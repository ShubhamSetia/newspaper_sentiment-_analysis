Chandigarh, August 10

Less than six months after the controversial mutation of 464 acres of Gwal Pahari land in Gurgaon came under the judicial scanner, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today largely referred the matter to the civil court. The copy of the orders was not yet available.

Disposing of a majority of the pleas before it, the Bench of Justice SS Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan kept a couple of petitions pending while directing the parties concerned not to carry out construction, alienate the land or create third-party rights.

Situated in the foothills of the Aravallis, Gwal Pahari in Gurgaon district is close to New Delhi and Faridabad. The development is significant as Haryana, on a previous date of hearing, had asserted that the shamlat land was with the Municipal Corporation-Gurgaon (MCG).

The Bench was told that 164 acres of the total 464 acres had been vacated and 300 notices issued. No less than 139 persons had filed civil suits and stay had been ordered in some cases.

A petition in public interest was filed in the matter by Gurgaon resident-cum-RTI activist Harinder Dhingra for a CBI probe to find the persons involved in prime land mutation.

Alleging the involvement of bureaucrats, politicians and local revenue officials, he had claimed that ownership of the disputed land was with the gram panchayat of Gwal Pahari since 1940 and transferred to the MCG in 2010.

The then Financial Commissioner (Revenue), not competent to pass an order on mutation in 2012, had favoured some builders, he alleged. The order was passed on the application of a private party challenging the 2010 transfer of land.

The order was challenged by the MCG before the Financial Commissioner, who stayed the order. But in October 2015, another IAS officer had restored the order. Thereafter, the matter had reached the state government and a decision was taken for mutation of land in favour of the MCG.

But, this order, too, was declared void in January by District Collector TL Satyaprakash. This order was stayed by Gurgaon Divisional Commissioner D Suresh in February, the court was told.

The Bench had already made it clear that encroachments from shamlat or village common land were required to be removed by taking legal recourse. The Bench had added that ordering an inquiry into the matter would not help and the solution lay in following the Haryana Municipal Act.

The Bench asserted that the accepted position was that the land was with the MCG since 2010. “If it is shamlat land, provisions under Section 408-A need to be initiated and we will monitor it,” the Bench asserted. Section 408-A of the Haryana Municipal Act deals with power to evict persons from corporation premises and land.

Beer may help overcome creative block,"London

Suffering a creative block? Drinking a pint of beer may trigger productivity and help you think out of the box for your artistic tasks, a study suggests.

Scientists from the University of Graz in Austria found that people performed better in a range of creative tasks after drinking moderate amount of alcohol.

In one word association test, a pint of beer for men, or around 350 mililitres (ml) for women, increased test scores by around 40 per cent.

In the test, participants were given three words and asked to think of a word that can be connected to each - for example, the word 'pit' can be attached to 'peach', 'arm' and 'tar'.

Alcohol helps remove parameters which surround a problem, allowing more creative thought, researchers said.

However, while alcohol boosted creativity it decreased 'executive function'. This may impede tasks that require motor skills, such as painting or dancing.

""Anecdotal reports link alcohol intoxication to creativity,"" Mathias Benedek, from the University of Gras, was quoted as saying by 'The Telegraph'.

""Alcohol impaired executive control, but improved performance in the Remote Associates Test,"" said Benedek, lead author of the research was published in the journal Consciousness and Cognition.

""Beneficial effects are likely restricted to very modest amounts of alcohol, whereas excessive alcohol consumption typically impairs creative productivity,"" he said. —PTI"
The Tribune,"NEW YORK: A 39-year old Indian-origin man has been indicted in the US on charges of soliciting and accepting bribes while performing his official duties as a state government employee.

New York, August 11

A 39-year old Indian-origin man has been indicted in the US on charges of soliciting and accepting bribes while performing his official duties as a state government employee.

Anuj Sud of Maryland was indicted on charges related to the bribery conspiracy, Acting US Attorney for the District of Maryland Stephen Schenning said.

Sud was a Liquor Board Commissioner and has been a licensed attorney in Maryland since 2005.

According to court documents, in September 2015, Sud solicited bribes from a lobbyist in exchange for his assistance with liquor board matters.

At a subsequent meeting, Sud and the lobbyist discussed Sud voting favourably in two upcoming hearings concerning the lobbyist’s clients, in exchange for money.

At each of the hearings, Sud took favourable action on behalf of the lobbyist’s client.

Following each hearing, the lobbyist met Sud and gave Sud USD 1,000 cash for his assistance. Similarly, Sud received another USD 1,000 bribe payment in exchange for taking favourable action on behalf of the lobbyist’s client.

Sud was charged with two counts of bribery, for each of which he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. PTI"

IN our correspondence columns will be founded a letter from Honorary Secretary, Indian Troops War Hospital Committee Lahore, of which Mr. H.P. Tollinton, Deputy Commissioner, Lahore, is President, in which he makes an appeal to the generous minded and philanthropic people to provide funds for supplying little luxuries such as fruits, utensils, etc., to the 320 wounded soldiers under treatment in the Lahore Cantonment War Hospital. The necessaries are, of course, provided by the Government and it is only small additional comforts which make such a great difference in making the soldiers feel that they are in their own land are being cared for by their own people. To the country-men of these brave warriors, who have fought the battles of their King-Emperor and the Empire and suffered for the righteous cause, this must be a duty and privilege, and not a call of charity or philanthropy."
Guard against water damage,"HOME TRUTHS

Saurabh Agarwal

The arrival of monsoon is a welcome respite from the summer heat. But on the flip side, the wet spell is also associated with leaking roofs, seepage, and in some cases, collapse of buildings due to structural failure. It is a false notion that little can be done to prevent water-related issues once a structure has been constructed. Now, a range of products are easily available in the market that can ensure maximum protection from water damage right in the beginning at the construction phase, and even as an after-construction solution to protect homes and buildings. Read on to get a better understanding of the underlying causes of the problem and the range of remedies and solutions available to effectively address the problem at hand:

What causes water damage

Shoddy construction and use of sub-standard materials can cause cracks and crevices in concrete structures that allow water to penetrate. These are not just an eye-sore aesthetically, but also pose a hazard to the structural strength of the building. Identifying the root cause and prompt corrective measures to deal with any seepage or leakage is important to prevent the problem from worsening.

Installing drainage system and maintaining it is the first logical step that must be undertaken from the construction phase itself. A proper drainage system must, therefore, be installed on priority basis if your home doesn’t have one.

Awareness is the key to prevention

As the saying goes — A stitch in time saves nine. Thus, following basic principles of water proofing at relevant stages of construction is a sure shot way of ensuring a water-proof structure that stands the test of time. Design and construction elements to mitigate the danger at the design stage, provision for effective drainage systems, use of suitable materials such as bitumen or silicone-based water proofing systems in terrace and walls along with water repellant paints and emulsions are also effective in the fight against seepage, leakage and dampness.

For new constructions, admixtures, plasticisers and integral water-proofing compounds are available to provide an effective barrier against water from cutting through concrete. These can be conveniently built-in when constructing structures like foundation and retaining walls in basement, wet areas (toilet, balcony and kitchen), terrace, overhead and underground tanks, swimming pools, podium slab etc.

For the water-proofing solutions to be effective, critical components of the structure such as block walls and underground foundation need to be in top shape.

Solutions to check out

There are several corrective measures that can be adopted as per the problem and structural composition of the building.

Liquid waterproofing is generally adopted for concrete and plasters. This innovative waterproofing solution acts as a tonic for cement and can be applied from the foundation to the roof of the building. This cement additive is specially formulated to increase the life span of buildings by preventing the development of cracks thereby preventing leakage and rusting.

Water proofing compounds are increasingly becoming popular not only as a deterrent to water ingress but also as an aid for healthy construction, emulsion and protective coatings to limit the effect of vagaries of weather on buildings.

Five water proofing solutions that are currently preferred are:

Conventional systems would include box-type water proofing with impervious stone slabs.

Crystalline waterproofing systems and flexible membrane water proofing systems involve application of chemicals on the surface of concrete.

Chemical coatings react with the soft by-products of the cement hydration process and form hard crystals. These crystals lodge themselves in the concrete pores, thereby making it impervious.

Water-repellant impregnates are silicones which due to their low-viscosity impart repellant property to the surface on application.

JAMMU: Blaming Article 370 of the Constitution for creation of a “separatist emotion”, the J&K unit of the BJP today said the time had come for the people of the state to say goodbye to it as well as Article 35A.

Tribune News Service/PTI

Jammu, August 10

Blaming Article 370 of the Constitution for creation of a “separatist emotion”, the J&K unit of the BJP today said the time had come for the people of the state to say goodbye to it as well as Article 35A.

Both these Articles, instead of being beneficial to the people of the state, have done a great damage and hamper the progress and development, claimed J&K BJP spokesperson Prof Virender Gupta.

“The time has come when the people of J&K should say goodbye to Article 370 and ask the Central government to revoke Article 35A,” he said. “The prevailing situation in the Valley shows that Article 370 has created a separatist psyche and acts as a breeding ground for separatist emotion,” Gupta said.

Article 370 grants special status to J&K while Article 35A, added to the Indian Constitution through a Presidential Order, empowers the J&K legislature to define the state’s “permanent residents” and their special rights and privileges.

Article 35A has come under focus after two Kashmiri women approached the Supreme Court challenging it. They contended that it had disenfranchised their children.

Moreover, the BJP is a part of the ruling alliance in J&K with the PDP. However the saffron party’s views on Article 370 and Article 35A appear at variance with its ally.

At a recent event in Delhi, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had said if Article 35A was tinkered with, there would be no one in Kashmir to uphold the national flag.

While Opposition National Conference (NC) has also spoken against any attempt to tamper with these provisions.

However, according to the BJP spokesperson, Article 370 is responsible for keeping the settled issue of J&K alive and encourages the separatists and external forces to interfere in the internal matters of the country.

He said Article 370 was increasing the alienation of the people of the Valley and in taking them away from the national mainstream.

“The Kashmiri leadership for its own vested political interests always indulged in a competitive game to exploit the people in the name of Article 370,” Gupta alleged.

The BJP spokesperson added that in spite of large-scale funding by the Centre, J&K had not been able to develop its own sustainable economy and remained underdeveloped and backward in many fields.

Industrialists and business houses from outside hesitate to open ventures in the state and as a result, it is facing the crisis of unemployment and migration of skilled and talented youth to the rest of the country, he added.

“Academicians and experts from the rest of the country are discouraged because of the Article to contribute in the educational growth of the state,” he claimed.

Gupta alleged that Article 370 was also responsible for widening the mistrust and alienation between the people of the Valley and those of Jammu and Ladakh regions.

He called upon the people of J&K to also look into the utility of Article 35A, claiming it was “most discriminatory” and differentiated between men and women with regard to their rights as citizen of the state.

Significantly, in a surprise development on Tuesday, Chief Minister Mufti had gone to meet NC president Farooq Abdullah. After the meeting, sources in the NC had said legal challenge mounted on the validity of Article 35A of the Constitution was the main subject of discussion between the two leaders."
The Tribune: Science,"SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook is rolling out a new video service offering professionally produced shows in a challenge to rivals such as YouTube, and potentially to streaming providers like Netflix.

San Francisco, August 10

Facebook is rolling out a new video service offering professionally produced shows in a challenge to rivals such as YouTube, and potentially to streaming providers like Netflix.

The Facebook service called Watch will include a range of shows, from reality to comedy to live sports, the social network said in its announcement late yesterday.

The new platform offers an opportunity for social interactions via the Facebook community of some two billion users.

It will be ""a place where you can discover shows your friends are watching and follow your favorite shows and creators so you don't miss any episodes,"" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said.

""You'll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.""

Facebook has funded some of the creators to get the service going.

The launch shows include blogger Nusseir Yassin's ""Nas Daily"", which includes videos together with his fans from around the world, and another hosted by author and motivational speaker Gabby Bernstein.

The service will also include a weekly Major League Baseball game.

""Watch is comprised of shows, a new type of video on Facebook,"" said Nick Grudin, Facebook's vice president of media partnerships, in a blog post.

""Shows are made up of episodes — live or recorded — that follow a consistent theme or storyline... Our goal is for Watch to be a platform for all creators and publishers to find an audience, build a community of passionate fans, and earn money for their work.""

Initially, Watch will be available to a limited group of Facebook users in the United States and more widely to US users in the coming weeks, Facebook, said.

Over time, creators will be able to monetize their shows through ""ad breaks,"" according to Facebook.

The launch is a limited move into scripted and professional video but puts Facebook on a course to challenge Google-owned YouTube, and possibly other streaming services if it gains a wider audience.

""In general, the model here feels very YouTube-like, with a subscription model, though Facebook's apps for TV platforms in recent months have signaled the broad structure and interface, with a combination of videos recommended or liked by friends, things you've saved, things that are popular on the platform, and so on,"" said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.

Banks go slow on giving agri loans,"Commercial banks short of target by 23%, co-op banks by 31%

Ruchika M Khanna

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

As commercial, regional rural and cooperative banks await the debt relief scheme of the Punjab Government, credit to farmers has fallen short of the target. This indicates the shift of source of agriculture credit to non-institutional sources of finance. In the first quarter of this fiscal, the target of commercial banks was short by 23 per cent and those of cooperative banks by 31 per cent. Commercial banks have lent Rs 3,639 crore less than their target, while cooperative banks have lent Rs 2,270 crore less. With the non-performing accounts (NPA) in the agriculture sector having increased to 7.06 per cent, it has raised the hackles of the government and bankers alike. Over the past few months, bankers have been resenting the drastic fall in loan recoveries. Thus, exercising caution, banks seem to have reduced lending to farmers. So, representatives of banks operating in the state today requested Principal Secretary (Finance) Anirudh Tewari to quickly implement the scheme so that they can recover the advances given to farmers. “Please decide on the debt relief scheme soon so as to save banks,” said PS Chauhan, convener of the Punjab State-level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), during a meeting here today. Data collected by the SLBC brought out that in terms of crop loan — loan given to farmers in each crop cycle — lending is short by Rs 6,536 crore against a target of Rs 26,700 crore. Commercial banks have lent Rs 4,387 crore less than the target; cooperative banks, Rs 2,585 crore; and Punjab Agriculture Development Bank, Rs 69 crore. Bankers hinted that they were well within their right to recover loans from defaulting farmers, but said they were going slow so that the government could roll out its scheme. Principal Secretary Tewari, who chaired the meeting, told The Tribune that the government was expecting to receive the report of the T Haque committee next week. “We are trying to raise money to repay farmer loans at the earliest. The debt relief scheme will be notified soon,” he added."

Sydney

Australian researchers have discovered a dietary supplement which can prevent miscarriages, and many different types of birth defects for pregnant women.

The discovery, announced on Thursday at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, said that the common supplement Niacin, known as Vitamin B3, can cure molecular deficiencies that cause birth defects and miscarriages in women, reports Xinhua news agency.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Until now, the cause of 80 per cent of birth defects had remained unknown to scientists, but with this discovery, pregnant women around the world will now be able to prevent many common abnormalities such as cleft palate, kidney, heart, and spinal issues.

The lead scientist who made this remarkable discovery, professor Sally Dunwoodie, told Xinhua that she never believed that she would be able to make such an important difference, and that this would now lead to new opportunities to improve the lives of women around the world.

The discovery showed that a major cause was a deficiency of a vital molecule known as NAD, which is important for normal development of organs.

To make NAD, vitamin B3 is necessary, and the vitamin is found in most meats and green vegetables, even in one of Australia's most famous exports, Vegemite.

Studies have shown however that by the third trimester of pregnancy, 60 per cent of women are deficient in their vitamin B3 levels, and as such need to complement their diet with additional supplements.

The Executive Director of the Victor Chang Institute Robert Graham said that women need to be taking vitamin B3 well before they decide to get pregnant.

""This will change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,"" Graham said.

""We believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country's greatest medical discoveries. It's extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventative solution at the same time,"" he added.

Politically incorrect,"MOVIE REVIEW - INDU SARKAR

Nonika Singh

Sorry to disappoint you readers, but Indu Sarkar isn’t about the enigmatic former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, who was loved and despised in equal measure. The title (Indu we all know was her nickname and Sarkar needs no qualifier) might have misled you in believing so.

But the film in the eye of controversy for some time, zeroes down on her most inglorious phase; the draconian and dreaded Emergency.

Expectedly, the narrative takes sides and does seem politically motivated as well. However, Indira’s presence is confined to the margins, just a scene or two - that too sans dialogues. Instead, it’s her son who gets ample footage. By the way, neither of them is referred to by actual names. However, the resemblance to real characters is telling and uncanny. And Bhandarkar has left no stones unturned to demonise Sanjay Gandhi - sorry, beg your pardon, chief as he is alluded to throughout the film.

His body language, dialogues or the mean act and references to his five-point programme including nasbandi … all are meant to paint him as the big bad boy of mommy dear, who, of course, is not Indu Sarkar.

So who is the titular character? Well, a fictitious woman coined by Bhandarkar who has gone on record to say the film is 70 per cent fiction and only 30 per cent fact. And it’s this marriage of reality with imagination that is rather problematic. Who can deny that a film on Emergency should be made?

Emergency is without a doubt a period that even Congress can’t be proud of. But by mixing facts with fiction, by trying to humanise the story of an orphan girl, Indu, caught in the vortex of political repression and then turning it into a thriller of sorts, the film neither remains truly political nor a riveting, heart-tugging, human drama.

Besides, to compare the fight against Emergency to the second freedom movement is stretching the yarn a bit too far. The use of National Song, Vande Mataram, as the anthem of the so-called peaceful revolutionaries too is rather distressing, if not in bad taste. All through the film you can’t shirk off the nagging doubt and realisation that Bhandarkar would gave gained in stature had he made the film during the Congress regime.

Today, his attempt seems like a government-pleaser stunt. In the film there is one key dialogue; Emergency main ya police ki chalti hai ya yes man ki. The same dialogue can be turned against the director.

Indeed, it’s tragic that 70 years after Independence, films on political subjects, that too not biting enough, are made in accordance with who is ruling at that point. And that is a bigger tragedy than the film itself, which despite sepia tones and occasional period touches (Bobby is running in theatres), also succumbs to the typical Bollywood plot.

However, one person that emerges tall is Kirti Kulhari. As the stammering poet-turned-rebel, she engages you with her dilemmas, more so in the first part. To a large extent her screen spouse, Actor Tota Roy Chowdhury, playing her ambitious husband, a government servant willing to play along with the powers that be, gets the nuances of his character right. Neil Nitin Mukesh as the near despicable chief spurning and mocking his loyalists too adds menace to his part. Only if Bhandarkar, who has been losing his touch lately, found his métier. From the man who gave us incisive Page 3 and fairly credible Fashion, we expected and deserved better."

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"
"At 20, I didn’t know what do with the leather ball: Umesh","Kandy, August 10

Umesh Yadav had no clue what to do with a red SG Test ball when he made his first-class debut at 20 but India’s premier fast bowler on Thursday said he always knew that his ability to generate pace would help him measure up at the highest level.

Seven years since his international debut, India’s premier fast bowler, who has played 33 Tests and 70 ODIs, feels he is finally bowling to his potential.

“You tend to know a lot about the game you have playing since childhood. But you can be at sea if you are suddenly told do something different,” Yadav told ‘bcci.tv’ ahead of the third Test against Sri Lanka beginning here on Saturday.

“I started playing with tennis and rubber ball and didn’t hold the seasoned ball until I was 20. It was pretty late for a fast bowler. So when that happened, I did not know what to do with the ball,” said the bowler with 92 Test and 98 ODI wickets to his credit.

And it took nearly two years for him to work it out.

“I did not know where to pitch the ball, the first two years I could not understand when the ball would go out and when it would come in or go straight.

“Then my coaches stepped in to help me. They told me it was normal that I was finding it tough to control the ball. Thereafter, I started working on my action especially the position of the left hand, and from there on Umesh Yadav changed forever.

“And all along I knew my pace would take me somewhere,” the Nagpur-born player said, recalling his early days.

With his performance in the past 12 months, Yadav has silenced experts, who often criticised him for being wayward in his line and length.

Despite the brickbats, the 29-year-old remains determined to give his best without compromising on pace.

“I always wanted to bowl fast. As I grew up, I learnt a lot about fast bowling. The place where I come from is not known for producing fast bowlers.

“I knew there were a lot of bowlers who could bowl in the 130-135kmph bracket. I knew you would be called different if you could bowl every ball at 140kmph and you would eventually get a chance,” he said.

Yadav then reflected on his India career which started in May 2010 when he played an ODI against Zimbabwe.

“It was easy to maintain pace when I came first on the international scene but as I kept playing, I learnt a lot about maintaining fitness and how to recover after the game. If you don’t do that, you cannot survive.

“The body is strong initially to a point but if you don’t strengthen it, it would collapse. So now whenever I get the time, I work on my recovery. The way oil is important for the engine, fitness and recovery is important for me.”

India currently possess a potent fast bowling unit including Yadav, Mohammad Shami, Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. —PTI"
Filing for motor insurance claim? Think twice,"Neeraj Gupta

People buy motor insurance mainly for two reasons — first and foremost, to protect their vehicle against any damage caused by an accident and secondly, because it is mandatory by law. Out of millions of accidents which happen on Indian roads annually, the vast majority of them are not fatal and claims for such accidents are called petty claims, where claim amount is less than the premium. While most of us prefer filing a claim immediately after an accident, we often face a dilemma on whether or not we should be filing a claim for smaller damages such as scratch or dent. So, should you file a claim every time? Here are a few pointers to consider before filing a claim from your insurer:

Do calculation

It is crucial for you to measure your claim amount against deductibles, depreciation and NCB benefits, and decide which one will be beneficial in the long run. Your motor insurance plan comes with a deductible clause that makes you equally responsible for paying some percentage of the total claim amount from your own pocket. This could be anywhere between 10%-20% of total repair cost, depending upon the size of the engine of your car. An inbuilt deductible is called as compulsory deductible and the amount is fixed Rs 1,000 up to 1500cc and Rs 2,000 above 1500cc. For instance, you have a comprehensive insurance plan without add-ons for a three-year-old car and you apply for a claim of Rs 10,000 to get the repairs done. In this case, you may have to pay somewhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 as deductibles and depreciation cost. Your insurer, on the other hand, would pay the rest of money that is Rs 4,000-5,000. So, if you were to make a claim here, you would undergo loss; knowing that you will have to let go 25% NCB and also pay for repairing from your own pocket.

No claim bonus

Apart from this, filing a claim impacts your claim history and creates a perception about your profile in the mind of insurance companies. In simple words, no claim bonus is a report card of your driving abilities. In India, there is no mechanism to calculate your driving skills; therefore, insurance companies rely on NCB. Maintained NCB simply means you have not made any claim in past years and hence you are a safe driver.

Dilemma

Scenario 1: Hitting someone else’s car or property. You should claim insurance if the damage is considerable. However, if the damage to the third-person’s property is minor and no one got hurt, then the best thing to do is to get the repairs done on your own. That way, you will escape from the hassle of long, time-consuming paperwork for a small amount. Scenario 2: Damage is going to cost Rs 15,000 or less. A big NO. Do not claim insurance for such a small amount. Settle it from your own pocket and save the insurance for worse days. However, you can claim benefits, if you own a new car with 0% NCB and zero depreciation add-on. Scenario 3: If the car is too old and you’re planning to purchase a new one anytime soon. Ever heard that you can transfer no claim bonus points to your new car and new insurance? It will be helpful not to dump the NCB benefits over a minor claim and, instead, use them to effectively lower your new insurance premium amount. In any case, you have to sell off the old car. Scenario 4: You have already made a claim this year. The number of claims you can make in a year are limited. As far as zero depreciation is concerned, it is limited to two claims per year, after two claims your plan will be handled as vanilla comprehensive policy, so must save it for an even worse scenario. Making a claim every time may look like a good thing to do for a short-term profit, but in the long term, you will face a bigger loss in terms of no NCB. Moreover, a lot of claims will make your driving history look too dangerous and you may have to pay a higher premium next time you buy an insurance policy. Hence, paying for small repairs from your own pocket will keep you in a win-win situation. The writer is Head of Motor Insurance, Policybazaar.com. The views expressed in this article are his own"
Advisory forum mooted for Shimla Smart City project,"Tribune News Service

Shimla, August 10

After well over a month the Centre included Shimla under National Smart City Mission, Chief Secretary VC Parka today gave the mission a first push, saying that the state urban development department would soon constitute a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and city advisory forum to execute the Rs 2905.79-crore plan.

Placement blues,"CAREER HOTLINE

Pervin Malhotra

Q.I went to Delhi from Mohali to do a course in jewellery design. Although I topped in my class, I have not got any placement from the institute. One of the companies that visited our campus liked my work and made me an initial offer. But they’ve now informed me that they’re freezing recruitment till end of the year due to some internal restructuring. I have no contacts in Delhi and ‘am staying with my relatives. I know I’m very creative and have worked very hard to complete the course. Also, I don’t have too much money to invest in buying gold etc. But if I don’t get a break, my parents will ask me to return home. Please suggest what I should do.

— lavanya

A.First of all, don’t panic. Also, don’t overly rely on campus placements. If they happen, well and good; else, start taking your own initiative. Fortunately, Delhi NCR as well as Chandigarh and Mohali are packed with jewellery shops and manufacturing firms. You can get a list from browsing the Net as well as from your institute. Call them and visit them armed with your portfolio. Keep making designs whenever you have the time. You may be able to sell these outright. Regardless of whether or not you land a job, you’ll get some valuable feedback besides an opportunity to see the latest trends and get an idea of what sells in the market. Another great idea would be to create a Facebook page showcasing some of the pieces you might have made while pursuing the course and a few others and offering to style and design unique custom-made jewellery by recycling discarded trinkets, broken or single odds ‘n ends from old jewellery into contemporary and wearable stuff. I’m sure, you’ll find many takers because this doesn’t involve risking huge sums of money on someone who is relatively new and unknown. If you do a good job, you will, in time, be able to convert them into loyal customers. And acquire a larger clientele by word-of-mouth. This calls for no investment, so it’s easily doable. The Rs 15,000-crore jewellery market, including the costume jewellery segment, is growing smartly YoY. With some patience, networking and smart positioning, I don’t see why you can’t be a part of this booming market – particularly since you’re talented and determined. Do give it a shot and let me know how it works. Best of luck!Q.I have a 7-year-old daughter and a 1½ -year old baby. I am overwhelmed by the volume of work I have in my full time position in a recruitment firm. I barely get to spend 1-2 hours with my baby as he goes to bed at 8 pm. I leave home at 7.30 am and am home by 7 pm and have work to do each night and weekend. I really resent having work to do at home. My husband is travelling most of the time, so I have to help the older kid with her homework as well. I’m constantly tired and sleep deprived. I’m not sure if working part time is an option or whether I should try and find an alternative career. Any advice would be welcome. I had done a BEd after doing my MA in mathematics.— namita j A.Juggling so many balls… no wonder you feel overwhelmed! While I’m possibly not the right person to advise you on this, one thing I can tell you is that life’s too short. Your child(ren) are everything and this job won’t ever love you like they do. Always put your kids, your family and your health before any job. But you and only you can decide what you want to do. Going part time would give you time to explore alternative careers and see if there’s some additional training you need to pursue something different. Ask your office, if they can let you work part-time or partly from home. A lot of offices are okay with it. And by the way, today teaching is not badly paid as compared to some other careers. There are many coaching centres who would value your skills. Private tuition and e-tutoring pay very well too. Good Math teachers are always at a premium. You could also consider network marketing (Amway, Avon, Tupperware etc) which you could do part-time while teaching/tutoring part-time. Do you have any skills like baking, craft, photography, content writing or anything else you could turn into a part time business to supplement your part time teaching? What you need is flexibility -- try thinking of new and different things as well as the traditional avenues. This will also get your finances on a stable footing (or as far as it’s possible). Also remember, your children won’t be babies forever; they’ll get bigger and be more independent which will ease your working life. When they’re out of secondary school you’ll have more time to work full time if that’s what you desire."

Sharif slams judiciary for his ouster,"Islamabad, August 10

It’s ‘Corruption Bachao’ rally: Imran

A defiant Nawaz Sharif today criticised the judiciary for forcing him to quit as Prime Minister, saying it was an “insult” to 200 million people of Pakistan that their elected leader was unceremoniously ousted with a single stroke of pen. A five-member Supreme Court Bench last month disqualified Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the PM to quit for the record third time. “It is an insult to 20 crore people of Pakistan. You voted for me and ‘five honourable’ (judges) with a single stroke of pen sent me home,” 67-year-old Sharif told his supporters in Jhelum on the second day of his journey from Islamabad to Lahore via the Grand Trunk Road. “There is no charge of corruption or embezzlement. May I ask why I have been ousted?” he said. Sharif said it was pity that none of the PMs in the 70-year history of the country have been allowed to complete their tenure. “Every PM in this country was given one-and-a-half-year tenure, on average, to govern. Some were executed, some jailed, some handcuffed, and some exiled,” he said. On the other hand, dictators were allowed to rule for decades and the judges even allowed them to rule, he said. “Is there any court in the country to hold a dictator accountable? One of them (Gen Pervez Musharraf) went out for medical treatment of his backache but never came back to face cases.” Sharif said every time the country is pulled back when it reaches at a takeoff stage. “This country cannot go like this. We were making progress and once again it has strangled,” he told his supporters amid slogans of 'wazir-i-azam Nawaz Sharif' (PM Nawaz Sharif). He said he was not seeking restoration but his struggle was to institute “respect for the mandate of the people”. “You sent me to Islamabad but they (judges) have sent me back to home.” — PTIPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan on Thursday hit out at ex-PM Nawaz Sharif and termed his “homecoming” rally to Lahore as “Corruption Bachao” rally. “My advice to NS (Nawaz Sharif) on his Corruption Bachao rally: You can blame the umpires, the pitch, the weather, some of your players.. but in the end you can’t avoid the sinking feeling that the game is over and you have lost,” Imran tweeted"
"Lawyer for CBI probe, moves High Court","Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

The stalking case has reached the Punjab and Haryana High Court with an advocate filing a petition in public interest for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the controversy. In his petition, human rights activist and lawyer Ranjan Lakhanpal has asserted that political interference in the matter was writ large. In the given circumstances, justice could not be done. “There is a crisis of faith in the system,” Lakhanpal said. He said the investigation into the case was improper, evident from the manner in which the whole probe was carried out, the way the accused were treated and the manner in which the offences were diluted and added later on. Lakhanpal claimed that there were 25 CCTV cameras on the route where the victim was stopped. “Strangely, all CCTV cameras installed by the police were not in a working condition. This speaks volume of the inefficiency of the police,” the human rights activist said. The public interest litigation (PIL) is expected to come up for hearing on August 16."

Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh this evening at his official residence here. The two are believed to have discussed issues regarding abrogation of Article 35A of the Constitution that grants special status to the state. This has raised many eyebrows in the Valley. Even as both sides remained tight-lipped about the agenda of discussion, sources suggested that given the timing of the meeting, Article 35A might have come up for deliberations.Mehbooba, who arrived in the national Capital late afternoon, met the Home Minister for 45 minutes and left without interacting with mediapersons. She is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of other political parties tomorrow, before calling on newly appointed President Ram Nath Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Mehbooba is keen to build a consensus against abrogation of the constitutional provision which empowers the Jammu and Kashmir legislature to define the state’s “permanent residents” and their special rights and privileges, said sources. Earlier this week, the Chief Minister had met Opposition National Conference president Farooq Abdullah to seek his party’s support on the issue. Abdullah is reported to have told her that she should meet the Prime Minister, key Union Ministers and the BJP leadership to convince the Sangh Parivar against striking down the constitutional provision. The controversy erupted in 2014 after an NGO, “We the Citizens”, filed a PIL in the Supreme Court, seeking Article 35A to be struck down. The state government, under the guise of Articles 35A and 370, which grant special autonomous status to the state, has been discriminating against non-residents, who are debarred from buying property, getting government jobs or voting in local elections, the PIL alleged. Article 35A was added to the Constitution by a presidential order in 1954, it said."
"Humans arrived in Southeast Asia 20,000 years earlier","Melbourne

Modern humans may have exited Africa and arrived in Southeast Asia over 70,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought, said scientists. The study led by researchers at Macquarie University in Australia also suggests that humans could have potentially made the crossing to Australia even earlier than the accepted 60,000 to 65,000 years ago. The dating of a cave site in West Sumatra in Indonesia, called Lida Ajer, provided researchers the first evidence for rainforest use of modern humans. ""Rainforests are not the easiest place to make a living, especially for a savannah-adapted primate, so it suggests that these people were ahead of the curve in terms of intelligence, planning and technological adaptation,"" said Gilbert Price from University of Queensland in Australia. As a result of thorough documentation of the cave, reanalysis of the specimens, and a new dating programme, it was confirmed that the teeth found there were of modern humans, Homo sapiens, and dated back 73,000 years. A barrage of dating techniques were applied to the sediment around the fossils, to overlying and underlying rock deposits in the cave and to associated mammal teeth, indicating that the deposit and fossils were laid down between 63,000 to 73,000 years ago, researchers said. The study was published in the journal Nature. —PTI"

Chandigarh, August 10

A local court today remanded Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala and the latter’s friend Ashish Kumar in two-day police custody in the stalking and attempt-to-abduction case. The victim, Varnika Kundu, is the daughter of an IAS officer.

Pleading for two-day remand, the public prosecutor told the court that the police needed to reconstruct the crime scene and find the motive behind stalking and attempt to abduct the 29-year-old disc jockey. The police also wanted to unearth “how the accused came to know the victim”, what was their intention behind committing the crime and whether they had any criminal background.

Opposing the remand, defence counsel Surya Prakash contended that the accused were not following the girl. “No more interrogation is required as the accused were there with the police for the past four days whenever they asked them to join investigation. It is a media trial and the case has been hyped. The police are acting under pressure. No weapon has to be recovered from them.”

Civil Judge Barjinder Pal Singh, meanwhile, asked them to wait. He went inside his room twice. Thereafter, after studying the case reports, he granted two-day remand to the police.

The accused were re-arrested and charged with attempt to abduction on Wednesday after the local police were criticised for applying only bailable Sections in the FIR. The duo was booked under Sections 354-D (stalking) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC and 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles Act on August 5 and was granted bail. After much hue and dry, the police yesterday re-arrested and added Sections 365 (kidnapping or abduction with intent to confine a person) and Section 511 (attempt to commit an offence punishable with life imprisonment) of the IPC.

Meanwhile, reacting to the development, victim’s father Virender Kundu said, “The law is taking its course. the matter is sub judice.”"

A large number of Gaddi people gathered at Sangam Park near Kotwali Bazar and were joined by other BJP leaders who came out to support them. The protesters raised slogans against the state government, Chief Minister Virbhdra Singh, local MLA Sudhir Sharma and the Himachal Police. They moved through the main market and gheraoed the district police headquarters. They held a demonstration outside the SP office. Former Transport Minister Kishen Kapoor, a prominent Gaddi leader, along with other members, met SSP, Kangra, Ramesh Chajta. Kapoor told The Tribune that the SSP denied that the police had ever indulged in using force but later on told the Gaddi leaders that an ASP would inquire the matter. They submitted a memorandum to the Governor through Deputy Commissioner CP Verma. They demanded the state government should be sacked and President’s rule be imposed on the state. Kapoor said the Gaddi community had decided to meet the Chief Minister at 7 am this morning to ask him the reason why the police resorted to lathicharge when his motorcade had crossed the demonstration site but, surprisingly, the Chief Minister left at 6 am for Bilaspur. He alleged that when the Chief Minister could not face people, he had no right to be in power and should be sacked. Meanwhile, former minister Major Vijai Singh Mankotia, the Khaniara Sangarsh Samiti, the Indunag Sewa Dal and other Gaddi outfits extended their support to the community in their struggle against the Chief Minister.KANGRA: BJP MP Anurag Thakur ton Thursday lambasted at Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh for his comments on the Gaddi community and condemned the lathicharge by the police on innocent members of the community, who were yesterday protesting against the Chief Minister’s remarks at Dal Lake in Dharamsala. Commenting on the series of events, Anurag said, “Brutality on innocents, crime against women and mafia raj are at its peak. The brutality shown by the police by resorting to lathicharge is unacceptable.” He said instead of tendering an unconditional apology, the Chief Minister had chosen the path of terrorising common people. — OC"

Kicking off his three-day campaign today, senior JD-U leader and Rajya Sabha member Sharad Yadav said he was with the grand alliance (RJD and Congress), even if his party had snapped ties with it. Claiming that the original party was with him, he termed Nitish Kumar’s joining hands with the BJP as “betrayal” of the people’s mandate. “ The disintegration of the grand alliance has broken the trust of over 11 crore people. The mandate was clearly against the BJP-led NDA during the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections,” a belligerent Yadav said.At a function in Sonepur, he claimed, “Sarkari JD-U is with Nitish Kumar while the original party is with me. The original JD-U, in association with secular forces, will form government after the next General Election.” Asked whether his tour amounted to “anti-party activity”, Yadav, who is the leader of the party in the Upper House, said he did not want to make any comment. Most JD-U legislators and party workers maintained a distance from him. None was there to receive him at the airport, but he was greeted by a large group of ‘supporters’, said to be RJD workers. At least two former JD-U legislators were seen in the crowd greeting Yadav. “It is Yadav’s personal visit and the JD-U has nothing to do with it,” maintained Neeraj Kumar, JD-U spokesperson, denying a split in the party. During his campaign, Yadav is likely to visit eight districts — Sonepur, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura. He will interact with the masses to ascertain their opinion on the breakup of the alliance. “Nitish Kumar has insulted people’s mandate. I am here for a direct feedback,” said Yadav.

Gitanjali Sharma

The Tricolour. That’s the first sight that awaits a visitor stepping out of the Srinagar airport. Riding high on a tall mast on the airport lawns, it somewhat dwarfs the images of the green and black flags raised at pro-freedom protests. It’s a rather comforting thought, despite the promise to keep behind all preconceptions on this four-day journey to experience the Valley in its various shades.

Day 1 (Friday), Dateline: Srinagar

Minutes later, moving towards the city, the taxi driver, a local, expectedly veered the conversation around violence, the innumerable restrictions and outsiders’ apprehensions — real and imaginary. The traffic was bare minimum, courtesy the Friday factor. Zipping along the Jhelum, the driver finally applied brakes to his chatter at the hotel resting near the river, with the trailing thought: peace through dialogue remains the destination of most Kashmiris. The wait is on.

The shades of this wait were only too visible at the Dal Lake, its placidness donning a sombre shroud with few appreciators in sight. Asif Khan, one of the many shikarawallahs wistfully awaiting customers, blamed the blankness around to the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims. When probed a little further, he vent out his anger on the government that was “doing nothing to resolve the Kashmir issue”. The wait for tourists, aman and azadi continues, he said, creating ripples in the still waters.

Postscript: Just five occupants at the hotel. A tip brought in three lovely roses from its lush garden to the room.

Day 2, Dateline: Central Kashmir

The ubiquitous wait wears a uniformed look for the soldiers tackling militants, both local and Pakistan nationals.

The run from Srinagar to Zojila passes through the heavily fortified central Kashmir towns of Ganderbal and Sonmarg. As the Amarnath yatris take this route to the Baltal camp, armed soldiers, alert to untowardness of any kind, can be seen stationed a few metres apart. Keeping endless vigil, they too appear to be players, howsoever different, in the waiting game.

“The security forces can keep the situation under control up to a certain level but beyond that the political set-up has to take over,” a top Army officer in the region summed up the lingering Kashmir crisis.

Despite the threat to even the seasonal multicultural plurality, the yatris’ enthusiasm has shown no dip. The fervour was evident too at the Pahalgam base camp in south Kashmir, which was toured the next day. The separatists may keep making loud proclamations about “Kashmiri hospitality” for “our yatri guests” but equally loud remain their frequent calls for shutdowns and “freedom”.

Postscript: Got little time to sit and stare on the Sonmarg meadows that are being overwhelmed by the surrounding construction activity.

Day 3, Dateline: South Kashmir

“I am confused. I want peace but I don’t know how it will come about. I have no faith in any of the mainstream parties. Yes, I am drawn towards the new militants surfacing on the social media. At least, they promise freedom…I live on that hope.” This outburst of a dryfruit-seller in Pampore reflects the angst of many Kashmiris and their disillusionment with political leaders. The outrage against the PDP, particularly for aligning with the rightist BJP, in its south Kashmir bastion is all too palpable.

PDP vice-president and Chief Minister’s Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni, who is one of the prime movers in the government, admitted some people were upset with their party but expressed confidence that they would come around. Hopeful of a dialogue, he placed implicit faith in the Central Government for resolving the Kashmir issue. The wait for the Modi government to take the initiative to understand and settle the Kashmir crisis hasn’t died, though some of the optimism has surely waned in the last three years.

In contrast, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has ruled out the possibility of a dialogue during the present situation. “The time is not conducive for talks,” he put it categorically, alluding to the unending violence.

This stance, however, doesn’t go down well with the majority in Kashmir who have been long waiting for a discourse. Prof Noor Ahmad Baba, a political expert, is of the view that Kashmir has gone restive waiting for the Central Government to at least acknowledge the problem as it exists. The signs of violence and terror in south Kashmir, the hub of militancy, are starkly visible along the Pampore-Pahalgam stretch. Just metres away from the highway at Pampore in Pulwama district stand the burnt and damaged Entrepreneurship Development Institute buildings that came under fidayeen attack twice over. A little ahead in Anantnag, comes the point where the pilgrim bus came under militant fire.

Crossing the vulnerable highway in south Kashmir, a thought creeps along: will the wait for peace remain just that. A wait. The disheartening thought, however, evaporates the minute you meet Amarnath yatra pilgrims at Pahalgam, the longer but less excruciating route to the shrine. Their enthusiasm and that of the hospitable locals around, allows faith to make way for hope again… hope for some resolution to this conflict.

The SSP at Anantnag, Altaf Khan, a counter-insurgency specialist, appeared confident about the militant count dipping significantly over the next six months. However, gullible youth turning to flashy new-age militants occupying the social media still remained a concern, he admitted while regretting the disappearance of the multi-cultural society from Kashmir. “I had 85 per cent Pandits in my class in Srinagar. The new generation hasn’t seen this plurality. Having grown up seeing only violence and mistrust, they know little of Kashmiriyat,” he asserts.

The Centre’s indecisiveness to boldly tackle the crisis, too, draws flak from some quarters. Another top cop from the region declared that the Modi government must take a decision, even if it is to bring the state fully under its control.

Postscript: The nun chai (salty tea) and flattened buns at a roadside bakery both freshened the mind and spirit.

Day 4, Dateline: North Kashmir

It was an exhilarating four-hour stretch from Srinagar to Aman Setu, the peace bridge connecting Uri with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Passing through Baramulla, the Jhelum snaked along one side and apple orchards dotted the green cover on the other.

At Aman Setu, the peace bus arrived with passengers, some returning to this side and others visiting from across the LoC. One thing they all had in common: a satiated look that comes with fulfilment of some kind. Grateful for this exchange, they gushed over the need for peace.

This wait continues, more so for the real stakeholders on the sidelines — the student who wants to attend school without fear, the soldier who hasn’t got leave to be home with his family, and the shikarawallah who wants to wind up the day with at least Rs 500 in his pocket.

Minutes after the arrival of the peace bus came the flash about shelling near Aman Setu. News from the Rajouri area had already come earlier in the day of a soldier and a six-year-old girl succumbing to heavy Pakistan shelling.

Heading back through a vulnerable area, the mind was blank, there was no room for fear or anxiety. All that it carried with it was the burden of the lives gone and the lives still struggling as the conflict and the wait lives on.

Postscript: On the return flight, a Kashmiri Pandit was sceptical about resolving the Kashmir crisis through dialogue. Minutes later, however, she said resignedly: “Probably, that’s the only way out.”"
86 pc food items along Char Dham routes adulterated,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 9

Despite best efforts to check it, food adulteration continues to a big challenge along the Char Dham Yatra routes in Uttarakhand with the latest report revealing an overall 86 per cent adulteration along the routes in the state. A Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS) report revealed that out of the 1,143 samples collected along the Char Dham Yatra routes, 983 samples were found to be adulterated. It was astonishing that the salt being sold here had no Iodine in it. Even the mustard oil being sold was 100 per cent adulterated and tea was 92 per cent adulterated. The illachi dana had chemicals in it. The cocunut sold was of poor quality and so were the cashew and other dry fruits offered at the char dhams. Sindoor or roli was found to be100 per cent toxic. Expressing concern over the findings, Brijmohan Sharma, founder, SPECS, asserted that while the tourism was the economic backbone of the fledgling state, the results of the testing were disappointing. “In the state’s the tourism policy and practice, one of its more important pillars - food or boarding - stands ignored. What we are offering to the pilgrims and tourists is sheer third-class food and boarding with a big question mark on its quality”, Sharma observed."
"Panama probe won’t go Pak way, expect fair trial: Jaitley","Panama probe won’t go Pak way, expect fair trial: Jaitley





New Delhi, August 10 Answering questions over the fate of Panama papers, the government today said every account named in the leak is being probed but made it clear that nobody would be punished here without a proper process, unlike Pakistan where Nawaz Sharif was removed as Prime Minister. “Nobody has ever taken more action than this government on foreign account details which have come,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in the Rajya Sabha while replying to a debate on Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill which was passed by the House later. Referring to the Panama papers leak, he said “every account” in it is being investigated. “We have a rule of law. We do not have system like the neighbouring country where you remove first and then have a trial,” Jaitley said, referring to Sharif who was ousted last month over the Panama papers leak issue. Sharif had to resign after the Pakistan Supreme Court disqualified him from holding public office and ruled that graft cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama papers scandal. In the wake of that development, questions were raised here regarding the status of probe in the same issue. During the reply, Jaitley said tax authorities were conducting investigations and prosecutions are being launched in cases where documents have been received. “We first make our own investigations and on each one of those cases, whether it is Liechtenstein cases or HSBC cases or other cases which have come to the notice or the Panama, in each case, we have been in touch with the regular authorities of the country where these accounts are,” he said. “Prosecutions are being filed wherever documents are coming. Assessment proceedings are being cleared and there is no prohibition on publishing their names once the prosecutions are filed because they are filed in India in open court,” the Finance Minister said. Jaitley said names are confidential as long as the matter is under investigation but the confidentiality clause ceases to exist once it reaches court. Dubbed as “Panama Papers”, investigations into vast stash of records from Panamanian legal firm Mossack Fonseca by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalist had named several world leaders and celebrities as having money stashed abroad in offshore companies.

Rise to the challenge,"Building parameters catering to the needs of physically challenged and the elderly are key to inclusive habitations in the urban space

Aniel Kuumar Saha

A number of city development authorities in India launch group housing residential schemes for citizens from time to time. But it is ironical that the configuration and design of apartments on offer under these schemes are not sensitive to the needs of the physically challenged and the elderly. Even privately built residences have this lacuna. As per the census of 2011, India’s total disabled population is around 2.2 per cent (more than 2.5 crore persons). Considering the 1.25 billion population in the country, the number of disabled is significantly higher. There are also more elderly in our society. But as a result of the complete disregard for their specific needs, a large number of these people live in dwelling spaces which are not equipped enough for them. And disability being of different kinds and categories, the amount of problems for the physically challenged is very different. Actually, in most of our cities the very basic need — housing and mobility - remains a challenge for them.

While India has already passed the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill- 2016, the condition of living and standards followed for the disabled and the elderly remains abysmal in the country.

So what is the solution? The solution lies in promoting the development and construction of disabled-friendly apartments and transportation corridors and mobility across our cities. Keeping these things in mind, architects and designers have to become an important part of the design as well as the construction process. A number of design elements that can make life easy for the physically challenged and the elderly can be incorporated in the apartments.

Some such elements can be:

The common passage should have side bars on the walls to hold and walk; all staircases on the premises should be low rise and not very steep.

Easy signage and Braille signage should be a must for the benefit of the hearing and visually impaired, respectively

The steps on the staircases should be wide enough for someone who has problem in walking. For completely disabled, there should be provision of a separate lift or a separate ramp should be there.

Within apartments, too, there are certain modifications required. These can be:

Every apartment entrance and exit door has to be wide enough to make the entry of a wheel chair easy.

Rooms should have wide doors and at least one washroom/toilet has to be spacious enough to accomodate a wheel chair.

Water fittings should be installed at a lower level. The bathroom should also be accessible with grab bars around the toilet, tub and shower.

Light switches and thermostats have to be easy to reach. Kitchen counters should also be low enough to use effectively.

Within mass housing developments, particular units can be customised for the buyer with a disability or for families having a member suffering from a physical handicap.

The Model Building Bylaws 2016 (Chapter 8), IS Code 4963, CPWD guidelines for Barrier-Free environment give a very detailed design and planning guidelines to provide a barrier-free environment for disabled and elderly people. Thus for actual implementation and enforcement, there is a need for a strong business and political will. And the intent should be greater than mere profiteering.

— The writer is CMD, SAHA Groupe

What does the law say?

Section 45 of the notified Act requires all public buildings to be made accessible within five years of the notification of rules. However, the revised National Building Code of India should incorporate elements of a universal design to bring down barriers for the disabled.

The Act is a revised and modified version of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1996. Both aimed at creating a barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities and the elderly. Both the Acts have also mentioned about features for residential premise."

Indian-origin anti-Brexit campaigner fears acid attack in UK,"London, August 10

An Indian-origin campaigner, who had mounted a successful legal challenge to prevent British Prime Minister Theresa May from triggering Brexit without Parliament’s approval, has spoken out of fears that she may be the target of an acid attack on the streets of London.

Gina Miller, who has been targeted by Brexiters on social media for her stance against Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU), said she could be forced to leave Britain as a result of death threats and abuse against her.

“I have been getting threats of having acid thrown in my face for months and months now. When I see someone walk towards me on the street with a bottle of water or something, I just freak out,” said the 52-year-old businesswoman.

Miller, born Gina Nadira Singh in British Guiana (now Guyana) to Guyana’s former Attorney General Doodnauth Singh, has been a vocal campaigner as part of a “Best for Britain” drive.

She lives under 24-hour security with her husband and three children, who she claims spend their weekends indoors due to fear.

“If it came to the point that it was just too much to bear from a security point of view, if I sat down with my police teams and we felt that it was a really serious threat, I would have to seriously consider leaving the UK,” she told ‘Verdict’ magazine.

“This would break my heart because I love this country and I am fighting for it. But we might have to,” she added.

Scotland Yard has served eight cease and desist notices to people who had sent Miller threatening messages.

Recently, a British aristocrat was jailed for 12 weeks for offering “5,000 pounds for the first person to ‘accidentally’ run over this bloody troublesome first- generation immigrant” in reference to Miller on social media.

Rhodri Phillips had made a series of threatening Facebook posts against Miller before she took him to court over the attacks.

Miller’s concerns of an acid attack come against the backdrop of a growing number of such crimes on the streets of London. — PTI"

Amritsar, August 10

They were classmates in 1930s. Hailing from well-off families, they studied, played and enjoyed together in Zafarwal tehsil of Narowal district, now in Pakistan, but the Partition in 1947 left them tormented as the families of both had to flee the then newly-formed State — Pakistan, leaving behind their properties and business. Now, well settled in Amritsar, Krishan Lal Mahajan and Ishar Das sit together and discuss their childhood days.

Krishan Lal Mahajan is now 87. He says he visits in his dreams his native village — Bara Pind Jagpal — in Pakistan. “Those memories are still vivid. I remember all streets, fields and shops of Bara Pind Jagpal a village in Zafarwal tehsil of Narowal district (then in Gurdasur) even after 70 years,” he says. But, he has never made any effort to visit his native place.

His friend Ishar Das (85) of Gandot village of the same tehsil has visited his village twice after the Partition, in 1965 and 1971 after wars between India and Pakistan as the area the Indian Army had occupied included his village as well. Ishar Das says he has made several attempts to visit Lahore but succeeded once.

Mahajan and Das, who were class-fellows in their childhood, had left their school when they were in sixth standard. After 70 years of Partition, they often sit on a bench outside a barber shop at Katra Bagian and talk for hours about their childhood, the Partition, politics and the struggles they have faced.

They hold a grudge against politicians who were responsible for the Partition of India as that dreadful event in 1947 left their families moneyless, who were moneylenders. For survival, they had to do petty jobs and low profile trades.

“In 1946, I had shifted to Lahore and got recruited in the Indian Railways as an operator. My father was a diesel pump operator. We had a good life and our future was bright but the Partition took away everything. I sold watermelons on roadsides for survival,” says Krishan Lal Mahajan.

Mahajan says he doesn’t have a sound knowledge about the politics and freedom struggle. “I used to listen a slogans in my village and nearby towns — Lal Quila Se Ayi Awaz, Dhillon-Sehgal-Sahnwaz (Indian National Army heroes),” he recalls.

Ishar Das (85) says his jovial nature is the reason behind his fitness. Recalling his past, he says, “My family struggled a lot for survival after the Partition, but I tackled the problems with a smiling face. My father was a moneylender in Gandot village. We were leading a royal-type life. We had a buffalo and a horse for ride. Though I wasn’t aware what was happening around, it was on August 15 when Station House Officer Kamaldeen from the Zafarwal police station came to our village riding his horse and addressed villagers at the village chowk. He requested Hindu families to leave the village with their valuables as communal violence had broken out in Lahore and Sialkot. The border was just two kilometres away from our village. We packed our luggage and left.”

“We never thought that the border line drawn by the then leaders will remain forever. My mother used to say that we will go back our village. We stayed in Pathankot for one year and then shifted to Amritsar,” he says.

During the 1965 war, Das read in newspapers that the Army had occupied the Zafarwal tehsil of Pakistan, so he took this opportunity to visit his village. The inhabitants of the village had been evacuated by the Pakistani army. “I reached my home and found everything in good condition. I went to the rooftop of my house. Suddenly a security personnel turned up and questioned what I was doing there. I told him that it was my home but he didn’t believe. I had to convince him that I left this home 18 years ago,” he says.

He got his passport made and visited Lahore in 1967."
‘Jiyo Parsi Abhiyan’,"‘Jiyo Parsi Abhiyan’

Col IPS Kohli (retd)

Col IPS Kohli (retd) It is raining abhiyans in India and while the likes of 'Swachh Bharat' and other pan-India programmes are well known, an 'abhiyan' that is lesser known in this part of the country is the 'Jiyo Parsi Abhiyan'. This programme was launched in November 2013 by the 'Ministry of Minority Affairs' to arrest the dwindling numbers of the much-loved and good-looking Parsi community. An ad which is the brainchild of Sam Balsara, used humour which is a Parsi staple to encourage Parsis to marry Parsis early, to produce more Parsis. The Parsis rose (sic) to the occasion and slipped into an overdrive. In about a year and a half the slide was somewhat arrested but more remains to be done. One of the taglines of the ad is 'Will your boyfriend be as successful as Rattan Tata?' Its import: advice to Parsi girls not to be over choosy about their mates and marry early or at the right time. Another one says, 'Earlier times families were cricket teams surely; you can manage a carrom foursome'. A mere 70,000 make up the entire community in India and an equal number is dispersed over the rest of the world. They are Zoroastrians who immigrated to Gujarat from Persia over a thousand years ago. Now concentrated chiefly in Mumbai, they adopted Indian culture but continue to worship Ahura Mazda, the founder of Zoroastrianism. In a country that has its minority communities perpetually whining for more favours and freebies, the Parsis, who are the smallest community, have never asked for anything and have steadfastly remained loyal to the State, bringing excellence in every field they have ventured into. In some fields they are the builders and pioneers of modern India. Besides, the Tatas, who pioneered civil aviation in India, the Parsi hall of fame includes literally the who's who of India. Ardeshir Godrej, Cyrus Poonawalla, Homi Jahangir Bhabha, Homi Sethna, Fali Nariman, Soli Sorabjee, Feroze Gandhi, Bhikaji Cama, Russi Modi, Zubin Mehta, Shiamik Davar, Nina Wadia, John Abraham, Farokh Engineer, Bapsi Sidhwa, Mehr Jessia, Perizaad Zorabian, Bejan Daruwalla, Cyrus Broacha, Behram Busybee Contractor and Persis Khambatta are known Indian icons. It is perhaps in the armed forces that the Parsis, who are not a martial race, have made the most significant contribution. This small community gave India two Chiefs of Air Staff, Aspy Engineer and Fali Homi Major, a Chief of Naval Staff, Jal Cursetji, and last but not the least the legendary Field Marshall Sam Maneckshaw, who had the guts, gumption and the conviction to look the Prime Minister in the eye and call a spade a bloody shovel. Sam Bahadur was the architect of India's most spectacular military victory in 1971 which sliced rogue Pakistan into two, leading to the birth of Bangladesh. Come on all you Daruwalas, Sodabottlewaterwalas, Ganjawalas, Gheewalas, Subziwalas, Thelewalas, Tyrewalas, Topiwalas, Ghaswalas, Cyclewalas - pick up the gauntlet! India needs more of you."
LA city to get more oversight in 2028 agreement,"Los Angeles, August 10

Los Angeles 2028 Olympic bid chiefs will give more oversight to city officials as they attempt to fine-tune details of their hastily revised plans to stage the Games, documents showed on Wednesday.

LA 2028, the City of Los Angeles and the United States Olympic Committee released a new memorandum of understanding in preparation for the 2028 Games in a bid to seek formal approval on Friday.

Los Angeles was granted the right to stage the 2028 Olympics after cutting a deal with Paris to step aside in the race for the 2024 Games.

The move, which was encouraged by the International Olympic Committee, means that Los Angeles is required to tweak plans for the Olympics in order to receive final backing from the City Council.

The City Council had already given unanimous support to the LA 2024 bid and is expected to back 2028 at a meeting on Friday.

However a city report released last week by the Office of the City Administrative Officer and Office of the Chief Legislative Analyst outlined risks in shifting to 2028.

“The additional four years add uncertainty concerning future economic and political conditions,” the report said.

“Although such uncertainty exists with the 2024 Olympic Games which will occur in seven years, the four-year extension increases those uncertainties.”

In addition to the lack of an independent analysis of a formal budget for 2028, another potential risk factor is that part of the ‘24 deal included a $250 million guarantee from the state of California to cover possible cost overruns.

With the legislature in recess, it is impossible to immediately guarantee they will approve the same amount for 2028.

However the memorandum of understanding released Wednesday said the city would be given additional provisions to guard against financial risk.

The memo would provide City representation on the LA 2028 Board of Directors, gives the City consent rights over significant venue changes within the City of Los Angeles and $270 million of the projected $500 million Games budget contingency and more frequent LA 2028 presentations and updates to the City Council in the first three years.

“My top priorities in this process are to protect Los Angeles taxpayers and create new opportunities for young Angelenos to play sports, and be healthy,” Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said.

“This new MOU ensures that our City priorities remain front-and-center in LA 2028’s preparations for the Games.

Under the City’s leadership, we can be sure that the up to $160 million we will receive to fund youth sports programs from LA 2028 will be put to the best, most impactful use.” — AFP"
It hit the fan long back,"BOOK REVIEW: POST-TRUTH: WHY WE HAVE REACHED PEAK BULLSHIT AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT BY EVAN DAVIS.

Man has always lied, evaded, cheated, misstated and concealed. What seems to have changed is the intensity with which post-truth is being bandied about. This is because there are no gatekeepers on the social media where truth and falsehood get equal billing

Sandeep Dikshit

A decade back, the word ‘bullshit’ would have appeared in print with asterisks blanking out the last four alphabets. Today, it is part of the title of three books released in quick succession. But we could be groping about something that was in existence since millennia, but has now acquired epidemic proportions. The burden of Evans’ song is that the phenomena of post-truth, which is colloquially called bullshit, reared its head in 2016.

What follows is intensive groundwork into all shades of post-truth defined as an assertion or claim whose owners neither know nor care whether what they say is true or false as long as their interests are met by fooling the gullible. The claim about its emergence in 2016 has to be held in abeyance. Cast a look at the past like Mark Antony’s speech at Caesar’s funeral over 2,000 years back. Or the US-UK disinformation over Iraq followed by further dissembling by not acknowledging the war’s consequences such as the breakup of the country and the fresh wind it gave to the ideology of violent Islamism.

Post-truth has been with us all the while in all its forms. The beauty of this book is in breaking it down and presenting the infinite variants of lying through the teeth: nonsense and gibberish (generally benign); gestures and phony behaviour (think Trump, Modi, Lalu Prasad Yadav); hidden messages (linguistic contortions) and short-termism (spouting exaggeration and lies to achieve an immediate aim).

It appears that things have been the same since kingdom come. Man has always lied, evaded, cheated, misstated and concealed. What seems to have changed is the intensity with which post-truth is being bandied about. This is because there are no gatekeepers on the social media where truth and falsehood get equal billing. There has been another significant change: the arrival of Donald Trump with his alluring mix of political lies, spin and falsehood. Just like academics treat September 11, 2001 (not 9-11) attacks as the day terrorism emerged, authors in the western world believe that post-truth is linked to the previous US presidential elections.

That is why, for those not plugged into the internal circuitry of the power play in the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, some obscure parts and people of Europe, the examples cited in the book are a big yawn for people in other parts of the globe. The examples have been painstakingly collated, assembled and distributed, but the net is not wide enough. It would have been more appealing had Davis not focused only on the Blairs and the Trumps, but spoken about their peers elsewhere — Shinzo Abe, Nawaz Sharif, Robert Duterte, Thaksin Shinawatra, Jacob Zuma and, our very own, Narendra Modi.

Nor are we told how the western media sets the pace and dominates the narrative on contentious issues where the self interest of its home country takes precedence. We, in the developing world, are frequently shushed into an uncomfortable silence with the avalanche of post-truth that descends from western TV channels and newspapers. The South China Sea is a prime example. A close reading of the occupation of those islands would show that the first stone in the sea was not cast by China. The first runway built on these islands or the first fortification was also not by China but by a clutch of countries that thrive under the shield of the American military umbrella.

What is the solution? It is natural that Evans will falter since his work is based on a partial study of post-truth. He has to, therefore, fall back on positivism and state that, in the end, good sense should prevail. If only life had a Bollywood-style happy ending."
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

05 Aug 2017 | 11:28 AM

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished.

[ + read story ]

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."
Book your writer,"The Writers’ Museum in Dublin is the best place to meet all wordsmiths

Preeti Verma Lal

What would you say of a city that Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, George Bernard Shaw called home? A city which earned the rare Unesco City of Literature tag. A city that produced four Nobel laureates in literature. A city that had an entire novel woven around its one day: Joyce’s Ulysses (June 16, 1904). A city that has bridges named after writers. A restaurant called Chapter One. Dublin, the capital of Ireland, was surely to the alphabet born. And in this city, the best place to meet all wordsmiths is the Dublin Writers’ Museum. If you do not look up at the black wrought iron arch of No 18, Parnell Street, you’d probably miss the black wooden door that leads into the museum. It could pass off as a rich man’s 18th century Georgian townhouse. That is what it originally was — the home of George Jameson, production manager of Jameson Whiskey Distillery, who lived in this house from 1891 to 1914. With so many famous writers residing in the city, journalist Maurice Gorham (1902-1975) mooted the idea of a Writers’ Museum in Dublin. Spread over two floors, the museum opened in November 1991. The two ground floor rooms narrate the history of Irish literature from the beginning to the present time through books, personal artefacts and statues. Room 2 is entirely devoted to literary giants of the 20th century. Here, living writers are not displayed — only the dead get display space. It starts with the Irish Literary Revival — from William Butler Yeats’ mettle in founding the Abbey Theatre to Easter Rising and the publication of Joyce’s Ulysses in 1922 — a signed copy of which is on display. Joyce shares a shelf with another exile, playwright and Nobel laureate Sean O’Casey. Under glass panes in locked tables are the typewriter of James Joyce, pen and spectacles of Frank O’Connor, Oliver Gogarty’s laurels, Mary Lavin’s teddy bear; a note from Sheridan to a creditor; a signed refusal from George Bernard Shaw to provide an autograph; a concise card from Samuel Beckett and Brendan Behan’s postcard from Los Angeles (‘Great spot for a quiet piss-up’). One of the most prominent displays is the specially designed telephone of Samuel Beckett. Walk on the red carpet that drapes the wooden staircase into the Gallery of Writers, a splendidly decorated room, which was once a magnificent salon with ornamental columns and gilded frieze. James Joyce’s piano stands amid the bust and portraits of Shaw, Frank McCourt, Wilde and Beckett. Step down the staircase, open a door and you can sit in the garden with busts of writers staring from window sills. Or, you can step into the bookshop and pick a copy of your favourite book. In Dublin Writer’s Museum, you cannot play Joyce’s piano. Beckett’s black rotary phone is safely locked. The first edition of Molly Malone is sepia with age. In a museum dedicated to the written word, you cannot hear the writers speak. But their words speak to you."
Indian-origin man indicted in US over bribery conspiracy,"New York, August 11

A 39-year old Indian-origin man has been indicted in the US on charges of soliciting and accepting bribes while performing his official duties as a state government employee. Anuj Sud of Maryland was indicted on charges related to the bribery conspiracy, Acting US Attorney for the District of Maryland Stephen Schenning said. Sud was a Liquor Board Commissioner and has been a licensed attorney in Maryland since 2005. According to court documents, in September 2015, Sud solicited bribes from a lobbyist in exchange for his assistance with liquor board matters. At a subsequent meeting, Sud and the lobbyist discussed Sud voting favourably in two upcoming hearings concerning the lobbyist’s clients, in exchange for money. At each of the hearings, Sud took favourable action on behalf of the lobbyist’s client. Following each hearing, the lobbyist met Sud and gave Sud USD 1,000 cash for his assistance. Similarly, Sud received another USD 1,000 bribe payment in exchange for taking favourable action on behalf of the lobbyist’s client. Sud was charged with two counts of bribery, for each of which he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. PTI"
HC sends Gwal Pahari dispute to civil court,"Village in foothills of Aravallis close to New Delhi and Faridabad

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

A petition in public interest was filed in the matter by Gurgaon resident-cum-RTI activist Harinder Dhingra for a CBI probe to find the persons involved in the mutation of 464 acres of Gwal Pahari land in Gurugram

Alleging the involvement of bureaucrats, politicians and local revenue officials, he had claimed that ownership of the disputed land was with the gram panchayat of Gwal Pahari since 1940 and transferred to the MCG in 2010.

Less than six months after the controversial mutation of 464 acres of Gwal Pahari land in Gurgaon came under the judicial scanner, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today largely referred the matter to the civil court. The copy of the orders was not yet available. Disposing of a majority of the pleas before it, the Bench of Justice SS Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan kept a couple of petitions pending while directing the parties concerned not to carry out construction, alienate the land or create third-party rights. Situated in the foothills of the Aravallis, Gwal Pahari in Gurgaon district is close to New Delhi and Faridabad. The development is significant as Haryana, on a previous date of hearing, had asserted that the shamlat land was with the Municipal Corporation-Gurgaon (MCG). The Bench was told that 164 acres of the total 464 acres had been vacated and 300 notices issued. No less than 139 persons had filed civil suits and stay had been ordered in some cases. A petition in public interest was filed in the matter by Gurgaon resident-cum-RTI activist Harinder Dhingra for a CBI probe to find the persons involved in prime land mutation. Alleging the involvement of bureaucrats, politicians and local revenue officials, he had claimed that ownership of the disputed land was with the gram panchayat of Gwal Pahari since 1940 and transferred to the MCG in 2010. The then Financial Commissioner (Revenue), not competent to pass an order on mutation in 2012, had favoured some builders, he alleged. The order was passed on the application of a private party challenging the 2010 transfer of land. The order was challenged by the MCG before the Financial Commissioner, who stayed the order. But in October 2015, another IAS officer had restored the order. Thereafter, the matter had reached the state government and a decision was taken for mutation of land in favour of the MCG. But, this order, too, was declared void in January by District Collector TL Satyaprakash. This order was stayed by Gurgaon Divisional Commissioner D Suresh in February, the court was told. The Bench had already made it clear that encroachments from shamlat or village common land were required to be removed by taking legal recourse. The Bench had added that ordering an inquiry into the matter would not help and the solution lay in following the Haryana Municipal Act. The Bench asserted that the accepted position was that the land was with the MCG since 2010. “If it is shamlat land, provisions under Section 408-A need to be initiated and we will monitor it,” the Bench asserted. Section 408-A of the Haryana Municipal Act deals with power to evict persons from corporation premises and land."

PS Banerjee, who witnessed the horrors of Partition as a Class VIII girl, recalls how Hindus and Muslims protected each other during that time of absolute turmoil and bloodshed

Manpriya Singh

The first few professions

Hindu Vs Muslim

Years haven’t wiped out much of the memories, experiences and observations for the 87-year-old, Chandigarh-based, PS Banerjee. Former teacher at Sacred Heart Convent School, she effortlessly recalls the year 1947 when she was in Class VIII. “I was a student of Government School, Bulandshahar, and so many of my teachers migrated from here.”While despair and hopelessness invariably forms a part of human-inflicted tragedy, she scuttles through the bitter memories to only unearth the brave human spirit. “The women who migrated from there usually dressed in black clothes,” she starts narrating from a fashion point of view before moving onto other things. What’s more? “They were women of grit and determination. They never begged. None of them. Ever. Having lost out on their lands and almost everything, some of the first few professions they chose to survive were the simple things that women could do,” Banerjee recalls rows and rows of tandoors being laid out where women made chapattis in return for money. “They cooked in tandoors, the men became vegetable vendors, some women took up sewing. But they never begged.” The horrors began a little before Partition actually struck. “Curfew was a very normal thing and one night I remember being scared for my father. He was a priest and was to arrive on a bus. But due to hostility and bloodshed, he reached home only at 4 am, shuttling various buses.” In an era when not even public payphones existed, “you can imagine my fear as a daughter,” she shrugs.There are disconnected episodes, but all form a coherent part to explain the era. In the middle of it, Banerjee looked at the entire turn of events with fear. “Around 2 am in the morning the call of Azaan from Muslim inhabitants on the first floor of our house, would scare me.” She adds, “The girls who did come to study from the other side of the fence arrived in a palanquin. Girls were reserved those days and always protected.” As for the always spoken about Hindu-Muslim divide -it wasn’t as stark and as universal as is often played out by history. Recalls Banerjee, “In our vicinity, a seven or eight-year-old Muslim boy told a Hindu doctor to not come to his place to treat his father because he feared for the doctor’s life.” She adds, “There were many incidents like these where people protected other community’s members. Before Partition, they lived in harmony and after Partition, in bitter-sweet memories of each other.” Till the next story!"
"House panel favours commercial surrogacy, overturns key provisions","Aditi Tandon

In a major setback to the government today, the parliamentary panel reviewing the surrogacy Bill asked the government to permit commercial surrogacy and allow the service not just for married Indian couples but also live-in partners, single/ divorced women, widows and NRIs and OCIs. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health has virtually overturned every major provision of the Surrogacy Regulation Bill 2016, questioning the government rationale in saying that only a close relative of the intending couples can serve as a surrogate mother. The panel has said both related and unrelated women should be allowed to become surrogates.Most importantly, the committee has rejected the provision of “only altruistic surrogacy” as “paternalistic.” The government Bill imposes a blanket ban on commercial surrogacy, saying only close relatives can offer wombs to an intending mother for exchange of medical reimbursement. “Economic opportunities available to surrogates through surrogacy services should not be dismissed in a paternalistic manner. We are convinced the altruistic surrogacy model as proposed in the Bill is based more on moralistic assumptions than on any scientific criteria and all kinds of value judgments have been injected into it in a paternalistic manner. The word altruistic in the Bill should be replaced with the word “compensated”,” the panel has said in its report. The panel, rejecting that surrogacy services could be availed of by only Indian couples married for five years, said it should be replaced with one. “The Department of Health Research, by imposing prohibition on widows and divorced women, has closed its eyes to ground reality. The decision to keep live-in partners out of the Bill is inconsonant with the modern social milieu and too narrow in understanding. We recommend that the department broadbase the eligibility criteria and widen the ambit of persons who can avail surrogacy services by including live-in couples, divorced women and widows,”it said. The committee, agreeing to bar foreigners, is of the opinion that NRIs, PIOs and OCI card-holders should be allowed surrogacy services. The government Bill had excluded these categories. The Bill, drafted by a GoM headed by Union Minister Sushma Swaraj to regulate the $2 billion surrogacy industry in India, was widely criticised for its narrow provisions."

Bathinda, August 10

Days, months and years have passed but memories of her native place Jalalabad in Multan district, Pakistan, refuses to fade away for 81-year-old Shanti Devi, also known as Dyali Bai, a resident of Partap Nagar.

“It was like I needed wings to fly to Jalalabad, my home, where I spent my childhood like a princess,” said Dyali Bai.

“In Jalalabad, we were living a royal and happy life but in one night, everything changed. The brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims seemed to have vanished. I couldn’t remember the date exactly as I was just 10-year-old at that time,” she said.

“I remember that my father’s friend Maulvi saved our family from the Muslim mob. The same night, they sent us to Multan on horseback and mules. At that time, my father did not have the idea that we would never come back again to our place. He realised it in Multan from the special trains that were plying to India,” added Dyali Bai.

“During the journey from Jalalabad to Multan, we saw a number of bodies lying near the Ravi river. My father was trying to assure me and my younger brother that nothing had happened. We were told that we were going to some relative’s house. We boarded a train from Multan and when we reached Kurukshetra, we saw a large number of people living in tents,” the octogenarian said.

Dyali Bai said her home was destroyed and within a few weeks, they were reduced to being paupers.

‘We didn’t have sleepers on our feet. We spent more than two years in camps at Kurukshetra. After that, the government allotted us land in Bhiwani. But it was not that easy as my father had to make a lot of efforts to get that small piece of land,” she said.

“I do not exactly remember the year in which I got married to a freedom fighter, the late Hari Chand, a resident of Kurukshetra. I may be 13 or 14-year-old at that time and he was around 20 to 21. Later, he got a job in the Railways at Bathinda and we started living here,” added Dyali Bai.

Today, she hates Pakistan and as she says they called them ‘kaafir’.

She admires India’s first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru for providing facilities to the people in Kurukshetra at the time of partition."
Manish...he’s awesome!,"From humble beginnings, renowned fashion designer Manish Malhotra has a niche of his own today. The man, who sleeps for just five hours, believes imitation indeed is the best form of flattery

Manpriya Singh

How do we address Manish Malhotra? For, the introductions he doesn’t need any. Though they’d shuttle between B-town’s darling…poster boy of mainstream fashion and lately, Indian bride’s dream designer. Having fancied clothes, colours and films since childhood, he is living his B-town dream and as far as Bollywood is concerned, well, they are living him up too. “Ever since childhood at the age of 5 or 6, I have had a fascination for sketching and colours. I had an opinion on the colour of my mother’s saree. As for films, they are till today my best stress-buster.” The flair and passion more than made up for lack of education and even humble beginnings when he, “didn’t have the money to come up with a collection.” He is ready for ‘n’ number of queries on his label, his inspiration, journey, Bollywood and anything in between. “It’s hot here,” he settles after felicitating students of INIFD and before his 45 minute lecture is to begin. The signature Burberry check scarf comes out (this time, he’s wearing grey) though not the black blazer. “I always wear black because I feel it makes me look slimmer because I am always feeling fat; and checks because they give a masculine touch.” It’s the busiest time, there is Lakme Fashion Week coming up in Mumbai next week. “But once I commit to something I fulfill it. You wouldn’t see me taking calls from office back in Mumbai or working on the collection. I’ll put in extra hours, but won’t neglect anything.”

Indian women going wrong?

“I think where Indian women go wrong the most is in overdoing things. There’s jewellery, costume, hair and make-up; everything going at the same time. For instance, if you are wearing a nice heavy necklace, keep the blouse or neckline simple and vice-versa.”

World of replicas

Once a collection is out there, it doesn’t take more than a week for the market to be flooded with ‘Manish Malhotra lehengas’. With everyone trying to do the same thing (sometimes the exact same thing); he does acknowledge and takes solace in the fact that imitation indeed is the best form of flattery! Having said that, “If it’s films that are being followed and copied, I can’t control that, but as a brand, we plan to take significant measures to tackle that.”

If I want to say something like that, I have a way of saying it.“Very hectic; there’s a period drama coming up starring Alia, Varun, Sridevi; and then Student of The Year 2. Also there are shows in Delhi, Kolkata and Dubai.”“I admire Sridevi because she believed in me when I was starting out and she was at the peak of her career. She and Rekha are the only people, I address as mam.”

"The Tribune: Delhi, NCR news","NEW DELHI:Issues of pending mohalla clinics' expansion and giving weight to guest teachers in recruitment in government schools pitted the AAP and Opposition BJP legislators against each other in the Delhi Assembly on Thursday.

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 10

Issues of pending mohalla clinics' expansion and giving weight to guest teachers in recruitment in government schools pitted the AAP and Opposition BJP legislators against each other in the Delhi Assembly on Thursday.

What tensed the atmosphere was the spat between the ruling benches and Opposition leaders prompting Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Health Minister Satyendra Jain to accuse the BJP-led Centre of “obstructing” the Delhi Government’s crucial projects.

Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel pulled up Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa for repeatedly interjecting Sisodia while he was throwing barbs at the Opposition for attacking the AAP government over the delay in regularisation of guest teachers.

“Our government is working and we are not indulging in eve-teasing and harassing girls on streets (in a veiled reference to the Chandigarh stalking case embroiling Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala’s son),” Sisodia said in the House.

Besides, the Shiromani Akali Dal leader, Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta alleged that the Kejriwal government is not serious in filling the vacancies of guest teachers in government schools and just blaming the Lt Governor.

Gupta questioned the August 7 advertisement issued by Delhi Subordinate Selection Board for 9138 vacancies of government school teachers, pointing out that around 17,858 guest teachers are left in the lurch as not only have they been disadvantaged by not considering their experience in new appointments but they are now expected to clear exam with young applicants.

“You (AAP government) had promised to regularise 17,858 teachers and do you think these teachers will fall under your formula. Teachers who were not allowed to take exams due to age will approach the court. The government must find out ways to absorb guest teachers,” said Gupta while asking the government to regularise guest teachers.

Referring to the recent advertisement of teachers’ appointment in government schools, Sisodia told the House, “In the new recruitment notice provision of age relaxation is there but we had also asked for giving weight to the experience of guest teachers that was rejected. We had sent the cabinet’s proposal on August 6, 2015. On March 30, 2016, the file was sent back with objection on weight in the light of Uma Devi judgement.”

Mohalla clinic proposal rocks the Assembly

The other issue that rocked the Assembly today was the pet project of the ruling party—mohalla clinics.

Both the AAP and the BJP sparred over the issue with Health Minister Satyendra Jain telling the House the file is stuck with the LG and Speaker Ram Niwas Goel going on to suggest to LoP Vijender Gupta that a five-member delegation comprising BJP and AAP legislators can meet the LG and request him to approve.

While ruling party legislators Rajesh Gupta and Ritu Raj expressed their anger on the need for the LG’s approval on setting up mohalla clinics, Rajouri Garden MLA Sirsa and Gupta criticised the AAP government over the issue.

Order on adulteration soon: Satyendra Jain

AAP legislator Jarnail Singh raised concerns over alleged adulteration in food served by many hotels and restaurants in the city. After the Speaker said a helpline service no (1800113921) should be displayed on the premises of every hotel and restaurant and in response, Jain said an order will be issued in this regard in every restaurant and hotels.

Notes that bridge the gap,"Shubha Mudgal on increasing the scope of Hindustani classical music in the age of smartphone

Neha Kirpal

Shubha Mudgal knows the new generation speaks a different language. She knows attending classical music concerts is a thing of the past for them. But, who said Hindustani can’t go to the youth? To reach out to them, Shubha is talking to them in their language. That of apps, streaming, etc. The Padma Shri awardee has, along with her husband, Aneesh Pradhan, established an online distribution platform for musicians specialising in diverse forms of Indian music through the website www.UnderscoreRecords.com. Among the many projects, they have initiated in their efforts to preserve the rich musical heritage of India is www.SangeetKosh.net, an online encyclopedia of Indian music. Shubha Mudgal talks to us, among other things, about the challenges Hindustani classical music scene is facing and its future.I have been a student of Hindustani classical music for over 35 years now and there have indeed been quite a few noticeable changes. On a positive note, festivals that have put in sustained efforts to promote classical music for decades witness a marked increase in audience numbers. As a result, leading festivals now attract listeners in many thousands. However, smaller music circles — that have also made an invaluable contribution — find it difficult to attract audiences and organise concerts periodically due to the lack of funds and support. Some of the bigger music festivals have also had to downsize due to the lack of adequate sponsorship. As instruments like keyboards, guitars and drums find more takers, traditional artisans and master craftsmen, who make acoustic Indian instruments like the tanpura and the sitar, find it difficult to sustain themselves. Many of them prefer to look for other professions for their children. It will be a pity if their mastery is lost to future generations.I think platforms like YouTube throw up an absolute treasure of music. But a listening guide that explains facts in simple terms is what is difficult to come by. There are various artistes and scholars who are attempting to put together music appreciation modules. However, this is not a simple task and requires some experimenting, scripting and a fair bit of research and development — all of which require support and funding. It is hard enough to find sponsors for events and performances in India. I can imagine what a Herculean task it would be to look for sponsors for music education modules.From Spotify (currently not available in India) to Gaana and YouTube, every platform is available for music lovers to explore. The problem lies in making the right discovery. If you don’t know which artiste, raag, style or instrument you want to hear, you could just wade around forever more and not find the music that you might enjoy.No, I think it has already been proved in case of the Gandharva channel, InSync, etc. that listeners of Hindustani classical music don’t want to buy subscriptions. Further, the programming needs to be innovative and technically on par with other channels. Settling for mediocre or low quality, badly produced content simply to fulfill the 24-hour mandate is not going to help Hindustani classical music, its exponents or its listeners. Therefore, it is best that no attempt be made to start dedicated television or radio channels till these issues are worked out in the greatest detail.There are enough awards, and enough dirt and corruption around the existing awards for me to say categorically that more awards are only going to create a bigger scramble and tussle for them.Both plays revolve around forms and styles of music that I have been studying for decades. Both are directed by Purva Naresh who is herself trained in kathak, pakhawaj and music. Therefore, the experience was pleasant, enriching and satisfying.Well, I am no specialist in composing music for either films or theatre. But when the subject or script demands the involvement of a trained Hindustani musician, I am happy to be involved and collaborate, if my schedule permits me to do so."
The Tribune: Science,"SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook is rolling out a new video service offering professionally produced shows in a challenge to rivals such as YouTube, and potentially to streaming providers like Netflix.

San Francisco, August 10

Facebook is rolling out a new video service offering professionally produced shows in a challenge to rivals such as YouTube, and potentially to streaming providers like Netflix.

The Facebook service called Watch will include a range of shows, from reality to comedy to live sports, the social network said in its announcement late yesterday.

The new platform offers an opportunity for social interactions via the Facebook community of some two billion users.

It will be ""a place where you can discover shows your friends are watching and follow your favorite shows and creators so you don't miss any episodes,"" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said.

""You'll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.""

Facebook has funded some of the creators to get the service going.

The launch shows include blogger Nusseir Yassin's ""Nas Daily"", which includes videos together with his fans from around the world, and another hosted by author and motivational speaker Gabby Bernstein.

The service will also include a weekly Major League Baseball game.

""Watch is comprised of shows, a new type of video on Facebook,"" said Nick Grudin, Facebook's vice president of media partnerships, in a blog post.

""Shows are made up of episodes — live or recorded — that follow a consistent theme or storyline... Our goal is for Watch to be a platform for all creators and publishers to find an audience, build a community of passionate fans, and earn money for their work.""

Initially, Watch will be available to a limited group of Facebook users in the United States and more widely to US users in the coming weeks, Facebook, said.

Over time, creators will be able to monetize their shows through ""ad breaks,"" according to Facebook.

The launch is a limited move into scripted and professional video but puts Facebook on a course to challenge Google-owned YouTube, and possibly other streaming services if it gains a wider audience.

""In general, the model here feels very YouTube-like, with a subscription model, though Facebook's apps for TV platforms in recent months have signaled the broad structure and interface, with a combination of videos recommended or liked by friends, things you've saved, things that are popular on the platform, and so on,"" said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.

The Tribune: Ludhiana city news,"LUDHIANA: The police today claimed to have solved the recent cyber fraud cases with the arrest of four petrol pump employees here.

Nikhil Bhardwaj

Tribune News Service

Ludhiana, August 10

The police today claimed to have solved the recent cyber fraud cases with the arrest of four petrol pump employees here. The case is said to have been cracked after thorough questioning of cyber thief Mukul, whose live-in partner Ramandeep Kaur had committed suicide at the Dugri police station a few days ago.

The accused have been identified as Ravinder Singh of Sandh village in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, who worked at the Bansal filling station, Dhuri railway line; Bikramjit Singh of Surti village in Kangra, who worked at the Bharat petrol pump, Samrala chowk; Shuban Vishkarma, who worked at a Reliance petrol pump in Dugri; and Davinder Kumar of New Agar Nagar here.

Additional DCP-II Sandeep Garg and ACP-Headquarters and Cyber Crime Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, who cracked the case, conducted a press conference today.

Garg said after Mukul was nabbed on August 5, the police had recovered several fake ID proofs from him, which he was using for shopping expensive things from malls and from online sites through cloned debit and credit cards.

“During Mukul’s questioning, the police came to know that he and his girlfriend, Ramandeep Kaur, was in touch with several petrol pump employees to whom they had given skimming devices to steal data of cash cards. Whenever any customer came to their petrol pumps for buying petrol or diesel, these employees used to swipe card in the skimming machines to steal the data,” Garg added.

The ADCP said by unearthing this racket, the police had solved 18 cases of cyber fraud, out of a total 28 cases reported in the past over two weeks. These cases mainly pertain to shopping from cards or withdrawing cash from ATMs and do not include cases in which money was transferred through net banking. The police are seriously working to crack those cases as well.

Expensive watches, shoes bought with cloned cards

Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, ACP, Cyber Crime, said after preparing the clones of ATM cards, Mukul used to buy expensive branded watches, shoes, clothes and other things. “We have recovered branded wrist watches, such as Rolex, Rado, and branded shoes which Mukul had purchased recently with the cloned cards,” the ACP added.

Workers charged Rs 800 per swipe to steal data

The arrested petrol pump employees were paid Rs 800 per swipe by Mukul. Once the card was swiped and PIN secretly recorded by an employee, he could claim Rs 800 from Mukul. ADCP II Sandeep Garg said the pump employees had been providing their services to Mukul for the past several months, and it could be possible that data of hundreds of cards was stolen by them through skimming devices. “So far, pump employees had prepared 79 clones of debit and credit cards. We have not recovered any skimming machines but we have enough evidence of Mukul’s connection with these pump employees. They were also in touch with Mukul over the phone and we have all records,” Garg revealed.

Police advice to residents

Whenever you visit a petrol pump or a shop, you should cautiously watch employees if they are swiping your debit/credit card on a skimming device, and always make sure that nobody is around when you enter the PIN on the machine. Criminals can’t withdraw money with cloned cards unless they have the secret PIN.

Stolen data of cards was sold outside Punjab

Since Mukul had loads of stolen data of debit and credits cards, he used to sell it to criminals in Delhi, Mumbai, Jharkhand and other state for huge sums. The price of stolen data was fixed as per the balance amount in the card."
"Mehbooba wants to run with hare, hunt with hounds: Omar","Slams CM’s move to reach out to both New Delhi, parties in Kashmir

Azhar Qadri

Tribune News Service

Srinagar, August 10

As the clamour over the possible scrapping of Article 35-A grows in the Kashmir valley, former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti of being in a dilemma and said she wanted to “run with the hare and hunt with the hounds”. The National Conference working president in his hard-hitting commentary against Mehbooba said she wanted to “govern with the BJP and opposed their politics with us”. “That is the crux of her dilemma — run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. She wants to govern with the BJP and oppose their politics with us,” Omar wrote on Twitter while commenting on the Chief Minister’s move to reach out to both New Delhi, which is adamant on scrapping Article 35-A, as well as the political parties in Kashmir which are threatening an agitation over the issue. Omar’s comment comes at a time when Mehbooba Mufti, whose party governs the state in alliance with the BJP, is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi to discuss the legal challenges to Article 35-A. Mehbooba had earlier met the opposition leaders in the state, including National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, and discussed “ways to protect” the Article. The Article 35-A, incorporated in the Indian Constitution in 1954, grants special privileges and rights to the permanent residents of J&K and debars non-residents from buying land or property, getting government jobs, or voting in Assembly elections in the state. A New Delhi-based RSS-linked NGO ‘We the Citizens’ filed a petition seeking the repealing of Article 35-A before the Supreme Court in 2014. The state government had earlier this year filed its response and sought dismissal of the petition. The Central government, however, did not file any affidavit opposing the writ petition; instead, it said it wanted a “larger debate” on it. Omar’s National Conference party was the first to raise an alarm over the possible scrapping of the Article. The party’s president had earlier this week warned of a “far greater agitation” if an attempt was made to abrogate it. The possibility of the Article getting scrapped has united political parties in the region with mainstream as well as separatist groups issuing threats and warning of protests in defence of the state’s special status. A loose coalition of separatist leaders has already called for a shutdown on Saturday in the region to protest against the possible scrapping of the Article, saying that it is being done to “alter the demography of the state”."
How to defeat the idea of traffic management,"GOOD MOTORING

H. Kishie Singh

It has been repeated, ad nauseam, in this column that what we need is an expert on traffic. Judging by the so-called improvement of Chandigarh roads, it is abundantly clear that no one in the Chandigarh Administration and the Chandigarh Police have the foggiest notion of this term. I suspect we have a babu who may not even have a driving licence, but is making decisions on traffic management in the city. For the benefit for the city drivers and the powers that be, let us define the term ‘traffic management’. Well, traffic management means free and easy flow of traffic in controlled and safe conditions. Having explained that, I am obliged to ask, why are there two speed breakers at the entrance to Raj Bhawan? Traffic on this road, Vigyan Path, flows uninterrupted. Not being happy with such a scenario, two speed breakers have been built on this road. Surely, the Governor’s driver and escort vehicle have the brains to stop as they exit, look left and right, and then enter the main road. This happens occasionally. In any case, there are always half-a-dozen policemen on duty to control traffic and give His Excellency the right of way. Now, these speed breakers are an impediment, 24x7, in the free flow of traffic. They serve no practical purpose. It is also an accepted fact that speed breakers can cause accidents. Then there is the brilliant move of diverting weekend traffic through Sector 5. The diversion was necessary because Sarovar Path is closed at the Vigyan Path roundabout. The traffic is obliged to turn left to get to Sukhna Lake. The Police also did a left turn and, like water takes the path of least resistance, the Police did the same. They came to the Sector 5 entrance and diverted traffic to turn right. They did not solve a problem, they created one. A crossroad complete with barriers, creating a dangerous situation and making life hell for the residents of Sector 5. All the holiday makers now drive through the heart of Sector 5 to the Lake. It would have been much easier to take the traffic another 100 meters to Himalaya Marg, a wide sector dividing road. However, a hundred metres was a road too far! The latest disaster in traffic management thrust on Chandigarhian’s is at the junction of Chandi Path and Madhya Marg. Driving along Madhya Marg, you will come to a roundabout. Under the traffic lights there is a sign ‘No Left Turn’! Somebody please tell me what to do? Another point: If you are driving north on Chandi Path, just as you approach Madhya Marg, there is a slip road. The purpose of a slip road is to allow traffic to slip from the main road to prevent congestion. And guess what? There could be a red light at the end of the slip road to prevent you from entering Madhya Marg! This defeats the whole purpose of the slip road. Traffic now backs up on two roads. Nothing could be more counter- productive than blocking a slip road exit. The slip road is not very long. The length can accommodate two, may be three cars. The rear end of the fourth car could jut out on to Chandi Path, creating another problem.

The script of love and lyrics,"Urdu, the language of Mir, Ghalib, Faiz and Firaq has a rich literary tradition, which must not be allowed to wither away

Kuldip Dhiman

When poet Jaleel Manakpuri was being felicitated by an organiser who was not familiar with the nuances of Urdu, a friend sitting next to the poet said, “Jaleel sahab, aaj aap zaleel hone wale hain.” (Jaleel sahib, today you are going to be humiliated). This is because a slight difference in pronunciation can change the meaning completely in Urdu. Jaleel means ‘glorious’, and if pronounced zaleel, it means ‘to be humiliated’. Urdu, along with its twin sister Hindi, has been a language of the masses for more than 700 years. Both grew out of what is called khari boli, the general language of communication in northern India. While Urdu is normally written in the Persian script, and has more Persian, Turkish and Arabic words, Hindi is written in the Devanagari and inclines more towards Sanskrit. These are virtually indistinguishable to the outsider. The name ‘Urdu’ has its origins in the Turkish word ordu which means ‘army camp’, and over the centuries, it has produced great literature, especially poetry. A single sher (couplet) of Urdu can help you express what cannot be said in a thousand words. However, with the rise of English as the lingua franca, and with an unfair association of Urdu with religion, this beautiful language seems to be losing favour with the masses. Many Urdu aficionados have begun to feel that the language is slowly dying, while experts in the field hold that Urdu is doing much better than before. Rekhta, an organisation devoted to the promotion of Urdu language and literature, recently held a mushaira (poetic gathering) at the Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh. If numbers are any indication, it was heartening to see that the hall was jam-packed with young and old, with many of them standing outside the theatre hall to listen to the poets. The same is true of wherever mushairas are held. Litterateurs from Punjab such as Saadat Hasan Manto, Sahir Ludhianvi, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Gulzar and hundreds of others have made tremendous contribution to popularise Urdu. Its popularity notwithstanding, Urdu certainly remains in the shadow of English. Dr Kumud Bansal, Chairperson, Haryana Urdu Akademi, Panchkula, observes, “Not just Urdu, all Indian languages are suffering. Children are not being taught their mother tongue anymore. Most parents want their children to learn only English. This is because of the slave mentality we have. This is the reason we need Urdu academies. Have you heard of an English academy?” We move over to Malerkotla, a town rich in Urdu culture. Talking about the current health of Urdu, Dr Rubina Shabnam, Secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, says: “Urdu is the language that emerged in the undivided Punjab. In his book, Punjab Mein Urdu, Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani, the great linguistic and researcher, has shown through research based on historical evidence that the greater Punjab was the birthplace of Urdu. So Urdu is rooted in this region.” However, not all scholars agree with Shirani. Talking about the academy and its aims, Dr Shabnam says, “We started in 2014, and we have a budget of only Rs 50,000 per annum. Even with this meagre sum, we have managed to hold stage programmes but have not been able to publish anything. Now, the government has given us a one-time sum of Rs 3 crore. With this, we hope to realise the aims of the academy. Recently, I met Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister, and he said he would give us a hundred crore rupees. If we got this amount, we would be able to encourage Urdu writers, and poets. Presently, we are starting free Urdu learning centres in six cities of Sunam, Bathinda, Ropar, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Patiala.” Regarding the popularity of Urdu, Prof Mahmood Alam, former professor at Government College, ex-secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, and writer of a poetry collection Shikast-e-Khwab, says: “If you ask me about the current status of Urdu, I would say it is far better than before. Two decades ago, Urdu was not being taught in as many schools as it is being taught now, and there were not as many students as we have now. During my time, there used to be four teachers, and we had about four or five students who wanted to learn Urdu. Now you have 30 students, but unfortunately only one teacher. Many wish to learn Urdu but they get discouraged because it does not offer employment opportunities.” Rubbishing language politics, Professor Alam observes, “People say that there is friction between Hindi and Urdu. They say languages create conflict between different people, but this is not so. Languages bring people together. If Hindi and Punjabi speakers learn Urdu, their Hindi and Punjabi pronunciation will improve, and vice versa.” One has to learn the finer points of this language in order to speak it well. As Dagh Dehalvi puts it: “Nahin khel ai Dagh yaron se kah do; Ki ati hai Urdu zaban ate ate” (O! Dagh, tell friends that learning Urdu is not a child’s play; It takes its own time to be mastered). Amarnath Wadehra, a diehard Urdu protagonist, remembers the days of his youth when Urdu poets were a rage in Lahore, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and the rest of Punjab. “There used to be regular mushairas that went on all night, and people came in hordes to listen to their favourite poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi, Firaq Gorakhpuri and many other stalwarts. Urdu poets did a lot to fan the flames of the freedom moment, and bring about a social change. Many freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for the country singing ‘Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mei hai’. The younger generation should learn English for getting jobs, but they must also learn Urdu to enrich their personality.” Born in 1937, Pakpattan, Pakistan, Dr HK Lall has been teaching Urdu for the past four decades. “Urdu is in my blood. My father taught it to my brother and me.” Even at 81, he continues to teach the language untiringly. “Khidmat-e-Urdu karunga umr bhar; Yeh meri puja, mera imaan hai.” (I will serve Urdu all my life; It is my worship, it is my conscience).

Disappearing readers

Propagators notwithstanding, the fact is that the circulation of Urdu newspapers and magazines is going down by the day. In 2001, the total number of Urdu newspapers in the country was 2,906, but many have been forced to go online or have closed shop because of falling circulation. In a telephonic conversation, Sham Dass Khanna, news editor, Hind Samachar, the number one Urdu daily in Punjab, said, “The situation is alarming. From 1,20,000 copies per day until the 1990s, our circulation has come down to 37,000 copies per day. Our readers are disappearing because Urdu does not promise career options.”

Measures needed

In order to improve the condition of Urdu, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Nadeem, who conducts certificate and diploma courses in Urdu and Persian at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib, says: “We plan to start special classes for students who are doing post-graduation and doctorate in Punjabi because there is a close relationship between Punjabi and Urdu. The knowledge of Urdu is important even for religious studies because the poetry of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Gobind Singh is replete with Persian words and phrases.” Urdu is the language of Punjabi culture because it was born in Punjab, observes Dr Nadeem. “It is essential to learn Urdu, because once you learn how to read and write it, doors open to eight languages because they all used the same script. These languages are: Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kashmiri, Pashtu, Dogri, Sindhi, and also Punjabi because in Pakistan, it is written in the Persian script. If you examine Punjabi and Urdu, you will notice that there are so many similarities. For example, chhabeel comes from the Arabic word sabeel; ardas comes from arz-e-dash.” Dr Mohammad Ayyub Khan, programme in-charge, Haryana Urdu Akademi, points out the practical problems in the propagation of Urdu: “There is an acute shortage of teachers. At Panjab University, Punjabi University, Guru Nanak Dev University, and Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, they have appointed only one Urdu teacher, and this one teacher runs the entire department. How can they do justice to their jobs? In MA classes, we have eight subjects, so we need at least four Urdu teachers. It is not that there are no posts, but I fail to understand why these are not being filled up. It is not that the government is not giving funds to promote the language; the funds are not being properly utilised.” Muhammad Rafique, lecturer, political science at Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), Malerkotla, says: “A team from Delhi came here to study the status of Urdu in this tehsil, and they gave a good report about it. They said, in other states, about 1,200 Urdu teachers have been appointed but their output is very poor. We have only 45 teachers, but their output is tremendous.” Sahibzada Ajmal Khan Sherwani, a poet belonging to the royal family, suggests that if we want people to learn Urdu, we must produce excellent literature, films, TV serials and plays in Urdu. We see that the rise or downfall of a language is directly linked to the rise or downfall of its literature. “Urdu is very popular, and one of the reasons is the extensive use of Urdu in the film industry. Another reason for its popularity is various TV channels that telecast Urdu programmes, serials, seminars, and mushairas. In addition to this, the government must open more institutes and encourage students to learn it in schools and colleges so that great writers and poets are produced.” Speaking of Urdu, he wrote a verse: “Hoon main Urdu, hai dilon mei mera maskan dekho; Kaun kehta hai ki meri koi jagir nahin” (I am Urdu, and my abode is in the hearts of people, Who says that I have no legacy?). The legacy of Zauk, Sauda, Momin, Iqbal, Hali, Faraz and others is alive indeed in the hearts of the masses."

Suicides: Farmers to boycott I-Day events,"Accuse Cong govt of failing to control damage

Kuldip Bhatia

Ludhiana, August 10

Farmers will boycott Independence Day functions across the state and observe August 15 as a “black day” in protest against the government’s “failure” to stem the tide of farm suicides. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) announced this at a meeting of its state committee here today. “In view of unabated suicides by farmers, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and his Cabinet colleagues must pay homage to deceased farmers before unfurling the National Flag,” BKU general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said. The Congress, BKU members said, had promised to waive farm debt in the run-up to the Assembly elections. “Now, debt waiver comes with certain conditions. Loans of only up to Rs 2 lakh are to be waived. And as of now, this remains an assurance. Not even a single farmer has benefitted from the announcement,” BKU secretary general Ramkaran Singh Rama claimed. Rama and Lakhowal said the Congress government was now looking towards the Centre for debt relief, while the Modi government had already washed its hands off the matter, saying it was for the states to provide relief, if any, to farmers. BKU functionaries blamed the Central and state governments for betraying farmers. “The BJP (at the Centre) and the Congress (in Punjab) secured votes of farmers on the pretext of providing remunerative prices for their produce and implementing the Swaminathan Commission report. The two parties have reneged on their promise, denying economic independence to farmers,” Lakhowal said. The BKU demanded release of sugarcane arrears running into more than Rs 100 crore by August 28. “If sugarcane growers are not paid by then, they will start an indefinite dharna from August 29 and disrupt traffic on the Chandigarh-Ludhiana and Chandigarh-Ropar roads,” Lakhowal added."
United States favours dialogue on Doklam issue,"Washington, August 11

The US on Friday said it wanted India and China to have a dialogue over the Doklam standoff in the Sikkim section. India and China have been locked in a face-off in the Doklam area for the past 50 days after Indian troops stopped the Chinese People’s Liberation Army from building a road in the area. “It’s a situation that we have certainly followed closely,” State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters at her news conference. “As you know, we have relationships with both governments. We continue to encourage both parties to sit down and have conversations about that. And I’ll just leave it at that,” Nauert said. PTI"

"NRIs, locals pitch in for farmers’ kin","Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

In an initiative to help the beleaguered farmer community, a number of people, including NRIs and locals, have come forward to donate money through the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to the families whose one or more members have committed suicide. Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira said the AAP was just a facilitator between the donors and recipients and would not open any special bank account for the purpose. Surjeet Singh, father of Australian NRI Rashpal Singh, originally of Charar village (Jalandhar), handed over a cheque for Rs 2 lakh to the family of Davinder Singh of Chanarthal Khurd village in Fatehgarh Sahib today. All three male members of the family had committed suicide in the recent past after failing to repay the loan taken from a local commission agent. Khaira added that after his call to the NRIs a few days ago, many of them contacted him to help the farmers in the state. He said Jeet Singh Kular (Canada), Raju Purewal (Canada), Dashmesh Singh Pannu (Canada) and Jaswinder Singh Latti (Italy) have promised to donate Rs 1 lakh each to the farmers’ families, while Manjeet Singh Ghumman (Holland) has offered to pay monthly pension of Rs 2,500 each to the widows of Dalit Khet Mazdoor families. Another donor from Moga — Happy — has offered to donate Rs 25,000 to any victim family. Khaira said he had also donated Rs 50,000 to a migrant family of Kapurthala whose five members had committed suicide after consuming poison in June. Terming the initiative as “Peedit Kisan-Majdoor Bachao Muhim” (Save indebted farmers-labourer initiative), Khaira made a fervent appeal to Punjabi NRIs to come forward and help the aggrieved families with an open heart."
Rajya Sabha passes Bill to resolve NPAs,"Sanjeev Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 10

The Rajya Sabha today passed the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2017 which aims to empower the Reserve Bank to direct banks to initiate insolvency proceedings in large NPA cases. The Bill, which amends the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, will replace the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017. The Lok Sabha had passed the Bill earlier. Speaking in the debate on the Bill, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the banking system is being impacted by the rising non-performing assets (NPAs) and its capacity to lend to small investors and support growth and jobs is being impacted. He said the amendment to the Banking Regulation will address the issue of big defaulters who are leaning on the argument that where are the takers for the assets and treat it as a compulsion for the banks. He said as insolvency proceedings are initiated in large projects, management can change hands and investments will be made which will ensure that the asset does not get rusted, the company continues to function and jobs and the bank loan is protected. As of March this year, the total NPAs of public sector banks is to the tune of Rs 6.41 lakh crore and if the stressed assets are added, the figure is Rs 8.28 lakh crore. The Finance Minister said the government had even explored the option of asking PSU companies to takeover some of the NPA assets in various sectors which the companies declined. He added that this is one move that has shaken the defaulters. Some defaulters are now running after the banks to reach some compromise. Jaitley said the initiation of insolvency proceedings in big cases will lead to an administrator being appointed following which asset reconstruction companies, fund and even domestic companies may be willing to take over the management which will ensure that the banks are paid. This measure is bound to lead to displacement of managements in defaulting companies, he added.As of March this year, the total NPAs of public sector banks is to the tune of Rs 6.41 lakh crore and if the stressed assets are added, the figure is Rs 8.28 lakh crore."

"Faces covered, they appeared nervous","Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

Hiding their face, the two accused entered the courtroom amid tight security arrangements. Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala kept his face covered with a handkerchief even inside the courtroom. The only time he removed his handkerchief was when the Judge asked him about his name and address. His friend Ashish Kumar, too, kept his face covered with his hands inside the courtroom. While being escorted out of the courtroom, the two did not interact with the media. The youths appeared tense and nervous in the courtroom. The District Courts in Sector 43, Chandigarh, were abuzz with activity since morning. Electronic media vans were seen stationed outside the court complex since 8.30 am. Around 2.20 pm, the police brought the two accused to the court complex. In an attempt to give mediapersons the slip, the police took the entrance gate where hardly any journalist was present. The mediapersons kept waiting for the accused at the other gate where there was a huge security cordon. The security scenario can be gauged from the fact that three DSPs — Deepak Yadav, Kewal Krishan and Satish Kumar — and four inspectors, besides other policemen were present when the accused were produced before the court. The courtroom was jampacked with advocates, mediapersons and others."
Just another dazzler,"MOVIE REVIEW - VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS

Johnson Thomas

The comic book ‘Valerian et Laureline’ created by Pierre Christin and drawn by Jean-Claude Mezieres( all of 21 volumes from 1967 to 2010), gets a cinematic lifeline in Luc Besson’s ‘Valerian and The City of a Thousand Planets.’ This one is obviously one of many more to come and it’s a dazzler no doubt.

Set in the 28th century, year 2550, way beyond anything imagined so far, in a sort of going beyond Star Wars effort, Besson pulls out all the stops to showcase a vigorously vibrant and colourful world of ideas that unfortunately don’t go any further than the pages it once enhanced.

The minister of defense(Herbie Hancock) commissions two special operatives Valerian(Dane DeHaan) and Laureline(Cara Delevingne), for a intergalactic intelligence mission to save Alpha- a multi-cultural, multi racial metropolis invaded by a dark force that threatens to destroy the peaceful city and the entire universe in the bargain. It’s always the same load of crap in different forms I guess.

This is Besson’s show-piece effort and he is obviously in show-off mode trying to outdo every great sci-fi filmmaker history has known. And in tech-smarts with millions of dollars at his command, he certainly makes his mark. It’s the narrative impetuosity that puts paid to any deeper affect though.

The movie experience is not all that satisfying. For one, the lead cast, 20 something lean and skilled, brown and blonde haired duo, don’t even look remotely like the more mature black haired he-man and luscious red head duo depicted in the comic book.

Also, the narrative goes all over the place trying to outdo every sci-fi actioner seen before – so what you get is largely a mish-mash of genre types. It is appealing nevertheless, for its exquisitely enticing CGI and motion capture incandescence. There’s beauty in the visuals but the impact is immediate, not long lasting.

This overly ornate sci-fi attempt does manage to create some interest with its entertaining dialogues and the sparkling chemistry between its leads. The romance between them in fact has more lasting power than the hi-tech glitz on show here. The special effects overshadow every other aspect of the film including story, plot and performances.

Rihanna gets an eye-popping cameo that lasts much longer than necessary and there are amiable characters galore that catch the eye but fail to stay memorable. In fact most of the talent on show here have little to do other than mark their presence in a possible franchise overture. At 137 minutes, it’s also a little too long in the tooth to be consistently sufferable.

The tech hi-jinks may herald Besson as the next big thing on the sci-fi horizon but the lack of soul in the presentation of it is terribly belittling. This is a classic case of arrested evolution...what a pity!"
Sentinels of Singapore,"Among the elaborate funerary paraphernalia at the Bukit Brown cemetery are statues of Sikhs, standing guard at some Chinese graves

Vandana Aggarwal

In the heart of Singapore lies Bukit Brown, a cemetery home to more than one lakh Chinese graves. The area is overgrown, and at first glance, it looks like any old Chinese cemetery with its horseshoe-shaped graves, elaborate funerary paraphernalia and tomb guards. Look again, and you will notice that statues of Sikhs stand guard at some of the tombs! The Sikhs, like other Indian communities, had made their presence felt in Singapore quite early. However, it was after the Anglo-Sikh wars of the 19th century that the British sat up and took notice of the military capabilities and bravery of the Sikhs. The first Sikh police contingent arrived in Singapore in 1881. A British recruitment handbook referred to them as being “fairly incorruptible”, and “good policemen.” Many of them took up private employment after completing their tenure with the government. Impressed by their masculine personality and bravery, the prosperous Chinese businessmen started employing Sikhs at their houses and businesses. Soon, they became an important part of their lives thanks to their honesty, hard work and loyalty. They are locally referred to as ‘jagas’ (Malay for guards), a word that undoubtedly owes its origins to the Punjabi word ‘jaga’ or ‘staying awake’. Old timers in Singapore nostalgically remember the kind-hearted, burly Sikh guards sitting in front of banks and offices on their charpoys. The Sikhs built a formidable reputation of being reliable protectors of life and property. The Chinese, who strongly believed in an afterlife, at some point decided that it would be a good idea to have the Sikh guards protecting them after their deaths as well.

Guarding the dead

The Bukit Brown cemetery was established in 1922. So far nearly 30 pairs of Sikh guards have been discovered there. These range from around 3 feet to 5 feet 8 inches in height. These stand in pairs, erect, holding guns by their sides and very often carry a kirpan too. Every curl of their beard, fold of their turban and wrinkle in their shirt is carefully carved out giving them a realistic, life-like appearance. Some of the guards look older; they have a slight slouch, a visible paunch and gentleness in their eyes. Others have an imposing appearance, with piercing eyes and are smartly dressed with carefully tied turbans, ammunition belts and police boots. There is no evidence that these beautiful statues were made in Singapore. These were probably imported from China with the rest of the tomb decorations. It is a mystery how the carvers were able to carve the likeness of the guards. Either these were sent sketches to help them or they modelled them after the Sikh policemen who had already made their way to Shanghai and other parts of China as policemen. Traditional Chinese medicine physician Chew Geok Long’s tomb, with its accompanying Sikh guards, is well maintained and the guards are brightly painted. These guards are dressed in military uniforms, and apart from the gun, also have a majestic ceremonial sword at their waist. These sentinels of a lost world replace the Chinese door gods, who guarded the tombs and ward off evil spirits. A few guards have ‘foo dogs’ — mythical Chinese guard dogs — standing beside them showcasing an interesting amalgamation of Chinese and Indian cultures. The features of some are distinctly Chinese!

A page forgotten

Sadly Bukit Brown was largely forgotten for decades having been closed in 1973. Nature then took over the graves, enveloping anything and everything in its embrace. In 2012, the government of Singapore announced plans to redevelop Bukit Brown into a housing estate and build a road through it. That was when Singaporeans, once again, took notice of this cultural heritage. The ‘brownies’ is a group of dedicated volunteers, who have worked tirelessly to make more people aware of the rich heritage at Bukit Brown. Peter Pak has discovered and extensively photographed and recorded these guards for the past six years. In his blog, “Rojak Librarian,” he states, “these Sikh guards are representative of a unique period of time when Singapore was a colony of the invincible British Empire.” When news about the presence of these statues came to public notice, Ishvinder Singh (30), a third-generation Sikh in Singapore, was taken by surprise. As a practicing Sikh, Bukit Brown meant a lot to him as he was at that time grappling with a desire to know more about his roots. He, along with researcher Vithya Subramaniam, decided to work on a Sikh heritage trail app. Vithya focused on research and content and Singh on technology. The app was launched in 2015. His aim was twofold — to make the Sikh youth proud of being Sikhs and to raise an awareness of their shared immigrant heritage.

A heritage conserved

At least one pair of Sikh guards, along with the tomb, which they were guarding, has been removed to make way for the proposed road. It is, however, being preserved as an important part of Singapore’s heritage by the National Heritage Board. Many of these statues are not easy to find and are hidden in the dense undergrowth. Closer inspection has shown that not all guards are Sikhs as some do not have facial hair. They have been exposed to the elements for decades and due to a lack of maintenance, many of them have been knocked down at an angle or have trees enveloping them. Human and nature notwithstanding, these Sikh guards are not giving up the job that was assigned to them and continue to stand tall, reminding us of how our forefathers travelled to faraway places and made a name and place for themselves in different parts of the world."
Mukund speaks up against racial abuse,"New Delhi, August 10

Sinquefield Cup: Anand beats Nepomniachtchi, in joint lead

India cricketer Abhinav Mukund, it seems, has been facing racial abuse for some time. In an emotional outburst on his Twitter page, the left-handed opener said that he had been at the receiving end of insults and ridicule for his skin tone. And just to make sure that the needle of suspicion didn’t point towards his teammates, Mukund made it clear that the post had nothing to do with any member of the Indian team. The post, Mukund wrote, was in response to some messages targeting his skin tone on social media. “I am writing not to garner sympathy or attention but with the hope to change the mindset of people on an issue I feel strongly about. I have been travelling a lot within and outside our country since I was 15. Ever since I was young, people’s obsession with my skin colour has always been a mystery to me,” his statement, posted on Wednesday night, read. “Anyone who follows cricket would understand the obvious. I have played and trained day in and day out in the sun and not even once have I regretted the fact that I have tanned or lost a couple of shades. “It is simply because I love what I do and I have been able to achieve certain things only because I have spent hours outdoors. I come from Chennai, one of the hottest places in the country and I have gladly spent most of my adult life in the cricket ground.” Further, the 27-year-old said that he had been subjected to this abuse for long and it wasn’t stopping. “I have been subjected to a lot of name calling and I have laughed and shrugged it off because I had bigger goals! I toughened up because this was never something that would pull me down. “There were many times when I chose not to dignify these insults with responses. Today I am speaking up not just for me but for many who experience ridicule based on the colour of one’s skin. Obviously with the rise of social media, it has gone to such magnitude that I see people hurling abuses left, right and centre at something I have absolutely no control over! “Fair is not the only lovely or handsome guys! Stay true, stay focussed and be comfortable in your own skin,” he concluded. — PTIViswanathan Anand defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia in the seventh round to jump to the joint top position in the Sinquefield Cup. The second straight victory with white pieces took Anand to 4.5 points from seven rounds and with just two rounds remaining in the super tournament, the Indian ace now shares the lead with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France and Levon Aronian of Armenia. It was a customary Sicilian Najdorf by Nepomniachtchi and Anand went for a popular system he has been employing recently. The middle game gave a slight advantage to Anand but it proved to be optical as the game progressed. After the trading of queens, the position simplified further to a rook and minor piece endgame. Nepomniachtchi had a major lapse in concentration as he gave a pawn and then followed it up with another erroneous move. “He just seemed to fall apart,” said Anand as Nepomniachtchi, visibly angry with himself, left the hall after the game that lasted 40 moves. — PTI"
"The Tribune: Delhi, NCR news","NEW DELHI:Issues of pending mohalla clinics' expansion and giving weight to guest teachers in recruitment in government schools pitted the AAP and Opposition BJP legislators against each other in the Delhi Assembly on Thursday.

New Delhi, August 10

Issues of pending mohalla clinics' expansion and giving weight to guest teachers in recruitment in government schools pitted the AAP and Opposition BJP legislators against each other in the Delhi Assembly on Thursday.

What tensed the atmosphere was the spat between the ruling benches and Opposition leaders prompting Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Health Minister Satyendra Jain to accuse the BJP-led Centre of “obstructing” the Delhi Government’s crucial projects.

Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel pulled up Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa for repeatedly interjecting Sisodia while he was throwing barbs at the Opposition for attacking the AAP government over the delay in regularisation of guest teachers.

“Our government is working and we are not indulging in eve-teasing and harassing girls on streets (in a veiled reference to the Chandigarh stalking case embroiling Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala’s son),” Sisodia said in the House.

Besides, the Shiromani Akali Dal leader, Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta alleged that the Kejriwal government is not serious in filling the vacancies of guest teachers in government schools and just blaming the Lt Governor.

Gupta questioned the August 7 advertisement issued by Delhi Subordinate Selection Board for 9138 vacancies of government school teachers, pointing out that around 17,858 guest teachers are left in the lurch as not only have they been disadvantaged by not considering their experience in new appointments but they are now expected to clear exam with young applicants.

“You (AAP government) had promised to regularise 17,858 teachers and do you think these teachers will fall under your formula. Teachers who were not allowed to take exams due to age will approach the court. The government must find out ways to absorb guest teachers,” said Gupta while asking the government to regularise guest teachers.

Referring to the recent advertisement of teachers’ appointment in government schools, Sisodia told the House, “In the new recruitment notice provision of age relaxation is there but we had also asked for giving weight to the experience of guest teachers that was rejected. We had sent the cabinet’s proposal on August 6, 2015. On March 30, 2016, the file was sent back with objection on weight in the light of Uma Devi judgement.”

Mohalla clinic proposal rocks the Assembly

The other issue that rocked the Assembly today was the pet project of the ruling party—mohalla clinics.

Both the AAP and the BJP sparred over the issue with Health Minister Satyendra Jain telling the House the file is stuck with the LG and Speaker Ram Niwas Goel going on to suggest to LoP Vijender Gupta that a five-member delegation comprising BJP and AAP legislators can meet the LG and request him to approve.

While ruling party legislators Rajesh Gupta and Ritu Raj expressed their anger on the need for the LG’s approval on setting up mohalla clinics, Rajouri Garden MLA Sirsa and Gupta criticised the AAP government over the issue.

Order on adulteration soon: Satyendra Jain

AAP legislator Jarnail Singh raised concerns over alleged adulteration in food served by many hotels and restaurants in the city. After the Speaker said a helpline service no (1800113921) should be displayed on the premises of every hotel and restaurant and in response, Jain said an order will be issued in this regard in every restaurant and hotels.

CoA raps Khanna for not submitting SGM’s minutes,"Sabi Hussain

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 10

The Indian cricket board (BCCI) hasn’t yet submitted the minutes of its July 26 Special General Meeting (SGM) to the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA). The board is duty-bound to provide the minutes to CoA. CoA wanted the minutes at the earliest to prepare its fifth status report, which it would be submitting to the three-judge bench of the SC ahead of the August 18 hearing. On Wednesday, when CoA and BCCI members met in the national capital, CoA chairman Vinod Rai was infuriated at the board’s latest dilly-dallying approach. Rai categorically told BCCI’s acting president CK Khanna to provide a copy of the minutes without any further delay, according to a BCCI office-bearer present at the meeting. However, a source said that Khanna isn’t signing the minutes since it has been prepared by BCCI’s acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary. According to some BCCI observers, Choudhary is enjoying a healthy working relationship with the CoA chairman, and Khanna doesn’t trust Choudhary anymore. “Rai prefers to talk to Choudhary on every BCCI matter, rather than calling up Khanna or treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry,” a BCCI insider said. “According to the audio recordings of the SGM made available to CoA, only three persons talked for the majority of the time – Choudhary, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Chaudhry. Khanna remained a mute spectator, therefore he didn’t want to be seen as a villain in the eyes of the Court that he didn’t oppose any of the BCCI’s decisions.”"

Jalandhar, August 10

Donning a white kurta pyjama, a pen in his pocket, an Urdu newspaper placed on the table to his left, which he just finished reading, Sardari Lal (85) says he only reads Urdu newspaper, the language which he learnt in Sialkot, now in Pakistan.

The mention of Sialkot suddenly brought back the memories of Partition. The pain from which he went through and the agony which he faced popped up in his mind and his relaxed demeanour suddenly vanished and sadness came to his eyes.

Lal, who is an ex-MC councilor, says he left Sialkot with his parents and uncles and experienced this tragedy at the tender age of 16.

“I can never forget that place where I was born and that moment when I left it, I was very young,” Lal says with a heavy voice.

After a small pause, he continues, “When we boarded a train from Pakistan and reached Badami Bagh of Lahore, the train was attacked by miscreants, but the military that was along with us guided us to safety.”

“And the moment the train crossed Wagah Border, people celebrated by shouting in happiness and hugging each other. We were happy that at least we were safe at that moment,” remembers Lal.

The journey after reaching here was also not so easy. Lal says when he reached Jalandhar, the name of the place was not even known to him.

“Asi ik desh to doosre desh aaye si, kuch nahee pata si ki kithe jana hai, kithe rehna hai, ki khana hai, oh time kadi nahee bhul sakda” (We had shifted from one country to another, we didn’t know where we were, where to stay and what to eat, I will never forget those times)

When they saw Indian flag

“We were made to stay in a camp where I remember that our nation’s flag and only one tent was installed,” said Lal. “We felt relaxed and confident to see our flag, but all the people were made to stay under one tent,” he smiles.

Sipping tea, Lal said they did not sleep for the whole time in the tent and they did not even eat.

“They used to give us chickpeas (“chane”) and we would run to eat.”

As he came out of the thinking mode, he said he felt that today’s generation would never understand the problems people had to face then. “You all are lucky that you are born in present times, only we know what we went through,” Lal says while keeping aside the cup of tea.

After living in camps in Burlton Park, he said that all people got shifted in the quarters in Bhargo Camp that were especially got built by the government for the people who came here after Partition.

“They really came as a relief, and then I started my work here in 1950 of manufacturing surgical instruments, and things eventually fell in place,” he said.

From riches to rags

“Once I was coming back from work and found that an ice-cream vendor was arguing with a man who had stolen his spoon after eating the ice cream,” he said.

The man initially denied and afterwards, he accepted and cried that he had stolen the spoon. “Voh aadmi crorepati tha, yahan par ek chammach ke liye chori ki, ye alam tha us waqt,” says Lal before signing off."
Indian nun rescues Cameroonian sex slaves from Middle East,"Yaounde, August 10

A celebrated Indian nun who rescues Cameroonian women from slavery in the Middle East has called for greater support for victims to help them recover from the horrors of being drugged, raped and abused.

Sister Vanaja Jasphine says she has identified more than 200 women who have been trafficked from the central African nation and enslaved in the Middle East in recent years.

The 39-year-old nun last year helped to bring home 14 trafficking victims, whom she refers to as Cameroon’s “children”.

A rising number of African women are heading to the Middle East for domestic work, driven abroad by the lack of jobs at home, rights activists say. Yet many have their passports confiscated and end up trapped in modern-day slavery.

“One woman was thrown from the balcony of a two-storey building by her employer after she accidentally burnt her boss’s shirt whilst ironing,” Jasphine said of a victim in Kuwait.

Others are drugged and turned into sex slaves — being raped multiple times a day and even forced to have sex with animals.

“They come home with a lot of trauma,” Jasphine, coordinator of the Justice and Peace Commission of Kumbo, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a seminary in the capital Yaounde.

“Sometimes, a (woman forced to be a) sex worker can be exploited 15 times a day — physically, mentally, she’s drained ... she’s gone,” added the nun, who moved to northwest Cameroon almost a decade ago to work with the country’s poorest.

“In the end, she doesn’t have anything. She comes back in the same dress she left in.”

Jasphine was hailed in June as one of eight global heroes in the fight against trafficking at the launch of the United States’ annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which grades countries on their efforts to stamp out modern-day slavery.

But Jasphine has no time for celebrations.

She is too busy seeking funding, counselling and support for victims left traumatised by their ordeal abroad.

Traffickers change tactics

Jasphine says she identifies trafficking victims by working with activists, community leaders and civil society groups.

To raise awareness about their plight, she has helped organise demonstrations, where women have marched with placards reading: ‘Bring back our suffering daughters’.

“We got a lot of support from the people,” said Jasphine.

“It touches every heart because they (the people) feel: ‘It’s my own child who is affected, who is exploited’.” She has also lobbied government officials, all the way to the country’s Prime Minister, to do more to help the women.

Cameroon has made strides towards meeting the US minimum standards to end trafficking, having provided services to some victims and sent a delegation to the Middle East to discuss Cameroonian workers’ rights, the 2017 TIP report said.

Yet the state has not funded repatriation for slavery victims stranded in the Middle East, and continues to rely on civil society groups to bring trafficking cases to its attention and provide most services for victims, the report said.

The government has tried to crack down on Cameroonians travelling to the Middle East, but traffickers have changed tactics, and are instead flying women via Nigeria, Jasphine said.

She said the government must now do more to help those coming home.

Although her organisation and other groups try to help victims get back on their feet, take them to hospital and provide counselling, it is simply not enough, the nun warned.

“It is very disheartening,” Jasphine said, showing a series of distressed text messages from one of the women she helped to rescue from Kuwait, who is now struggling financially.

N Korea details Guam strike plan,"Four missiles to fly over Japan, land 30-40 km from US Pacific territory: KCNA

Seoul/Guam, August 10

Guam’s residents concerned but have faith in US military

The tiny US territory of Guam feels a strong sense of patriotism and confidence in the American military, which has an enormous presence on the Pacific island. But residents are increasingly worried over Washington's escalating war of words with North Korea

Like other US territories, Guam has a sometimes complicated relationship with the US mainland but many across the island say despite the threats and concerns they feel reassured and protected by the military especially in times of tense, geopolitical sparring

About 160,000 people live on the island, which extends about 19.31 km at its widest. The American military presence on Guam consists of two bases, Andersen Air Force Base in the north and Naval Base Guam in the south, which are home to 7,000 US troops

North Korea dismissed warnings by US President Donald Trump that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States and outlined detailed plans on Thursday for a missile strike near the US Pacific territory of Guam. Experts in South Korea said the plans unveiled by the reclusive North ratcheted up risks significantly, since Washington was likely to view any missile aimed at its territory as a provocation, even if launched as a test. North Korea’s apparently rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the US mainland has fuelled tensions that erupted into a war of words between Washington and Pyongyang this week, unnerving regional powers and global investors. World stocks fell for a third day, with shares in Seoul slumping to a seven-week low, after North Korea said it was finalising plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land 30-40 km from Guam, adding detail to a plan first announced on Wednesday. Guam, a tropical island more than 3,000 km to the southeast of North Korea, is home to about 163,000 people and a US Navy installation that includes a submarine squadron, a Coast Guard group and an air base. As announced by North Korea, the planned path of the missiles would cross some of the world’s busiest sea and air traffic routes. The North Korean army would complete its plans in mid-August, ready for leader Kim Jong Un’s order, state-run KCNA news agency reported, citing General Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Force of the Korean People’s Army. “The Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA (Korean People’s Army) will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi Prefectures of Japan,” the report said. “They will fly 3,356.7 km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30 to 40 km away from Guam.” While North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States and its allies, the report was unusual in its detail. It follows two successful tests of an intercontinental missile by the isolated state in July and a series of other missile tests. “Even if the North’s missiles do not hit the ocean territory of Guam, the US will not tolerate such a provocation because it is a severe threat to its national security,” said Cha Do-hyeogn, visiting researcher at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. Major airlines that fly over the region however said they had so far made no plans to change flight paths. — Reuters"

Thumb rules for investment,"Anil Chopra

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment. However, there are certain fundamental principles of investing which are universally applicable to “one and all”. These principles are also referred as “Thumb Rules” in general parlance. We are sharing below certain thumb rules which must be kept in mind before making investment/financial decisions.Your monthly savings must be at least 30% of your take home salary/income. Take home salary is computed as net salary after statutory deductions like provident fund and TDS etc. For example, if your gross monthly income is Rs 1 lakh and your take home salary after tax/PF is Rs 70,000 then you must save at least Rs 21,000 every month for investing in your medium to long term goals.

Savings account

Not more than two times of your monthly household budget expenses. If your household expenses budget is Rs 50,000 pm, you should not keep more than Rs 1 lakh balance in your savings account. Please remember that generally savings bank accounts earn interest @ 4% pa and that is not enough even to beat inflation.

Investment in gold

Ideal allocation to gold is around 10% of your financial portfolio. Financial portfolio includes bank balance, fixed deposits, post office schemes, mutual funds, bonds, shares and stocks etc. Accordingly, if your financial portfolio (without adding the value of house) is Rs 1 crore, maximum exposure to gold including Gold Mutual Fund or Gold ETF should be Rs 10 lakh. If your investment in gold is less than 10% of your financial portfolio, you may invest in Gold ETF or Gold Mutual Funds rather than buying physical gold which carries risk of being stolen. On the other hand, if your current investment is higher than 10% of your financial portfolio, then at least do not make any fresh investment in gold until your financial portfolio grows and exposure to gold comes down to around 10%.

Allocation to equity

Thumb rule for investing in equity is “100 minus your age” should be the allocation to equity. For example, if your age is 30 years, you may invest up to 70% (100 – 30) of your savings into equity through Equity Mutual Fund Schemes of reputed Asset Management Companies. Similarly, if your current age is 60 years, you should not invest more than 40% (100–60) of your savings in equity-oriented schemes. As your age continues to grow, you should reduce your exposure to equity.

Debt schemes

As already mentioned, around 10% should be invested in gold, 100 minus your age should be invested in equity and balance should be invested in debt schemes like PPF, debt mutual funds, FMP, bonds, bank deposits etc. For example, if your current age is 50 years then you should invest 50% in equity (100–50), 10% in gold and balance 40% in various debt instruments.

Life insurance coverage

The thumb rule for life insurance coverage amount is at least seven times of your annual income. If your annual salary package is Rs 15 lakh, you must have “sum assured” of at least Rs 1 crore in one or more life insurance plans, including term plan, ULIPs and traditional plans.

Health insurance

For single individual, with no dependents, health insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh is enough. However, for any couple with or without kids, health insurance coverage should be for minimum Rs 5 lakh and if your old parents are also alive and dependent on you then you must take a family floater plan of Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual funds

If your monthly savings is Rs 10,000, you must have minimum two SIPs of Rs 5,000 each. One in large cap and another mid cap. If your monthly savings is Rs 25,000, you should have five SIPs of Rs 5,000 each out of which two should be large cap, one mid cap, one flexi cap and the last one can be in sectoral SIP like banking or infrastructure etc.

Portfolio review

The thumb rule for reviewing the portfolio is once every three months if your portfolio is larger than Rs 50 lakh and at least twice a year if your portfolio is less than Rs 50 lakh. Above thumb rules are shared for reference purpose only and to ensure that you should not go “off course” in your journey of wealth creation and achievement of your financial goals. You must consult a certified financial planner or a subject matter expert for taking important financial decisions. The writer is Group Director, Bajaj Capital.

"Facebook rolls out video shows, in new challenge","San Francisco, August 10

Facebook is rolling out a new video service offering professionally produced shows in a challenge to rivals such as YouTube, and potentially to streaming providers like Netflix.

The Facebook service called Watch will include a range of shows, from reality to comedy to live sports, the social network said in its announcement late yesterday.

The new platform offers an opportunity for social interactions via the Facebook community of some two billion users.

It will be ""a place where you can discover shows your friends are watching and follow your favorite shows and creators so you don't miss any episodes,"" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said.

""You'll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.""

Facebook has funded some of the creators to get the service going.

The launch shows include blogger Nusseir Yassin's ""Nas Daily"", which includes videos together with his fans from around the world, and another hosted by author and motivational speaker Gabby Bernstein.

The service will also include a weekly Major League Baseball game.

""Watch is comprised of shows, a new type of video on Facebook,"" said Nick Grudin, Facebook's vice president of media partnerships, in a blog post.

""Shows are made up of episodes — live or recorded — that follow a consistent theme or storyline... Our goal is for Watch to be a platform for all creators and publishers to find an audience, build a community of passionate fans, and earn money for their work.""

Initially, Watch will be available to a limited group of Facebook users in the United States and more widely to US users in the coming weeks, Facebook, said.

Over time, creators will be able to monetize their shows through ""ad breaks,"" according to Facebook.

The launch is a limited move into scripted and professional video but puts Facebook on a course to challenge Google-owned YouTube, and possibly other streaming services if it gains a wider audience.

""In general, the model here feels very YouTube-like, with a subscription model, though Facebook's apps for TV platforms in recent months have signaled the broad structure and interface, with a combination of videos recommended or liked by friends, things you've saved, things that are popular on the platform, and so on,"" said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.

A meeting best forgotten,"MOVIE REVIEW - JAB HARRY MET SEJAL

Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering.

Australian scientists make breakthrough over miscarriage prevention,"Sydney

Australian researchers have discovered a dietary supplement which can prevent miscarriages, and many different types of birth defects for pregnant women.

The discovery, announced on Thursday at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, said that the common supplement Niacin, known as Vitamin B3, can cure molecular deficiencies that cause birth defects and miscarriages in women, reports Xinhua news agency.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Until now, the cause of 80 per cent of birth defects had remained unknown to scientists, but with this discovery, pregnant women around the world will now be able to prevent many common abnormalities such as cleft palate, kidney, heart, and spinal issues.

The lead scientist who made this remarkable discovery, professor Sally Dunwoodie, told Xinhua that she never believed that she would be able to make such an important difference, and that this would now lead to new opportunities to improve the lives of women around the world.

The discovery showed that a major cause was a deficiency of a vital molecule known as NAD, which is important for normal development of organs.

To make NAD, vitamin B3 is necessary, and the vitamin is found in most meats and green vegetables, even in one of Australia's most famous exports, Vegemite.

Studies have shown however that by the third trimester of pregnancy, 60 per cent of women are deficient in their vitamin B3 levels, and as such need to complement their diet with additional supplements.

The Executive Director of the Victor Chang Institute Robert Graham said that women need to be taking vitamin B3 well before they decide to get pregnant.

""This will change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,"" Graham said.

""We believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country's greatest medical discoveries. It's extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventative solution at the same time,"" he added.

Class-IX boy leaves home to finish 'Blue Whale' challenge; rescued,"Pune, August 11

A 14-year-old boy from Solapur, who was on his way to Pune to complete a task given to him in the online game 'Blue Whale Challenge', was rescued by the police. The district police yesterday intercepted a Pune-bound state transport bus in which the teenager was travelling, near Bhigwan on an information given by their Solapur counterparts. ""As soon as we were informed by our counterparts in Solapur, we intercepted the bus and rescued the boy, who was on his way to complete a task given by the Blue Whale Challenge game,"" a Bhigwan police station officer said. He said the boy appeared ""lost"" and was silent when the police took him with them. ""The boy's businessman father came to the police station and took him home,"" the officer said. According to him, the Class IX student was addicted to the game, where a player is given different tasks by his handlers. ""After the boy went missing, his parents started inquiring with his friends when they came to know that he was playing the 'Blue Whale Challenge',"" the official said. The online game, which originated in Russia, starts by asking participants via social media to take self-harming tasks. A 14-year-old boy from Mumbai had recently ended his life by jumping off a building and the police are probing if the incident was linked to the Blue Whale suicide challenge. —PTI"
"Kohli, Ashwin endorse Mukund’s strong stand on racial abuse","India players, including captain Virat Kohli, on Thursday backed their teammate Abhinav Mukund’s strong stand against racial abuse.

“Very well said Abhinav,” tweeted Kohli.

Mukund had posted a compelling message against racial abuse on social media, saying that he has himself been at the receiving end of insults and ridicule for his skin tone.

Not just Kohli, Mukund’s view was endorsed by Ravichandran Ashwin and Hardik Pandya.

“Read and learn, don’t make it a headline cos its someone’s emotion,” wrote Ashwin.

Even badminton player Jwala Gutta showed her support after reading Mukund’s statement.

Mukund, who featured in the first Test against Sri Lanka in the ongoing series and scored 81 in the second innings, expressed his disappointment at some of messages sent to him targetting his skin tone.

The left-handed Tamil Nadu batsman, however, made it clear that his statement had nothing to do with any member of the Indian cricket team. — PTI"

Tips for becoming a co-applicant in home loan,"Ravindra Rao

A home is the most popular, and will be the most enduring of all earthly establishments, said the late great American magician, Channing Pollock, about his abode. A home is perhaps the most prized possession for most of us and aspirational in every sense; the best address, important neighbours and all facilities that we would ever need in life. That costs a small fortune in many Indian cities but if you have a robust source of income and an impressive credit score, such dreams can be realised without much strain. However, for those who do not fulfil the income criteria for a substantial loan, a simple way to hone your overall financial prowess is to borrow jointly with your spouse or someone who can be designated as a co-borrower. Let’s understand the basics of this advantageous concept.A co-borrower can be an immediate family member, salaried or self-employed, who is an Indian or even an NRI. Depending on their discretion, lending institutions can allow up to six co-applicants which may include spouse, siblings and blood relatives like parents. Nevertheless, married couples get the highest preference as banks even assign a longer loan repayment tenure subject to the retirement age of the older applicant.Prospects of a bigger loan at a better rate brighten when an applicant adds co-applicants with a good credit score and an independent income source. It helps lenders consider the joint income of the applicants to assess their repayment capacity. But banks may insist that all co-owners of the property must be the co-applicants as well.A joint home loan bestows tax deduction benefits for both co-applicants separately, provided they are co-owners of the property and each of them is contributing to the home loan repayment. As per existing provisions, principal repayments are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act for up to a maximum limit of Rs 1.50 lakh. In the case of interest payments, there is a tax deduction available under Section 24 up to Rs 2 lakh if the property is self-occupied (If the property is let out, then the entire interest becomes eligible for tax deduction). For a joint home loan, this takes the combined limit to Rs 3 lakh under Section 80C and Rs 4 lakh under Section 24(b) – which helps reduce a significant burden on the family.

Advantage for married applicants

Few important tips can enhance the overall benefit to married applicants. A couple must mutually work out the ownership share between themselves as co-borrowers to optimise tax benefits; either this can be in the ratio of 50:50 for claiming deductions in equal proportion or 60:40 or 70:30 depending on which co-borrower falls into what tax bracket – if he or she has a higher income, a bigger share of the property can help avail greater benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit given to each co-applicant would be in proportion to their contribution in repayment of principal and interest. Thus, it is even possible for co-applicants to decide how much tax benefit they would want, and at what proportion, each applicant would pay. In case of a woman applicant, many lenders would provide a differentiated interest rate - usually a few basis points below the normal home loan rates. For this, the applicant must be the sole or joint owner of the property and an applicant or co-applicant for the home loan. Joint home loan applicants can make payments from a single or joint account by way of cheques or ECS. Some institutions even allow co-borrowers to share the number of EMIs between them, depending on which they could decide the number of EMI cheques to be issued by each applicant. One borrower can pay all instalments while the other can refund his or her share by way of cheque or fund transfer to that account.A key factor that decides one’s loan eligibility is the credit worthiness of borrowers. When one applies for a loan or credit, a lender seeks the individual’s credit risk, evaluated by a credit score maintained by agencies. A credit report is the holistic sum of the applicant’s financial dealings in every sphere of life, interpreted as a number that is critical for getting not just loans or other means of credit, but even to qualify for them (banks can judge not just the applicant’s primary eligibility but even his/her ability and propensity to repay). It is prudent to keep a check on the credit report/credit score of an applicant as well as a co-applicant; as lower scores could impact one’s chances of obtaining finance for a home.Besides home loan documents, individual details such as KYC (proof of identity and address), income and property documents are required to avail the housing loan. Detailed documentation helps a lender to decide faster and beneficially in your favour. Income documents can be supported by other assets created by the applicants to show their prudent financial behaviour. Though there would be multiple borrowers, the documentation process for joint home loans remains much like that of individual home loans. Despite its enormous benefits, one may avoid applying for a joint home loan if the credit score of the co-owner is low due to a poor credit history or if he/she is already repaying an ongoing loan that has consumed maximum loan eligibility or if he/she is intending to buy a bigger property in the future for self-occupancy or if he/she is about to retire.

Managing loan and finances

A joint home loan is not only about saving in terms of principal and interest payment to a great extent, but also about sharing an honorable and real responsibility towards a home. Many couples would agree that such a joint move has instilled a sense of discipline – especially financial prudence – in them where both partners feel proud for contributing towards mutual benefit. Yet, one must not take hasty decisions in terms of finalising a house or taking a huge loan (it may turn out expensive over the tenure with fewer benefits). Couples must undertake basic financial planning before committing to a huge monthly payout which may hamstring regular needs or individual desire to acquire something personal. As TS Elliot said, “Home is where one starts from.” Home loan is where one could learn much from – as co-borrowers.

Trading curbs stayed on Prakash Industries,"Mumbai, August 10

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today stayed trading restrictions imposed on JKumar Infraprojects and Prakash Industries, which are among the 331 suspected shell companies identified by the government. Markets regulator SEBI had asked the stock exchanges to restrict trading in shares of 331 “suspected shell companies”, some of which have investments by several well-known domestic and foreign investors. The move came after the watchdog received the list of such companies from the corporate affairs ministry and many of the 331 firms are under the scanner of the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and the Income Tax Department. JKumar Infraprojects and Prakash Industries had moved the SAT against the SEBI directions. Following their appeals, the SAT has stayed the trading restrictions imposed on the two companies and these shares can resume normal trading tomorrow. On August 8, many of the companies tagged annual reports and other financials along with their filings to press upon the exchanges that they are not shell companies and are in compliance with all regulations. Out of the 331 companies on the list, more than 160 are actively traded shares on the exchanges. — PTI

Amritsar, August 10

They were classmates in 1930s. Hailing from well-off families, they studied, played and enjoyed together in Zafarwal tehsil of Narowal district, now in Pakistan, but the Partition in 1947 left them tormented as the families of both had to flee the then newly-formed State — Pakistan, leaving behind their properties and business. Now, well settled in Amritsar, Krishan Lal Mahajan and Ishar Das sit together and discuss their childhood days.

Krishan Lal Mahajan is now 87. He says he visits in his dreams his native village — Bara Pind Jagpal — in Pakistan. “Those memories are still vivid. I remember all streets, fields and shops of Bara Pind Jagpal a village in Zafarwal tehsil of Narowal district (then in Gurdasur) even after 70 years,” he says. But, he has never made any effort to visit his native place.

His friend Ishar Das (85) of Gandot village of the same tehsil has visited his village twice after the Partition, in 1965 and 1971 after wars between India and Pakistan as the area the Indian Army had occupied included his village as well. Ishar Das says he has made several attempts to visit Lahore but succeeded once.

Mahajan and Das, who were class-fellows in their childhood, had left their school when they were in sixth standard. After 70 years of Partition, they often sit on a bench outside a barber shop at Katra Bagian and talk for hours about their childhood, the Partition, politics and the struggles they have faced.

They hold a grudge against politicians who were responsible for the Partition of India as that dreadful event in 1947 left their families moneyless, who were moneylenders. For survival, they had to do petty jobs and low profile trades.

“In 1946, I had shifted to Lahore and got recruited in the Indian Railways as an operator. My father was a diesel pump operator. We had a good life and our future was bright but the Partition took away everything. I sold watermelons on roadsides for survival,” says Krishan Lal Mahajan.

Mahajan says he doesn’t have a sound knowledge about the politics and freedom struggle. “I used to listen a slogans in my village and nearby towns — Lal Quila Se Ayi Awaz, Dhillon-Sehgal-Sahnwaz (Indian National Army heroes),” he recalls.

Ishar Das (85) says his jovial nature is the reason behind his fitness. Recalling his past, he says, “My family struggled a lot for survival after the Partition, but I tackled the problems with a smiling face. My father was a moneylender in Gandot village. We were leading a royal-type life. We had a buffalo and a horse for ride. Though I wasn’t aware what was happening around, it was on August 15 when Station House Officer Kamaldeen from the Zafarwal police station came to our village riding his horse and addressed villagers at the village chowk. He requested Hindu families to leave the village with their valuables as communal violence had broken out in Lahore and Sialkot. The border was just two kilometres away from our village. We packed our luggage and left.”

“We never thought that the border line drawn by the then leaders will remain forever. My mother used to say that we will go back our village. We stayed in Pathankot for one year and then shifted to Amritsar,” he says.

During the 1965 war, Das read in newspapers that the Army had occupied the Zafarwal tehsil of Pakistan, so he took this opportunity to visit his village. The inhabitants of the village had been evacuated by the Pakistani army. “I reached my home and found everything in good condition. I went to the rooftop of my house. Suddenly a security personnel turned up and questioned what I was doing there. I told him that it was my home but he didn’t believe. I had to convince him that I left this home 18 years ago,” he says.

He got his passport made and visited Lahore in 1967."
"The Tribune, Personal finance news","07 Aug 2017 | 1:22 AM

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment.

[ + read story ]

Anil Chopra

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment. However, there are certain fundamental principles of investing which are universally applicable to “one and all”. These principles are also referred as “Thumb Rules” in general parlance.

We are sharing below certain thumb rules which must be kept in mind before making investment/financial decisions.

How much should YOU save

Your monthly savings must be at least 30% of your take home salary/income. Take home salary is computed as net salary after statutory deductions like provident fund and TDS etc. For example, if your gross monthly income is Rs 1 lakh and your take home salary after tax/PF is Rs 70,000 then you must save at least Rs 21,000 every month for investing in your medium to long term goals.

Savings account

Not more than two times of your monthly household budget expenses. If your household expenses budget is Rs 50,000 pm, you should not keep more than Rs 1 lakh balance in your savings account. Please remember that generally savings bank accounts earn interest @ 4% pa and that is not enough even to beat inflation.

Investment in gold

Ideal allocation to gold is around 10% of your financial portfolio.

Financial portfolio includes bank balance, fixed deposits, post office schemes, mutual funds, bonds, shares and stocks etc.

Accordingly, if your financial portfolio (without adding the value of house) is Rs 1 crore, maximum exposure to gold including Gold Mutual Fund or Gold ETF should be Rs 10 lakh. If your investment in gold is less than 10% of your financial portfolio, you may invest in Gold ETF or Gold Mutual Funds rather than buying physical gold which carries risk of being stolen. On the other hand, if your current investment is higher than 10% of your financial portfolio, then at least do not make any fresh investment in gold until your financial portfolio grows and exposure to gold comes down to around 10%.

Allocation to equity

Thumb rule for investing in equity is “100 minus your age” should be the allocation to equity. For example, if your age is 30 years, you may invest up to 70% (100 – 30) of your savings into equity through Equity Mutual Fund Schemes of reputed Asset Management Companies.

Similarly, if your current age is 60 years, you should not invest more than 40% (100–60) of your savings in equity-oriented schemes. As your age continues to grow, you should reduce your exposure to equity.

Debt schemes

As already mentioned, around 10% should be invested in gold, 100 minus your age should be invested in equity and balance should be invested in debt schemes like PPF, debt mutual funds, FMP, bonds, bank deposits etc. For example, if your current age is 50 years then you should invest 50% in equity (100–50), 10% in gold and balance 40% in various debt instruments.

Life insurance coverage

The thumb rule for life insurance coverage amount is at least seven times of your annual income. If your annual salary package is Rs 15 lakh, you must have “sum assured” of at least Rs 1 crore in one or more life insurance plans, including term plan, ULIPs and traditional plans.

Health insurance

For single individual, with no dependents, health insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh is enough. However, for any couple with or without kids, health insurance coverage should be for minimum Rs 5 lakh and if your old parents are also alive and dependent on you then you must take a family floater plan of Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual funds

If your monthly savings is Rs 10,000, you must have minimum two SIPs of Rs 5,000 each. One in large cap and another mid cap. If your monthly savings is Rs 25,000, you should have five SIPs of Rs 5,000 each out of which two should be large cap, one mid cap, one flexi cap and the last one can be in sectoral SIP like banking or infrastructure etc.

Portfolio review

The thumb rule for reviewing the portfolio is once every three months if your portfolio is larger than Rs 50 lakh and at least twice a year if your portfolio is less than Rs 50 lakh.

Above thumb rules are shared for reference purpose only and to ensure that you should not go “off course” in your journey of wealth creation and achievement of your financial goals. You must consult a certified financial planner or a subject matter expert for taking important financial decisions.

"Gang of car thieves busted, 31 of 56 vehicles recovered","Our Correspondent

Fatehgarh Sahib, August 10 The district police claimed to have busted a 10-member interstate gang of car thieves and arrested four of them. They recovered 31 cars and SUVs worth Rs 3.5 crore from different parts of the state on their disclosure. They confessed to have stolen 56 vehicles. The police claimed it to be one of the biggest recoveries and with the arrest of six other members, more vehicles are likely to be recovered. The police said the role of insurance company officials was also under scanner. Addressing mediapersons, Patiala zone IG Amardeep Singh Rai and Fatehgarh Sahib SSP Alka Meena said CIA staff, Sirhind incharge, Harminder Singh got a tip-off that Balwinder Singh, alias Saba, of Amritsar, running a workshop at Faridkot, along with his accomplices had been involved in theft of cars. The IG said the police followed them and succeeded in arresting Balwinder along with his three accomplices on the Amritsar-Wagah border. The other three arrested are Simarjeet Singh and Sandeep Singh of Faridkot and Mandeep Singh of Amritsar. Narrating their modus operandi, the SSP said they used to enter the vehicle by breaking the rear windowpane and with the help of a software they used to corrupt the security system and used master keys to start the vehicle. After taking the vehicle to the workshop at Faridkot, they used to get the chassis, engine number and number plates of totally damaged accidental cars with the help of insurance officials and used in these cars. The gang members were helped by Monu of Chandigarh and Lalli and Kewal of Amritsar in selling the cars. One Ramjit, alias Ram, of Delhi is also the mastermind of the gang."
Invest in NHAI bonds to save capital gain tax,"TAX ADVICE SC VASUDEVA

Invest in NHAI bonds to save capital gain tax

My father-in-law retired from Indian Railways in 1978 and settled at Darapur village which is in close proximity to Tanda town, a sub-tehsil of Hoshiarpur district. He bought a 10-marla agriculture land in his own name and another 10 marla land in the name of his eldest of the three sons and built 816 sq ft house at a cost of Rs 4.5 lakh (approximately). [No records are available]. He kept on improving the property but again records are not available. The land was purchased at a total cost of Rs 16,500 in February 1979 [registered deed is available] . He expired in April 2017, leaving a will for this property in the name of his three sons with equal share for each. This property has now been sold by his sons in May 2017 at a total price of Rs 46 lakh. Three brothers have decided to share proceeds of Rs 42 lakh equally among themselves and all four real sisters at Rs 6 lakh each. Rs 1 lakh will be donated to gurdwara as per will of the deceased and Rs 3 lakh have been spent on his last rites. In this connection following clarifications are requested: 1. Is any tax payable for sale of property and if so, how much? 2. How much tax is payable by each of the three sons and each of four daughters even though the will is in favour of three sons only. 3. If tax is payable then can it be avoided by any means or measures? 4. Even though the property has been sold by three sons, the purchaser has been asked to transfer Rs 6 lakh directly to accounts of each sister. Is this in order or some measures need to be taken to regularise the payments. — Rajinder Saini Replies to your queries which are given under are based on the presumption that the agricultural land bought by your father was situated within 8 km of Tanda town and therefore is to be considered as a ‘capital asset’. Further, as the capital asset has been transferred in May 2017, the reply given hereunder is based on the amended provisions of the Act. a) Section 48 of the Act provides that for the purpose of computing capital gain on the transfer of a capital asset, cost of the capital asset and cost of any improvement thereon, shall be deducted from the consideration received or receivable on the transfer of such capital asset. It has also been provided in Section 55 of the Act that in case the capital asset has been purchased before 1.4.2001, the assessee has an option to adopt fair market value of the asset as on 1.4.2001 and such fair market value of the capital asset shall be indexed by giving a benefit of cost inflation index so as to ascertain the cost deductible for the purposes of computing the amount of capital gain. The amount of fair market value as on 1.4.2001 should be much more as compared to the cost of the land in 1979. It will therefore be desirable to obtain a valuation certificate from an approved valuer for ascertaining such fair market value. The amount of capital gain has not been computed as the fair market value as on 1.4.2001 has not been indicated in the query. It may be added that each of the sons would be liable to pay income-tax on their share (i.e. 1/3rd) of the amount of long-term capital gain arising on the transfer of the property. b) No tax will be payable by daughters of the deceased as the amount received by them would be treated as a gift by the brothers. c) Tax on the amount of capital gain could have been saved provided each of the sons had utilised their share of the long-term capital gain towards buying tax-saving bonds issued by National Highways Authority of India or Rural Electrification Corporation Limited within six months of the date of transfer. Alternatively, each one of them could have saved the amount of tax, if the amount of long-term capital gain had been utilised for purchase or construction of a residential house individually or jointly by them. The purchase of such residential house should have been made within one year before or two years after the transfer of the property. The construction of residential house should have been effected within three years after the date of the transfer of the property. d) The payment of Rs 6 lakh directly to the daughters of the deceased would not make any difference with regard to taxability of the amount of capital gain."
Harassment of girls: Panel report in 6 days,"Our Correspondent

Kullu, August 10

Nand Lal Sharma, Principal, Government Degree College, Kullu, said a committee had been formed after a written complaint was received from four girls against a female professor today. He said the committee would submit its report within six days and would forward it to the higher authorities for further action. He added that a preliminary report and information about the issue had already been sent to the authorities. Four girl students of the college had approached the police on Tuesday to complain against a female professor for allegedly harassing them to take back an earlier complaint against her husband. The girls had given a complaint to the college management in September last year and alleged that a professor used to engage in obscene talks with them and caused them mental harassment. The professor was transferred in December to some other college after a probe was conducted by a committee. However, his wife assumed the charge in February this year at Kullu College. The principal said disciplinary action was underway against the professor after the complaints from the girls were received last year and chargesheet of the case had already been submitted to the higher authorities. He added that the girls did not approach the college management and directly went to the police. He further added that internal investigation in both the matters was underway. Meanwhile, the telephonic conversation of alleged professor with a girl had gone viral on social media. The students have demanded suspension of both professors and sought quick justice to prevent further abuse by the alleged accused. Kullu SP Shalini Agnihotri said the police had already registered a case at the women police station and was carrying out further investigations. She added that statements of both the alleged accused would be registered by the police under this case."
"The Tribune, Business news","NEW DELHI: Flipkart has raised an estimated $2.5 billion from SoftBank Vision Fund, making the fund created by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank one of the biggest shareholders of India’s largest e-commerce player.

New Delhi, August 10

Flipkart has raised an estimated $2.5 billion from SoftBank Vision Fund, making the fund created by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank one of the biggest shareholders of India’s largest e-commerce player.

“This is the biggest ever private investment in an Indian technology company,” Flipkart said without disclosing the sum invested.

The investment will make the $100 billion Vision Fund one of the largest shareholders in Flipkart, the e-tailer said.

People familiar with the deal said the investment is worth $2.5 billion, with about $1.5 billion being directly funneled into Flipkart and $1 billion for part of Tiger Global Management’s stake.

The SoftBank Vision Fund, the world’s largest technology-focused fund, will get about 20% stake in Flipkart, they said.

The investment, which comes less than two weeks after Snapdeal dropped merger talks with its bigger rival, will swell Flipkart’s cash holdings to more than $4 billion. Snapdeal is backed by SoftBank.

The investment is part of the financing round announced in April this year where Tiger Global-backed Flipkart had raised $1.4 billion from Tencent, Microsoft and eBay. At that time, Flipkart was valued at $11.6 billion. With the latest funding, Flipkart is estimated to have raised well over $5 billion to date.

For Flipkart, the funding provides it with more arsenal to compete with Amazon. The two companies have been locked in an intense battle for leadership in the burgeoning Indian e-commerce market.

“India has a thriving internet market with close to 500 million internet users and as per market research, the Indian e-commerce market is expected to grow at a five-year CAGR in excess of 30%,” the statement said.

The funding round further solidifies Flipkart’s balance sheet and will help accelerate investment in driving continued market leadership, it added.

Amazon and Flipkart have been pumping in millions of dollars to strengthen infrastructure as well as bring more sellers and buyers online.

While Flipkart has now raised close to $4 billion this year, Amazon pumped in about $600 million across various units in India since January this year.

“This is a monumental deal for Flipkart and India. Very few economies globally attract such overwhelming interest from top-tier investors,” Flipkart co-founders Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal said.

Masayoshi Son, founder, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, said India is a land of vast opportunity. “We want to support innovative companies that are clear winners in India because they are best positioned to leverage technology and help people lead better lives. As the pioneers in Indian e-commerce, Flipkart is doing that every day,” he added. — PTI"
Imprisoned in paradise,"BOOK REVIEW: POST-TRUTH: BEHOLD, I SHINE BY FRENY MANECKSHA.

Sumayyah Qureshi

Women and children are the silent sufferers in any conflict. They are usually the major war casualties, sometimes behind the scenes. In Kashmir, which has seen endless violence over the decades, perpetrated by both, the militants and the security apparatus, women and children have had to suffer immensely — denting their emotional, mental and physical well-being. In the book, the author, Freny Manecksha, quotes from Habba Khatun's verses, who was a mystic wanderer and Kashmir's most loved poetess. Manecksha draws a comparison between the peaceful times that prevailed during Habba Khatun's life and at the present times. ""There lives a time when groups of girls could pick chinar leaves and twist them into ornaments, or walk into forests to collect firewood, or celebrate the coming of spring in badamwaris."" Kashmir has come a long way from the times of Habba Khatun. Its women have been robbed off the freedom to live a carefree life that Habba Khatun saw and described in her verses. That idyllic life is a thing of the past now. There are many dangers, numerous threats, there are no more safe places under the chinar trees or in the forests, where women once collected firewood. The spring in badamwari comes and goes, patiently awaiting the revellers that once visited. It is all suffused with a dogged sombreness that looks difficult to shake off. As jackboots become as ubiquitous as chinars, Kashmiri women have felt the shrinking of spaces and curtailment of freedom. They feel gagged in their own land. The author talks about militarisation and how it has affected the overall quality of life of women. She has spoken to many Kashmiri women, including journalists, writers and human rights activists, to know what it means to live in the most militarised zone in the world. The scars that these women have beared are not visible to the eye but lie buried deep within, entrenched in their psyche, mostly festering, as the endless war that these women fight, with themselves and with the outside forces, continues. The usual narrative about the Kashmiri conflict has majorly revolved around the atrocities suffered by men. This book is among the few works that has taken up the cause of state's faceless, identity-less, oppressed women. It is a small yet significant contribution by Manecksha in which she has written about the sufferings of the women torn apart by conflict. Despite the odds, these women are picking up the threads of life and moving on with their battered lives. This work is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of Kashmiri women, to their resilience and perseverance and never-ending quest for truth and justice."
The Tribune: Movie Reviews,"Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering. So much so even the delectable song Hawayein written by Irshad Kaamil and composed by Pritam gets lost and can’t hold love in the air."
Game of addiction,"Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

Nonika Singh

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."
Facebook photos may help diagnose depression,"Washington

Your Facebook or Instagram photos could tell if you are depressed, thanks to scientists who have developed a new computer programme that could diagnose depression from social media posts better than doctors.

The programme could identify depressed people correctly 70 per cent of the time.

In comparison, previous research has shown that doctors can make a correct unassisted diagnosis of depression 42 per cent of the time.

""Our analysis of user accounts from a popular social media app revealed that photos posted by people diagnosed with depression tended to be darker in colour, received more comments from the community, were more likely to contain faces and less likely to have a filter applied,"" said Christopher Danforth, from the University of Vermont in the US.

""When they did select a filter they were more likely to use the filter that converted colour images to black and white. People diagnosed with depression also posted at a higher frequency compared to non-depressed individuals,"" said Danforth.

""With an increasing share of our social interactions happening online, the potential for algorithmic identification of early-warning signs for a host of mental and physical illnesses is enormous,"" he said.

""Imagine an app you can install on your phone that pings your doctor for a check-up when your behaviour changes for the worse, potentially before you even realise there is a problem,"" he added.

The researchers used the computer programme to analyse 43,950 photos, following recruitment of 166 users of a popular social media app, including 71 people that had a clinical diagnosis of depression.

The programme scoured the photos for details that were associated with healthy and depressed individuals.

This information was then used to see if the programme could predict who would go on to be diagnosed with depression by only looking at photos that were posted before their diagnosis.

""Although we had a relatively small sample size, we were able to reliably observe differences in features of social media posts between depressed and non-depressed individuals,"" said Andrew Reece from Harvard University in the US.

""Importantly, we also demonstrate that the markers of depression can be observed in posts made prior to the person receiving a clinical diagnosis of depression,"" Reece said.

The research was published in the journal EPJ Data Science. —PTI"
"Article 370 must go, harming state: BJP","Tribune News Service/PTI

Jammu, August 10

Blaming Article 370 of the Constitution for creation of a “separatist emotion”, the J&K unit of the BJP today said the time had come for the people of the state to say goodbye to it as well as Article 35A. Both these Articles, instead of being beneficial to the people of the state, have done a great damage and hamper the progress and development, claimed J&K BJP spokesperson Prof Virender Gupta. “The time has come when the people of J&K should say goodbye to Article 370 and ask the Central government to revoke Article 35A,” he said. “The prevailing situation in the Valley shows that Article 370 has created a separatist psyche and acts as a breeding ground for separatist emotion,” Gupta said. Article 370 grants special status to J&K while Article 35A, added to the Indian Constitution through a Presidential Order, empowers the J&K legislature to define the state’s “permanent residents” and their special rights and privileges. Article 35A has come under focus after two Kashmiri women approached the Supreme Court challenging it. They contended that it had disenfranchised their children. Moreover, the BJP is a part of the ruling alliance in J&K with the PDP. However the saffron party’s views on Article 370 and Article 35A appear at variance with its ally. At a recent event in Delhi, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had said if Article 35A was tinkered with, there would be no one in Kashmir to uphold the national flag. While Opposition National Conference (NC) has also spoken against any attempt to tamper with these provisions. However, according to the BJP spokesperson, Article 370 is responsible for keeping the settled issue of J&K alive and encourages the separatists and external forces to interfere in the internal matters of the country. He said Article 370 was increasing the alienation of the people of the Valley and in taking them away from the national mainstream. “The Kashmiri leadership for its own vested political interests always indulged in a competitive game to exploit the people in the name of Article 370,” Gupta alleged. The BJP spokesperson added that in spite of large-scale funding by the Centre, J&K had not been able to develop its own sustainable economy and remained underdeveloped and backward in many fields. Industrialists and business houses from outside hesitate to open ventures in the state and as a result, it is facing the crisis of unemployment and migration of skilled and talented youth to the rest of the country, he added. “Academicians and experts from the rest of the country are discouraged because of the Article to contribute in the educational growth of the state,” he claimed. Gupta alleged that Article 370 was also responsible for widening the mistrust and alienation between the people of the Valley and those of Jammu and Ladakh regions. He called upon the people of J&K to also look into the utility of Article 35A, claiming it was “most discriminatory” and differentiated between men and women with regard to their rights as citizen of the state. Significantly, in a surprise development on Tuesday, Chief Minister Mufti had gone to meet NC president Farooq Abdullah. After the meeting, sources in the NC had said legal challenge mounted on the validity of Article 35A of the Constitution was the main subject of discussion between the two leaders."
Interest can’t be as per bank’s whim,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

When I took a housing loan from my bank, I was told that I would be charged an interest of 8 per cent in the first year. The bank’s letter on the loan also made this clear and I chose this bank only because of this offer. However, the bank has charged me 9.25 per cent interest on the ground that it had made a mistake in calculating the interest rate and that the actual rate of interest was 9.25 per cent. My question is: Can a bank charge more than the rate of interest mentioned in the loan agreement? The manager says that there was a delay in getting the communication from the head office on the interest rate and that’s how the mistake happened.

In this age of electronic communication, this explanation is hard to believe. In any case, the bank cannot go back on the terms of the contract. If it has made a mistake, then it has to take responsibility for it. It cannot alter the terms of the contract signed with you. So tell the bank to refund with interest, the excess amount charged from you.

I have spoken to the manager many a times and have also complained in writing. However, the bank is not willing to make amends. What is my option now and how do I go about it?

Please write to the nodal officer of the bank. He should be able to resolve this issue immediately. If he fails to do that, I would suggest that you lodge a complaint with the banking ombudsman. You can get the contact details of the ombudsman from the bank itself. Even otherwise, the website of the Reserve Bank of India gives you the contact details of the ombudsmen in the country. The procedure is simple and you can file your complaint online. Just make sure that you send a copy or image of the loan agreement and your account details showing deduction of the loan amount.

Let me quote, for your benefit, two somewhat similar cases decided by the banking ombudsman and reported in the latest annual report of the banking ombudsman scheme. In the first case, the complainant had taken a home loan at 8.50 per cent interest per annum, to be reset every five years from the date of disbursement of the first instalment. However, after the first year, the rate of interest was changed to 9.50 per cent and then modified to 10 per cent and 12.20 per cent by the bank, without even informing the consumer. When asked about it, the bank said that the rate of interest was actually 9.25 per cent, to be reset every five years. However, in the letter given to the customer, the bank had erroneously indicated the rate of interest as 8.50 per cent and had collected the instalments at that rate for one year. It was, therefore, recovering the interest due from the customer as per the actual rate of 9.25 per cent!

The ombudsman directed the bank to calculate interest at the rate mentioned in the agreement, i.e. 8.50 per cent, for five years and refund the excess amount charged from the customer.

In another complaint, a state government entity deposited Rs 8.10 crore as fixed deposit for 90 days, on the basis of the bank’s offer of 8.8 per cent interest and 1 per cent penalty for premature withdrawal. Due to some exigency, the entity had to withdraw the money before the completion of 90 days. However, when it did so, the bank charged a penalty of 2 cent for premature closure. Here again, the bank’s justification was that it had erroneously quoted one per cent as penalty in the offer document because of a clerical error!

The banking ombudsman observed that the complainant had asked for a quotation from the bank before placing the funds in a fixed deposit. And after mentioning the penalty as one per cent in that quotation, the bank cannot revise the penalty rate. The bank was advised to calculate the penalty for premature closure of FD at one per cent and refund the excess amount deducted, along with savings bank (SB) rate of interest, calculated from the date of deduction till the date of refund."
Modi heaps praise on outgoing V-P Ansari,"Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 10 Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined Leader of the House Arun Jaitley, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, former PM Manmohan Singh and other members in bidding a fond farewell to Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari whose tenure as Vice-President ended today. Lauding him for upholding Constitutional norms and sharing nostalgic moments with him, many members also made references to his passion for sports, especially cricket. Significantly, the PM, while noting the illustrious family history of Ansari in the public life, did not fail to mention his association to the Congress and the Khilafat Movement. ""His nana ji (maternal grandfather) and dada ji (paternal grandfather) were presidents of a national party,” he said. Modi said Ansari’s experience as a career diplomat would have helped him in conducting the business of the Upper House. I have also benefited immensely from Ansari's insights on diplomatic issues on several occasions, he added, while wishing him all the best for the future. “Dealing with political fraternity must be a different experience for you, a smiling Jaitley said bidding farewell to Ansari. The Chairman’s job is a thankless job. Your tenure may have seen disturbances but has also seen a very high quality of debate, he said. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hailed his contribution in the House and said the country keeps on progressing despite challenges largely because of people like him. Describing him as a friend, philosopher and guide, Singh said he received maximum possible guidance and cooperation from the outgoing Chairman."
Israel making underground wall to block ‘attack tunnels’,"Jerusalem, August 10

The 2-year project

The wall, comprising concrete planks and sensors, will stretch some 64 km and is expected to be some 20 ft high and 40 m deep and cost around $834 million

The wall will be built parallel to the border fence sealing off the Palestinian enclave run by Islamist movement Hamas and is expected to be complete in two years

The project comes after the government faced criticism over a vast network of tunnels built by Hamas under the Gaza border, which it used in the 2014 war.

Israel is pushing ahead with a project to build a giant underground wall around the Gaza Strip to block tunnels that could be used for attacks, the army said today. The project comes after the government faced heavy criticism over Hamas’s use of tunnels in the 2014 Gaza war, with a state inquiry earlier this year accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and army top brass of being unprepared for the threat. “In the coming months, we are going to accelerate the construction of the barrier. We hope that construction will be complete in two years,” Major General Eyal Zamir said. Construction Minister Yoav Galant said the wall will be built in Israeli territory parallel to the border fence sealing off the Palestinian enclave run by Islamist movement Hamas. “The fact that the work will be located in our sovereign territory rules out any justification for attacks against those working there,” Galant said. — AFP"

They were demanding a complete loan waiver and revision of crop prices. The protest was part of their “jail bharo” agitation. The dharna made the movement of police and public difficult. The police heaved a sigh of relief only after the protestors left the place, but with a warning to return on Friday morning. Members of four organisations – BKU (Kadian), BKU (Sidhupur), Pagri Sambhal Jatta and Doaba Sangarsh Committee — participated in the dharna. The farmers also demanded Rs 5,000 per acre as compensation for compliance of stubble burning ban. They also raised the problem of stray animals which is another big challenge to the already “distressed” peasantry in the state. The government was collecting a huge amount in the name of cow cess, but the instead of taking care of stray cattle, the government has left it to farmers to tackle the problem, alleged Pritam Singh, a leader of BKU (Sidhupur)."
Three suspected Khalistani militants arrested in MP,"Were part of terror module run from Canada: Police

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

The Punjab Police’s State Special Operations Cell arrested three alleged Khalistani militants from Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh) last night. A police spokesperson said the militants were part of a terror module run by Canada-based Gurjeet Cheema, who had supplied them arms and other logistic support. Those arrested have been identified as Balkar Singh, Balwinder Singh and Satinder Singh Rawat. They were residing in villages of Gwalior. The spokesperson said the arrests were made with the help of the Madhya Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad in follow-up operations after the arrest of Maan Singh of Gurdaspur and Sher Singh of Jalandhar on May 21 by the Punjab Police. A large consignment of arms and ammunition, sent by the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), had been recovered from them. The police said the Gwalior module was working on the directions of Lakhbir Singh Rode, Pakistan-based chief of the ISYF. The police said Cheema, who belongs to Jogi Cheema village in Gurdaspur, was now based in Brampton, Ontario (Canada). His module was allegedly supplying weapons to terror suspects in Punjab. Three pistols, supplied by the arrested trio, were earlier recovered from Maan Singh, Gurpreet Singh alias Peet and Simarjit Singh alias Nikka. Meanwhile, Balkar, Balwinder and Satinder were produced before the Duty Magistrate at Ajnala in Amritsar district today. They were remand in police custody till August 16."

Harish Khare

Seventy years later we imitate Pakistan

Harish Khare

Seventy years ago, two nations were created in the Indian sub-continent. A new nation, Pakistan, was carved out; this 'moth-eaten' new nation was to be home to the Muslims of the British India. A truncated India became the successor state to the British imperial order, its pretensions, its institutions, its boundaries and its flawed control model. The grand hope was that after these cartographic rearrangements in the East and the West, the two new states and their newly endowed citizens would rediscover the joys of civilizational co-existence. That hope got definitely belied by all the bloodshed, dislocation, riots, violence, massacres that attended the Partition. Seventy years later the two nations are yet to find a modus vivendi to live in benign comfort with each other. In 1971, India helped Pakistan’s eastern wing to discover its separate national identity; consequently, Pakistan became a much more compact nation. It is much more a natural state today than it was before 1971. And, it now has a huge historic grievance against India to sustain its national narrative; it continues to define itself as a nation — internally and externally — in hostile terms towards India. For seventy years, we in India had permitted ourselves a glorious air of grand superiority over Pakistan. As long as Jawaharlal Nehru lived, his aura, political legitimacy, global stature, mass popularity and dedicated leadership gave us in India a new sense of collective equanimity. We were imaginatively engaged in creating a new India, building its new “temples” and inculcating a scientific temper in this ancient land of medieval superstition and ignorance. For seventy years, or most part of it, we could legitimately assure ourselves that we were better than Pakistan. We have had a Constitution and its elaborate arrangements; we were a democracy and held free and fair elections to choose our rulers; we had devised a dignified political culture of peaceful transfer of power among winners and losers after each election at the Centre and in the States; we had committed ourselves to egalitarian social objectives; we were determined not to be a theocratic State; we were proudly secular and we put in place procedures and laws to treat our religious and linguistic minorities respectfully; we had leaders who drew their legitimacy and authority from popular mandates; our armed forces stayed in the barracks; we had a free and robust judiciary; a mere high court judge in Allahabad could unseat a powerful prime minister. And, when a regime tried to usurp the democratic arrangement, the citizens threw the offending rulers out at the first opportunity. For seventy years, we had every reason to believe that we were superior to Pakistan. Above all, we were not Pakistan. In recent decades, we became even more smug about our superiority as we have unthinkingly bought into the Western narrative that Pakistan was a “failing state” or a “failed state” — that too with nuclear weapons. What we have failed to appreciate is that Pakistani elites, too, have devised a working political culture best suited to its genius. Pakistani elites are not untroubled by inequities and inequalities in the land. We may bemoan that the Army has emerged as the senior partner in the Islamabad-Rawalpindi axis; nonetheless, it is a state that remains unwavered in its animosity towards us but still runs a coherent foreign policy and maintains internal order. Its elites have perfected the art of taking the Western leaders for a ride and have seen off super-powers' intervention in neighbouring Afghanistan. There is a certain kind of stability in Pakistan's perennial instability. Seventy years later we in India find ourselves itching to move towards a Pakistani model, notwithstanding our extensive paraphernalia of so many constitutional institutions of accountability. In recent years, we no longer wish to define ourselves as a secular nation; our dominant political establishment is exhorting us to shed our ‘secular’ diffidence and to begin taking pride in us being a Hindu rashtra. Just as in Pakistan, the dominant religion has come to intrude and influence the working of most of our institutions. For seventy years our political class looked down upon Pakistan for its inability to keep its Generals in their place. Seventy years on, we are ready to ape those despised “Pakis.” Our Army was never so visible or as voluble as it is now; our armed forces are no longer just the authorised guardians of our national integrity, they are also being designated as the last bulwark of nationalism. Consequently, as in Pakistan, we no longer allow any critical evaluation of anything associated with the armed forces. Those who do not agree with the armed forces’ performance or profile stand automatically denounced as ‘anti-national.’ What is more, we are thoughtlessly injecting violence and its authorised wielders as instruments of a promised renaissance. Seventy years later, we are cheerfully debunking all those great patriots and towering leaders who once mesmerised the world in the 20th century world and who were a source of our national pride and who had forged an inclusive political community across the land by instilling in us virtues of civic togetherness. As Pakistan has done, we too now seek national glory and garv from re-writing our history books to cater to our religious prejudices. Just as Pakistan has institutionalized discrimination, we too are manufacturing a 'new normal' in which it is deemed normal and natural to show the minorities their place at the back of the room. Seventy years later, the most complex legacy of the Partition — Kashmir — remains unresolved. It continues to bleed both Pakistan and India, financially, politically and spiritually. All these years we had allowed ourselves to believe that for Pakistani elites the Kashmir dispute provides a dubious platform of a meretricious coherence; not to be left behind, we in India are increasingly content to use the Kashmir problem to help us redefine the content and contours of our edgy and brittle nationalism. Worse, Kashmir continues to take a toll on our collective sensitivities. As a nation, we are getting comfortable in the use of violence and coercion to resolve differences at home and abroad. Seventy years ago we were determined to be different from Pakistan; seventy years later we are unwittingly beginning to look like Pakistan. Mohammed Ali Jinnah must be permitting himself a crack of a smile at our unseemly hurry to move away from Jawaharlal Nehru and his founding legacy."
Draped in past & present,"Designers Shyamal & Bhumika, who debuted at FDCI’s India Couture Week, share their creative canvas

Swati Rai

When couture took over the ramp in the Capital recently, one label had to leave a mark. This season was Shyamal & Bhumika’s first at FDCI’s India Couture Week. A drift from the usual cheer at the event, they brought in muted colours. Champagne gold, ruby red, emerald green, coral blue and crimson swayed the ramp. Moving away from traditional flavour, their designs were contemporary this time. And well, it turned a glamorous affair.

The Gujarat-based couple established the brand in 2003. Across the years, it has come to know for their designs that seek inspiration in the rich Indian heritage and history. The two use precious crafts and techniques of the country to create couture collections relevant to modern-day sensibilities.

Bhumika’s passion for textiles and fashion led her to study fashion design at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) whereas Shyamal researched fashion in Milan and London. This disparate design training and fashion exposure honed their design sensibility. “It gave me a completely different perspective and helped add an international view point of fashion to our work. It led to the birth of what we call our global line, which is designed by keeping in mind the current global influences, trends and a very modern aesthetic,” says Shyamal.

Architectural grandeurs of their ancestral homes to personal travels and tales that they grew up listening to, all find expression in their mood boards, sketches and, finally, the ramp. Their sartorial map remains faithful to its vision of ‘India to the World’, their tagline. They use fashion as a medium to connect global audiences through the rich and glorious crafts and artisan techniques of India.

But there is a question that bothers us again and again: Is it not a disadvantage to live away from the fashion hubs of India? Shaymal says that from marketing and networking point of view, it might not be a good idea to stay in Gujarat. However, he feels this distance gives them as “an opportunity to be away from commercial pressures and influences and work in peace.”

“Also, when you are away, your roots and influences are different and your collections look unique. However, we do have a store in Mumbai and retail points in Delhi. So, we are very accessible to everyone. The constraint of not being in the fashion capital helped us adopt social media early on and led us to being one of the most followed south Asian designers on Facebook,” he smiles.

The Princess’ Soiree, the collection showcased at ICW, is an extension of the common thread binding their collections form the past — that of a grand and royal, yet contemporary lexicon. With this, they carry forward their earlier collections like The Royal Procession, Shaahi Baug, etc.

The Princess’s Soiree centres around a well-heeled and well-travelled woman of the present with roots in the past. The story is about her travels from India to Europe and back and her various inspirations en route. The new collection draws from the ancestral stories of their family from the late 1800s. But, it also features European details, Victorian inspirations and Baroque decorations amalgamated with rich Indian heritage. So, what you see on the ramp are floor sweeping gowns, sheer tulle capes, ruffled blouses, supple frills, belted waists, kalidaar jackets and lehengas. Fluid beadwork, dripping gold embroidery in floral setting and luscious gold thread work is immaculately incorporated. The cascading ruffles sprinkled with glitter, twirling tulle skirts and magnanimous gowns with winding floral thread work transcend you to a fantasy like ambience.

Amidst all this experimentation, one mulls if at a time when plus size fashion and ageless fashion is taking over sartorial discussions, do they see their collection breaking stereotypes… Shyamal and Bhumika say, “Style is more important than just blindly aping fashion trends.” No wonder then that their team is trained to customise couture for a global clientele with very specific requests and multiple size specifications, suiting different age groups as well as altering the outfit to meet different religious customs.

The designers also intend taking the crafts of India to a global clientele. “We have been successful in doing it over the internet and the next step would naturally be a network of international retail points to cater to this global following,” says Bhumika. In the near future, they swear to breaking away from the conventional and inch towards pastels such as forest green or English green, shades of red, intricate handwork and a subtle play of sheer. Take the hint."
Buxar DM found dead on rail tracks in Ghaziabad,"Tribune News Service

Ghaziabad (UP), August 11

The body of Buxar district magistrate Mukesh Pandey was on Thursday found near the railway tracks here, police said.

His body was found from the rail tracks about one km from the Ghaziabad railway station, they said, adding a purported suicide note was also recovered from the spot.

In the note, it was written that Pandey, a 2012-batch IAS officer, was fed up with his life and lost his ""belief on human existence"".

""I am committing suicide in district centre area of Janakpuri in west Delhi...by jumping off the 10th floor of the building. I am fed up with life and my belief on human existence has gone, my suicide note is kept in a Nike bag in room 742 of a five-star (name withheld) hotel in Delhi. I am sorry, I love you all! Please forgive me,"" said the note, according to Senior Superintendent of Police H N Singh.

Singh said it was not immediately known that at what time or how Pandey committed suicide.

The SSP added that the post mortem would be conducted today.

Officials of the Government Railway Police (GRP) who reached the spot, near Kotgaon here, said prime facie it appeared a case of suicide.

Senior officials of Ghaziabad district administration also reached the spot.

Meanwhile, a senior Delhi Police official said that police received information from his friends that Pandey would commit suicide and had gone to a west Delhi mall.

A police team was immediately rushed to the mall but it could not trace him.

After scanning the CCTV footage, it was found that he was leaving the mall and going towards the nearby metro station, the official said, adding on analysis of CCTV footage there, he could not be traced.

Later, the Delhi Police learnt that he had committed suicide, the official said.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar condoled the death of the IAS officer.

""He was a capable administrator and a sensitive officer. May god bless his soul,"" he said in a tweet. —with PTI inputs"
No axe to grind with India: Chinese navy,"Says Indian Ocean 'vast region', anticipates more cooperation with Indian Navy

Sandeep Dikshit

While the confrontation with the Chinese army has entered into the second month, leading to hot words in Beijing, its navy says it has no axe to grind with India because the Indian Ocean is a “vast region”. At the sprawling base of the South China Sea Fleet in this hot and humid south China port city, its officers said they anticipated more cooperation with the Indian Navy in cleansing the oceans of drug running, piracy and arms trafficking. Addressing a concern in India over China rapidly inducting aircraft carriers in its armada, Chinese naval officers sought to be conciliatory. “The number of aircraft carriers is not critical. Our role in China’s National Defence Policy is defensive. We will never intrude into other countries, nor will we endure obstruction by other countries,” said Capt He Luyang. “All our major weapon systems are not toys,” interjected his colleague. This is the first time Indian journalists were given monitored access to the sword arm of the Chinese navy.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

It is South China Fleet’s ships and submarines that cause consternation in India when they make restocking pauses at Colombo and Karachi on way to anti-piracy duties in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. But Capt Hu feels the Indian media overreacts to the docking of Chinese submarines in nearby countries. Their movement does not compare to manoeuvres of the US navy destroyers near the tightly contested islands of South China Sea. Capt Hu drew attention to a vital difference. Chinese ships transit through international navigation areas, not in the waters of “your country”. But US battleships come inside the 12 nautical mile (nm) boundary of islands claimed by China. “It will be different if our ships do that. It is all right for the US navy to go through SCS but we won't tolerate their crossing of the red line of 12 nm,” he emphasised. Equipped with bombers, submarines — both nuclear and conventional — besides UAVs, destroyers and reconnaissance planes, the Indian Navy is keenly tracking this fleet’s expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean."

Bathinda, August 10

Days, months and years have passed but memories of her native place Jalalabad in Multan district, Pakistan, refuses to fade away for 81-year-old Shanti Devi, also known as Dyali Bai, a resident of Partap Nagar.

“It was like I needed wings to fly to Jalalabad, my home, where I spent my childhood like a princess,” said Dyali Bai.

“In Jalalabad, we were living a royal and happy life but in one night, everything changed. The brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims seemed to have vanished. I couldn’t remember the date exactly as I was just 10-year-old at that time,” she said.

“I remember that my father’s friend Maulvi saved our family from the Muslim mob. The same night, they sent us to Multan on horseback and mules. At that time, my father did not have the idea that we would never come back again to our place. He realised it in Multan from the special trains that were plying to India,” added Dyali Bai.

“During the journey from Jalalabad to Multan, we saw a number of bodies lying near the Ravi river. My father was trying to assure me and my younger brother that nothing had happened. We were told that we were going to some relative’s house. We boarded a train from Multan and when we reached Kurukshetra, we saw a large number of people living in tents,” the octogenarian said.

Dyali Bai said her home was destroyed and within a few weeks, they were reduced to being paupers.

‘We didn’t have sleepers on our feet. We spent more than two years in camps at Kurukshetra. After that, the government allotted us land in Bhiwani. But it was not that easy as my father had to make a lot of efforts to get that small piece of land,” she said.

“I do not exactly remember the year in which I got married to a freedom fighter, the late Hari Chand, a resident of Kurukshetra. I may be 13 or 14-year-old at that time and he was around 20 to 21. Later, he got a job in the Railways at Bathinda and we started living here,” added Dyali Bai.

Today, she hates Pakistan and as she says they called them ‘kaafir’.

She admires India’s first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru for providing facilities to the people in Kurukshetra at the time of partition."
English teachers with poor Class X result to be trained,"SCERT seeks names from DEOs; 5-day course this month

Jhajjar, August 10

The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), Haryana, will impart special training to those teachers in English at government schools across the state which had recorded poor results in the matriculation examination in the 2016-17 academic session. Under the training programme, teachers would be given tips for improving their teaching skills for ensuring good results, educated about modern trends of classroom management and made aware of updates in the education system, sources said. The sources said the SCERT had recently sent to all District Education Officers (DEOs) a list of 120 government senior secondary schools statewide which had a dismal performance in English in the Class X examination. Several schools in the list had recorded a result of below 10 per cent. “Twenty government schools in Palwal, 13 in Bhiwani, 11 in Rohtak, nine in Fatehabad, eight each in Gurugram, Kaithal, Karnal and Mewat, six in Mahendragarh, four in Sonepat, three each in Jind, Yamunanagar and Sirsa, two each in Hisar, Jhajjar and Rewari and one each in Panchkula and Panipat have recorded a dismal showing in English in 2016-17,” stated the communiqué of the SCERT Director. The sources said DEOs had been directed to provide the names of teachers concerned by August 11 so that their training schedule could be finalised. The five-day residential training of teachers would be organised under the capacity building programme this month. Jhajjar DEO Satbir Siwach said they had sent the names of teachers concerned in the district to the SCERT for special training. “Such training is essential to improve the teaching methods of teachers so that they can improve results in future examinations,” he said.

How do we address Manish Malhotra? For, the introductions he doesn’t need any. Though they’d shuttle between B-town’s darling…poster boy of mainstream fashion and lately, Indian bride’s dream designer. Having fancied clothes, colours and films since childhood, he is living his B-town dream and as far as Bollywood is concerned, well, they are living him up too. “Ever since childhood at the age of 5 or 6, I have had a fascination for sketching and colours. I had an opinion on the colour of my mother’s saree. As for films, they are till today my best stress-buster.” The flair and passion more than made up for lack of education and even humble beginnings when he, “didn’t have the money to come up with a collection.”

He is ready for ‘n’ number of queries on his label, his inspiration, journey, Bollywood and anything in between. “It’s hot here,” he settles after felicitating students of INIFD and before his 45 minute lecture is to begin.

The signature Burberry check scarf comes out (this time, he’s wearing grey) though not the black blazer. “I always wear black because I feel it makes me look slimmer because I am always feeling fat; and checks because they give a masculine touch.”

It’s the busiest time, there is Lakme Fashion Week coming up in Mumbai next week. “But once I commit to something I fulfill it. You wouldn’t see me taking calls from office back in Mumbai or working on the collection. I’ll put in extra hours, but won’t neglect anything.”

Indian women going wrong?

“I think where Indian women go wrong the most is in overdoing things. There’s jewellery, costume, hair and make-up; everything going at the same time. For instance, if you are wearing a nice heavy necklace, keep the blouse or neckline simple and vice-versa.”

World of replicas

Once a collection is out there, it doesn’t take more than a week for the market to be flooded with ‘Manish Malhotra lehengas’. With everyone trying to do the same thing (sometimes the exact same thing); he does acknowledge and takes solace in the fact that imitation indeed is the best form of flattery! Having said that, “If it’s films that are being followed and copied, I can’t control that, but as a brand, we plan to take significant measures to tackle that.”

manpriya@tribunemail.com

Quick fire round

Whom does he admire for their style?

“Mr Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Rekhaji. In fact Rekha mam looks gorgeous. We go to the same gym and I tell her that even in gym clothes she looks gorgeous. I tell her, “See at 7 am in the morning also you look stunning. Among the younger lot, there’s Alia.”

What does he have to say about judgments passed on the basis of fashion, looks and styles?

It’s democracy. All I can say is that I have never made personal comments. If I want to say something like that, I have a way of saying it.

The year 2017 for Manish Malhotra is?

“Very hectic; there’s a period drama coming up starring Alia, Varun, Sridevi; and then Student of The Year 2. Also there are shows in Delhi, Kolkata and Dubai.”

A celebrity he’d like to dress up?

“I admire Sridevi because she believed in me when I was starting out and she was at the peak of her career. She and Rekha are the only people, I address as mam.”

His take on Chandigarh?

The special cell of the Delhi Police has arrested two men with suspected links to Al-Qaida in two separate cases, the police said today. Syed Mohammed Zishan Ali, suspected to be linked to the terror outfit, was arrested after being brought back from Saudi Arabia, while 25-year-old Raja-ul-Ahmed was detained last week following a tip-off from the West Bengal Police.A senior officer said Ahmed was arrested last week, but he did not give out details about the date or place of the arrest. Ahmed is suspected to be a member of the Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), linked to an Al-Qaida group in Bangladesh. Ali’s arrest is being seen as a major breakthrough for the security agencies as he may provide crucial information on the presence of the terror outfit in India. The arrest is crucial for furthering anti-terror efforts against AQIS (Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent), said DCP (Special Cell) Promod Singh Kushwah. Zishan, originally from Jamshedpur, operated from Saudi Arabia and had married the sister of Sabeel Ahmed, a cousin of Kafeel Ahmed, who masterminded the 2007 Glasgow international airport attack."

The Tricolour. That’s the first sight that awaits a visitor stepping out of the Srinagar airport. Riding high on a tall mast on the airport lawns, it somewhat dwarfs the images of the green and black flags raised at pro-freedom protests. It’s a rather comforting thought, despite the promise to keep behind all preconceptions on this four-day journey to experience the Valley in its various shades.

Day 1 (Friday), Dateline: Srinagar

Minutes later, moving towards the city, the taxi driver, a local, expectedly veered the conversation around violence, the innumerable restrictions and outsiders’ apprehensions — real and imaginary. The traffic was bare minimum, courtesy the Friday factor. Zipping along the Jhelum, the driver finally applied brakes to his chatter at the hotel resting near the river, with the trailing thought: peace through dialogue remains the destination of most Kashmiris. The wait is on.

The shades of this wait were only too visible at the Dal Lake, its placidness donning a sombre shroud with few appreciators in sight. Asif Khan, one of the many shikarawallahs wistfully awaiting customers, blamed the blankness around to the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims. When probed a little further, he vent out his anger on the government that was “doing nothing to resolve the Kashmir issue”. The wait for tourists, aman and azadi continues, he said, creating ripples in the still waters.

Postscript: Just five occupants at the hotel. A tip brought in three lovely roses from its lush garden to the room.

Day 2, Dateline: Central Kashmir

The ubiquitous wait wears a uniformed look for the soldiers tackling militants, both local and Pakistan nationals.

The run from Srinagar to Zojila passes through the heavily fortified central Kashmir towns of Ganderbal and Sonmarg. As the Amarnath yatris take this route to the Baltal camp, armed soldiers, alert to untowardness of any kind, can be seen stationed a few metres apart. Keeping endless vigil, they too appear to be players, howsoever different, in the waiting game.

“The security forces can keep the situation under control up to a certain level but beyond that the political set-up has to take over,” a top Army officer in the region summed up the lingering Kashmir crisis.

Despite the threat to even the seasonal multicultural plurality, the yatris’ enthusiasm has shown no dip. The fervour was evident too at the Pahalgam base camp in south Kashmir, which was toured the next day. The separatists may keep making loud proclamations about “Kashmiri hospitality” for “our yatri guests” but equally loud remain their frequent calls for shutdowns and “freedom”.

Postscript: Got little time to sit and stare on the Sonmarg meadows that are being overwhelmed by the surrounding construction activity.

Day 3, Dateline: South Kashmir

“I am confused. I want peace but I don’t know how it will come about. I have no faith in any of the mainstream parties. Yes, I am drawn towards the new militants surfacing on the social media. At least, they promise freedom…I live on that hope.” This outburst of a dryfruit-seller in Pampore reflects the angst of many Kashmiris and their disillusionment with political leaders. The outrage against the PDP, particularly for aligning with the rightist BJP, in its south Kashmir bastion is all too palpable.

PDP vice-president and Chief Minister’s Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni, who is one of the prime movers in the government, admitted some people were upset with their party but expressed confidence that they would come around. Hopeful of a dialogue, he placed implicit faith in the Central Government for resolving the Kashmir issue. The wait for the Modi government to take the initiative to understand and settle the Kashmir crisis hasn’t died, though some of the optimism has surely waned in the last three years.

In contrast, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has ruled out the possibility of a dialogue during the present situation. “The time is not conducive for talks,” he put it categorically, alluding to the unending violence.

This stance, however, doesn’t go down well with the majority in Kashmir who have been long waiting for a discourse. Prof Noor Ahmad Baba, a political expert, is of the view that Kashmir has gone restive waiting for the Central Government to at least acknowledge the problem as it exists. The signs of violence and terror in south Kashmir, the hub of militancy, are starkly visible along the Pampore-Pahalgam stretch. Just metres away from the highway at Pampore in Pulwama district stand the burnt and damaged Entrepreneurship Development Institute buildings that came under fidayeen attack twice over. A little ahead in Anantnag, comes the point where the pilgrim bus came under militant fire.

Crossing the vulnerable highway in south Kashmir, a thought creeps along: will the wait for peace remain just that. A wait. The disheartening thought, however, evaporates the minute you meet Amarnath yatra pilgrims at Pahalgam, the longer but less excruciating route to the shrine. Their enthusiasm and that of the hospitable locals around, allows faith to make way for hope again… hope for some resolution to this conflict.

The SSP at Anantnag, Altaf Khan, a counter-insurgency specialist, appeared confident about the militant count dipping significantly over the next six months. However, gullible youth turning to flashy new-age militants occupying the social media still remained a concern, he admitted while regretting the disappearance of the multi-cultural society from Kashmir. “I had 85 per cent Pandits in my class in Srinagar. The new generation hasn’t seen this plurality. Having grown up seeing only violence and mistrust, they know little of Kashmiriyat,” he asserts.

The Centre’s indecisiveness to boldly tackle the crisis, too, draws flak from some quarters. Another top cop from the region declared that the Modi government must take a decision, even if it is to bring the state fully under its control.

Postscript: The nun chai (salty tea) and flattened buns at a roadside bakery both freshened the mind and spirit.

Day 4, Dateline: North Kashmir

It was an exhilarating four-hour stretch from Srinagar to Aman Setu, the peace bridge connecting Uri with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Passing through Baramulla, the Jhelum snaked along one side and apple orchards dotted the green cover on the other.

At Aman Setu, the peace bus arrived with passengers, some returning to this side and others visiting from across the LoC. One thing they all had in common: a satiated look that comes with fulfilment of some kind. Grateful for this exchange, they gushed over the need for peace.

This wait continues, more so for the real stakeholders on the sidelines — the student who wants to attend school without fear, the soldier who hasn’t got leave to be home with his family, and the shikarawallah who wants to wind up the day with at least Rs 500 in his pocket.

Minutes after the arrival of the peace bus came the flash about shelling near Aman Setu. News from the Rajouri area had already come earlier in the day of a soldier and a six-year-old girl succumbing to heavy Pakistan shelling.

Heading back through a vulnerable area, the mind was blank, there was no room for fear or anxiety. All that it carried with it was the burden of the lives gone and the lives still struggling as the conflict and the wait lives on.

Postscript: On the return flight, a Kashmiri Pandit was sceptical about resolving the Kashmir crisis through dialogue. Minutes later, however, she said resignedly: “Probably, that’s the only way out.”"
Motorists stare at garbage on NH-9,"Dumping disrupts traffic on Delhi-Sirsa highway on outskirts of Hisar

Hisar, August 10

In a setback to the cleanliness campaign, motorists crossing Hisar can see garbage at the dumping station located on the outskirts of the town spilling to National Highway-9, the Delhi-Sirsa road. Traffic on the slip road is disrupted as almost half the stretch is covered by garbage, which is an invitation to stray cattle which feed on garbage. The presence of cattle also poses a threat to fast-moving traffic on the national highway. Officials of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) maintained that it was a serious matter which must be taken note of on an urgent basis. NHAI Project Director RK Rathee said he had spotted the garbage spilling on the road. “I will take up the matter with the Municipal Commissioner for taking urgent steps to remove the garbage from the road,” he said. Chief Sanitary Inspector Subhash Chander said garbage-carrying dumpers could not cover the entire distance to the dumping station during rain for unloading the garbage. “We have 19 acres for dumping at the site, of which three acres adjoining the highway has been given to the NHAI for widening the road,” he said. They had decided to engage a poplane machine to manage garbage at the site, he said. Rajesh Kumar, commuting from Fatehabad to Hisar, said an unbearable stench distracted commuters every time they reached the site. “The situation has been persisting for about two months. The garbage has now been scattered on the slip road, attracting stray cattle. I fear that it will spill to the main road in the next few days,” he said. The municipal corporation had planned to set up a solid waste management plant at some distance from the site, but non-procurement of land had been delaying the project, sources said."
"Rs 34,000-cr Aamby Valley to go under the hammer","SC rejects Sahara’s plea to put auction on hold

New Delhi, August 10

In a setback to Subrata Roy, the Supreme Court today turned down his plea to halt the process for auction of Sahara Group’s flagship property Aamby Valley by the official liquidator of the Bombay High Court. On behalf of Roy, senior counsel Kapil Sibal told a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra that Sahara was holding negotiations with a foreign company to sell 26% stake in Aamby Valley and requested it to put the auction process on hold. However, the Bench said it would stay the auction process only if Sahara deposited Rs 1,500 crore with SEBI in terms of its earlier order. The top court’s refusal to stay the process for auction of Aamby Valley – a Rs 34,000-crore real estate – means the liquidator can go ahead with the publication of auction notice on August 14. In a last ditch attempt to save Sahara group’s flagship property Aamby Valley in Pune district of Maharashtra from being disposed of, the company had on Wednesday moved the top court with a request to halt the entire process on the ground that the company was ready with a new payment plan. The Bench headed by Justice Misra had on July 25 asked Roy to deposit Rs 1,500 crore in the SEBI-Sahara account by September 7 and said it might consider his plea for grant of 18 months for complete repayment. Angry over non-payment of money, the top court had on April 17 decided to sell property worth Rs 34,000 crore belonging to the Sahara group in Maharashtra’s Aamby Valley and had sought Roy’s presence before it. During that hearing, Sibal had sought 18 months to deposit the over Rs 9,000 crore of the total Rs 24,000 crore investors’ money which was supposed to have been deposited by Sahara. He had also requested the court to allow the Sahara group companies to do business."

Sources said on Thursday night, a team of the UT police reconstructed the route on which the stalking incident took place. Vikas Barala was accompanying the police. The sources said the police and the accused stopped at the Sector 7 market. Barala was made to show the place where they had parked the SUV to drink beer. The accused was then taken on the route on which the victim was stalked.

Earlier, the police had reconstructed the route along with the complainant.

DGP TS Luthra visited the Sector 26 police station on Wednesday night to take stock of the investigation.

Varnika’s father Virender Kundu on Thursday visited the Sector 26 police station and met SSP Eish Singhal.

The police did not allow journalists to enter the police station. They were stopped at the main gate.

Vikas Barala (23), son of Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala, and his friend Ashish Kumar (27), who were arrested for a bid to abduct 29-year-old Varnika Kundu, denied the charges during interrogation. However, they admitted that it was their SUV after the police confronted them with CCTV footage. The two were arrested on the night intervening August 4 and 5 after they allegedly chased and tried to block the victim’s car with their SUV while she was heading home. Despite the victim’s statement to the police that an abduction attempt was made, the two were subsequently released on bail as they were charged under a bailable offence. Later, the abduction bid charge was added to the case following which they were arrested. Sources said during interrogation, the police confronted the two by showing them the CCTV footage gathered from various places, including a liquor shop from where they purchased a bottle of beer. The sources said the accused admitted that the vehicle in the CCTV footage was theirs. However, they denied the allegations. The footage of the liquor shop shows one of the accused walking out with a beer bottle around 11.20 pm on August 4. The police also have footage of the Sector 7 market where the accused parked their vehicle and had beer. It was from the Sector 7 market that the accused started stalking the victim till the Housing Board light point."
"Right to dissent must be protected, says Ansari","Outgoing Vice-President calls for restraint on hasty legislation

A day after outgoing Vice-President Hamid Ansari spoke of a “feeling of unease” among minorities, in his farewell speech as Rajya Sabha Chairman today he cautioned the BJP-led Union Government on the need to protect parliamentary rights of those expressing dissent. Several Opposition leaders backed his views. Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party) and Derek O’ Brien (TMC) hoped parliamentary precedents set by him (not allowing Bill to be passed amid din) would continue after the new Chairman, BJP’s M Venkaiah Naidu, takes over tomorrow.Quoting Dr S Radhakrishnan, Ansari said: “A democracy is distinguished by the protection it gives to minorities. A democracy is likely to degenerate into tyranny if it does not allow the opposition groups to criticise fairly. “But, at the same time, minorities also have their responsibilities. They have every right to criticise, their right to criticise should not degenerate into wilful hampering and obstruction of the work of Parliament...” Noting that the manner in which the MPs attended to their business was watched by “the citizen body,” he called for restraint on hasty legislation. Inside the Rajya Sabha, the BJP stuck to niceties, with top leaders praising him. Outside, several NDA leaders criticised his comments on minoritis as “petty.” Some asked why he had kept mum or had not resigned if he felt so strongly on the issue. Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP general secretary, wondered if Ansari was looking for “political shelter” after his retirement."
Cricketer Abhinav Mukund slams racial abuse on social media,"Indian cricketer Abhinav Mukund has slammed racial abuse on social media, saying he has himself been at the receiving end of insults and ridicule for his skin tone. In a statement posted on his Twitter page, Mukund, who featured in the first Test against Sri Lanka in the ongoing series and scored 81 in the second innings, expressed his disappointment at some of messages sent to him targeting his skin tone. The left-handed Tamil Nadu batsman, however, made it clear that his statement had nothing to do with any member of the Indian cricket team.

“I am writing today not to garner sympathy or attention but with the hope to change the mindset of people on an issue I feel strongly about. I have been travelling a lot within and outside our country since I was 15. Ever since I was young, people’s obsession with my skin colour has always been a mystery to me,” his statement, posted on Wednesday night, read. “Anyone who follows cricket would understand the obvious. I have played and trained day in and day out in the sun and not even once have I regretted the fact that I have tanned or lost a couple of shades. “It is simply because I love what I do and I have been able to achieve certain things only because I have spent hours outdoors. I come from Chennai, probably one of the hottest places in the country, and I have gladly spent most of my adult life in the cricket ground.” Further, the 27-year-old said he had been subjected to this abuse for long and it had not ended. “I have been subjected to a lot of name-calling and I have laughed and shrugged it off because I had bigger goals! Affected young, I toughened up because this was never something that would pull me down. “There were many times when I chose not to dignify these insults with responses. Today I am speaking up not just for me but for many from our country who experience ridicule based on the colour of one’s skin. Obviously with the rise of social media, it has gone to magnitude that I see people hurling abuses left, right and centre at something I have absolutely no control over! “Fair is not the only lovely or handsome guys! Stay true, stay focused and be comfortable in your own skin,” he concluded. His statement evoked strong response from his fans, who praised him for sharing his thoughts on the subject. Bengal cricketer Manoj Tiwary, replying to him, tweeted, “Well said Abhinav.” In his latest post on Thursday morning, Mukund made it clear that his statement had nothing to do with Indian team. “Guys please don’t turn this into something else, it has absolutely no connection to anyone in the team. It is mainly targeted at people who have been posting abuses about colour and saying absolutely derogatory things about the tone of my skin. That’s all,” he tweeted. He further appealed, “Please don’t turn this into something political. I just wanted to make a positive statement hoping to make a change. That’s all.” Mukund has played seven Tests for India and is yet to make his ODI debut."

The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Parts of Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and Delhi report a ‘phantom barber’ chopping off braids of unsuspecting women, usually from rural areas. The police and civic officials have launched awareness campaigns, but the effect is not known

[ + read story ]

It has been five days and teenaged Saanya (name changed) refuses to leave her room, holding on to her hijab and getting scared even by a slight flutter of a newspaper. She was a chirpy girl until July 31: she had picked up a comb to hurriedly manage her mane. The moment it touched her hair, her braid came off. Screaming, she fainted and almost the entire village rushed to see the latest victim of ‘phantom barber.’

Similar incidents have been reported from Delhi, Gurugram Rewari and Fatehabad where the victims blame a witch, saying they saw black cats before falling unconscious. Some people have started putting up neem leaves, lemon & chilli bunches, talismans and even cow dung on the entrances of their houses to ward off the “evil spirits.”

The fear has led to both Hindu and Muslim religious leaders coming up with special charms and enchantments to ward off the phantom barber. Anti-witch hair bands have made it to local markets in Mewat and are being sold for as high as Rs 100 apiece.

Several braid saving experts are offering doorstep services and roaming the streets selling their talent to keep one’s house safer through turmeric-stained handprints or a special talisman. A series of songs have been composed on braid chopping.

Call it fear or hysteria, some people say the ‘phantom barber’ is a paranormal entity going around chopping braids of women in Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The ‘phenomenon’ is believed to be the biggest since 2001 when ‘monkey man’ started prowling the district of Nagaur in Rajasthan.

How it began

The state police were startled when a video went viral in Nagaur in the second week of June. The clip showed two men thrashing a woman, forcing her to repeatedly recite various names of gods. The two were traced and arrested and their revelation brought the story of the ‘phantom barber’ to fore. They told the police that the woman was a ‘Baal Kataani’ — a witch who was chopping off the braids of local women. The two produced a WhatsApp message in support of their claim.

Within days the district thanas were flooded with over 20 complaints about braid chopping incidents. With no concrete evidence, no FIR was registered. Soon, similar cases started surfacing from Bikaner, Jodhpur, Sikar and Jaipur districts. A few cases were registered, but no major breakthrough came.

While the matter was about to be written off as an odd rumour in Rajasthan, alarm bells rang out in Haryana, Delhi and UP with a barrage of reports of braid chopping reaching the authorities.

Mewat is the worst hit by phantom barber: the district police have received over 250 cases, but have registered only one case. Areas like Punhana, Ferozpur Jhirka, Nuh and Hathin have reported around 50 cases each to the local administration though victims have flatly refused to go to the police, fearing for their lives.

The victims in Rajasthan have not explained much about the mysterious chopping. In Gurugram, though, such victims are talking about a ‘shape shifter’ who is seen for a few seconds before a woman falls unconscious and her braid is chopped. The fall-out has been serious: women have been confined to homes with hair tied up in buns after being massaged with badly smelling oils. The youths of villages are forming special groups to man the areas at night, and are even catching hold of suspects and turning them over to the police.

Suppressed fear?

Most say it is something similar to the 2001 case where victims saw flashes of monkey assaults. But it all turned out to be a mere hysteria. “All of this started with WhatsApp messages. If you review profiles of the targeted women, you would find most of them coming from suppressed sections of society living with constant sense of victimization. And when anything of this sort happens, they are vulnerable to illusions of being targeted,” says Ritika Sen, a city-based psychologist and behavioral expert. “No woman living in condominiums has been touched. A detailed investigation of victims will tell us how many of these cases are genuine. Paranormal entities do exist, but their effect is localized,” said Sen.

The city administration also dismisses it as a scare. “There are many self-proclaimed victims. But they are not ready to file a police complaint even after much persuasion. We are currently more focused on spreading awareness and preventing rumours. Panchayats and maulvis are getting in touch with the victims and persuading villagers to deal with it logically,” said Mani Ram Sharma, Deputy Commissioner, Mewat."

The Tribune: Ludhiana city news,"LUDHIANA: The police today claimed to have solved the recent cyber fraud cases with the arrest of four petrol pump employees here.

Ludhiana, August 10

The police today claimed to have solved the recent cyber fraud cases with the arrest of four petrol pump employees here. The case is said to have been cracked after thorough questioning of cyber thief Mukul, whose live-in partner Ramandeep Kaur had committed suicide at the Dugri police station a few days ago.

The accused have been identified as Ravinder Singh of Sandh village in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, who worked at the Bansal filling station, Dhuri railway line; Bikramjit Singh of Surti village in Kangra, who worked at the Bharat petrol pump, Samrala chowk; Shuban Vishkarma, who worked at a Reliance petrol pump in Dugri; and Davinder Kumar of New Agar Nagar here.

Additional DCP-II Sandeep Garg and ACP-Headquarters and Cyber Crime Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, who cracked the case, conducted a press conference today.

Garg said after Mukul was nabbed on August 5, the police had recovered several fake ID proofs from him, which he was using for shopping expensive things from malls and from online sites through cloned debit and credit cards.

“During Mukul’s questioning, the police came to know that he and his girlfriend, Ramandeep Kaur, was in touch with several petrol pump employees to whom they had given skimming devices to steal data of cash cards. Whenever any customer came to their petrol pumps for buying petrol or diesel, these employees used to swipe card in the skimming machines to steal the data,” Garg added.

The ADCP said by unearthing this racket, the police had solved 18 cases of cyber fraud, out of a total 28 cases reported in the past over two weeks. These cases mainly pertain to shopping from cards or withdrawing cash from ATMs and do not include cases in which money was transferred through net banking. The police are seriously working to crack those cases as well.

Expensive watches, shoes bought with cloned cards

Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, ACP, Cyber Crime, said after preparing the clones of ATM cards, Mukul used to buy expensive branded watches, shoes, clothes and other things. “We have recovered branded wrist watches, such as Rolex, Rado, and branded shoes which Mukul had purchased recently with the cloned cards,” the ACP added.

Workers charged Rs 800 per swipe to steal data

The arrested petrol pump employees were paid Rs 800 per swipe by Mukul. Once the card was swiped and PIN secretly recorded by an employee, he could claim Rs 800 from Mukul. ADCP II Sandeep Garg said the pump employees had been providing their services to Mukul for the past several months, and it could be possible that data of hundreds of cards was stolen by them through skimming devices. “So far, pump employees had prepared 79 clones of debit and credit cards. We have not recovered any skimming machines but we have enough evidence of Mukul’s connection with these pump employees. They were also in touch with Mukul over the phone and we have all records,” Garg revealed.

Police advice to residents

Whenever you visit a petrol pump or a shop, you should cautiously watch employees if they are swiping your debit/credit card on a skimming device, and always make sure that nobody is around when you enter the PIN on the machine. Criminals can’t withdraw money with cloned cards unless they have the secret PIN.

Stolen data of cards was sold outside Punjab

Since Mukul had loads of stolen data of debit and credits cards, he used to sell it to criminals in Delhi, Mumbai, Jharkhand and other state for huge sums. The price of stolen data was fixed as per the balance amount in the card."

"ED raids businessman’s office, house in Srinagar","Samaan Lateef

Tribune News Service

Srinagar, August 10

The Enforcement Directorate on Thursday raided the house and office of a leading businessman and carpet exporter in Kashmir in connection with exports proceeds involving over Rs 20 crore. A joint team of the Enforcement Directorate and Crime Branch of the Jammu and Kashmir Police on Thursday raided businessman Sheikh Ashiq’s office Al-Khuddam at the Sangarmal complex inSrinagar and his house at the Ahmad Nagar locality of the city. Ashiq and his family are into carpet export business and also run a tour and travel agency under the name of Al-Khuddam. They also own hotels and restaurants. “Today we conducted searches at two premises connected to Sheikh Ashiq Ahmad. We have found some incriminating material,” said an Enforcement Directorate official privy to the operation. The directorate official said the businessman was given the opportunity to provide documents related to the export proceeds amounting to Rs 20.2 crore mostly between 2014 and 2015. “He (exporter) has made no efforts to get the export proceeds realised despite the lapse of the due period of realisation. The exporter is also not cooperating in the investigation,” the Enforcement Directorate official said. The Reserve Bank of India has also not granted the businessman an extension to realise the outstanding export proceeds. The official said the businessman had not contemplated any action against overseas buyers. “It creates a doubt that the export proceeds have been intentionally withheld outside India since 2014-2015 for certain personal gains of the exporter and corresponding loss of valuable foreign exchange to the Government of India,” the official said. The Enforcement Directorate, which is probing the case under sections of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), suspects illegal transactions. The National Investigation Agency on Monday questioned the sons of the chairman of the hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani in connection with a terror funding probe allegedly involving the Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief, Hafiz Saeed."
Secret to true love: Dating a friend,"There’s a famous moment in When Harry Met Sally, when Billy Crystal’s character explains the age old riddle of male and female friendships. “Men and women can never be friends,” he tells Meg Ryan, “because the sex part always gets in the way.” And he’s right, sort of. Spoiler alert, Harry meets Sally, Harry befriends Sally and the two fall madly in love. It’s a narrative we’ve seen played out time and time again, spanning the Dukes of Shakespeare to the Hugh Grants of Richard Curtis. So why is it that the friends-to-lovers paradigm bears such perennial relevance? And does it work IRL? It’s been scientifically proven that the longer you’ve known somebody, the more attractive you’ll find them, researchers at the University of Texas found. They asked students to rate each other at the beginning of the semester, and again at the end. Naturally, these rates increased hugely over time, explaining how — in numerical terms — a “six” can easily become a “nine” in a matter of weeks. In other words, when it comes to long-term attraction, aesthetics has very little to do with it. A further study asked 167 couples how long they’d known one another before becoming romantically involved and whether they were friends first. They found that, on average, the couples had known each other four months before dating. Plus, 40 per cent of them were friends beforehand. You never feel more comfortable than when you’re with your friends, right? They often know you better than your fmaily. So, why is it that platonic familiarity so frequently leads to romance? “The purity of a friendship allows you to see one’s character before it’s blurred by sexual intentions and wanting to ‘get’ something physical out of it,” dating expert Matthew Hussey said.

Sydney

Australian researchers have discovered a dietary supplement which can prevent miscarriages, and many different types of birth defects for pregnant women.

The discovery, announced on Thursday at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, said that the common supplement Niacin, known as Vitamin B3, can cure molecular deficiencies that cause birth defects and miscarriages in women, reports Xinhua news agency.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Until now, the cause of 80 per cent of birth defects had remained unknown to scientists, but with this discovery, pregnant women around the world will now be able to prevent many common abnormalities such as cleft palate, kidney, heart, and spinal issues.

The lead scientist who made this remarkable discovery, professor Sally Dunwoodie, told Xinhua that she never believed that she would be able to make such an important difference, and that this would now lead to new opportunities to improve the lives of women around the world.

The discovery showed that a major cause was a deficiency of a vital molecule known as NAD, which is important for normal development of organs.

To make NAD, vitamin B3 is necessary, and the vitamin is found in most meats and green vegetables, even in one of Australia's most famous exports, Vegemite.

Studies have shown however that by the third trimester of pregnancy, 60 per cent of women are deficient in their vitamin B3 levels, and as such need to complement their diet with additional supplements.

The Executive Director of the Victor Chang Institute Robert Graham said that women need to be taking vitamin B3 well before they decide to get pregnant.

""This will change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,"" Graham said.

""We believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country's greatest medical discoveries. It's extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventative solution at the same time,"" he added.

Having fancied clothes, colours and films since childhood, he is living his B-town dream and as far as Bollywood is concerned, well, they are living him up too. “Ever since childhood at the age of 5 or 6, I have had a fascination for sketching and colours. I had an opinion on the colour of my mother’s saree. As for films, they are till today my best stress-buster.” The flair and passion more than made up for lack of education and even humble beginnings when he, “didn’t have the money to come up with a collection.”

He is ready for ‘n’ number of queries on his label, his inspiration, journey, Bollywood and anything in between. “It’s hot here,” he settles after felicitating students of INIFD and before his 45 minute lecture is to begin.

The signature Burberry check scarf comes out (this time, he’s wearing grey) though not the black blazer. “I always wear black because I feel it makes me look slimmer because I am always feeling fat; and checks because they give a masculine touch.”

It’s the busiest time, there is Lakme Fashion Week coming up in Mumbai next week. “But once I commit to something I fulfill it. You wouldn’t see me taking calls from office back in Mumbai or working on the collection. I’ll put in extra hours, but won’t neglect anything.”

Indian women going wrong?

“I think where Indian women go wrong the most is in overdoing things. There’s jewellery, costume, hair and make-up; everything going at the same time. For instance, if you are wearing a nice heavy necklace, keep the blouse or neckline simple and vice-versa.”

World of replicas

Once a collection is out there, it doesn’t take more than a week for the market to be flooded with ‘Manish Malhotra lehengas’. With everyone trying to do the same thing (sometimes the exact same thing); he does acknowledge and takes solace in the fact that imitation indeed is the best form of flattery! Having said that, “If it’s films that are being followed and copied, I can’t control that, but as a brand, we plan to take significant measures to tackle that.”

Quick fire round

Whom does he admire for their style?

“Mr Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Rekhaji. In fact Rekha mam looks gorgeous. We go to the same gym and I tell her that even in gym clothes she looks gorgeous. I tell her, “See at 7 am in the morning also you look stunning. Among the younger lot, there’s Alia.”

What does he have to say about judgments passed on the basis of fashion, looks and styles?

It’s democracy. All I can say is that I have never made personal comments. If I want to say something like that, I have a way of saying it.

The year 2017 for Manish Malhotra is?

“Very hectic; there’s a period drama coming up starring Alia, Varun, Sridevi; and then Student of The Year 2. Also there are shows in Delhi, Kolkata and Dubai.”

A celebrity he’d like to dress up?

“I admire Sridevi because she believed in me when I was starting out and she was at the peak of her career. She and Rekha are the only people, I address as mam.”

His take on Chandigarh?

“I am going for a drive in the evening. It’s the clean, green and well-planned city. Also I love the food here. I have been here for films like Veer Zara and Dil Bole Hadippa.”"

Jalandhar, August 10

Donning a white kurta pyjama, a pen in his pocket, an Urdu newspaper placed on the table to his left, which he just finished reading, Sardari Lal (85) says he only reads Urdu newspaper, the language which he learnt in Sialkot, now in Pakistan.

The mention of Sialkot suddenly brought back the memories of Partition. The pain from which he went through and the agony which he faced popped up in his mind and his relaxed demeanour suddenly vanished and sadness came to his eyes.

Lal, who is an ex-MC councilor, says he left Sialkot with his parents and uncles and experienced this tragedy at the tender age of 16.

“I can never forget that place where I was born and that moment when I left it, I was very young,” Lal says with a heavy voice.

After a small pause, he continues, “When we boarded a train from Pakistan and reached Badami Bagh of Lahore, the train was attacked by miscreants, but the military that was along with us guided us to safety.”

“And the moment the train crossed Wagah Border, people celebrated by shouting in happiness and hugging each other. We were happy that at least we were safe at that moment,” remembers Lal.

The journey after reaching here was also not so easy. Lal says when he reached Jalandhar, the name of the place was not even known to him.

“Asi ik desh to doosre desh aaye si, kuch nahee pata si ki kithe jana hai, kithe rehna hai, ki khana hai, oh time kadi nahee bhul sakda” (We had shifted from one country to another, we didn’t know where we were, where to stay and what to eat, I will never forget those times)

When they saw Indian flag

“We were made to stay in a camp where I remember that our nation’s flag and only one tent was installed,” said Lal. “We felt relaxed and confident to see our flag, but all the people were made to stay under one tent,” he smiles.

Sipping tea, Lal said they did not sleep for the whole time in the tent and they did not even eat.

“They used to give us chickpeas (“chane”) and we would run to eat.”

As he came out of the thinking mode, he said he felt that today’s generation would never understand the problems people had to face then. “You all are lucky that you are born in present times, only we know what we went through,” Lal says while keeping aside the cup of tea.

After living in camps in Burlton Park, he said that all people got shifted in the quarters in Bhargo Camp that were especially got built by the government for the people who came here after Partition.

“They really came as a relief, and then I started my work here in 1950 of manufacturing surgical instruments, and things eventually fell in place,” he said.

From riches to rags

“Once I was coming back from work and found that an ice-cream vendor was arguing with a man who had stolen his spoon after eating the ice cream,” he said.

The man initially denied and afterwards, he accepted and cried that he had stolen the spoon. “Voh aadmi crorepati tha, yahan par ek chammach ke liye chori ki, ye alam tha us waqt,” says Lal before signing off."
80 per cent Aadhaar enrolment for ICDS,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 10

Uttarakhand has managed to provide 80 per cent Aadhaar enrolment of children who are beneficiaries of the ICDS Supplementary Nutrition Scheme (take home ration scheme for malnourished children)and are in the age group of 6-36 months and 3-6 years. As the Central Government has issued directives to the state government to ensure there is 100 per cent enrolment of beneficiaries or face withdrawal of Central assistance, there is an urgency among officials of the Department of Woman and Child Development that runs the ICDS scheme for achieving full enrolment of beneficiaries. A massive exercise is underway in Uttarakhand in all districts to achieve 100 per cent coverage. The districts that are lagging behind are Pithoragarh, Uttarkashi and Chamoli, where action was taken against the District Project officers. “The full coverage under Aadhaar of the beneficiaries will help us plug leakages and also monitor the end result of the schemes, which is to tackle malnutrition among children and lactating mothers,” said Vimmy Sachdeva, Additional Secretary, Woman and Child Development. Since the children below the age of five years are being enrolled based on their parent’s biometrics, in many cases, the parents did not have their biometrics, as a result there has been a delay in three districts. Despite the glitches, Uttarakhand has achieved a target of 80 per cent enrollment for the take-home ration scheme. “In the coming few days, we will have covered all the beneficiaries. Already 13 schemes are on the Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System,” she added. So far 7,19,836 children have been enrolled at 20,067 anganwadi centres of 13 districts and around 1,38,095 children are still to be enrolled."
Francis takes shock 400m gold,"WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS

American wins after Olympics champ Miller-Uibo stumbles with gold in sight; Felix fades to bronze

London, August 10

American Phyllis Francis won a surprise World Championships 400 metres gold on Wednesday as Olympics champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo inexplicably stumbled when seemingly certain of victory in an extraordinary finale. Francis looked out of the medals with 80 metres to go but maintained her form amid the carnage to post a personal best time of 49.92 seconds and take a shock gold. Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser, 19, claimed a brilliant silver in 50.06s as defending champion Allyson Felix of the US faded to get bronze. Felix looked her usual smooth self despite the sodden track and had made up the stagger on Francis, a lane outside her, by the end of the first bend. However, she did not come off the final bend with her usual authority and Miller-Uibo surged ahead into the final straight. The title seemed secure but Bahamian Miller-Uibo, who famously dived over the line to pip Felix to the Olympics gold last year, lost her form. Her legs seemed to stiffen, perhaps through cramp, and became entangled. As she virtually stopped running, the fast-finishing Francis, Naser, Felix and fourth-placed Shericka Jackson all went past.

Felix in top club

Felix’s bronze took her World Championships medal haul to 14, matching the record of Jamaican sprinters Usain Bolt and Merlene Ottey. Felix’s tally includes nine golds; she can make it 10 with the 4x400m relay to come.China’s Gong Lijiao ended her long wait for a global outdoor title when she won the shot put gold medal. The 28-old-year had won five silver and bronze medals at the World Championships and Olympics but a gold had always eluded her until a chilly, wet night in London. Gong made light of the conditions as she broke 19 metres with five of her six attempts and won with a fifth throw of 19.94m. There were only two other throws over 19 metres — Anita Marton’s final effort of 19.49 which won silver for the Hungarian and USA’s reigning Olympics champ Michelle Carter’s third throw of 19.14 which took bronze.

Gun-to-line triumph

Norway’s Karsten Warholm announced himself as one of the sport’s brightest new powerhouses as he recorded a magnificent gun-to-line triumph to win the 400m hurdles title. The 21-year-old former decathlete demonstrated all the strength he has acquired from competing in the multi-event discipline as he led from the first hurdle and held off his pursuers on the home straight to win in 48.35 seconds. He beat Turkey’s European champion Yasmani Copello (48.49s), who took silver, and also spoiled Olympics champion and favourite Kerron Clement’s dream of becoming the first man to win three world titles at the discipline as the American had to settle for bronze in 48.52s. It was the first track victory at any World Championships by a Norwegian since Ingrid Kristiansen’s 10,000 metres triumph in Rome in 1987.

Neeraj disappoints

Indian javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra could manage a best of 82.26m to finish a lowly seventh in qualifying Group A. Chopra, whose season’s best is 85.63, failed to secure a direct qualification for the final. With Group B qualifying yet to finish, Chopra’s chances of making it to the 12-man final seem low. G Lakshmanan bettered his personal best but it was not enough to qualify for the final of the men’s 5000m. — Agencies"
Child sex ratio: Karnal goes past 930 mark,"In 2010, 834 girls were born against 1,000 boys

Karnal, August 10

Karnal has witnessed a significant increase in the child sex ratio with more than 930 girls against 1,000 boys. As per the Civil Registration System, the sex ratio in the district was 933 till July, while it was 909 in 2016, 897 in 2015, 886 in 2014, 881 in 2013, 847 in 2012, 849 in 2011 and 834 in 2010. The data shows that the mindset of people has changed a lot towards the girl child in the last seven years due to several initiatives undertaken by the state government and the Centre. The sex ratio has increased considerably, but a lot needs to be done in several areas of the district. The data reveals that the sex ration in several areas under Assandh, Indri and Nissing Community Health Centres (CHCs) is more than 1,000 during the last seven month, while areas under Jalmana, Barsat, Gagsina, Kutail, Kachwa, Kunjpura, Nigdhu and Sagga Primary Health Centres (PHCs) also witnessed child sex ratio more than 1,000 during this period. The data shows low sex ratio in the areas under Khukni, Barota, Sambhli and Ballah PHCs and Nilokheri and Gharaunda CHCs. “There are 127 registered ultrasound centres in the district, of which 75 are in working condition, while 52 are non-operational,” said Yogesh Kumar, Civil Surgeon. With efforts of the department, 12 persons had been convicted by the court so far for violation of the PCPNDT Act, he said. He said that Karnal was among the 100 districts of the country having low sex ratio, but the department left no stone unturned and made efforts to educate residents and also kept a check on violators of the PCPNDT Act. “We have identified villages with low sex ratio and health workers have been asked to keep a vigil on these villages to find out the reasons behind it,” he said. “The district administration has also constituted a district-level task force which holds meetings to review the situation and it also educates people about the alarming situation,” he said. With the help of Asha, anganwari and health workers, the department had been making efforts to make residents aware about the programmes being carried out by the department to promote the birth of a girl child, he said, and added that they were also guiding pregnant women about the nutritional food to curb malnutrition problems. “We are also ensuring that the newborn child gets complete immunisation so that the infant death could be reduced,” he said."
A nascent field worth exploration,"BIOFLUID MECHANICS

Gauri Chhabra

India is witnessing an alarming increase in diseases and injuries of all kinds. According to a recent report, 17 per cent of the urban Indians have kidney injuries; and there are nearly two million heart attacks a year, one person dies every 33 seconds owing to a heart attack and over 4 million people are living with chronic joint pain. For such ailments we use pacemakers, defibrillators, artificial kidneys, blood oxygenators, prosthetic hearts, and joints. Have you ever wondered what these pacemakers, defibrillators etc. are made of? They are made of fluids that include, air, blood, lymph and water. It can be found both in plants and animals. The discipline that deals with such devices that is Biofluid Mechanics.

Definition

This is a discipline which uses or involves many other disciplines, including biology, medicine, biochemistry, biorheology, hemorheology, mathematics, bioengineering and physics. Biofluid Mechanics applies engineering, mathematical and physical principles of fluids to solve complex and multifaceted problems, primarily in biology and medicine, but also in aerospace and robotics. This field has a direct bearing on clinical issues including heart surgery and heart valve replacement, the reaction of pharmaceutical in the body, surgical by pass techniques, ultrasound studies, and the role of hemodynamic reactions on the endothelial cells. It can be considered as the conjuncture of mechanical engineering and biological engineering.

The need

Biofluid Mechanics is a fascinating subject due to the fact that it attracts attention from both the scientists and general public. Unlike engineering applications, understanding human body biofluid dynamics is not easy. This is due to the fact that in vivo experiments are not easy to perform. Non-invasive experiments are useful but not always give the desired result. Thus, both theoretical and computational biofluid dynamics play a major role in the understanding of human body biofluid dynamics. The extracorporeal systems, such as medical devices, can be experimentally tested by satisfying local government regulations. Real biofluids are often essential to test these devices. Such fluids can only be obtained by licensed bodies. Thus, in the development of medical devices both theoretical and computational biofluid dynamics play a major role at the early stages of design and development.

Eligibility and skill set

Biofluid Mechanics is offered as an elective subject at PG level in Biomedical Engineering. In order to pursue your masters in biomedical engineering you need to have pursued your BE or BTech or equivalent in Biomedical or Medical Electronics with at least 50 per cent marks in aggregate. For getting into Bio Fluid Mechanics, you should have research and problem-solving skills, competence in developing arguments from scientific, ethical and philosophical perspectives. You should also posses the ability to plan and manage projects; ability to gather, analyse and communicate complex technical data to others. Besides, you should also have the ability to work in all kinds of environments, developed through field-work experience.

Responsibilities

Using computer software and mathematical models to design, develop and test new materials, devices and equipment. This can involve programming electronics, building and evaluating prototypes, troubleshooting problems, and rethinking the design until it works correctly.

Conducting research to solve clinical problems using a variety of means to collate the necessary information, including questionnaires, interviews and group conferences.

Working closely with other medical professionals, such as doctors and therapists as well as with end-users (patients and their careers).

Assessing the potential wider market for products or modifications suggested by health professionals or others.

Arranging clinical trials of medical products.

Approaching marketing and other industry companies to sell the product.

Writing reports and attending conferences and exhibitions to present your work and latest designs to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.

Meeting with senior health service staff or other managers to exchange findings

The tasks you carry out will vary depending on your employer and the seniority of the post held, but may include:

Scope

India: This field is still in its nascent stage in India and, therefore, scope is very limited at present. One of the main reasons why progress is slow is due to the lack of integration between research institutions, hospitals and universities in India. In developed nations such as USA, UK and Singapore, excellent integration exists between universities and hospitals, thereby creating the perfect environment for R&D in Biomedical Engineering. In India, most of the jobs related to Biomedical Engineering are in non-tech areas such as service, maintenance, customer support, sales and management. If you are interested in pursuing a career in research and core development work in Biomedical Engineering must look for jobs in universities, labs and research centers in India or pursue MS and PhD studies in USA, UK and other nations. Abroad: The scope for this field is excellent abroad. Biomedical Engineering is doing extremely well in USA, UK, Germany, Singapore, Canada and Australia. Other countries such as Japan and China are also doing very well in this field. There has been some tremendous achievements and breakthroughs in these nations due to the excellent integration that exists between research centers, universities and hospitals, thereby enabling researchers, scientists, faculty and surgeons to work together to solve complex problems in medicine and healthcare. Pay packages are impressive for biomedical engineers in these countries. If you are very ambitious and looking to climb up the ladder in this field will benefit immensely from a PhD degree in biomedical engineering. A career in the above mentioned nations will be very rewarding and satisfying, provided you work hard.

Career Scape

Healthcare, pharmaceutical and healthcare equipment manufacturing sectors are the prime recruiters. Government agencies such as Drugs Department, State wise Health Departments are also known to recruit BE/BTech. Biomedical Engineering Graduates. Average starting salary is generally between Rs 3-6 lakh per year. Chances of building a career abroad after graduation are good, when it comes to this engineering branch. Abroad, the salary package will be much better in comparison to the figures mentioned above. You may also find jobs in pathological labs, clinics and hospitals as well as rehabilitation clinics. Some of the commonly found job posts available for graduates are- biomedical engineer, equipment design engineer, lab technician/administrator, research engineer

Playing action video games may harm your brain,"Toronto

Playing action video games may cause depletion of grey matter in the brain, increasing the risk of diseases such as depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's, a study has warned. Researchers from University of Montreal (UdeM) in Canada found that habitual players of action games have less grey matter in their hippocampus, a major part of the brain that is responsible for orientation and for recalling past experience. Previous studies have shown that hippocampus depletion puts a person at risk of developing brain illnesses and diseases ranging from depression to schizophrenia, Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Alzheimer's disease. ""Video games have been shown to benefit certain cognitive systems in the brain, mainly related to visual attention and short-term memory,"" said Greg West, associate professor at UdeM. ""But there is also behavioural evidence that there might be a cost to that, in terms of the impact on the hippocampus,"" West added. There is another important part of the brain called the striatum that counterbalances the hippocampus, researchers said. It has an area known as the caudate nucleus that acts as a kind of ""autopilot"" and ""reward system"" - getting us home from work, for example, and telling us when it's time to eat, drink and do other things that keep us alive and happy, they said. Gaming has been shown to stimulate the caudate nucleus more than the hippocampus, 85 per cent of players rely on that part of the brain to navigate their way through a game. Researchers found that the problem is that the more the people use caudate nucleus, the less they use the hippocampus, and as a result the hippocampus loses cells and atrophies. The team recruited close to 100 people (51 men, 46 women) and got them to come in and play a variety of popular shooter games like Call of Duty, Killzone and Borderlands 2, as well as three-dimensional games from the Super Mario series, for a total of 90 hours. The team scanned the brains of habitual players of action video games and comparing them to non-players, and found that less grey matter in the hippocampus of habitual players. They then followed that up with two studies to establish causality and found that it was indeed the gaming that led to changes in the brain. The study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. —PTI"

Chandigarh, August 10

A local court today remanded Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala and the latter’s friend Ashish Kumar in two-day police custody in the stalking and attempt-to-abduction case. The victim, Varnika Kundu, is the daughter of an IAS officer.

Pleading for two-day remand, the public prosecutor told the court that the police needed to reconstruct the crime scene and find the motive behind stalking and attempt to abduct the 29-year-old disc jockey. The police also wanted to unearth “how the accused came to know the victim”, what was their intention behind committing the crime and whether they had any criminal background.

Opposing the remand, defence counsel Surya Prakash contended that the accused were not following the girl. “No more interrogation is required as the accused were there with the police for the past four days whenever they asked them to join investigation. It is a media trial and the case has been hyped. The police are acting under pressure. No weapon has to be recovered from them.”

Civil Judge Barjinder Pal Singh, meanwhile, asked them to wait. He went inside his room twice. Thereafter, after studying the case reports, he granted two-day remand to the police.

The accused were re-arrested and charged with attempt to abduction on Wednesday after the local police were criticised for applying only bailable Sections in the FIR. The duo was booked under Sections 354-D (stalking) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC and 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles Act on August 5 and was granted bail. After much hue and dry, the police yesterday re-arrested and added Sections 365 (kidnapping or abduction with intent to confine a person) and Section 511 (attempt to commit an offence punishable with life imprisonment) of the IPC.

Meanwhile, reacting to the development, victim’s father Virender Kundu said, “The law is taking its course. the matter is sub judice.”"

TOKYO:Born in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Milkha Singh was orphaned and rendered a refugee by the riots at Partition.

[ + read story ]

Fourth best

Tokyo, Sept 1960

Born in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Milkha Singh was orphaned and rendered a refugee by the riots at Partition. He got into the Indian Army in 1952 and ran his first race a fortnight later — it was not a great beginning, for Milkha had to stop to rest after half-a-mile before continuing. But his love for running shaped his extraordinary training regimen, which included running in all kinds of terrain, and sprinting next to speeding trains. In 1958, he won gold medals in the 200m and 400m events at the Asian Games, and the 400m gold at the Commonwealth Games the same year.

But the legend of Milkha was created in the 1960 Rome Olympics, when he missed the bronze by a whisker. In the run-up to the Olympics, he had beaten all the world’s best quarter-milers, except Otis Davis of the US, and was a favourite to win a medal. In the final, he burst off the blocks with tremendous power and took the early lead but, at the 200m, slowed down a bit and even turned to look at the competitors. This was a fatal mistake: He was quickly overtaken and could finish only fourth.

First World Champion

Calcutta, Dec 1958

Eleven years after Independence, India had its first world champion. Wilson Jones, son of a Welshman, was good at hockey and cricket too, but found fame at the billiards table. After early years of struggle in the World Amateur Billiards Championship, he finally triumphed in 1958 in Kolkata. He was immediately hailed as a national hero, and he paid back his admirers by winning his second world title.

Woman power

Sandgate, Sept 1959

Arati Saha became the first woman from Asia to swim across the English Channel, from Cape Gris Nez in France to Sandgate in England. Saha, a precocious talent who had participated in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, presented the face of the new Indian woman to the West, and provided a role model to women in India when she raised the Indian flag at Sandgate on September 29, 1959.

Tennis great

London, June 1960

Ramanathan Krishnan, who is still the greatest tennis player from India, reached the semifinals of the Wimbledon Championships in 1960, and repeated the feat the next year. Krishnan had announced his arrival seven years earlier when, as a 16-year-old, he was India’s hero in a lost cause against Belgium in their Davis Cup tie in 1953. He won the junior title at Wimbledon next year, and the London Lawn Tennis Championship in 1959. In both his Wimbledon semifinals, Krishnan had the tough luck of running into the eventual winner, Neale Fraser and Rod Laver. No other Indian player has reached the semifinals of a Grand Slam in singles.

Yawn series

India, 1960-61

The second visit by a Pakistan team for a Test series raised excitement, but the cricket was dull and uninspiring. All the five Tests were drawn, and each of the 15 first class matches played by the visitors, too, ended in a draw. After this series, India and Pakistan played 12 drawn Tests in a row. It was clear the teams were very defensive in the mindset, unwilling to take a chance — Pakistan’s batsmen scored at 35 runs per 100 balls, India’s at 39 runs per 100 balls. Pakistan notched up five 100s, and India answered with four, three of them by Polly Umrigar. There was no Test cricket between the two sides for over 17 years after this series.

Football gold standard

Jakarta, Sept 1962

A day after India lost the Asian Games gold medal match in hockey to Pakistan, the football team rose up and won gold for the country. The Indian team comprised legends of the sport — Chuni Goswami was the captain, Jarnail Singh the scorer of goals in the semifinal and final, while PK Banerjee scored goals throughout the tournament, and Peter Thangaraj was the rock-solid goalkeeper of the team. In the final, won 2-1 by India against South Korea, Thangaraj was the star with some spectacular saves.

Lost and found

Tokyo, Oct 1964

Four years after the heartbreaking loss to Pakistan in the gold medal match, India regained the hockey title in the 1964 Olympic Games. At Tokyo, the first Olympics to be held in Asia, India remained unbeaten in the group stage and defeated Australia 3-1 in the semifinal. For the third time in a row, India and Pakistan fought a bitter battle for gold, and India prevailed 1-0. It was a triumph also for goalkeeper Shankar Lakshman, who made several excellent saves. India had lost their hold on the gold medal in 1960, when Pakistan won the final 1-0.

Davis final

Melbourne, Dec 1966

India made the Davis Cup final in 1966, where they lost to Australia. Ramanathan Krishnan and Jaidip Mukherjea figured in all the five matches but could win only two sets in all in the singles. However, the duo won the doubles rubber, shocking the 1965 Wimbledon champions Newcombe and Roche.

Great Randhawa

Tokyo, Oct 1964

An outstanding allround athlete, Gurbachan Singh Randhawa focussed on decathlon in the early part of his career. He touched the 6,000-point mark at age 18 and won the gold medal at the 1962 Asian Games, where he was named the best athlete of the event. Then, out of the blue, he quit decathlon and began to focus only on the 110m hurdles, where his timing was consistently in the world’s top-10. After winning his heat, he timed 14 seconds in the semifinals to make the final; in the final, Randhawa ran his heart out and again timed 14 seconds, good enough for the fifth place. This was the best result by an Asian athlete in the 1964 Olympics.

Translating into “sunny field” in Danish, Solvang was founded by three Danish immigrants Reverend Benedict Nordentoft, Reverend Jens M. Gregersen and Professor Peder P Hornsyld — all of who shared a common dream of establishing a Danish town in America. To provide a bit of context; between 1861 and 1910, there was an exodus of people from Denmark who migrated to the United States in anticipation and hope of better economic opportunities, social status and freedom. The number crossed a whopping 90,000 in the 1880s and while the Danes settled in their new country, they still bonded together on Danish culture, customs and traditions. Hence, there were several Danish colonies that mushroomed during this time in the midwest. Solvang is an example of one of the most successful Danish colonies founded in 1911. With a population of about 5,500, Solvang is a picturesque town, 24 km north of the Pacific coast and about 75 km from Santa Barbara in California. Replete with the old-world charm, a visit to Solvang is sure to get your senses refreshed. It is the sort of town where almost everyone knows everyone else. ‘Downtown’ consists of a few blocks and a couple of crossroads. Stores are small and cozy. Traffic is sparse and life is pleasantly slow paced. An ideal weekend getaway from Los Angeles, Solvang is best explored on foot. However, if you want to experience the rustic essence of this little town, hop on to the Solvang trolley that provides a narrated tour of the town in a carriage that is drawn by two draft horses! A romantic experience, which has been in existence since 1973. The best way to start your tour would be to make a stop at the Elverhoj Museum of History and Art that is just about two blocks away from the town centre. Housed in a traditional structure that is reminiscent of an 18th century Danish farmhouse, the first thing that catches your attention as you approach the museum is the hand-crafted wooden door with an innovative latch, reminiscent of the days of the yore. The museum was once the residence of Solvang’s most-gifted couple Viggo Brandt-Erichsen and his wife, Martha Mott, who were acclaimed artists and built this house in the 1950s. One of the few museums dedicated to Danish culture outside of Denmark, Elverhoj has extensive exhibits relating to Solvang’s history and development. The museum celebrates the industrious Danish-American spirit, including the native culture and heritage through several photographs, models, artefacts, sculptures and paintings. As you take a stroll through the serene, balmy roads lined with picture-perfect houses set amid the prettiest of gardens, you notice many of these have large birds ‘resting’ on the rooftops. A closer look will reveal that these are wooden models of the European white stork that is now officially extinct in the wild in Denmark. Nevertheless, it is a tradition to have these birds on rooftops as these are believed to bring good luck and prosperity. Windmills, little elf houses that are believed to protect houses and Scandinavian-styled buildings with timbered roofs are other typical Danish symbols commonly found in Solvang. It is only apt that Solvang, which seems to be straight out of a fairytale, houses the museum of Hans Christian Andersen, apart from a Hans Christian Andersen square. Located in the Book Loft building, this charming museum is a trip down memory lane where you can browse books, artefacts and memorabilia related to the fairytales. Operated by the Ugly Duckling foundation, the museum has exhibits relating to Andersen’s life, including a model of his childhood home and antique tools for making wooden shoes. While in the town, do take time out to check out the fare in the bakeries and restaurants that serve speciality Danish pastries, pancakes and sausages."
"With Shah in RS, MPs’ leisure days over: PM","Vibha Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 10 As BJP president Amit Shah gears up for his Rajya Sabha debut, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is believed to have cautioned party MPs who do not like to spend much time participating in proceedings of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha that their days of leisure are now over. Addressing a parliamentary party meeting where he also praised Shah for completing three successful years as the party chief and bringing back the culture of hard work witnessed during Jan Sangh days, the PM is believed to have told the BJP lawmakers that he had said enough on the issue. Now that Shah would be there in the Rajya Sabha, the days of leisure are over, sources quoted him as saying at the meeting—the last for the ongoing Monsoon Session that saw the government face an embarrassing situation when a united Opposition pushed through changes to a Constitution Amendment Bill on backward classes. Sources said the words should act as a warning for habitual abstainers to get their act together. “We have asked you multiple times to be present in Parliament. Still some MPs remain absent. What do you think of yourselves.....You are nobody, I am nobody, it is the BJP that’s important,” is what the Prime Minister apparently told the MPs. Notably, this is not the first time he has expressed anger over BJP members skipping Parliament proceedings, particularly in the Rajya Sabha where the collective NDA still lacks the numbers despite the BJP individually having overtaken the Congress there. Shah had also made his displeasure known at the last meeting, which he conducted in the absence of the PM who was touring that day. He also made his displeasure known to the “missing MPs”, some of whom had gone to the airport last night to receive him there, sources say, predicting a sharp spike in Rajya Sabha’ attendance with Shah’s presence in the Rajya Sabha, which will now be conducted by senior BJP leader M Venkaiah Naidu."
Waiting to exhale,"The wait appears endless in Kashmir. Many have seen a lifetime go by hoping for a political resolution through dialogue, some clamour for ‘azadi’, and some others seek an end to violence to negotiate peace in the region that has been on an uncomfortable pause for more than 60 years

Gitanjali Sharma

The Tricolour. That’s the first sight that awaits a visitor stepping out of the Srinagar airport. Riding high on a tall mast on the airport lawns, it somewhat dwarfs the images of the green and black flags raised at pro-freedom protests. It’s a rather comforting thought, despite the promise to keep behind all preconceptions on this four-day journey to experience the Valley in its various shades.

Day 1 (Friday), Dateline: Srinagar

Minutes later, moving towards the city, the taxi driver, a local, expectedly veered the conversation around violence, the innumerable restrictions and outsiders’ apprehensions — real and imaginary. The traffic was bare minimum, courtesy the Friday factor. Zipping along the Jhelum, the driver finally applied brakes to his chatter at the hotel resting near the river, with the trailing thought: peace through dialogue remains the destination of most Kashmiris. The wait is on.

The shades of this wait were only too visible at the Dal Lake, its placidness donning a sombre shroud with few appreciators in sight. Asif Khan, one of the many shikarawallahs wistfully awaiting customers, blamed the blankness around to the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims. When probed a little further, he vent out his anger on the government that was “doing nothing to resolve the Kashmir issue”. The wait for tourists, aman and azadi continues, he said, creating ripples in the still waters.

Postscript: Just five occupants at the hotel. A tip brought in three lovely roses from its lush garden to the room.

Day 2, Dateline: Central Kashmir

The ubiquitous wait wears a uniformed look for the soldiers tackling militants, both local and Pakistan nationals.

The run from Srinagar to Zojila passes through the heavily fortified central Kashmir towns of Ganderbal and Sonmarg. As the Amarnath yatris take this route to the Baltal camp, armed soldiers, alert to untowardness of any kind, can be seen stationed a few metres apart. Keeping endless vigil, they too appear to be players, howsoever different, in the waiting game.

“The security forces can keep the situation under control up to a certain level but beyond that the political set-up has to take over,” a top Army officer in the region summed up the lingering Kashmir crisis.

Despite the threat to even the seasonal multicultural plurality, the yatris’ enthusiasm has shown no dip. The fervour was evident too at the Pahalgam base camp in south Kashmir, which was toured the next day. The separatists may keep making loud proclamations about “Kashmiri hospitality” for “our yatri guests” but equally loud remain their frequent calls for shutdowns and “freedom”.

Postscript: Got little time to sit and stare on the Sonmarg meadows that are being overwhelmed by the surrounding construction activity.

Day 3, Dateline: South Kashmir

“I am confused. I want peace but I don’t know how it will come about. I have no faith in any of the mainstream parties. Yes, I am drawn towards the new militants surfacing on the social media. At least, they promise freedom…I live on that hope.” This outburst of a dryfruit-seller in Pampore reflects the angst of many Kashmiris and their disillusionment with political leaders. The outrage against the PDP, particularly for aligning with the rightist BJP, in its south Kashmir bastion is all too palpable.

PDP vice-president and Chief Minister’s Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni, who is one of the prime movers in the government, admitted some people were upset with their party but expressed confidence that they would come around. Hopeful of a dialogue, he placed implicit faith in the Central Government for resolving the Kashmir issue. The wait for the Modi government to take the initiative to understand and settle the Kashmir crisis hasn’t died, though some of the optimism has surely waned in the last three years.

In contrast, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has ruled out the possibility of a dialogue during the present situation. “The time is not conducive for talks,” he put it categorically, alluding to the unending violence.

This stance, however, doesn’t go down well with the majority in Kashmir who have been long waiting for a discourse. Prof Noor Ahmad Baba, a political expert, is of the view that Kashmir has gone restive waiting for the Central Government to at least acknowledge the problem as it exists. The signs of violence and terror in south Kashmir, the hub of militancy, are starkly visible along the Pampore-Pahalgam stretch. Just metres away from the highway at Pampore in Pulwama district stand the burnt and damaged Entrepreneurship Development Institute buildings that came under fidayeen attack twice over. A little ahead in Anantnag, comes the point where the pilgrim bus came under militant fire.

Crossing the vulnerable highway in south Kashmir, a thought creeps along: will the wait for peace remain just that. A wait. The disheartening thought, however, evaporates the minute you meet Amarnath yatra pilgrims at Pahalgam, the longer but less excruciating route to the shrine. Their enthusiasm and that of the hospitable locals around, allows faith to make way for hope again… hope for some resolution to this conflict.

The SSP at Anantnag, Altaf Khan, a counter-insurgency specialist, appeared confident about the militant count dipping significantly over the next six months. However, gullible youth turning to flashy new-age militants occupying the social media still remained a concern, he admitted while regretting the disappearance of the multi-cultural society from Kashmir. “I had 85 per cent Pandits in my class in Srinagar. The new generation hasn’t seen this plurality. Having grown up seeing only violence and mistrust, they know little of Kashmiriyat,” he asserts.

The Centre’s indecisiveness to boldly tackle the crisis, too, draws flak from some quarters. Another top cop from the region declared that the Modi government must take a decision, even if it is to bring the state fully under its control.

Postscript: The nun chai (salty tea) and flattened buns at a roadside bakery both freshened the mind and spirit.

Day 4, Dateline: North Kashmir

It was an exhilarating four-hour stretch from Srinagar to Aman Setu, the peace bridge connecting Uri with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Passing through Baramulla, the Jhelum snaked along one side and apple orchards dotted the green cover on the other.

At Aman Setu, the peace bus arrived with passengers, some returning to this side and others visiting from across the LoC. One thing they all had in common: a satiated look that comes with fulfilment of some kind. Grateful for this exchange, they gushed over the need for peace.

This wait continues, more so for the real stakeholders on the sidelines — the student who wants to attend school without fear, the soldier who hasn’t got leave to be home with his family, and the shikarawallah who wants to wind up the day with at least Rs 500 in his pocket.

Minutes after the arrival of the peace bus came the flash about shelling near Aman Setu. News from the Rajouri area had already come earlier in the day of a soldier and a six-year-old girl succumbing to heavy Pakistan shelling.

Heading back through a vulnerable area, the mind was blank, there was no room for fear or anxiety. All that it carried with it was the burden of the lives gone and the lives still struggling as the conflict and the wait lives on.

Postscript: On the return flight, a Kashmiri Pandit was sceptical about resolving the Kashmir crisis through dialogue. Minutes later, however, she said resignedly: “Probably, that’s the only way out.”"

Stalking is no stroll in park

Also in this section

The Maratha march

Ever since the Varnika Kundu stalking case has hit the headlines, disquieting murmurs have emanated from certain quarters. Those who have deluded themselves into thinking that the outrage against the culprits is much ado about nothing would perhaps need to be told that another young girl, all of 17, has fallen prey to her stalkers. Murdered allegedly by four boys from her village in Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, the victim's family has claimed that she had been being stalked and harassed for more than six months. Her death, as that of others like Priyadarshini Mattoo before her, once again proves that stalking is not merely a ‘boy-chasing-girl’ thing as Union minister Babul Supriyo has made this out to be. Stalking is a crime, hence punishable with a jail term of up to three years and includes unwanted phone calls and email hacking. Tragically, each time a case of woman harassment comes up, it not only becomes a grim reminder of how unsafe women are, but also bares societal prejudices entrenched in feudal mindsets. While men like Supriyo try to find justification in its rampant existence in real and reel life, many misguided Romeos confuse it with romance and wooing. Other misogynists try to cow down the sufferer by blatant victim shaming all the while spreading canards. Varnika's courage in coming out in the open to take on her tormentors might be a one-off example. However, it is an emphatic reminder that girls will not take it lying down anymore. The arrest of Vikas Barala and Ashish Kumar may be a small step in her battle, given the working of our judicial system. The legal battle is likely to be grueling and protracted. Massive support that is coming her way from many quarters is in itself a matter of satisfaction and a signal that women are no longer willing to settle for the status quo. They are demanding change and driving it as well. For once, the politically connected accused has been made to hide his face and not the victim her identity."

2-day police remand for duo,"STALKING CASE

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

A local court today remanded Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala and the latter’s friend Ashish Kumar in two-day police custody in the stalking and attempt-to-abduction case. The victim, Varnika Kundu, is the daughter of an IAS officer. Pleading for two-day remand, the public prosecutor told the court that the police needed to reconstruct the crime scene and find the motive behind stalking and attempt to abduct the 29-year-old disc jockey. The police also wanted to unearth “how the accused came to know the victim”, what was their intention behind committing the crime and whether they had any criminal background. Opposing the remand, defence counsel Surya Prakash contended that the accused were not following the girl. “No more interrogation is required as the accused were there with the police for the past four days whenever they asked them to join investigation. It is a media trial and the case has been hyped. The police are acting under pressure. No weapon has to be recovered from them.” Civil Judge Barjinder Pal Singh, meanwhile, asked them to wait. He went inside his room twice. Thereafter, after studying the case reports, he granted two-day remand to the police. The accused were re-arrested and charged with attempt to abduction on Wednesday after the local police were criticised for applying only bailable Sections in the FIR. The duo was booked under Sections 354-D (stalking) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC and 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles Act on August 5 and was granted bail. After much hue and dry, the police yesterday re-arrested and added Sections 365 (kidnapping or abduction with intent to confine a person) and Section 511 (attempt to commit an offence punishable with life imprisonment) of the IPC. Meanwhile, reacting to the development, victim’s father Virender Kundu said, “The law is taking its course. the matter is sub judice.”"
When life is on the move,"Every year, shepherds and their flocks of sheep travel from Rajasthan to pastures in Haryana

Sunil Phogat

During summer months, one often sees large flocks of sheep grazing in the central regions of Haryana. From a distance, everything looks fine. The envious and carefree life of the nomads, herds of bleating sheep, newborn lambs carefully tucked in the shepherds’ arms… But, a few days spent with them reveal the hard side of the seemingly romantic life. They hail from Rajasthan and tread great lengths and breadths of the north-western and western regions of the country in search of pastures that have now shrunk. Not just Gujjars, they are Muslims, Rajpoots and Jats too. Most of them own sheep, but some rear those of a seth, a rich businessman, for livelihood. They bring hundreds of herds of sheep from Jodhpur, Sirohi, Jalaur and Nagaur every year and enter Haryana from the southern tip near Rewari or Mahendergarh, preferably along the railway track. The journey starts after Makar Sankranti. What brings them here is the fact that agricultural lands that get vacated after the rabi crops have been harvested and fallows offer green fodder. There is enough to feed them throughout the harsh summer as fallow lands in Haryana are seldom used by cattle herds from the state. The shepherds from Rajasthan thus occupy these lands until monsoon hits the region. We get talking to the shepherds who tell us that a healthy and grown up sheep yields about 700g of raw wool in a season. But rearing season is also a season of exploitation by middlemen who keep an eye on their movement and approach them at the onset of shearing season. The rate offered is as low as Rs 20 per sheep per season! A sheep is sheared thrice a year: in February-March, June-July, and November-December. The rate of wool varies in accordance with quality and demand. In lean times, the buying price remains static at Rs 35 to 40 per kilogram. Towards the end of winter, it might double and sometimes sell at Rs 100 per kg. Any little ‘profit’ that the shepherds can make vanishes between the time lag in the three fleecing seasons. The katariya or sheep barber charges Rs 16 per sheep. Besides, the herdsmen incur expenditure on maintenance of the sheep if it ever falls sick. The cost of transportation of one truck load of sheep is Rs 15,000 per journey. The assistant herdsmen are also paid wages. A headman of the shepherds, who we talk to, says the price per kg of wool should not be less than Rs 150 if they have to survive. The shepherds say that with the changing times, herdsmen shun laborious and time-consuming walks to the pastures of Haryana. Animals are now loaded into trucks at Jodhpur and alighted at the border touching Mahendragarh. From there, they usually start their journey into the hinterland of Haryana. Rayees Khan, a shepherd from Jodhpur, tells us that the sheep remain tightly packed in the vehicle’s chamber for 12-14 hours before they reach the borde. Gujjars, with their own flocks of sheep, prefer to travel long distances, often covering 400 miles or more on foot. From Mahendragarh, the shepherds move towards the shepherds move towards Charkhi Dadri and Bhiwani, cross a small stretch of Rohtak or Hissar and then move towards Jind, following the shortest country routes that they are well familiar with after years of travelling to and fro. They keep the sheep in open lands in Jind, Rohtak and Jhajjar districts, in rotation as per the availability of fodder and other vegetation, and stay on for several months. The flocks are taken away for grazing during the day within a radius of 5km from the camp to make the return in the evening easier. The grown up children of the herdsmen join them during vacations in the school. A laggard soon joins the herdsman to follow the age-old tradition. Women and children are taken care of by a couple of elderly persons in the Dera while the herdsmen are away for grazing. Sheep keep healthy and happy in dry season, but despise wet surroundings or rains. Heavy rains, in fact, bring a change in the mood of both the herdsmen and the sheep. While men feel melancholy, the sheep flock together and stand perched on high lands until they shed the last raindrops dangling from their hair. The morass and sticky land damages their hoofs and skin. To experience the same, this June, this writer followed them from dawn to dusk one day. The day began with heavy rains, was followed by scorching heat and ended when the stars lit up the sky. Being a nomad isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.

No benefits

During the 12th five-year, the government of India had set a target of covering 1, 30,000 shepherds and less than a million sheep under the Sheep Breeder’s Insurance Scheme. However, the data about the final outcome could not be known. A large number of sheep and shepherds remained excluded from the beneficiary schemes despite the fact that the Central Wool Development Board releases grant money to NGOs for their welfare.

Trump unveils a fresh Af-Pak policy,"Trump unveils a fresh Af-Pak policy

Maj Gen Ashok K. Mehta (retd)

Even as Trump takes the hard line against Pakistan backing certain terror groups, there are many US generals who do not wish to antagonise Afghanistan’s neighbour.





Maj Gen Ashok K. Mehta (retd) The legendary Trump tantrums and tweets have so convulsed the White House that a four-star Marine General, John Kelly, in charge of Homeland Security, had to be transferred to the White House as Chief of Staff to maintain dignity and decorum and keep strategic policy-making insulated from chaos. Take Afghanistan, or Af-Pak. Inter-agency wrangles — between Pentagon, State Department, national security establishment and the CIA — have delayed the Af-Pak policy document. It was due in April but was put on hold as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wanted to re-hyphenate Afghanistan with Pakistan. Gen John Nicholson, US Commander, Resolute Force, in Kabul, who was in Delhi last month, had been told to expect the strategic directive latest by July 18. Instead, on July 19, in a stormy meeting of top generals at the White House presided over by Trump, he demanded to know why the war in Afghanistan was not being won even after 16 years, 2,740 US lives and USD 1 tn. According to one insider account, Trump wanted Nicholson sacked and replaced with his National Security Advisor, serving Lt Gen HR McMaster. The President’s NSC has met thrice seeking out-of-the-box ideas. Trump had famously told visiting President Xi Jinping over dinner that he had left the war-fighting to the generals. At the July 19 meeting, Trump did not encounter any unconventional thinking, but was presented three widely accepted options — status quo, ramping up force levels, investing in a political solution. It seems he is incensed with Pakistan for consistently ‘not cooperating’ — after reviewing punitive policy recommendations made by Sen. John McCain, chairman, Senate Armed Forces Committee, following a brief visit last month to Pakistan; former Congressman Larry Pressler; and Lisa Curtis, Senior Director for South and Central Asia at the White House NSC. Trump is likely to get tough with Pakistan. The message loud and clear from the White House was conveyed last week by McMaster to Pakistani generals. That Trump will not tolerate any support to terrorists, Pakistan has to change its paradoxical policy of supporting the Taliban, Haqqanis and other groups and has to stop those providing safe havens and support bases to these groups. The bottom line is changing the behaviour of the deep state, which no US Administration has been able to achieve. Trump wants to win an unwinnable war hoping a tough and punitive policy on Pakistan’s non-compliance may open the door for better or worse in bringing a chastened Taliban/Haqqani network to the negotiating table. At the last count, the Taliban were in control of 95 of Afghanistan’s 407 districts. While McMaster is echoing Trump’s hard line, there are many generals, including Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Dunford who do not wish to antagonise Pakistan and doubt whether a punitive approach can alter the behaviour of the Rawalpindi generals. Eventually, the hard line could prevail but how it gets operationalised will be worth watching. The security situation in Afghanistan is worsening by the day as Kabul awaits Trump’s Ten Commandments. While at the strategic level there is a stalemate, at the tactical level advantage is with the Taliban and their affiliates. Earlier in the year, National Security Adviser Hanif Atmar, speaking at the IDSA, New Delhi, had said that the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were losing on an average 29 soldiers a day fighting Taliban, Haqqanis and the ISIS. In comparison, Indian losses in Kashmir for all of 2016 were 95 combatants. Last three months have witnessed the most horrendous attacks ever — biggest truck bomb explosion in Kabul and the largest assault on an army camp in Balkh province killing hundreds of civilians and soldiers. These have sapped the confidence of Afghans who came on the streets demanding security from the National Unity government (NUG) riven with differences and afflicted by corruption. Meanwhile, the NUG has evolved a four-year (2017-2020) roadmap for enhancing ANSF fighting capabilities as agreed at the Warsaw Nato summit this May. The Americans and the West pay almost the entire cost of Afghanistan security and economy. Pentagon’s latest report on Afghanistan states that India is the most reliable friend of the Kabul regime. Prime Minister Modi has repeatedly said that India will stick with Afghanistan through thick and thin. During last week’s US-India Forum at New Delhi, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj lauded sacrifices made by the US in preserving the gains of the last 16 years, including peace, security and democracy in Afghanistan. New Delhi’s development assistance for Afghanistan is worth USD 3 bn and is the largest to any country other than Bhutan. Pakistan is the stick in the mud. Atmar had made plain that defeat of the Taliban was possible only if the Taliban and Haqqani sanctuaries were dismantled. He claimed that the Afghan Special Forces were the best in the world and the war could be taken to the sanctuaries. Senator Ted Poe has listed two legislations, one declaring Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism and the other withdrawing the privileged status of Most Favoured Non-Nato Ally. Trump advisers are convinced that only coercion and raising the costs for Pakistan will work. Besides curtaining funding, hard options such as surgical strikes against sanctuaries and targeted drone strikes to take out the Taliban and Haqqani leadership are on the table. Since 2004, when drone strikes first started against Pakistan, 428 strikes have taken place, the last on July 3 in South Waziristan against ISIS targets. On June 13, US drones struck in Hangu district of Khyber Pakhtunwa, killing Abu Baqar Haqqani, in Pakistan beyond the drone-permissible tribal belt area. This is the second attack outside the agreed drone-strike areas, the last being in Balochistan which took out Taliban supremo Mullah Mansour last year. It is estimated that approximately 1,200 to 1,600 terrorists have been killed in drone attacks. Will the drone strikes extend to Taliban and Haqqani sanctuaries on Pakistani soil? Will Afghanistan Special Forces assisted by US Rangers conduct surgical strikes against safe havens? A Trump authorisation for either or both these options can be a game-changer. While admiring the chocolate cream dessert at the banquet for Xi, Trump informed him that Cruise Missiles had just attacked the Syrian airbase from where chemical attacks were launched by Assad forces in Syria. How far can Trump go to tame Pakistan to get out of Afghanistan? The long awaited policy directive will conceal more than it will reveal!

"HUDA to pay Rs 3,800 cr for land by first week of Sept","Sushil Manav

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 10

Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) today announced that it would clear all pending original awards for the land acquired by it in the state by the first week of September. HUDA was scheduled to pay over Rs 3,800 crore to 36,931 landowners. Facing a severe financial crunch, HUDA had taken loans from banks to clear dues of landowners. Sources said while Rs 3,600 crore had already been received, a further loan of Rs 4,000 crore would be received soon. HUDA had already uploaded on its official website a combined priority list of 36,931 farmers to whom it owed Rs 3,800.41 crore as compensation for the land acquired for development of residential or commercial sites. Of this, Rs 2,055.54 crore was payable to 6,104 landowners in the Gurugram-Rewari zone, Rs 988.91 crore to 13,404 in Rohtak zone, Rs 315.35 crore to 8,998 in Panchkula zone, Rs 221 crore to 4,216 in Hisar zone and Rs 219.61 crore to 4,209 persons in Faridabad zone. “Though it is named as a priority list, I want to make it clear that there is no priority as such in case of original awards. We have enough funds at our disposal to clear all these dues. Whosoever comes first will get the payment first,” said J Ganesan, Chief Administrator, HUDA. He said the persons whose names appeared in the list could submit relevant documents as well as their bank account details with the Land Acquisition Officers (LAOs) of their respective zones and the money would be deposited in their accounts immediately. “The disbursal of payments has already started. I sanctioned payments worth Rs 140 crore today to persons who had submitted their documents,” Ganesan said. He said LAOs were told not to delay any case as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was particular about making payments as soon as possible. He said once the payments HUDA owed to landowners for original awards were cleared, it would proceed to clear dues of enhancement ordered by courts. The enhanced awards would be paid on the basis of priority list and not on a first-come-first-served basis, he stated. Asked how much HUDA owed to landowners towards enhancement ordered by various courts, Ganesan said a combined priority list would be prepared soon. Sources said the enhanced award amounts could be more than the original compensation dues."
SoftBank puts $2.5 bn into Flipkart’s wallet,"New Delhi, August 10

Flipkart has raised an estimated $2.5 billion from SoftBank Vision Fund, making the fund created by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank one of the biggest shareholders of India’s largest e-commerce player. “This is the biggest ever private investment in an Indian technology company,” Flipkart said without disclosing the sum invested. The investment will make the $100 billion Vision Fund one of the largest shareholders in Flipkart, the e-tailer said. People familiar with the deal said the investment is worth $2.5 billion, with about $1.5 billion being directly funneled into Flipkart and $1 billion for part of Tiger Global Management’s stake. The SoftBank Vision Fund, the world’s largest technology-focused fund, will get about 20% stake in Flipkart, they said. The investment, which comes less than two weeks after Snapdeal dropped merger talks with its bigger rival, will swell Flipkart’s cash holdings to more than $4 billion. Snapdeal is backed by SoftBank. The investment is part of the financing round announced in April this year where Tiger Global-backed Flipkart had raised $1.4 billion from Tencent, Microsoft and eBay. At that time, Flipkart was valued at $11.6 billion. With the latest funding, Flipkart is estimated to have raised well over $5 billion to date. For Flipkart, the funding provides it with more arsenal to compete with Amazon. The two companies have been locked in an intense battle for leadership in the burgeoning Indian e-commerce market. “India has a thriving internet market with close to 500 million internet users and as per market research, the Indian e-commerce market is expected to grow at a five-year CAGR in excess of 30%,” the statement said. The funding round further solidifies Flipkart’s balance sheet and will help accelerate investment in driving continued market leadership, it added. Amazon and Flipkart have been pumping in millions of dollars to strengthen infrastructure as well as bring more sellers and buyers online. While Flipkart has now raised close to $4 billion this year, Amazon pumped in about $600 million across various units in India since January this year. “This is a monumental deal for Flipkart and India. Very few economies globally attract such overwhelming interest from top-tier investors,” Flipkart co-founders Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal said. Masayoshi Son, founder, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, said India is a land of vast opportunity. “We want to support innovative companies that are clear winners in India because they are best positioned to leverage technology and help people lead better lives. As the pioneers in Indian e-commerce, Flipkart is doing that every day,” he added. — PTI"

Born in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Milkha Singh was orphaned and rendered a refugee by the riots at Partition. He got into the Indian Army in 1952 and ran his first race a fortnight later — it was not a great beginning, for Milkha had to stop to rest after half-a-mile before continuing. But his love for running shaped his extraordinary training regimen, which included running in all kinds of terrain, and sprinting next to speeding trains. In 1958, he won gold medals in the 200m and 400m events at the Asian Games, and the 400m gold at the Commonwealth Games the same year. But the legend of Milkha was created in the 1960 Rome Olympics, when he missed the bronze by a whisker. In the run-up to the Olympics, he had beaten all the world’s best quarter-milers, except Otis Davis of the US, and was a favourite to win a medal. In the final, he burst off the blocks with tremendous power and took the early lead but, at the 200m, slowed down a bit and even turned to look at the competitors. This was a fatal mistake: He was quickly overtaken and could finish only fourth.Eleven years after Independence, India had its first world champion. Wilson Jones, son of a Welshman, was good at hockey and cricket too, but found fame at the billiards table. After early years of struggle in the World Amateur Billiards Championship, he finally triumphed in 1958 in Kolkata. He was immediately hailed as a national hero, and he paid back his admirers by winning his second world title.Arati Saha became the first woman from Asia to swim across the English Channel, from Cape Gris Nez in France to Sandgate in England. Saha, a precocious talent who had participated in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, presented the face of the new Indian woman to the West, and provided a role model to women in India when she raised the Indian flag at Sandgate on September 29, 1959.Ramanathan Krishnan, who is still the greatest tennis player from India, reached the semifinals of the Wimbledon Championships in 1960, and repeated the feat the next year. Krishnan had announced his arrival seven years earlier when, as a 16-year-old, he was India’s hero in a lost cause against Belgium in their Davis Cup tie in 1953. He won the junior title at Wimbledon next year, and the London Lawn Tennis Championship in 1959. In both his Wimbledon semifinals, Krishnan had the tough luck of running into the eventual winner, Neale Fraser and Rod Laver. No other Indian player has reached the semifinals of a Grand Slam in singles.

The second visit by a Pakistan team for a Test series raised excitement, but the cricket was dull and uninspiring. All the five Tests were drawn, and each of the 15 first class matches played by the visitors, too, ended in a draw. After this series, India and Pakistan played 12 drawn Tests in a row. It was clear the teams were very defensive in the mindset, unwilling to take a chance — Pakistan’s batsmen scored at 35 runs per 100 balls, India’s at 39 runs per 100 balls. Pakistan notched up five 100s, and India answered with four, three of them by Polly Umrigar.

He touched the 6,000-point mark at age 18 and won the gold medal at the 1962 Asian Games, where he was named the best athlete of the event. Then, out of the blue, he quit decathlon and began to focus only on the 110m hurdles, where his timing was consistently in the world’s top-10. After winning his heat, he timed 14 seconds in the semifinals to make the final; in the final, Randhawa ran his heart out and again timed 14 seconds, good enough for the fifth place.

Indian-origin activist places giant inflatable 'Trump chicken' near White House,"Washington

A giant inflatable chicken with a Donald Trump hair style has been placed near the White House by an Indian-origin activist to protest the president's stand on releasing his tax returns, dealing with North Korea and engaging with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Taran Singh Brar, a documentary filmmaker, placed the ""Chicken Don"" in the lawn, just south of the White House and near the Washington Monument with due permission from the National Park Service and the Secret Service. ""The tallest thing they usually allow on the Ellipse is the national Christmas tree,"" he said. ""They gave me a waiver for the 30-foot tall Chicken Don."" ""Trump is too chicken to release his tax returns, to stand up to Putin,"" he told the local media. ""We are out here to criticise our president for being weak and ineffective as a leader and being too afraid to release his tax returns, too afraid to stand up to Putin and now engaged in a game of chicken with Kim Jong Un,"" Brar was quoted as saying by the Washington Examiner. ""Yet he wants a military parade in DC. It's all incongruous, and we are here to make fun of him for that,"" Brar said. according to whom the angry-looking chicken which has golden-orange hair and hand gestures in Trump's style is available for purchase on eBay for USD 1,500. Early this year, Brar started an online fund raising campaign for this unique protest. ""Hey everybody! We are raising money to bring Chicken Don to the White House. Help the Chicken cross the road... Pennsylvania Avenue,"" he wrote on his fund raising post Chicken March. ""We think the coward squawking in the White House is too chicken to show his tax returns, too chicken to stand up to Putin, and too chicken to face the press. We've been inflating Chicken Don in his backyard so he knows no one is scared but him,"" Brar said. Trump, however, has missed the chicken protest as he has been staying at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. His absence probably made Brar's protest easier. ""I realised it's actually better, because the symbolism works and the Secret Service won't be as jumpy,"" Brar said.

Pak’s ‘Mother Teresa’ Dr Ruth Pfau no more,"Karachi, August 10

Dr Ruth Pfau, a German doctor popularly known as Pakistan’s ‘Mother Teresa’ for dedicating her life to eradicate leprosy in the country, died today at a private hospital in Karachi. She was 87. She died after a prolonged age-related illness. Dr Pfau first visited Pakistan in 1960 and was so touched by the plight of leprosy victims that she decided to stay forever in the country to treat them. The nun founded the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi in 1962 and later set up its branches in all provinces of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan, and treated over 50,000 families. Due to her tireless efforts, the World Health Organisation in 1996 declared Pakistan one of the first countries in Asia to be free of leprosy. She was born in 1929 in Germany and lived through the horrors of the World War II. Pfau joined the Society of Daughters of the Heart of Mary and was assigned to go to India but landed in Karachi for a brief stay due to some visa problems. Her interaction with leprosy patients in the port city motivated her to change the plan and stay rest of life in Pakistan to help the patients. She was 29 when landed in Karachi for the first time. She was awarded the Hilal-e-Imtiaz — Pakistan’s second highest civilian award — in 1979, the Hilal-e-Pakistan in 1989. She was also awarded the Staufer Medal at the German consulate Karachi in 2015. The funeral mass will be held on August 19 at St Patrick’s Cathedral, and thereafter will be laid to rest in the Christian Cemetery (Gora Qabristan). The German embassy said in a statement that German ambassador Martin Kobler expressed his heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the representative of the Maria Adelaide Leprosy Centre. “With great concern we have got the sad massage of the death of Dr Ruth Pfau. She was a devoted Christian nun and a member of the society of Daughters of the Heart of Mary. We are losing with her an important symbol of the German Pakistan friendship. Her services will never be forgotten.” — PTI"
Kidnapped infant found dead,"Our Correspondent

UNA, AUGUST 10

The 37-day-old infant Harman Deep, who was allegedly snatched from his mother from Rakkar Colony near Una, was found dead. His body was recovered from a water channel, about 70 metres from their house, today. The police have sent the body for the post-mortem examination at Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College in Tanda and registered a case against unknown persons. The infant’s mother Rajinder Kaur told the police that two masked men had kidnapped the child on Wednesday afternoon. The kidnappers snatched the child from her while she was sitting in the courtyard of her house. The police and neighbours launched a search for the abductors and the child. A team of forensic experts, led by Dr Meenakshi Mahajan from the forensic lab situated in Dharamsala, visited the crime scene and collected the evidence. According to Additional SP Madan Lal, a local resident Sukh Dev first spotted the body and informed the police. The ASP said a case under Section 302 had been registered."
Public art in private hands,"The sale of antiquities legally excavated is just as ethically problematic as those likely looted

Alice Stevenson

Illicit antiquities are once again in the headlines. US retailer Hobby Lobby was recently fined $3m ( Rs 19.22 cr) for illegally acquiring antiquities that were most likely looted from Iraq. Collectors and museums are therefore being reminded to undertake due diligence in checking collections’ histories before purchasing cultural property. The implication here is, of course, that when the item on the auction block has been legally excavated and diligently recorded by archaeologists, there isn’t a problem. This is an enormous mistake. Such sales may be legal, but they are still ethically problematic. At its most direct, the public auction of archaeologically procured finds puts those objects at risk of disappearing into the private domain, where their integrity is no longer assured. There are no international legal protections, no “obligations of ownership”, for cultural property in private possession. More broadly, the legal status of these sales confers an air of legitimacy to the antiquities trade. However, one looks at it as a “grey trade”. Illicit antiquities — that is things without provenance, accompanied by fake documents or with opaque ownership histories — are likely to be offered at the same sales.

Inflating prices

The origin of items offered by auction houses is supposed to be subjected to close scrutiny. This seems reassuring, but there’s a worry that the records of discovery made by archaeologists now not only certifies auction lots, but also inflates their worth. And this in a wider art market where prices have never been higher and is at risk of severe overheating. Whether they covet old masters or ancient pots, many bidders seek to acquire cultural capital, not out of some sort of honed connoisseurship or a sense of societal patronage, but as immediate monetary investments. Exceptional prices are translated into headline news, reducing heritage to economic value and undermining attempts to promote meaningful engagements with the past. Sales from museums in this context threaten public trust in them. These exorbitant prices and their media profile fuel market demand and become an incentive for looting. When heritage is sold by and for the privileged, it is those that live in proximity to archaeological sites that stand to lose the most. It denies source communities the long-term touristic potential of sites. Looting can have devastating consequences. Well-meaning efforts to protect heritage in situ have been advocated, but there needs to be more recognition that the problem often begins and ends in Europe, North America and Asia.

Public to private

Despite these problems, sales of “licit” archaeological finds are still seen as unproblematic. Just how embedded this problem is can be seen from a case from 2014, when two lots of Egyptian antiquities from the Archaeological Institute of America (AIAs) St Louis Chapter were offered for sale at Bonhams, London. Lot 160 was billed as “the treasure of Harageh” and comprised a group of 4,000-year-old stone vessels and rare examples of inlaid silver jewellery. Lot 162 was made up of a single stone headrest. The former was removed from auction following the intercession of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a private sale to it for an undisclosed sum, while the latter exceeded its estimated price at auction and disappeared into private hands. These artefacts were originally discovered during excavations conducted under the auspices of Flinders Petrie’s British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), who had regulations on where objects should go. The finds were legally removed from Egypt, they were fully documented, duly published by the BSAE and a few delivered to the St Louis Museum in 1914 under the understanding that these were for public benefit. A century later, the St Louis AIA branch contravened that agreement. The objects could have been donated to another institution capable of ensuring their long-term care and public accessibility. Instead, they went straight to the auction house.

Time to speak out

When the auction was announced, a colleague and I condemned it in a public statement [The writer is a senior lecturer in museum studies at University College London]. But many believed our reaction was melodramatic. For them, the sale was completely above board. It did not even breach AIA’s own ethical codes, which at the time only denounced the “trade in undocumented artifacts”. But given the problematic implications of selling material on the open market, we must be vocal in denouncing instances in which archaeological heritage is commercialised in this way. This is especially important given the current ideology of austerity in many countries, leading to concerns that institutions may begin to consider their public collections as assets rather than as cultural obligations. Yet museums still dispose of heritage from other countries on the open market. Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio sold ancient Egyptian artefacts from its founding collection in winter 2016 through Christie’s. We have a moral obligation to challenge these sales. Millions of artefacts have been excavated and exported by rich nations from developing countries whose own resources are now stretched as they attempt to halt the destructive looting of their heritage. We should be responsible and accountable on their behalf for material we excavated and exported. We should not condone those that seek financial profit from the past, which is the sole objective of auction houses.— The Independent"
"Minorities not ‘insecure’, Naidu debunks view as propaganda","New Delhi, August 10

M Venkaiah Naidu, the Vice-President-elect, today rejected as “political propaganda” the view that there is a sense of insecurity among minorities in the country, apparently a rejoinder to outgoing Vice-President Hamid Ansari. A day before he takes oath as next Vice-President, he said his advice to politicians was not to drag communities into politics. Though Naidu did not name anyone, his comments are seen a response to Ansari’s remarks in a TV interview that there is unease and a sense of insecurity among the Muslims and that “ambience of acceptance” is under threat.“Some people are saying minorities are insecure. It is a political propaganda... Minorities are more safe and secure in India (than anywhere else) and they get their due,” Naidu said. He disagreed with the view that there was growing intolerance, saying Indian society was the most tolerant in the world because of its people and civilisation. “There is tolerance. That is why democracy is so successful,” he said. The former BJP president cautioned against creating a divide in the nation by singling out one community, saying it would draw an adverse reaction from other communities. “If you single out one community, other communities will take it otherwise. That is why we say all are equal. Appeasement for none, justice for all,” the 68-year-old leader said. “They (minorities) held prominent positions, including constitutional responsibilities, because there is no discrimination,” he said. Ansari had spoken of “unease” among minorities in the backdrop of incidents of violence by self-proclaimed cow protectors. — PTI"
Martial arts came in handy for Varnika: Father,"All four members of Kundu family black belt in choi kwang do

Panchkula, August 10

Girls should hit first, and hit hard

Hit the attacker on the nose, eye or on the neck, and with full force

Use your kick or knee, and hit in the groin area of the attacker

Use your vehicle key to hit the attacker on the face

“Martial arts training gave confidence to Varnika to tackle the situation with her presence of mind,” says stalking victim Varnika’s father VS Kundu, a senior IAS officer of the Haryana cadre. Kundu, a second-degree black belt holder, says Varnika is a first-degree black belt holder in choi kwang do. Kundu’s wife Sucheta and their two daughters — Varnika and Satvika — all are first-degree black belt holders in choi kwang do. Kundu’s message is that people should train their children, especially girls, in martial arts as it gives them confidence to handle such situations. Varnika’s coach Bikram Thapa, a sixth-degree black belt holder who runs an academy in Sector 16, Panchkula, says Varnika is like his daughter and he is happy that she is safe. Thapa says the way Varnika reversed her car and used her presence of mind to call the Police Control Room clearly shows the control she has over her body and mind, which ultimately helped her. “A normal person would have shivered and panicked, but Varnika kept her cool and handled the situation well. In martial arts, we not only teach how to deal with attackers physically but also that presence of mind is a key factor,” says 44-year-old Thapa. “We always teach students to use ‘body force’ to hit the attackers. Girls can use their hair clip, vehicle key or pen to hit the attacker. The girls should not fear and should handle the situation with confidence,” says Thapa.

Family shows the way

Martial arts coach Bikram Singh Thapa says Kundu’s is the first family in the region all members of which have been awarded a black belt.

How it all started

Initially, Kundu’s younger daughter Satvika joined the martial arts classes. Later, seeing Satvika practise, all family members joined the classes. Mother Sucheta also taught martial arts to destitute children at Bal Niketan, Sector 2, and Bal Sadan, Sector 12-A, in Panchkula. VS Kundu is now the president of the Choi Kwang Do Federation of India whereas Bikram Thapa is the general secretary."

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment.

[ + read story ]

Anil Chopra

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment. However, there are certain fundamental principles of investing which are universally applicable to “one and all”. These principles are also referred as “Thumb Rules” in general parlance.

We are sharing below certain thumb rules which must be kept in mind before making investment/financial decisions.

How much should YOU save

Your monthly savings must be at least 30% of your take home salary/income. Take home salary is computed as net salary after statutory deductions like provident fund and TDS etc. For example, if your gross monthly income is Rs 1 lakh and your take home salary after tax/PF is Rs 70,000 then you must save at least Rs 21,000 every month for investing in your medium to long term goals.

Savings account

Not more than two times of your monthly household budget expenses. If your household expenses budget is Rs 50,000 pm, you should not keep more than Rs 1 lakh balance in your savings account. Please remember that generally savings bank accounts earn interest @ 4% pa and that is not enough even to beat inflation.

Investment in gold

Ideal allocation to gold is around 10% of your financial portfolio.

Financial portfolio includes bank balance, fixed deposits, post office schemes, mutual funds, bonds, shares and stocks etc.

Accordingly, if your financial portfolio (without adding the value of house) is Rs 1 crore, maximum exposure to gold including Gold Mutual Fund or Gold ETF should be Rs 10 lakh. If your investment in gold is less than 10% of your financial portfolio, you may invest in Gold ETF or Gold Mutual Funds rather than buying physical gold which carries risk of being stolen. On the other hand, if your current investment is higher than 10% of your financial portfolio, then at least do not make any fresh investment in gold until your financial portfolio grows and exposure to gold comes down to around 10%.

Allocation to equity

Thumb rule for investing in equity is “100 minus your age” should be the allocation to equity. For example, if your age is 30 years, you may invest up to 70% (100 – 30) of your savings into equity through Equity Mutual Fund Schemes of reputed Asset Management Companies.

Similarly, if your current age is 60 years, you should not invest more than 40% (100–60) of your savings in equity-oriented schemes. As your age continues to grow, you should reduce your exposure to equity.

Debt schemes

As already mentioned, around 10% should be invested in gold, 100 minus your age should be invested in equity and balance should be invested in debt schemes like PPF, debt mutual funds, FMP, bonds, bank deposits etc. For example, if your current age is 50 years then you should invest 50% in equity (100–50), 10% in gold and balance 40% in various debt instruments.

Life insurance coverage

The thumb rule for life insurance coverage amount is at least seven times of your annual income. If your annual salary package is Rs 15 lakh, you must have “sum assured” of at least Rs 1 crore in one or more life insurance plans, including term plan, ULIPs and traditional plans.

Health insurance

For single individual, with no dependents, health insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh is enough. However, for any couple with or without kids, health insurance coverage should be for minimum Rs 5 lakh and if your old parents are also alive and dependent on you then you must take a family floater plan of Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual funds

If your monthly savings is Rs 10,000, you must have minimum two SIPs of Rs 5,000 each. One in large cap and another mid cap. If your monthly savings is Rs 25,000, you should have five SIPs of Rs 5,000 each out of which two should be large cap, one mid cap, one flexi cap and the last one can be in sectoral SIP like banking or infrastructure etc.

Portfolio review

The thumb rule for reviewing the portfolio is once every three months if your portfolio is larger than Rs 50 lakh and at least twice a year if your portfolio is less than Rs 50 lakh.

Above thumb rules are shared for reference purpose only and to ensure that you should not go “off course” in your journey of wealth creation and achievement of your financial goals. You must consult a certified financial planner or a subject matter expert for taking important financial decisions.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

05 Aug 2017 | 11:28 AM

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished.

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."
The Maratha march,"The Maratha march

Address upper-caste sense of grievance

Also in this section

Dangerous trail

After the Jat agitation in Haryana and the Patidar protest in Gujarat, the Maratha march in Maharashtra is another demonstration of the land-owning upper castes' sense of grievance over their perceived marginalisation. There is a growing feeling among the once socially, economically and politically dominant sections of society that they are falling behind in an acquisitive culture. Rightly or wrongly, they believe that pro-reservation politics played since the Mandal agitation and pro-market policies, unleashed since 1991, have left them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis other castes. Their children resent the denial of admission in institutions of repute and see jobs being snatched from them through an unfair practice of reservation. The increasing loss of political and economic influence has forced these once privileged sections of society to unite and come out in the streets. Since they depend largely on land, poor returns from agriculture have shrunk their incomes. Government-dictated MSPs, cutting down of subsidies and pro-consumer policies have turned agriculture into a loss-making venture. Farmer unrest is a countrywide phenomenon today, though protests and suicides are limited to a few states. Parties across the political spectrum have over the years wooed the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the backward classes with reservations in jobs and educational institutions, and this has created a sense of grievance among those who belong to a higher caste but are living at a subsistence level. It is not without reason that the protesters distrust politicians. Barring Hardik Patel in Gujarat, the movement has no recognisable face or leadership but the protest organisers in all the three states do not let politicians take the centre stage. This loss of faith in the political class stands out in almost every pro-reservation farmer agitation. The political leadership in general and that in the BJP-ruled states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana in particular has a difficult task of managing upper-caste aspirations and resentments. While the importance of affirmative action for the underprivileged cannot be ignored, political maturity is required to balance the conflicting demands and interests since social harmony is at stake. It needs to be understood that consumption-driven, jobless growth, encouraged by flawed policies, has created the situation."
