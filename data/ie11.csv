Cracks are showing in what has been a virtually non-stop U.S. equity rally after a rapid escalation of tension between North Korea and the United States this week. Market analysts expect that the pullback in stocks due to the increasingly aggressive tone in exchanges between Washington and Pyongyang will continue, although investors hope that the selling will not escalate to a correction – a decline of 10 percent or more.

The benchmark S&P 500 index tumbled more than 1 percent on Thursday, only the third time this year it has fallen that much, while the Nasdaq shed more than 2 percent.

“Markets are looking for any reason at all for a reset. That reset is being triggered by North Korea geopolitical concern and stretched valuations,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. “I do think we could see markets pull back between 1 and 5 percent.”

The S&P is trading near its most expensive valuation level since 2004, as measured by the price-to-12-month forward earnings ratio.

U.S. stocks have risen week after week this year – with the S&P up more than 9 percent – in extremely low volatility, as strong corporate earnings and an improving global economy offset disappointment that U.S. President Donald Trump’s promises to lower corporate taxes and implement a massive infrastructure spending have so far failed to see the light of day.

Until this week, the equity market had managed to shake off negative news, including previous saber-rattling over North Korea and failures in Washington to pass high-profile bills, such as repealing and replacing Obamacare.

But although U.S. equities on Wednesday managed to close only slightly down even after Trump’s warning that “fire and fury” would rain on North Korea, on Thursday the chickens came home to roost on Wall Street.

More than 430 stocks from all U.S. exchanges hit their lowest levels in 52 weeks or more on Thursday, the most for any session since mid-November right after Trump was elected. The average for new 52-week lows this year is about 230 per day.

“The easy money has already been made,” said Joel Kulina, senior vice president of institutional cash equities at Wedbush Securities in New York. “I’m looking selectively at the pullbacks, but my gut is that we could be in for a bumpy ride for the next couple of months or so.”

Many market participants have been calling for a significant decline on the S&P 500.

“A pullback is good so the market doesn’t get unidirectional. This is a normal fluctuation, it just seems so odd because we have hardly had any volatility,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.

If the decline continues, Paulsen said, it will be “a good buying opportunity. I’d look into energy, materials, industrials, tech and financials. I think before the end of the year the market goes to new highs and (Treasury) yields go higher.”

The benchmark U.S. yield on Thursday was just above 2.2 percent, at its lowest level since late June, as investors bought up Treasuries, a classic safe harbor. Yields on bonds move inversely to their price.

And in a textbook-type cross-asset move toward safety in times of trouble, the Japanese yen hit an eight-week high against the U.S. dollar while spot gold also reached a two-month high.

The CBOE Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose the most in about 12 weeks.

The index ended up 4.93 points at 16.04, the highest level since Nov. 8, when Trump was elected president.

In an inversion of the curve, the spot VIX rose above VIX futures, meaning traders are paying more for protection against a sudden sharp drop on the S&P than for protection in the future.

“We’re not very oversold yet so the market still has more downside left to it,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York.

“We’re still close to the all-time high so that makes people a little nervous too, so they might say now might be the time to take a little bit of money off the table.

"These five Indian laws owe their origin to British, but are still in practice","Steeped in European culture and practices, a number of these legal codes saw themselves being adopted in Indian society and being in existence long after the colonial powers had left. (Wikimedia commons) Steeped in European culture and practices, a number of these legal codes saw themselves being adopted in Indian society and being in existence long after the colonial powers had left. (Wikimedia commons)

The birth of independent India was immediately followed by a need for an adequate mechanism of governance, indigenous in its nature and yet acceptable and sensitive to the needs and customs of the large multitude of castes, classes, religious and linguistic communities it was trying to tie up together. Unsurprisingly then, for the new government, continuance of the judicial system put together by the British was a compromise formula that worked best then. Steeped in European culture and practices, a number of these legal codes saw themselves being adopted in Indian society and being in existence long after the colonial powers had left.

Ten years into independence, the Law Commission of India in its fifth report on the British statutes applicable in India stated, “While India remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the only trace of the old ties is the fact that the Crown is regarded by India as the symbolic Head of the Commonwealth.” No longer tied with the United Kingdom, the Commission suggested that India could have a new set of legal Code and if a British statute is sought useful, it could be replaced by a corresponding Indian statute, having necessary provisions from the British law.

Though 1200 archaic laws were scrapped in bulk, Indians are still following many obsolete laws that have been prevalent from the time of British colonial rule. A majority of the laws over which the Indian judiciary relies upon are derived from colonial times.

Here are some of the archaic laws that we continue to follow even now:

Criminalisation of homosexuality

The criminalisation of homosexuality or what is popularly referred to as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) dates back to 1860 when the British introduced it as sexual activities against the “order of nature.” The section has been much in controversy since 2009 when the High Court decriminalised it. Later, in 2012, however, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and homosexuality continues to be a criminal offence in India. The roots of the legality, however, can be found in European culture which for a long time had influenced Indian ways and thoughts.

In 1842, British court termed the act of homosexulaity as “nasty, wicked, filthy, lewd, beastly, unnatural and sodomitic practices.” (Wikimedia commons) In 1842, British court termed the act of homosexulaity as “nasty, wicked, filthy, lewd, beastly, unnatural and sodomitic practices.” (Wikimedia commons)

The stigma attached to homosexuality in Europe dates back to the 11th and 12th centuries when categories of people like lepers, witches, prostitutes and sodomists were considered to be carriers of contamination. The contamination was believed to threaten Europe’s sexual identity and it was considered necessary to include sodomy laws wherever colonisation was in effect.

As early as 1825, laws related to sexual offences had come into existence under the leadership of the then Chairman of the Law Commission Thomas Babington Macaulay. In 1842, British court termed the act of homosexuality as “nasty, wicked, filthy, lewd, beastly, unnatural and sodomitic practices,” to which the defence raised objections on the vagueness of the crime and said that mere adjectives did not provide clarity of the crime.

In light of the sepoy mutiny of 1857, the “Offences against the Person Act” was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1861 which went on to define homosexuality as “unnatural offences”, an inspiration to the provision present under the IPC. Macaulay introduced two clauses defining “Unnatural Offences” based on whether the act was consensual or non-consensual. The clause further dropped the value of consent, and is what it reads today as Section 377 of IPC, 1860.

Ironically, England made homosexuality partially legal and repealed its 1885 law, introducing the Sexual Offences Act, 1967, which amended the previous law criminalizing homosexuality.

Sedition law

Section 124A of IPC was recently used against the youth of the JawaharLal Nehru University (JNU) which resulted in arrest of the two for voicing their thoughts in favour of the separatist, Afzal Guru. Since then, the provision has been slapped on many and in July 2017 the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) recorded 165 arrests made on the charge of sedition in the last three years.

War against the King, compelling him to amend his policies or to intimidate the Parliament was considered an offence in England under the Treason Act, 1795. During the lifetime of King Charles II, sedition had its genesis under the Treason Act.

In the context of colonial India, sedition was first introduced in 1835 and was legally made into a criminal offence in 1870. Nationalist leader Bal Gangadhar Tilak was among the first few to face the brunt of the British law. According to the Bombay High Court archive, two British soldiers were murdered in Pune by some Brahmin youths who were allegedly instigated by Tilak’s public speeches. Charged with sedition twice, Tilak was released after completing a sentence of 18 months for the first trial and was sentenced six years for an editorial published in his newspaper, Kesari.

Terming sedition as the “prince among the political sections,” M K Gandhi considered sedition designed to suppress the liberty of citizens when he was brought in court for his articles in Young India magazine in 1922.

An amendment was made to the law and the word ‘sedition’ was dropped from the statute on December 2, 1948 when senior Congress leader, Seth Govind Das spoke in the house, “I believe they (British government) remember that this section was specially framed for securing the conviction of Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Since then, many of us have been convicted under this section.”

Although the term sedition vanished constitutionally, but it remained under IPC as Section 124A.

Blasphemy law

Controversial for curtailing freedom of speech, Section 295A of the IPC has been time and again imposed for banning publication of several books and other content. After the infamous lawsuit against Wendy Doniger’s book, ‘The Hindus: An Alternative History,’ there have been uncountable debates concerning Article 19(2) (fundamental rights) of the Indian Constitution.

The blasphemy law was inherited from the British colonial government during Punjab’s religious uprising and repeal of the Press Act in 1920, when Muslims violently protested against a publication, Rangeela Rasool. The publication included information of Prophet Mohammed’s private life vastly offending Muslims. Charged under Section 153A of the IPC, the Lahore High Court did not consider the same an offence against the author under the said section but added a clause to Section 295 of the IPC. Publishing pamphlets having content that might hurt religious sentiments of a community was made an offence under the additional clause.

Rangeela Rasool included information of Prophet Mohammed’s private life vastly offending Muslims. Rangeela Rasool included information of Prophet Mohammed’s private life vastly offending Muslims.

Following the communal tensions, the British considered this a grave lacuna not having a law modulating religious violence. While drafting the provision, the drafting committee raised several concerns regarding the language of the provision, fearing the fate of “scurrilous scribbler” as well as religious critiques.

Personal laws

Debates over triple talaq under Muslim personal law have been making rounds for the past many years and judgment over its validity has been reserved by the Supreme Court.

In the Medieval period and during the Mughal Empire, the Muslim administrators maintained harmony between the Hindu laws and the Muslim laws and chose not to interfere in the Hindu family, marriage and succession laws. Instead of constituting a new law modulating religious sentiments of both communities, Governor-General of India, Warren Hastings nurtured the personal laws of Hindus and Muslims.

Under the Charter Act of 1753, Indians were explicitly spared from trying their suits and disputes in the Mayor’s court (highest court during the British rule) and were directed to resolve their disputes themselves, unless both the parties of the case subjected themselves to the jurisdiction of the court. Hastings Rule specifically demarcating the personal laws of Hindus and Muslims was rephrased in Cornwallis Code of 1793 and it is by this rule that personal laws found a firm ground in the 17th century and continues to be what it is today.

The Dramatic Performance Act

In the 18th century, India used theatre as a weapon to exhibit rebellion against the colonial rule. Threatened by revolutionary impulses, the British government introduced the Dramatic Performance Act in 1876, which prohibited dramatic performances of “scandalous” and “defamatory” nature. Performances that would excite feelings among people against the government in power or likely to corrupt persons at the performance were prohibited.

Seventy years after independence, the law still exists and post-1947 many states introduced the law and amended it accordingly with the exception of Delhi and West Bengal.

Performances that would excite feelings among people against the government in power or likely to corrupt persons at the performance were prohibited.

The Law Commission in its 248th report published in 2014, recommended the repeal of the Act and said, “It was enacted during the colonial era and extensively used to curb nationalist sentiments propagated through dramatic performances. It has no place in a modern democratic society.”

As recent as 2014, the Madras High Court held that the Tamil Nadu Dramatic Performance Act, 1954 should be repealed as it is violative of Article 14 and 19 of the Indian Constitution and reasoned that provisions under the state law bore similarities with the central law.

Of murders and unpredictable twists: Author Ravi Subramanian on thriller writing,"Ravi Subramanian is perhaps the only true practitioner of the art in the Indian “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” space. (Source: UpGrad/YouTube/Amazon) Ravi Subramanian is perhaps the only true practitioner of the art in the Indian “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” space. (Source: UpGrad/YouTube/Amazon)

A look at the top 10 highest-selling “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” writers on Amazon India introduces us to the likes of Agatha Christie, Dan Brown, Sidney Sheldon and James Patterson. The only two Indian writers in the list are Ashwin Sanghi and Ravi Subramanian. While a larger chunk of Sanghi’s works draws upon Indian mythology and targets readers who also read the likes of Amish Tripathi and Devdutt Patnaik, Ravi Subramanian is perhaps the only true practitioner of the art in the Indian “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” space.

A banker by profession, Subramanian has written popular thrillers about banking and bankers, including an award-winning trilogy — “The Incredible Banker”, “The Bankster” and “Bankerupt” — and is now back with a fast-paced novel, “In the Name of God” (Penguin/ Rs 299/ 405 Pages).

So what are the rules for a successful thriller?

“Have a murder in the first page of the book. It always hooks the reader. Ask a question at the end of the first chapter. Do not reveal too much in the mid-chapters but build on your characters to keep the interest of the reader intact, and end with a powerful twist,” was the author’s answer during an interview at the IANS office here.

“I can come and kill you but that is not enough. What if after stabbing you I begin to twist and turn the dagger inside your body? It is the final twist which makes a thriller — ‘Oh damn! What a book’.” Subramanian also believes that a thriller is an overall experience. A reader would not want to finish it in 20 days; he wants to read it now and would be happy to finish more chapters in a day.

“So we keep the chapters very short. The reason for that is most people read books before going to sleep and normally they tend to think that I will sleep after finishing a chapter; if you are able to end that chapter on a high note and raise the curiosity of the reader, he is going to turn the pages and see that the next chapter is only three-pages long. And so the pages turn by themselves; without realising it, the reader is almost through 200 pages,” he added.

Subramanian clearly practices what he preaches — there are a whopping 121 chapters in the 400 pages of his latest novel. On the process of writing, Subramanian said It is a matter of deciding the subject of the book; once he has decided on that, the intuitive writer takes over without a set plot in mind. The plot gradually builds up as more and more chapters keep coming. “In this book, for instance, even when I had finished 90 per cent of it, I had no idea who the villain was going to be,” Subramanian revealed. While this surely lends a layer of unpredictability to the plot of the novel, isn’t it a painful task for the writer?

“Of course it is, but it is an advantage nonetheless,” he opined. “It’s painful because you often have to go back and rewrite a lot of stuff as, when I ultimately decide the villain of the novel, I may have to change something somewhere earlier in the novel. The advantage is that if I do not know who the killer is, there is no way that the reader will have the slightest idea about it.”

His latest work is titled “In the Name of God” and previously too, in “If God Was a Banker” and “God is a Gamer”, he has used some sort of a reference to God in the title of his books. The author said that it does not have anything to do with the high that mythological writing is witnessing in contemporary Indian publishing because one look at the cover of the book and you are sure that it has nothing to do with mythology and similar stuff. All events of the latest book happen in the “house of God”, the Anantha Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, and it was because of this that he used the word “God” in the title.

“What usually happens in thrillers is that you have a good and a bad guy, everybody doubts the bad guy and ultimately the good one emerges as the villain. But if everybody is grey, how will you pick who the villain? When I, as the writer, reached the end of it, it was only a matter of deciding who was going to be the villain and then making some changes here and there to suit the needs of the plot,” he contended. “In the Name of God” is currently the number one bestseller on Amazon India’s “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” category and is expected to draw more readers in the days to come.

The author hoped that thrillers would develop more prominently in the years to come and regretted that many publishers and authors are driven by what he called “market compulsions” that prevent them from considering thriller novels.

Man arrested from Delhi for ‘threatening’ Kolkata cop,"Sources said Singh had allegedly threatened the OC, saying that he would go to higher authorities if he didn’t cooperate. (Representational Image) Sources said Singh had allegedly threatened the OC, saying that he would go to higher authorities if he didn’t cooperate. (Representational Image)

The Anti-Rowdy section of Kolkata Police Wednesday arrested a person from Delhi, who had allegedly posed as the SSP of Uttarakhand and threatened a police officer in the city over phone. Sources in the police said the accused, Sanjay Singh, had allegedly threatened officer-in-charge (OC) of Sinthi police station Raghunath Thakur last week while seeking details about a missing person.

“A call was received by OC Thakur on his personal number. The person told the OC that he is the SSP of Uttarakhand. He sought some details about a person who had gone missing for sometime and the tower location of the person was showing Kolkata. The OC responded to the call saying he should give in writing then only he could help. Following this, the OC was threatened with dire consequences,” said a police officer.

Sources said Singh had allegedly threatened the OC, saying that he would go to higher authorities if he didn’t cooperate. After the phone got disconnected, the OC informed his seniors. A preliminary probe found that the call was made by Singh. Following this, a formal complaint was lodged. “On the basis of the complaint, raids were conducted and Singh was arrested from Delhi. He will be brought to Kolkata soon. We are yet to receive details about the background of the accused. Once he is interrogated, we will get details on what missing case he was talking about and why,” said a police officer.

Bombay HC seeks mechanism on organ transplant,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the state government to file an affidavit on whether there is a mechanism to deal with emergency organ transplant cases and, if the same does not exist, to suggest in what manner the state proposed to set up such a mechanism. (File photo) The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the state government to file an affidavit on whether there is a mechanism to deal with emergency organ transplant cases and, if the same does not exist, to suggest in what manner the state proposed to set up such a mechanism. (File photo)

With the Powai-based Dr L H Hiranandani Hospital not allowed to harvest cadaver organs ever since its licence was suspended a year ago, leading to wastage of at least five possible organs for transplantation, the state organ transplant cell has now shifted the blame on the hospital. The cell has claimed the donor was aged 81, diabetic and hypertensive, rendering his organs ineligible to be harvested.

The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the state government to file an affidavit on whether there is a mechanism to deal with emergency organ transplant cases and, if the same does not exist, to suggest in what manner the state proposed to set up such a mechanism. The state is expected to file its reply within two weeks.

“We cannot go against the central Act. There is already a mechanism to shift the patient to the nearest licensed centre,” said a senior Directorate of Health Services (DHS) official, adding that, according to central organ transplant guidelines, the age of a cadaver donor is capped at 80. “The hospital initially told us the donor was 71 years old but later said his age was 81,” the official added.

Mahesh Mehta, who lived in an old age home, was brought to Hiranandani Hospital on Monday by his family after suffering a brain stroke. On Tuesday, doctors declared him brain dead following which the family was counselled to give its consent for donating the kidneys, cornea and liver.

The hospital lost its licence to conduct organ transplants following an alleged kidney racket in July 2016. Five senior doctors of the hospital have been named in the chargesheet in that case, and three of them lost their licences to conduct transplants. On Tuesday, the hospital approached the government for permission to retrieve the organs.

According to the hospital, Mehta was aged 71, while state government records claim he was 81. The DHS denied permission initially, claiming the patient needs to be shifted to the nearest licensed hospital. The DHS later observed the donor was too old to donate.

A central government guideline caps the maximum age for heart donation at 60, for kidney and liver at 80 years, for pancreas at 50 years, for intestine or stomach at 55 years and for lung at 65 years.

“The prospective donor had diabetes and hypertension. His organs were not fit for donation,” the DHS official said, adding the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act prohibits unlicensed hospitals from getting involved in transplant procedure.

Manish Sisodia says new NGO roped in to address mid-day meal issues,"In the Delhi Assembly on Wednesday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia admitted that there have been “quality issues” in the mid-day meal scheme in government schools. (File Photo) In the Delhi Assembly on Wednesday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia admitted that there have been “quality issues” in the mid-day meal scheme in government schools. (File Photo)

After a series of incidents at schools where contaminated food has left pupils sick, the Delhi government plans to rope in NGO Akshaya Patra to provide “nutritious food” to at least 40,000 school students to begin with. In the Delhi Assembly on Wednesday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia admitted that there have been “quality issues” in the mid-day meal scheme in government schools, and said that “soon, in some places”, the NGO will provide food to schoolchildren. Delhi legislators pointed out that over the years, “rats”, “lizards” and “insects” have been found in mid-day meals served to children.

Sisodia’s comments followed three Delhi legislators – two from the AAP and one from the BJP – who highlighted quality issues in the mid-day meals. “Even those contractors who serve contaminated food are not properly investigated,” said BJP legislator from Rajouri Garden, Manjinder Singh Sirsa.

AAP legislators Jarnail Singh and Manoj Kumar, meanwhile, wanted to know how quality control takes places, how many NGOs are currently roped in to provide mid-day meals in Delhi and how the government is ensuring good quality food.

Elaborating on his plan, Sisodia said that currently, the NGO, Akshaya Patra, does not run any kitchens in Delhi. “They provide professional services in other states,” he said, adding that his observations were from his own visit to some of the schools which the NGO caters to in Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Karnataka. “In a proposal sent to the previous L-G, they said they will set up a kitchen and provide meals with nutritious value,” he said. However, the proposal was rejected by the L-G, he added.

“So now, the trustee of Akshaya Patra has decided to rent their own land and set up a kitchen in Delhi,” Sisodia said. “We will request the DDA to change the land use so that at least 40,000 children can quickly benefit from this,” he said.

At least 27 people killed in Congo protest this week: Human Rights Watch,"Congolese police detain protestors demanding that President Joseph Kabila leave power by the end of the year in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, July 31, 2017.

(Source: REUTERS/File)

At least 27 people, including three police officers, were killed in clashes between protesters and police in Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this week, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday. The majority of the deaths were in the capital, Kinshasa, where members of the separatist sect Bundu dia Kongo (BDK) marched against President Joseph Kabila and attacked a prison on Monday.

BDK is just one of many sources of opposition of Kabila that have threatened to plunge the vast, mineral-rich central African country into chaos since the president refused to step down when his mandate expired in December.

“Prompt and impartial investigations are needed to determine who is responsible for the deaths …. Violence by protesters or excessive use of force by security forces should not be tolerated and those responsible should be held accountable,” HRW Central Africa director Ida Sawyer said.

Congo security forces shot into crowds to disperse the protesters in Kinshasa, killing 11 BDK members and 10 bystanders, Human Rights Watch said in a statement.

Others were killed in similar clashes in the southwestern cities of Matadi and Muanda, it added. Congo’s police spokesman said on Wednesday that 19 people had been killed in total, including 17 BDK members and two police.

S Sreesanth: From being charged under MCOCA to dreaming of bowling again,"S Sreesanth had conceded 13 runs instead of the pre-determined 14. (Source: File) S Sreesanth had conceded 13 runs instead of the pre-determined 14. (Source: File)

The Kerala High Court lifted the ban on fast bowler S Sreesanth stating there was no evidence to ‘pinpoint’ his role in the IPL spot-fixing case. Here’s recalling the sensational arrest, the charges, the subsequent court cases and the acquittal.

The arrests

During 2013 IPL, Rajasthan Royals players S Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan are arrested in a midnight operation by the Delhi police for alleged spot-fixing in the IPL. Among others arrested are former Rajasthan Royals fast bowler Amit Singh and Sreesanth’s friend Jiju Janardhanan, who the police alleged was a conduit. The Delhi police charge cricketers and bookies under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) alleging the link goes all the way upto Dawood Ibrahim.

In court

The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s disciplinary panel headed by its anti-corruption unit chief Ravi Sawani bans Sreesanth and Chavan for life. Chandila receives a similar sanction later. The public prosecutor tells the court that there is evidence by way of phone conversations, that have been recorded, linking Sreesanth and other players to the bookies and D-Company and justify the invoking of MCOCA. The Delhi police’s chargesheet includes transcripts of these alleged coversations.

The evidence

The chargesheet includes a phone conversation between Amit Singh and Jiju Janardhanan. On May 9, 2013, after the KXIP versus RR game, Amit is heard telling Jiju that the bookies were in the ‘minus’ because Sreesanth had conceded 13 runs instead of the pre-determined 14.

Amit: Minus mein hai yaar aapko pehle saaf bataya tha ki 13 bhi minus hai. 14 plus hi hogi toh fayada hai

Jiju: Haan, who baat sahi hai

Amit: Maine kaha ki usne mehenat kari hai kuch toh karo. Bola ki match ke baad karte hai. Maine kaha ki bande ne mehanat kari hai kuch toh karo.

Jiju: Sreesanth ne word toh rakha naa

Amit: Woh bol raha hai ki they lost. Joh session aaya tha uske hisaab se hota hai

Jiju: Nahi nahi koi doubt wali baat thi hi nahi. Tune pura match dekha kya?

Amit: Yeh bata tu mujhe tune Sree ko bataya tha kya?

Jiju: Sab kuch bataya tha, sab kuch clear tha… everything was clear yaar

Amit: Usne wide ball kyu nahi dala

Jiju: Usne last mein dala. Yaar usne wide ball par chowka mara… Gilchrist ne…

– The police also arrested Abhishek Shukla, a ‘friend’ of Sreesanth and Jiju. They alleged in the chargesheet that when Sreesanth and Jiju were arrested, Shukla had removed the proceeds of the spot fixing — Rs 5.5 lakh— from their room at Hotel Sofitel, Mumbai, and kept it with him.

The verdicts

Patiala House court

In July, 2015, Delhi’s Patiala House court dropped all charges, including the MCOCA against the cricketers in the IPL 6 spot-fixing case. The court had set aside the charge saying there was insufficient evidence to charge the cricketers under MCOCA, under which the police had sought punishments. Additional Sessions Judge Neena Krishna Bansal said: “no prima facie case in any offence including provisions of MCOCA is made out against the accused persons and they are entitled to be discharged.”

Kerala High Court

On August 7, The Kerala High Court lifted the life ban imposed on Sreesanth by the BCCI saying there was no incriminating evidence to pinpoint his involvement in match fixing. Justice A Muhamed Mustaque said in his order: “It is to be noted that there are is no incriminating evidence to pinpoint Sreesanth’s involvement in spot-fixing . It must be remembered that in every disciplinary action related to a player of national repute, the player suffers his repute and confidence which he built through hard work.”

Nearly 70 HIV-positive children from Palawi will be presenting a dance-drama, titled Amhi Prakash Bije, at Balgandharva Rang Mandir, Pune, on Friday at 5.30 pm. Palawi is a residential unit for HIV-positive children, which is run by Prabha-Hira Pratishthan, in Purander. “People have a lot of misconceptions about HIV-positive kids. While some think such kids die at an early age, some are of the opinion that these children are always sick and not capable of doing anything. We want to break this perception through Amhi Prakash Bije (We are Seeds of Light) and tell people that even HIV-positive kids can be as normal as other kids,” said founder of the unit, Dimple Ghadge.

Children had been preparing for the programme for the past two months under the guidance of choreographers Mahesh Patil and Monika Shah.

The one-and-a-half-hour dance-drama includes a theatrical presentation, which is themed around HIV and the societal stigmas associated with it. It will be followed by a dance sequence that creatively blends the culture of Maharashtra, patriotism and folk art forms of the state.

Ghadge said all the participants, who are between the ages two and 21 years, had caught the virus from their mothers. Barring seven-eight children, all had come to Palawi through Child Court Committee or the police and have no parents or relatives. “Even those who have relatives, are not visited by anyone. In all the cases, after leaving them here, the relatives change their phone numbers and address,” he added.

Ghadge’s mother, Mangala Shah, had founded Palawi. The organisation has been working for rehabilitation and upliftment of HIV-positive children. Other than taking care of their education and medical expenses, Palawi also offers various skill-based courses, including stitching, farming, animal rearing and quilt-making.

Currently, Palawi has 110 HIV-positive children under its wing. “India is home to the largest population of HIV-positive orphans. Unfortunately, the number continues to rise. These children face staggering risks and typically die young or are abandoned by their relatives. At Palawi, the only thing we need to be very careful about their medicines and see that they do not catch a disease as their immune system is very weak. For example: if their cold is not treated on time, it can soon develop into pneumonia and may become critical,” said Ghadge.

Rafael Nadal opens Rogers Cup with easy win,"Rafael Nadal will play Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov in next round. (Source: Reuters) Rafael Nadal will play Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov in next round. (Source: Reuters)

Top-seeded Rafael Nadal and No. 2 Roger Federer cruised to easy victories Wednesday in their opening matches at the Rogers Cup. Nadal breezed past Borna Coric of Croatia 6-1, 6-2 to advance to the third round, while Federer routed Canadian Peter Polansky, 6-2, 6-1 in 53 minutes.

Nadal, a three-time Rogers Cup winner who is back in the hunt for the No. 1 ranking after winning his 10th French Open title this year, will play Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who downed 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin De Potro 6-3, 7-6 (4) in a second-round match on a gusty Wednesday afternoon.

The 18-year-old Shapovalov became the youngest player to reach the round of 16 of a Master Series tournament since Nadal in 2004 at Miami.

Federer, a two-time Rogers Cup champion ranked third in the world, has had a surprise resurgence this season by posting his 18th and 19th career Grand Slam wins at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. He played his first match of the hardcourt season that leads to the U.S. Open.

“I think this tournament I’m trying to play with confidence that I gained through the grass-court season,” Federer said. “I have to adjust my game a little bit just because the bounce of the ball is so much higher here than at Wimbledon, and there’s wind, which in Wimbledon we didn’t have much of.

“It’s just really to see how it goes this week, and then learn from this week, how I need to then play in Cincinnati (next week) and the U.S. Open.”

The Swiss star, who turned 36 on Tuesday, next faces Spain’s David Ferrer, a 7-6 (7), 3-6, 6-1 winner over 15th-seeded American Jack Sock.

Polansky, ranked No. 116 in the world after some strong results in challenger events, upset No. 75 Vasek Pospisil of Canada in the first round on Monday. It was his second meeting with Federer. At the 2014 Rogers Cup, he lost 6-2, 6-0.

“Even though I lost, this is one of the most memorable experiences of my life along with the match I played against him in Toronto,” Polansky said. “His transition from the baseline to the net, it’s a joke.

“You blink and he’s at the net. You hit balls pretty hard at him and he’s handling them like it’s no problem. Guys I’m used to playing, if I hit really hard, they’ll kind of block it but he’s constantly moving forward like a freight train.”

Sixth seed Milos Raonic, another Canadian, faced France’s Adrian Mannarino later Wednesday.

In other results, third-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria was upset 6-4, 6-7 (7), 7-5 by Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman, and fifth-seeded Kei Nishikori of Japan, a finalist last year, was ousted 6-7 (4), 7-6 (7), 7-5 by Gael Monfils. It was the Frenchman’s first win in four meetings with Nishikori.

Seventh-seeded Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov topped German Mischa Zverev 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain downed American Ryan Harrison 7-5, 6-2, and Robin Haase of the Netherlands defeated lucky loser Ernesto Escobedo 6-4, 6-1.

Sergey Shubenkov gets hero’s welcome in Russia after World Championship silver,"Sergey Shubenkov’s silver was the first major international medal won by any Russian athlete since the country’s athletics federation was suspended. (Source: Reuters) Sergey Shubenkov’s silver was the first major international medal won by any Russian athlete since the country’s athletics federation was suspended. (Source: Reuters)

Sergey Shubenkov arrived home in his native Russia on Wednesday night to a noisy reception from jubilant supporters after becoming the first Russian neutral athlete to win a medal at the World Championships in London.

The 26-year-old failed to retain his 110 metres hurdles world title, winning silver behind Jamaica’s Omar McLeod in Monday’s final.

Shubenkov’s silver was the first major international medal won by any Russian athlete since the country’s athletics federation was suspended over a 2015 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report exposing systematic doping in the sport.

Although he was disappointed with his second place, Shubenkov said the circumstances surrounding his status as a neutral athlete gave the achievement a different meaning.

“I feel like I am being congratulated more now than if I had won gold and if I had won it as part of the normal Russian team,” Shubenkov said at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport before taking a connecting flight to his Siberian hometown of Barnaul.

Shubenkov has also been praised by Russian officials, who have largely supported athletes’ efforts to compete as neutrals.

“After such a long suspension from international competitions, a silver like this is equivalent to a gold,” TASS news agency quoted sports minister Pavel Kolobkov as saying.

Unlike at the last two world championships in Beijing and Moscow — where Shubenkov won gold and bronze respectively – he could not wear his country’s colours in London.

“It was of course a little strange not to see the Russian flag at the medals ceremony,” he said.

Shubenkov is among the dozens of Russians cleared in recent months to compete internationally as neutrals by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) after demonstrating that his training programme met the proper anti-doping requirements.

Like the 18 other Russians competing as neutrals in London, Shubenkov could not wear his country’s colours or any national symbols.

When Shubenkov arrived in Moscow, a piece of grey tape was still covering a Russian athletics federation logo on his black backpack.

But his coach Sergei Klevtsov was proudly wearing a powder blue T-shirt with a double-headed golden eagle, a Russian national symbol.

It remains unclear when Shubenkov and other Russians will be allowed to compete again under their country’s flag.

The IAAF said last week that Russia’s athletics federation still had to meet several criteria before it could be reinstated.

"Virat Kohli should not be compared with Sachin Tendulkar, says Jonty Rhodes","Many have compared Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli for their sheer excellence with the bat. (Source: AP) Many have compared Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli for their sheer excellence with the bat. (Source: AP)

Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has said that comparing the duo of Sachin Tendulkar and current India captain Virat Kohli is not the right thing to do and they are both great in their own way.

Stating that he is not a believer of records, Rhodes said, “I am not a great believer in records and I don’t like to compare players from different eras. They are wonderful players. Both are great in their own way. Tendulkar is Tendulkar and Virat (Kohli) is Virat.”

When asked if Kohli could break Tendulkar’s records, Rhodes said, “Tendulkar started at the age of 16 and played until the age of nearly 40, for almost 24 years and set several benchmarks. I don’t know if Kohli can play for such a long time, given the demands of a modern-day cricketer.”

“Virat has started his career very well. His prolific run-scoring is incredible. He has made a lot of runs at a young age. Kohli must be just Kohli and should not be compared with Tendulkar.”, he added.

Rhodes was also quizzed on his choice of the best Indian fielder to which he said, “Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif were some of the better fielders around. Virat Kohli, he is ok. But Suresh Raina for me is the best fielder in India. He goes for the ball, regardless of whether he thinks he can get it or not. He reminds me a lot of a much younger Jonty Rhodes.”

He also spoke on the future of cricket and said, Rhodes said, “In my opinion, it is not Test cricket, but 50-overs cricket that is in trouble. T20 has changed the way the game is played now and Test cricket has become more exciting. T20 has brought a change in the manner cricket is played these days. In Test cricket, they play with a lot of freedom now, there is no fear of failure,” he said.

“When I was playing in the last century, batsmen used to struggle in the 90s. The nervous nineties they called it. There were several batsmen who got out in the 90s. Now, that is not the case. Some times, batsmen reach 100 from 94 with a single shot, a six. The players are very confident these days. I don’t think Test cricket is in trouble. In reality, 50-over cricket is in trouble,” Rhodes added.

Viswanathan Anand to meet Sergey Karjakin in Sinquefield Cup round six,"Viswanathan Anand is currently sharing the second spot with world champion Magnus Carlsen. (Source: File) Viswanathan Anand is currently sharing the second spot with world champion Magnus Carlsen. (Source: File)

High on confidence after a fine win over Fabiano Caruana of United States in the previous round, former world champion Viswanathan Anand will be looking to continue the momentum when he takes on Russia’s Sergey Karjakin in the sixth round of the Sinquefield Cup.

Anand, on three points out of a possible five, is currently sharing the second spot with world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway, while the leader is Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France on 3.5 points.

With four rounds still to go in the USD 300000 prize money tournament, Levon Aronian of Armenia, Caruana and Karjakin share the fourth spot with 2.5 points each in their kitty while the remaining four participants, US duo of Wesley So and Hikaru Nakamura, and Russians Ian Nepomniachtchi and Peter Svidler share the seventh spot on two points each.

While it may look like anyone’s tournament as of now, Anand has a real chance of winning a super tournament after a considerable gap.

After the game against Karjakin when he plays with black pieces, the Indian ace has back-to-back white games lined up against Nepomniachtchi and Vachier-Lagrave and this is where even one strike might just prove crucial.

Meanwhile, Vachier-Lagrave has passed the sternest test with full marks when he defeated Carlsen earlier in the tournament and the Frenchman has to now navigate carefully to keep his half point lead intact.

After the loss against Vachier in the fourth round, Carlsen scored a thumping victory over Wesley So to announce his comeback in the event.

The world number one for over six years now and world champion since 2013, Carlsen has not won a single super tournament in the last one year. The king is under pressure to perform and this could be the platform.

Among other participants in the fray, Levon Aronian started off brilliantly but has not been able to keep up the momentum while Nakamura and Wesley So have not been in the form that was expected from them.

In the sixth round, Carlsen will take on Nakamura, always considered a mouth-watering contest for the chess buffs.

Vachier has to tackle a wounded Caruana and one can expect fair number of crackers in that game too.

Overall the Sinquefield cup looks poised for a close finish.

Pairings round 6: Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 2.5) vs V Anand (Ind, 3); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 3) vs Hikaru Nakamura (Usa, 2); Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 2.5) vs Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 3.5); Levon Aronian (Arm, 2.5) vs Wesley So (Usa, 2); Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 2) vs Peter Svidler (Rus, 2).

"In defeat of IS, a significant compliment for Iraq national unity","A Yazidi shrine destroyed by the Islamic State is rebuilt in Bashiqa near Mosul earlier this week. (Reuters Photo) A Yazidi shrine destroyed by the Islamic State is rebuilt in Bashiqa near Mosul earlier this week. (Reuters Photo)

Iraq appeared to have reached a point of no return when the Islamic State (IS) executed an estimated 1,700 Iraqi Air Force cadets, mostly Shia Muslims, at Camp Speicher near Tikrit in June 2014. The massacre, one of the worst among the IS’s many atrocities, deepened sectarian faultlines, and laid the ground for a possible entrenchment of the terrorist group as the Iraqi state collapsed. It would have seemed far-fetched at the time to imagine the scenes of pan Iraqi solidarity seen on the streets of Mosul three years later, on July 10, 2017, when Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over the IS. Flag-waving civilians danced in the devastated streets amid chants of “by our souls and blood, we sacrifice for you, Iraq”, and calls for Shia-Sunni brotherhood.

The unity Iraqis forged in the face of the existential threat is a less discussed aspect of the defeat of the IS. Not many had anticipated what Iraq expert and The Guardian columnist Jonathan Steele described as “a national sense of urgency [among Iraqis] which overcame regional, ethnic and sectarian disputes”.

To be sure, it wasn’t easy. Even in March 2015, a year before the Iraqi army’s final push against the IS, tensions ran high at a meeting of 16 tribal leaders gathered at Baghdad’s Babylon Hotel with the object of reconciliation. An important leader threatened to walk out at one point, after local tribes were accused of being complicit in the Camp Speicher massacre. But the facilitators persisted with their efforts, and tangible results followed.

The Babylon Hotel meeting was organised as part of efforts supported by the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) since December 2014 “to forestall a new cycle of killing”. Iraqi facilitators, officials, peacebuilders, and NGOs led the talks to encourage engagements and counter calls for revenge. The USIP, a nonpartisan institute established by Congress in 1984 to “prevent, reduce, and resolve armed conflict around the world”, drew on earlier mediation experiences in Iraq, and its experience of cultural norms and tribal traditions. Its efforts turned out to be crucial in facilitating the return of Sunnis to their homes in Tikrit, which they had fled for fear of reprisals once the city was liberated. Earlier, the al-Bu Ajeel and al-Bu Nasir tribes had promised to turn over anyone found to have been involved in the massacre. “Determined bridge-building” curbed the “powerful tribal impulse for revenge”, defused calls for retribution, wrote Scott Peterson of the Christian Science Monitor.

The engagements provided a template for reconciliation, and helped build the understanding that both sides had suffered from the IS’s terror. It emerged that Sunnis had protected many Shia cadets and shepherded them out of IS-held territory. The two sides held the IS responsible for the atrocity without stigmatising Sunnis as a whole, and agreed to build a memorial to the massacre victims.

Iraq’s top Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, whose June 2014 fatwa swelled the ranks of anti-IS volunteer forces, emerged as a key unifying figure. A year earlier, he had issued a fatwa prohibiting the shedding of Sunni blood despite a wave of targeted attacks on Shias by al-Qaeda. Iraq’s Shia clerical establishment has worked hard at presenting a unified front, including inviting journalists from across the world to counter the sectarian projection of the anti-IS war. In 2016, a briefing of Sunni, Shia and Christian commanders of the anti-IS volunteer force was organised for Indian journalists in Baghdad to highlight the success of reconciliation efforts.

It has helped that the origins of sectarianism in Iraq are relatively recent. In a 2014 piece, Columbia University sociologist Musa al-Gharbi argued that the turmoil in Iraq resulted from a revolt against “very specific governmental policies — most of which have their origins in the US invasion and occupation”. Iraq had ethnic tensions prior to the 2003 invasion, al-Gharbi wrote, but Saddam Hussein “did not allow overt sectarianism to flourish”, and “Sunnis and Shias led a fairly well-integrated existence, especially in the larger cities”.

Indeed, nearly a third of marriages in Iraq were inter-sectarian, and the country had other thriving minorities, al-Gharbi argued. Political affiliation was largely based on secular ideologies; Saddam’s socialist Baath regime had a significant Shia presence. Even the insurgency, according to al-Gharbi, “was fairly broad-based” during the early stages of the occupation.

American diplomat Paul Bremer, who headed the post-Saddam Provisional Authority of Iraq, is often blamed for falling back on the colonial divide-and-rule policy to counter the broad-based challenge. Sunnis, who are around 40% of the population, suddenly found themselves excluded from positions of power. The army that predated the Baath party was disbanded, and Sunnis were purged from the military and bureaucracy in the garb of de-Baathification. The policy of mandatory declaration of sect for the issuance of documents, and the allocation of quotas in the governing council on a sectarian basis, pitted ethnic and religious groups against each other.

Iraq paid dearly as a result. While Prime Minister al-Abadi’s inclusive policies, and the Shia clergy’s farsightedness have helped, no one believes that the defeat of the IS is the decisive end of the war. Iraq could yet become a new battleground for regional powers and their deadly sectarian games. The Trump administration’s policy of taking sides in the region is unlikely to promote the cause of peace.

Russian vote meddling led to ‘serious mistrust’: Rex Tillerson,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today he had told his Russian counterpart that Moscow’s meddling in the US presidential election had created “serious mistrust” between the two countries. After meeting Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Manila, Tillerson said he had also warned him Washington was deciding on a response to the Kremlin’s decision to order a cut in the size of the US mission in Moscow.

“Russian meddling in the elections was certainly a serious incident. We talked about that in the discussion that we had with Mr Lavrov yesterday,” Tillerson told reporters. “And trying to help him understand just how serious this incident had been and how seriously it had damaged the relationship between the US and the American people and the Russian people, that this had created serious mistrust and that we simply have to find some way to deal with that.”

Russia has furiously denied reports, endorsed by US intelligence agencies, that it attempted to swing last year’s US presidential in favor of the eventual victor, President Donald Trump. Trump has played down the allegations, but the ongoing controversy cast a pall over already tense ties, which most recently saw President Vladimir Putin order the US diplomatic mission in Moscow cut 755 personnel.

“I told the foreign minister that we have not made a decision about how we would respond to the Russian request to remove US diplomatic personnel,” Tillerson said. “I asked several clarifying questions, just to describe the thinking behind that diplomatic note that we received, but I told them we would respond by September 1,” he said, referring to Moscow’s deadline to shrink the mission.

Venezuela top court orders jailing of opposition mayor Muchacho,"An anti-government demonstrator wearing a Russian military hat and his face covered with a Venezuelan flag protests the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, Aug. 6, 2017.

(AP Photo/Wil Riera)

Venezuela’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of opposition mayor Ramon Muchacho of the Caracas district of Chacao, which has been the site of intense anti-government protests against President Nicolas Maduro. The court said in a statement that its Constitutional Chamber sentenced him to 15 months in prison, and it dismissed him from his post.

Muchacho was ruled to be in contempt of court for not having obeyed an order to ensure free transit in his district, where protesters for more than four months have routinely blocked streets and set up barricades along avenues. It comes just days after the opening of a legislative superbody called the constituent assembly that Maduro promises will bring peace to the country but critics call the consolidation of a dictatorship. Muchacho, who did not appear at the hearings, slammed the ruling as an effort to stamp out dissent.

“We are being condemned for doing our job, for guaranteeing the legitimate right to peaceful protest and the right of all Venezuelans to exercise their civil and political rights,” wrote Muchacho in an email message that he sends to subscribers each morning.

“The coming hours will be difficult for me.” The Supreme Court has used similar reasoning in the past to jail mayors of protest-convulsed municipalities. Critics say such decisions show that the top court has become an extension of the ruling Socialist Party.

"Consumers Reports pulls recommendation for Microsoft Surface Laptop, Surface Book","Consumer Reports is not recommending Microsoft’s Surface Laptop, Surface Book. Consumer Reports is not recommending Microsoft’s Surface Laptop, Surface Book.

Consumer Reports is pulling its recommendation of four Microsoft laptops after one of its surveys found that users were complaining about problems with the devices. The consumer advocacy group said Thursday that it can no longer recommend Microsoft laptops or tablets because of poor reliability compared to other brands. Microsoft said the findings don’t accurately reflect Surface owners’ “true experiences.”

The consumer group says Microsoft machines have performed well in laboratory testing. But a subscriber survey found start-up and freezing problems. The devices losing their “recommended” status are the Surface Laptop (128GB and 256GB versions) and Surface Book (128GB and 512GB versions). Consumer Reports last pulled laptop recommendations in 2015, when ratings were removed for two Hewlett-Packard laptops and one made by Lenovo.

The post by Consumer Reports says their decision applies to Microsoft devices with detachable keyboards like the new “Surface Pro released in June and the Surface Book.” The new Surface Laptop is also included in the list of devices with problems. It also adds that in Microsoft’s case the “estimated breakage rate for its laptops and tablets was higher” compared to other brands, and the “differences were statistically significant.”

According to Consumer Reports, nearly 25 per cent of Microsoft devices will pose a problem for their users in the second year. This is why Microsoft is getting bumped off the list of recommendations. However, Microsoft doesn’t agree with these findings, and in a separate blogpost Panos Panay who is Corporate Vice President for Microsoft Devices wrote that Consumer Reports’ survey was “disappointing.”

The post goes on to read, “While we respect Consumer Reports, we disagree with their findings.” The company claims the return rates for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book “are significantly lower than 25%.”

It adds, “Additionally, we track other indicators of quality such as incidents per unit (IPU), which have improved from generation to generation and are now at record lows of well below 1%.” The company says Surface ranks high in customer satisfaction, with 98 per cent of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book users saying they were satisfied with the device. This survey was done by research company IPSOS and commissioned by Microsoft.

UN chief Antonio Guterres to make first visit to Israel and Palestinians,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. (Source: Reuters) United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. (Source: Reuters)

Antonio Guterres will make his first visit as the UN secretary-general to Israel and the Palestinian territories later this month for a firsthand look at a conflict that has been on the front burner of the United Nations for 70 years. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said yesterday that the trip “comes at a critical time in which there are attacks against the two-state solution,” which would see an independent Palestinian state existing side-by-side with Israel in peace.

The secretary-general “is adamant in emphasizing that there is no Plan B to the two-state solution,” Mansour told The Associated Press. “So to emphasize the importance of the two-state solution, and abiding by it and respecting the global consensus around it, is something that I think the Israeli leadership needs to listen to.”

Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said the trip “will provide an excellent opportunity for him to see firsthand both the challenges and the opportunities that we face in our region, including Hezbollah’s activities in Lebanon in violations of Security Council resolutions.” Guterres’ first stop will be Israel on Aug. 28 followed by a visit to Palestinian leaders including President Mahmoud Abbas on Aug. 29 in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Mansour said. The secretary-general will then travel to Gaza on Aug. 30 where he is expected to visit some projects of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.

Danon first mentioned the trip last month. It has not been officially announced by the UN. Israeli-Palestinian tensions escalated recently over the holiest site in Jerusalem when Israel installed metal detectors after Arab gunmen killed two Israeli policemen there in mid-July. Muslims protested and Israel removed the devices after intervention from the United States, Jordan and others.

Israel and the United States, the country’s closest ally, have sharply accused the United Nations of anti-Israel bias. “We welcome the secretary-general’s statements speaking ut against anti-Semitism and in favor of treating Israel as a fully equal UN member-state,” Danon said Tuesday in a statement to AP.

“During his meetings with the prime minister, president and minister of defense, the secretary-general will also hear about the importance Israel places on being treated fairly at the United Nations.” Mansour said Guterres must “push as much as he can” to stop Israeli settlement activities, which are illegal under international law and are on land Palestinians want for their state.

He said the secretary-general also needs to press Israel to lift its “illegal blockade” in Gaza.

"Before culture fest, floodplain was in sordid state: AOL","Weeks before the festival, farmers who cultivate vegetables on the floodplains were asked to leave. Weeks before the festival, farmers who cultivate vegetables on the floodplains were asked to leave.

The Yamuna floodplains on which the three-day World Culture Festival was held last year was in a “sordid state” prior to the event, the festival’s organiser, the Art Of Living (AOL) Foundation, told the National Green Tribunal, Thursday. “This was the state of the floodplains when it was handed over to us,” AOL counsel said, adding that subsequent findings of the expert panel were “erroneous”.

“It was more or less a sordid state of affairs,” counsel appearing for AOL, Nikhil Sakhardande, said, referring to an April, 2014 report prepared by an NGT-appointed principal committee. AOL said the report dated April 19, 2014, had maintained that social, cultural and religious activities were permitted at the site and thus the festival was allowed.

Sakhardande told a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar that it was a “pre-requisite” for the seven-member expert panel to know about the status of the floodplains prior to the event, before concluding that the damage was caused because of the festival. “The zone under which the WCF event falls is identified to have wetlands,” said the AOL counsel, “But those fall outside the 24 hectares allocated to us. We are not concerned with those.” The hearing will continue on Friday.

Explorers of the Library of Nature,"Scientists are explorers. Like all explorers, we don’t know what might be around the next turn. (Representational image) Scientists are explorers. Like all explorers, we don’t know what might be around the next turn. (Representational image)

The Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges was obsessed with libraries and labyrinths. His short stories examined the meaning of knowledge and the means by which it was gained. Though he never spoke of it directly, Borges’s stories always made me feel that he would have understood the tragedies, triumphs and day-to-day fun of doing science.

On August 9, in a ‘March for Science’, several thousand scientists and non-scientists took to the streets in cities across India. In many ways this event was a celebration of science, which continues to enjoy broad public support. In the present renaissance of science journalism and science communication, there is plenty of excellent material explaining scientific discoveries and their technological applications in accessible terms.

But there is very little written about the process of doing science, or of the motivations that drive scientists. This has led to a distorted image of science among the public and among policy-makers, at odds with scientists’ conception of their own work. Before we start any conversations about the long-term role of science in society, we must clear up these misconceptions.

Scientists are explorers. Like all explorers, we don’t know what might be around the next turn. But rather than setting out across oceans, savannahs, or mountain ranges, I like to imagine that we are set loose in one of Borges’s vast labyrinthine libraries.

Picture it. The Library of Nature has millions of rooms, connected to one another by passageways. On the shelves of each room are hundreds books written in myriad languages. If we could read them, we would find most these books to be prosaic, commonplace. But some of them contain Great Truths that tell us about our place in the universe, and give us the power to manipulate our world. It is these Great Truths we are in search of.

We explore the library, moving from room to room via the passageways. From every room there are many ways out. Some of the passageways have grand, decorated entrances. Others are no more than holes, with barely enough room to stand up. It’s tempting to follow the grand entrances, but this often leads us to dead ends. We document these dead ends, so our fellow explorers don’t make the same mistakes we did.

Some books in some rooms contain hints about which passageways to take, but decoding these hints is a painstaking process. Occasionally we decipher a new language. This is a great achievement, as it gives us access to a whole new set of books. We attempt efficiency by splitting up the library into sections and deploying teams to each section. But the labyrinth is so inter-twined that we must share notes, and learn from one another. Sometimes, while in one room, we notice cracks in the wall through which we glimpse other rooms not yet visited. Each such discovery is celebrated, and drives us to keep going.

There are two common misconceptions about these scientist-explorers. The first misconception is that we have access to a map of the library, and the task is simply to find the right route to the rooms containing Great Truths. This map-centric view is evident when scientists are asked to develop a cure for neurodegeneration, or an ultra-strong material for jet engines. But there is no such map of the whole library, only fragments showing rooms we have already explored. Loud showmen pretending to have such a map sometimes lead many explorers along a single trail, only to be doomed at a dead end.

The second misconception is that we simply have to sit and read every book, so the Great Truths will eventually be revealed. This is the fetish of the Big Data brigade, who believe that enough small facts will eventually accumulate to generate profound insights. But the time it would take to read every book would exceed the lifetime of the universe. Explorers forced to live their lives reading one book after the next, unable to leap away and enter a different room, would find no fulfilment and eventually quit in frustration.

How, then, do we ever find Great Truths? It is true that we have no map and not enough time. But each of us does have a compass. The compass is delicate: it only works when conditions are ideal; it must be held just right; and we must have patience to record the reading of its fluctuating needle. Used correctly, the compass points toward the direction in which we must move. There might not always be a direct passage leading that way, but we are often able to puzzle out a route.

This leads each of us to important discoveries: new languages and new sections of the library. Over time, our collective efforts allow a few scientist-explorers to find books containing Great Truths. When they do, they give credit to all the explorers that paved the way for them, and we share in their elation. This has the dual effect of inspiring a new generation of scientist-explorers, and providing tangible benefits to society.

So what is this compass? It is the sense that each scientist develops over time, of what questions to ask, what problems contain the key to unlocking big secrets. It is an aesthetic taste in approaches and methods, an intuition of how best to tackle such problems. It is the power to recognize when problems are close to being solved, of which obstacles still remain. The use of the compass takes time to master, it cannot be defined by a formula. The skill is passed down from teachers to students over centuries.

Both scientists as well as the broader society in which we live are aligned in the goal of finding Great Truths. But it takes time to understand the Library of Nature and its inner workings. It is not a collection of books strewn about haphazardly, but neither does it contain patterns so obvious as to be evident at first glance.

When society makes demands of scientists, we are obliged to listen because society provides the resources that support our exploration. But we should be careful to explain that there is no map, that following compasses takes time, that dead ends are common. We should explain why small discoveries should be celebrated, why we must share ideas, why we need to build a community in which diverse viewpoints are possible. This is the approach by which we discovered the laws of gravity and evolution, and every other Great Truth on which our modern technological society depends.

"Mercy, My Jewels!","Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger’s latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger’s agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa’s Shakuntala — a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‘husband,’ gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing – the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa’s story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves — how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette’s diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen’s Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‘symbols, myths, magic.’ (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger’s favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‘rape,’ for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence — emotional, physical and sexual — against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‘misremembered’) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

Guam governor shrugs off North Korea’s mid-August strike plan,"North Korea’s state media said earlier that, under the plan to be presented to leader Kim Jong Un, four intermediate-range missiles would be fired into waters 30-40 km (18-25 miles) from Guam “to signal a crucial warning to the United States”. North Korea’s state media said earlier that, under the plan to be presented to leader Kim Jong Un, four intermediate-range missiles would be fired into waters 30-40 km (18-25 miles) from Guam “to signal a crucial warning to the United States”.

The governor of Guam on Thursday dismissed North Korea’s statement that it will develop a plan by mid-August to launch missiles at the U.S. Pacific territory as coming from “a position of fear”, and said there was no heightened threat. North Korea’s state media said earlier that, under the plan to be presented to leader Kim Jong Un, four intermediate-range missiles would be fired into waters 30-40 km (18-25 miles) from Guam “to signal a crucial warning to the United States”.

Guam is home to about 163,000 people and a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group. “They like to be unpredictable. They’ll pop a missile off when no one is ready and they’ve done it quite a few times. Now they’ve telegraphed it,” Guam Governor Eddie Calvo told Reuters in an interview on the island.

“They’re now telegraphing their punch, which means they don’t want to have any misunderstandings. I think that’s a position of fear.” He said there was some concern among the public on Guam but no panic, and the authorities were “very confident” that there was no heightened threat despite the warnings from North Korea, which were first made on Wednesday.

“There is a defence umbrella contained within South Korea, there is a defence umbrella for Japan, there are naval assets between Korea, Japan and Guam, and there is a missile defence system of Guam that make up a multi-level defensive umbrella,” Calvo said. “At this point, based on what facts are known, there is no need to have any concern regards heightening the threat level.”

"North Korea details Guam strike plan, calls Trump’s warning a ‘load of nonsense’","Trump’s “fire and fury” remarks prompted warnings from U.S. officials and analysts not to engage in rhetorical games with Pyongyang. (AP/File) Trump’s “fire and fury” remarks prompted warnings from U.S. officials and analysts not to engage in rhetorical games with Pyongyang. (AP/File)

North Korea dismissed on Thursday warnings by U.S. President Donald Trump that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States as a “load of nonsense”, and outlined detailed plans for a missile strike near the Pacific territory of Guam. North Korea’s apparently rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland has fuelled tensions that erupted into a war of words between Washington and Pyongyang this week, unnerving regional powers and global investors.

Trump’s unexpected remarks prompted North Korea to say on Thursday it was finalising plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land 30-40 km (18-25 miles) from Guam, more than 3,000 km (2,000 miles) to the south. Guam is home to about 163,000 people and a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group. “Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,” a report by the North’s state-run KCNA news agency said of Trump.

The army will complete its plans in mid-August, ready for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s order, KCNA reported, citing General Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Force of the Korean People’s Army. While North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States and its allies, the report was unusual in its detail.

Masao Okonogi, professor emeritus at Japan’s Keio University, said the North Korean reports suggested Pyongyang was issuing a warning or advance notice of changes to its missile testing programme rather than threatening an attack. “I believe this is a message saying they plan to move missile tests from the Sea of Japan to areas around Guam,” he told Reuters. “By making this advance notice, they are also sending a tacit message that what they are going to do is not a actual attack.”

BOASTS ABOUT POWER

The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a stark warning earlier on Wednesday, telling Pyongyang the United States and its allies would win any arms race or conflict. “The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people,” Mattis said in a statement, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Tension in the region has risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July. Trump has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. On Wednesday, Trump boasted about U.S. nuclear capabilities. “My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before,” Trump said on Twitter. “Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was in Guam on a previously scheduled visit, played down the rhetoric, saying he did not believe there was an imminent threat from North Korea and “Americans should sleep well at night”.

Earlier on Wednesday, Guam Governor Eddie Calvo dismissed the threat and said the island was prepared for “any eventuality” with strategically placed defences. He said he had been in touch with the White House and there was no change in the threat level.

HEADING TOWARDS CONFRONTATION

North Korea accuses the Washington of devising a “preventive war” and has said any plans to execute this would be met with an “all-out war, wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the U.S. mainland”. Washington has warned it is ready to use force if needed to stop North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes but that it prefers global diplomatic action, including sanctions. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Saturday. China, North Korea’s main ally, has consistently urged both sides to work to lower tensions.

Influential Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said the North Korean nuclear issue was heading towards confrontation and it was time for the United States to respond to Pyongyang’s security concerns. “North Korea has almost been completely isolated by the outside world. Under such extreme circumstances, Pyongyang will weigh all its possible options,” it said in an editorial on its website on Thursday. “Washington should stimulate Pyongyang’s desire to engage with the outside world and return to the international community.”

A senior U.S. official who deals with the Korea issue said the “fire and fury” comment, which was Trump’s strongest warning yet for North Korea, was “unplanned and spontaneous”. “There had not been any discussions about escalating the rhetoric in response to Kim’s statements or about the possible effects of doing that,” the official said. However, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters national security officials had been aware of the tone of Trump’s message before he gave it. “The words were his own. The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand,” Sanders said.

Reserve Bank of India issues final guidelines for tri-party repo transactions,"Reserve Bank of India. (File/Photo) Reserve Bank of India. (File/Photo)

The Reserve Bank on Thursday issued the final guidelines on tri-party repo transactions as part of its attempt to energise the corporate bond market and generate more liquidity in the segment. A tri-party repo is a contract between a buyer and a seller of a security along with a third party agent. In most cases, the third-party agent may be a custodian bank, which will facilitate services like collateral selection, payment and settlement, custody and management during the life of the transaction.

Such repos can be traded over-the-counter (OTC) including on electronic platforms, or, on stock exchanges, and should reported within 15 minutes of the trade for public dissemination to CCIL or to exchanges or any other reporting platform authorised for the purpose by the Reserve Bank, it said in a notification.

The RBI had issued the draft guidelines on April 11, 2017 and had promised on the August 2 policy that it would issue the final guideline shortly and said “tri-party repos will enable market participants to use underlying collateral more efficiently and facilitate development of the term repo market.”

The draft guidelines were issued after recommendations from a committee headed by former deputy governor HR Khan in August 2016.

The RBI on Thursday allowed commercial banks, entities regulated by it or the Sebi, and those who have prior RBI approval to act as agents for tri-party repo.

The applicant should have at least five years of experience in the financial sector, preferably in offering custodial services. They will have to maintain minimum of Rs 25 crore in the form of net-owned funds has also been mandated.

Tri-party repos may be traded using any trading process authorised under RBI directions,including bilateral/multilateral, anonymous or otherwise, quote driven or order driven.

On settlement, RBI said all settlements will be on delivery vs payment (DvP) basis, with or without netting of securities and/or cash. Settlement can also be guaranteed or non-guaranteed bilateral/ multilateral, through clearing houses of exchanges or any other clearing arrangement approved under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007.

On the tenor, haircut and disclosures, it said these will be identical to those applicable to normal repos, in terms of the Reserve Bank directions.

Repo is an instrument for borrowing funds by selling securities with an agreement to repurchase the same on a mutually agreed future date at an agreed price including interest for the funds borrowed, while reverse repo is an instrument for lending by purchasing securities with an agreement to resell the same on a mutually agreed future date at an agreed price including interest.

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan apologises to accident victim’s family,"Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan (File) Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan (File)

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday tendered an apology on behalf of the state to the family of a road accident victim from Tamil Nadu who had died after hospitals denied him treatment.

Vijayan told the Assembly that the death of Murugan (46), a native of Tirunelveli, has brought disgrace to the entire state. “On behalf of the state and its people, I am tendering an apology to Murugan’s family. To prevent repeat of such incidents, the government would bring in legislation or amend existing rules,” he said.

Murugan had met with an accident while riding pillion near Kollam on Sunday. He was rushed to a hospital, which referred him to another hospital as he was critical. For the next seven hours, the ambulance carrying him moved from one hospital to another in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram but hospitals refused to admit him for lack of a neurosurgeon or ventilator.

As the issue triggered widespread protests, the government asked the Director of the Health Department to look into the matter. Police have registered a case under Section 304 of IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against five hospitals.

Tottenham Hotspur’s Danny Rose eager for trophies and big name signings,"Rose might not be ready for Tottenham’s campaign-opener at Newcastle United on Sunday but should be back soon and is keen to have a medal to show for his efforts at the end of the season. (Source: AP) Rose might not be ready for Tottenham’s campaign-opener at Newcastle United on Sunday but should be back soon and is keen to have a medal to show for his efforts at the end of the season. (Source: AP)

Tottenham Hotspur defender Danny Rose is desperate to win trophies this season and has urged the club to sign some more big name players to help him achieve his ambition.

The 27-year-old England international has been a mainstay at left back for Spurs since the 2013-14 campaign, although he missed the back-end of last season after sustaining a knee injury in January.

Rose might not be ready for Tottenham’s campaign-opener at Newcastle United on Sunday but should be back soon and is keen to have a medal to show for his efforts at the end of the season.

“I am reaching my peak and have probably only got one big contract left in me,” Rose told Britain’s The Sun newspaper.

“Time is running out and I do want to win trophies. I don’t want to play football for 15 years and not have one trophy or one medal.”

While the Yorkshire native is happy at Tottenham for the moment, he said he wanted to move back north at some stage before the end of his career.

“I will say this too, I will play up north. I don’t know exactly when but I will get back up north and play some football somewhere,” Rose said.

“I have been away for over 10 years now and I don’t get to see my mum that often. I’m not saying I want out, but if something came to me that was concrete, I’d have no qualms about voicing my opinions to anyone at the club.”

The long-serving defender said the club could still do with a few big name signings before the end of the transfer window.

“I am not saying buy 10 players, I’d love to see two or three – and not players you have to Google and say, ‘Who’s that?’ I mean well-known players,” Rose added.

“As a Tottenham player I’d love to see more signings. It would lift me seeing a top player come through the door … I’m just not buying the idea that we don’t need anyone. “As a starting 11 we have one of the best in the league, without a shadow of a doubt, but after that … I definitely feel we need to bolster the squad.”

"March for Science: Scientists, professors demand higher budgetary allocation for research","Scientists, professors, and researchers from across several cities in India have joined the ‘March for Science’ protest rally to voice their concern against the poor budgetary allocation for scientific research in India. Seen in this picture, professors and students from Jawaharlala Nehru University taking party in the rally. (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

The ‘March for Science’ protest rally is a global movement initiated by researchers and scientists in United States, who took to the streets to protest against dramatic budgetary cuts and shift in scientific policies under President Donald Trump regime in April this year. Over 600 cities globally participated in a first-ever protest march.(Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

The major demand from the protesters is to increase budgetary provision from 0.85 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent for scientific education and research. The protestors are also against “pseudo-scientific ideas”, slashing of IIT budgets, and center’s shift in scientific research. (Express Photo Nitika Kakkar)

Breakthrough Science Society, a Kolkata-based group of scientists, were the catalyst in organising the protest march in India. The group had started writing e-mails to the scientific community after the April rally in United States and several other countries. (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

Asmita, a PHd student taking part in the protests, said: ""We have seen a lot of non-scientific things being used as propaganda. We are marching today against that propaganda. Secondly, we need more funding in research. How can developments take place without funding. These are the main reasons we are marching today. We want more funding for basic research as research has long term benefits. It is very important for drugs and medicine as well. This March is for people to take notice of it."" (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

Prashant, one of the organizers from Breakthrough Science Society, told Indianexpress.com: ""Three important demands, keeping those in center there was a worldwide phenomenon on 22 April in 600 cities where more than 1 million people participated. Nothing could be done then but today we've organised a march in India in more than 35 cities. Things which are based on beliefs but not on scientific evidence, should be stopped."" (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

Taking about the importance of the rally, Prashant said: ""Myths are being passed as science, such as Pushpak vimaan. These kind of things are happening....If you see the textbooks by DN Batra, you will start laughing looking at the kind of things that are being taught in the name of science to school children. These things used to happen before as well but they have increased much more under this government."" (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

At the rallies, scientists also expressed their concern over SVAROP program (Scientific Validation and Research On ‘Panchgavya’), a program based on promoting benefits of cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd and ghee for their alleged medicinal properties. (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

MC Arunan, working with the Collaborative Undergraduate Biology Education at Bhabha Center, told Indianexpress.com: ""The scientific temper is taken for granted, and with current government there is less focus on evidence based decision making. In High court, a judge spoke about peacock’s tear. We are worried if we don’t speak about these perceptions now, we will never get an opportunity later.” (Express Photo by Nitika Kakkar)

Speaking about the rally, Aniket Sule, an astrophysicist attached to the Homi Bhabha Center for Science Education told Indianexpress.com: “The rally is not just to demand more funds for science. It is time scientists come together to speak about the shift we are seeing in government funds for research in cow urine. If we don’t speak now, people will believe in validation of cow urine without evidence.” (above) Photos from JNU. (Express Photo By Nitika Kakkar)

If you’re looking for celeb fitness inspiration then Alia Bhatt’s workout routine might make you want to hit the gym. She is no slouch when it comes to her performances on-screen and definitely not one when it comes to staying fit. The Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor has worked really hard to get the toned body she has today with the help of celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. According to reports, she weighed around 67kg when she was 17 and lost around 16kg in just three months when she was shortlisted for her debut film Student of the Year.

Today, all of 24, the actress can often be seen sharing inspirational workout videos with her followers on Instagram, documenting her journey in a way. From working out on the Pilates machine Cadillac to the extremely difficult back-bend bridge, handstand, crunches and Jack Rabbit, she does it all. This beauty doesn’t like repeating workouts, so Karachiwala has her hitting different machines like the corealign, reformer, Wunda chair, step barrel and the Bodhi suspension system.

As far as her diet is concerned, she has a major sweet tooth and is a fan of Pooja Dhingra’s Le 15 Patisserie and Chef Kelvin Cheung’s delectable cakes, but she is also a stickler for discipline and probably that’s what helps her the most.

Bhatt also believes in eating everything in moderation. Recently, she teamed up with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar for a Facebook live session, in which she talked about her body secrets. Shattering the concept of following the online food trends, she said, “Everyone’s talking about gluten-free pizza, brown bread, and red rice, about reducing their carb intake, and I’m eating white bread and butter at 4am. Rujuta showed me how local food eaten in moderation can be healthy.”

In the past, she has even shared photos of her enjoying bread on Instagram, which is a no-no for fitness freaks. “Who knew a piece of malt bread with avocado, tomatoes and a poached egg would make me so happy?,” she wrote.

"Ziox Duopix first impressions: Dual-front camera, but at what price?","Ziox Duopix is lightweight at 143 grams and fits comfortably in palms. The build quality is decent and on par with most of the affordable smartphones available out there. Ziox Duopix is lightweight at 143 grams and fits comfortably in palms.

By Tanmay Patange

Established in 2015, homegrown smartphone maker Ziox Mobiles is trying to stand out and make a name for itself in India’s affordable smartphone and feature phone segment. Ziox has expanded its existing smartphone lineup with the all new Ziox Duopix, which offers a dual front-facing camera. I used the Ziox Duopix at the launch event in Mumbai, and here are our first impressions for this smartphone.

Ziox Duopix design, display

The Ziox Duopix is lightweight at 143 grams and fits comfortably in palms. The build quality is decent and on par with most of the affordable smartphones available out there. Design-wise, it’s made up of plastic and measures 9.1 mm in thickness. The back cover is removable and less prone to smudges and fingerprints. The rear consists of a camera, LED flash, Ziox branding, and a speaker grille.

The power and volume controls are located on the right while on the left, there’s nothing. The 3.5 mm audio jack is on the bottom beside a microUSB port with OTG support and primary microphone. It lacks a fingerprint scanner of any kind. Ziox Duopix’s 5-inch HD (1,280 x 720) IPS display lacks any screen protection and oleophobic coating, leaving it exposed to smudges and fingerprints. Both the level of brightness and viewing angles are all right.

Ziox Duopix hardware, battery

Ziox Duopix is powered by an entry-level Spreadtrum SC9850 quad processor ticking at 1.3GHz, Mali-T820 GPU for graphics, and 2GB of RAM. It offers 16GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 64GB. The multitasking was fine and casual games like Temple Run and Subway Surfers ran without any hiccups. It packs a 2,500mAh removable battery, which is claimed to offer 10 hours of talk time and 650 hours of standby time.

Ziox Duopix software, UI

Ziox Duopix is the company’s second smartphone after the Astra Titan 4G to run a near-stock version of Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box. The near-stock UI is clean and has an app drawer as well. It comes pre-installed with native Android apps and no excess bloatware.

Ziox Duopix dual selfie cameras

The talking point of the Ziox Duopix is its dual selfie cameras, consisting of an 8MP wide-angle sensor and a 2MP secondary sensor located up front. It also houses front-facing flash for better selfies in poor lighting conditions. But the selfies we took in the demo zone were not up to the mark, and often struggled at focusing better. The viewfinder was sluggish too.

Ziox Duopix Final Thoughts

During the launch event, Ziox Duopix’s price and availability details were not revealed. However, given that it falls under the entry-level segment, the phone is unlikely to cost above Rs 7,000. The phone looks promising and has dual selfie cameras. However, in the budget category the phone will have a tough time competing with the likes of Redmi 4 and others.

PMLA case against Hasan Ali Khan: ED carries out searches in Mumbai,"The CBI’s fresh FIR has charged Khan for “cognisable offence(s)” under Sections 120 B and 420 of the IPC, Sections 13 (2), 13(1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 and Section 41(1) (b) of the CrPC. The CBI’s fresh FIR has charged Khan for “cognisable offence(s)” under Sections 120 B and 420 of the IPC, Sections 13 (2), 13(1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 and Section 41(1) (b) of the CrPC.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday conducted searches in at least four locations in Mumbai, including some premises of hawala traders allegedly connected to Pune businessman Hasan Ali Khan, who has been charged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act or PMLA. In July, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had issued a notice to Khan directing him to appear before the agency on July 4 and July 5 for interrogation in a fresh case filed by it against him for alleged criminal conspiracy and corruption. The case is based on a complaint filed by the ED. According to sources, Khan had requested for an extension from the CBI for appearing before the agency citing poor health.

The CBI’s fresh FIR has charged Khan for “cognisable offence(s)” under Sections 120 B and 420 of the IPC, Sections 13 (2), 13(1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 and Section 41(1) (b) of the CrPC. According to ED sources, while the first complaint did not name any government official or politician associated with Khan (62), the ED’s probe has now thrown some light on the contacts. The role of certain income tax department officials who probed the case is also under the scanner of the agency, said sources.

Khan’s lawyer in Pune, Prashant Patil told The Indian Express: “There is no such official confirmation to my client about any such raids being conducted. However, it is the irony of the present case that, in the last 10 years, the Income Tax Department and ED miserably failed to provide any prima facie evidence against my client. He lost his health and liberty to these presumptive allegations by the ED that till date has no prima facie basis. If there are allegations of money laundering, where is the money? The agencies have no answer to it. We are not aware of any allegation regarding criminal conspiracy with I-T official or any other government servant. The FIR has been registered by the CBI at the instance of the ED only to cover up the fact that till date, there is no prima facie evidence against Mr Khan. There is no point even talking about any alleged notarised document as the ED, since the past so many years, has not been able to provide any bank details or the account details of Mr Khan that come under the allegation of money laundering.”

He added: “The allegations are from the year 2006-07 and he was arrested in 2011 and kept in jail for no reason for four-and-a-half years. In this time period, they have miserably failed to to prove any of the allegations. It is easy to make allegations. Where is the proof of any such offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act? Khan’s health is deteriorating everyday because of such ruthless harassment,” Prashant said.

Patil said: “We filed an application, along with documentary evidences, to the ED in May 2016 to reflect that UBS has communicated to the Union Of India that these allegations are not true. Why does that communication of UBS, Switzerland, not relied upon if it is the official communication of the bank? The Special PMLA Court in 2011 had issued a Letter Regotary to the court concerned at Luxembourg to find out bank details of Mr Khan at the Royal Bank Of Luxembourg. The reply sent by that court was intentionally suppressed. The reply categorically says that there is no Royal Bank of Luxembourg. The entire set of allegations are just fake and untrue even to the knowledge of the ED. If there is any truth to the allegations why no trial has even commenced till date?”

In August last year, a three-member panel comprising top officials of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the CBI and the ED had questioned Khan on certain cross border transactions and entities set up in tax havens after the ED found fresh evidence of money laundering against Khan. The ED has been probing Khan for alleged laundering of $ 93 million acquired by him in 1997 and $700,000 acquired in 2006 under the PMLA. It is also investigating a June 2003 notarised statement of Khan confirming that he had opened an account in UBS, Singapore, in 1982 with a deposit of $1.5 million. The account was allegedly opened on the recommendation of deceased arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi who was also involved in the Bofors case. The investigation against Khan is also being monitored by SIT on black money.

In February last year, the ED had raided at least nine premises of Khan, his brother-in-law and some associates in Gurgaon, Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata and Hyderabad. Later, the ED provisionally attached the Pune residence of Khan under the PMLA.

Apart from this, the ED has forwarded a case of tax evasion by two companies— Payson Company Ltd and Autumn Holdings Ltd — set up by Khan and his associate, Kashinath Tapuriah, in the British Virgin Islands. The case pertains to undisclosed money earned by Khan in the form of commission and consulting fee through the two companies between January 1985 and December 1989.

PM Modi pulls up BJP MPs for skipping House,"Arun Jaitley, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and L K Advani at the party meeting Thursday. (Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri) Arun Jaitley, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and L K Advani at the party meeting Thursday. (Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri)

Pulling up BJP MPs for being absent from Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told them Thursday that their attendance in the House and performance would decide their renomination, including for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Modi also indicated that the presence of party chief Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha — elected from Gujarat this week — would make BJP members work more diligently and, according to one MP, end their days of “mauj masti”.

The Prime Minister, addressing BJP MPs for the first time after the absence of ruling party members in Rajya Sabha delayed the passage of a politically significant legislation and left the government red-faced, said he was not going to forget it.

An MP who attended the meeting said the Prime Minister was “deeply disappointed” with members who chose to be absent from the House despite repeated appeals. Modi was said to have asked the MPs why should the party have to issue a whip to ensure attendance.

On July 31, the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, realising that the treasury benches were short of numbers, forced a crucial clause to be dropped from The Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill, 2017 on granting constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC). Those absent included ministers.

A Lok Sabha MP said the Prime Minister has “made it clear that we could be MPs till 2019, but it will be our performance and our attendance that will decide our re-entry into Parliament”.

Welcoming Amit Shah, elected Rajya Sabha MP for the first time, Modi suggested that his presence would force members to work with greater diligence. He praised Shah, who completed three years as party chief Wednesday, saying he had brought back the culture of hard work and discipline.

One of the MPs said Modi told them that running the party while in power was much more difficult than it was in opposition.

Shah spoke on the condition of the Congress party in Gujarat. According to one present at the meeting, Shah said the Congress found it very difficult to manage 44 votes for its candidate (Ahmed Patel) in the Rajya Sabha elections.

“The party president wondered how a party that does not get the votes of its own elected MLAs will get votes of the electorate,” the source said.

"Bill to merge subsidiary banks with SBI clears LS, govt says boost to parent bank","Lok Sabha passed the bill to repeal the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act 1959 and State Bank of Hyderabad Act 1956, and to amend the State Bank of India Act 1955 Lok Sabha passed the bill to repeal the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act 1959 and State Bank of Hyderabad Act 1956, and to amend the State Bank of India Act 1955

Lok Sabha passed bills Thursday clearing the merger of subsidiary banks of State Bank of India with the parent bank. The government said this consolidation would not only lead to cutting of losses but also increase capital base and the bank’s ability to give loan. Lok Sabha passed the bill to repeal the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act 1959 and State Bank of Hyderabad Act 1956, and to amend the State Bank of India Act 1955, following the merger of five associates with SBI.

MoS (Finance) Santosh Gangwar said with this merger, SBI enters the list of top 50 banks globally, at 45th place. “The merger will bring about increased capital base and increased ability to give loans. Also, small banks will get access to products like mutual funds,” he said.

Allaying apprehensions that the consolidation would lead to closing of branches wherever both the main SBI and the subsidiary had branches, thus leading to poorer access for customers, Gangwar said, “We want every person to have access to banking services . No bank branches will be closed down; rather wherever required, we will open branches.” He said the merger will help increase SBI’s scope of operation and will pose a challenge to private banks as it will work as per the requirements of the people. “The merger has been planned keeping in mind the benefit of people and going forward its benefits will be seen,” he added.

According to the statement of object and reasons of the State Banks (Repeal and Amendment) Bill 2017, after the acquisition of the subsidiary banks by SBI, the subsidiary banks have ceased to exist and, therefore, it is necessary to repeal the SBI India (Subsidiary Banks) Act and the State Bank of Hyderabad Act.

Five associates and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank became part of SBI from April 1, catapulting the country’s largest lender into the list of top 50 banks in the world. The five associates are the State Banks of Bikaner & Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mysore, Patiala and Travancore. SBI had 90% shareholding in State Bank of Mysore, 75% in State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur and 79% in State Bank of Travancore.

Following the merger, the total customer base of SBI increased to 37 crore with a branch network of around 24,000 and nearly 59,000 ATMs. The merged entity began operation with a deposit base of more than Rs 26 lakh crore and advances level of Rs 18.50 lakh crore.

As per the bill, after the acquisition of all the subsidiary banks, it is no longer necessary to retain such provisions in the State Bank of India Act 1955. “Therefore, certain amendments are necessary in the said Act in so far as they relate to the subsidiary banks. The amendments are consequential in nature,” it says. During discussion on the bill, the Opposition argued that it was a way to gloss over rising nonperforming assets of banks which in SBI’s case had risen to close to 1.4 lakh crore.

Bill for sports university tabled MoS (Parliamentary Affairs) S S Ahluwalia introduced a bill seeking to establish India’s first exclusive sports university of international standards. Ahluwalia introduced the bill after question hour in the absence of MoS for Sports Vijay Goel, who is indisposed. The National Sports University Bill 2017 will facilitate the establishment of the university in Manipur. There are several sports institutes in the country but the university will have a wider canvas, encompassing disciplines like sports science, sports technology and high performance training.

PUCs must for renewal of vehicle insurance: SC,"Supreme court Supreme court

Cracking down on vehicular pollution, the Supreme Court on Thursday made it mandatory for vehicle owners to produce Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates for annual insurance renewal. A bench of Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta approved the recommendations of the SC-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) to ensure mandatory linking of PUC certificates with the issue of annual vehicle insurance. The bench directed that no insurance be granted to vehicles without valid PUC certificates.

EPCA had made the recommendations in its report (on assessment of PUC programme in Delhi and NCR) submitted to the court in April this year. The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had opposed this, saying the two cannot be merged. While insurance renewal happens every year, pollution checks are carried out at regular intervals, it contended.

The bench asked the Ministry to ensure that all fuel refilling centres in the NCR have PUC centres. It gave the Centre four weeks’ time to enure that there are functional PUC centres in the NCR.

Arjuna Ranatunga urges ICC to investigate Sri Lanka board president,"Sri Lanka lost the ongoing Test series against India. (Source: AP) Sri Lanka lost the ongoing Test series against India. (Source: AP)

Blaming the series of defeats on the players and the head of the Sri Lanka cricket board, former captain Arjuna Ranatunga has said that the International Cricket Council should get involved and investigate the board president. Ranatunga accused the president of being involved in gambling and players for having “no discipline in the team.”

“There is no proper discipline in the team… (but) no point in blaming the cricketers when they get involved in all these gambling things. First they have to get the officials in order,” Ranatunga told AFP.

Last few months haven’t been good for Sri Lanka cricket as they exited the Champions Trophy from the group stage, lost an ODI series to Zimbabwe at home and have now lost the ongoing Test series against India.

Ranatunga urged the ICC to investigate Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala, 52, for being involved in gaming and remove him as head.

“I want to know if the ICC has a backbone to check if these people (Sri Lanka Cricket management) are in compliance with ethics standards,” Ranatunga told AFP.

Sumathipala, who denied the allegations, has said that ICC and Sri Lanka sports ministry have cleared him to be in-charge.

“I deny any involvement personally, directly or indirectly with gaming business,” Sumathipala told AFP.

Ranatunga is Sri Lanka’s minister of petroleum and Sumathipala said the wants to take over the board from him. He also said this is not the first time allegations against the board have been made.

“If he wants to criticise the government, he must first resign,” Sumathipala said. “Every time the game is affected at the middle, Sri Lanka cricketers are not performing to the expectation, we hear this kind of noise coming from the same quarter,” Sumathipala said.

“The same man (Ranatunga) is continuously making every effort undemocratically, unethically to hold office of Sri Lanka Cricket, even when he has been democratically defeated more than once,” Sumathipala said.

Ranatunga, since his retirement from cricket, has been active in politics and also ran the cricket board as unelected administrator in 2008. He lost the electiosn last year. The next elections are only five months away.

“I thought OK, if the government thinks this is right — and I am part of this government — I tried to take a step back and allowed them (the board) to run. They have messed up everything,” Ranatunga said.

Tiger Woods pleads guilty to reckless driving,"Tiger Woods’ attorney, Douglas Duncan represented him in court in North Palm Beach County. (Source: Reuters) Tiger Woods’ attorney, Douglas Duncan represented him in court in North Palm Beach County. (Source: Reuters)

Tiger Woods has agreed to plead guilty to reckless driving and will enter a diversion program that will allow him to have his record wiped clean if he completes the program, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Woods, 41, was charged with driving under the influence in May when he was found asleep in his Mercedes-Benz, apparently under the influence of a prescription painkiller and sleeping medication. No alcohol was found in his system.

Woods did not appear at the Palm Beach County courthouse for his arraignment. Prosecutor Adrienne Ellis said the golf superstar agreed to plead guilty at an Oct. 25 hearing and enter the county’s program for first-time DUI offenders.

“He is not being treated any different than anyone else,” Ellis said.

Woods’ attorney, Douglas Duncan, entered a not guilty plea to the DUI charge on Woods’ behalf and declined comment as he left the courthouse.

Under the plea deal, prosecutors would drop the DUI charge, which is a more severe charge than reckless driving. If he completes the program, he can ask a judge to expunge the reckless driving conviction.

In the diversion program, Woods will spend a year on probation, pay a $250 fine and court costs, attend DUI school and perform 50 hours of community service. He would also have to attend a workshop where victims of impaired drivers detail how their lives were damaged and face other conditions. Since the program began four years ago, almost 2,400 defendants have enrolled, according to the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office.

If convicted of DUI, Woods would have faced a fine of between $500 and $1,000, had his car impounded for 10 days and other conditions. He also could have been jailed for up to six months, although that was unlikely, received probation and lost his driver’s license for six months to a year.

The DUI arrest was the first time Woods had been in trouble since Thanksgiving weekend 2009, when he plowed his SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his then-Windermere, Florida, home. That led to revelations that he had multiple extramarital affairs and a divorce from his wife Elin Nordegren, the mother of his two children. He spent 45 days in a Mississippi clinic where he was treated for sex addiction.

Woods was arrested at 2 a.m. May 29 about 15 miles from his home in Jupiter, Florida, when officers found him unconscious in his Mercedes-Benz, which was parked awkwardly on the side of the road and had damage to the driver’s side. It’s not clear how he damaged the car. Officers checked the area but didn’t find that he had hit anything.

Woods didn’t know where he was when asked by officers, and he stumbled and swayed through a field sobriety test, police dashboard camera video showed. Woods told officers he was taking the painkiller Vicodin and Xanax, which treats anxiety and insomnia, to cope with his fourth back surgery in April.

Woods announced last month he had completed treatment at an out-of-state clinic to deal with his use of prescription medications.

His 79 PGA Tour victories and 14 major titles both rank No. 2 all-time. He has not competed since February because of his back injury and is not expected to return this year. His last win was in August 2013.

"Princess Diana’s letters may fetch over USD 125,000 at auction","Late Princess Diana. (Source: File photo) Late Princess Diana. (Source: File photo)

An archive of 33 intimate letters written by Princess Diana, providing firsthand insights into her troubled marriage and personal insecurities, is expected to fetch over USD 125,000 at an auction. The handwritten letters addressed to Diana’s confidante Carolyn Pride Bartholomew were written from between 1978 and 1997. The archive documents the seldom-explored years of Diana’s from January 1980 to January 1982. This period includes the royal engagement and wedding to Prince Charles, the three-month-long honeymoon, Diana’s first pregnancy and initial year of marriage, according to RR auction house in the US.

The letters touch upon some of the most widely speculated aspects of Diana’s life including her tumultuous marriage, her doubts and an indirect mention of Camilla, now married to Prince Charles.

She also talks about her weight and self-esteem insecurities, recurring depression, and despair over press intrusion.

“The weight is down to 9 1/2 stone – got into a size 29 jeans on Saturday, instead of 32! So I am feeling much healthier but don’t imagine a slender gal – ’cause there is still a lot to come off,” the princess wrote in one of the letters.

The penned correspondence archive consist of 33 main pieces: 28 handwritten signed letters from Diana, encompassing 109 pages over 60 sheet; 26 are signed “Diana,” one signed “D,” and one signed, “me”.

Eight include the original hand-addressed envelopes, several with her initial “D”.

Diana met Carolyn at West Heath School when they were 12 -years-old.

They shared a dormitory then and became flatmates seven years later at 60 Colherne Court. Demonstrative of Diana and Carolyn’s intense bond, Carolyn would be Prince Harry’s godmother, and Diana godmother to her son Jack.

The online bidding begins on August 18.

US may lose its competitive edge due to H-1B clampdown:Report,"The report titled ‘The IT Boom and Other Unintended Consequences of Chasing the American Dream’ takes an in-depth look at how the H-1B visa programme affects both the US and Indian economies. The report titled ‘The IT Boom and Other Unintended Consequences of Chasing the American Dream’ takes an in-depth look at how the H-1B visa programme affects both the US and Indian economies.

Clampdown on H-1B visa programme will make it difficult for the US IT sector to attract open talent from countries like India and America might lose its competitive edge, a top American think-tank has said.

As the Trump administration is carrying out a review of the non-immigrant visas, the Center for Global Development (CGD) in a report said that H-1B visa, the most sought after by Indian IT professionals, is beneficial for both India and the US.

“It is really important to make sure that the I-T sectors from both countries are allowed to attract the right kind of people, because they really allow for innovation and growth in both the countries,” Gaurav Khanna, fellow at the CGD and co-author of the research paper, said.

The report titled ‘The IT Boom and Other Unintended Consequences of Chasing the American Dream’ takes an in-depth look at how the H-1B visa programme affects both the US and Indian economies.

“Both the economies have really benefited from the H-1B programme,” he told PTI.

“What our paper is really trying to stress, is that on average the US is better off because of the H-1B programme. So clamping down on the H-1B programme will basically not allow the US IT sector to attract the open talent from places like India. The US might then lose its competitive edge in IT production,” he warned, adding that IT companies might move to countries like Canada in the event of large scale clampdown on H-1B visas.

Khanna said the research has shown that India has been a beneficiary of brain-gain, rather than brain drain due to the visa programme.

“If you think about what happens in India, you know the prospect of migrating to the US and earning such a high wage…it seemed they really encouraged certain students and workers to acquire skills that would be valued by the H-1B programme,” he said.

The research, which examines the relationship between migration and the outsourcing of IT production to India since the early 2000s, found that US workers are on average, better off by about USD 431 million or USD 1,345 per additional migrant in 2010 because of the H-1B programme.

The study incorporates crucial mechanisms like innovation by businesses, trade with other countries, and the choices made by students and workers to become computer scientists.

While there are some negative impacts for a subset of the US workers, the overall gains outweigh the losses as the combined incomes of the US and India both rise under the H-1B programme by about USD 17.3 billion or 0.36 per cent. And total IT output from both nations rose steadily under the H-1B regime by about 0.45 per cent in 2010, the CGD research said.

It also found out that better technology, as a by-product of this immigration of tech workers, increased the overall productivity of other sectors as well, and consumers of computer-related goods enjoyed better software and lower prices.

The study found a one per cent decrease in price for US IT products and an 7.4 per cent fall in Indian IT products.

“The average worker in each country is better off because of immigration, and US native workers have made big gains because of the H-1B visa programme,” Khanna said.

“Yes, there may be things that can be done to blunt distributional impacts that affect a subset of workers, but overall, this policy has been a net-positive for the US economy and workers,” he asserted.

The research found out that those who migrated to the US, acquired skills, technical know-how and established networks with US companies. After their visas expired, they returned with these acquired human capital and technology and contributed to the growing tech-workforce in India.

“Together, the brain-gain to India under the H-1B programme outweighs any brain-drain,” it said.

According to Khanna, the increase in IT sector productivity, because of the additional knowledge and skilled workers spurred by the H-1B visa programme, allowed India to eventually surpass the US in software exports. Over time, some IT production begins to be outsourced from the US to India.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Rohit Kumar shines but Bengaluru Bulls fail to get past Tamil Thalaivas,"Rohit Kumar was pushing his team forward scoring some extraordinary raid points. (Source: PKL Media) Rohit Kumar was pushing his team forward scoring some extraordinary raid points. (Source: PKL Media)

Rohit Kumar scored 12 points on Friday against Tamil Thalaivas, 11 of which came from raids. Each of these were a sight to see. As has been the case every time Bengaluru Bulls took the mat at Nagpur, Rohit Kumar was pushing his team forward, scoring some extraordinary raid points. Even then, he went to collect his awards and trophies without a smile on his face. It was almost as if he wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. When congratulated for his performance in the post match press conference, Rohit Kumar smiled and said, “Kaha bhai, uska kuch fayda nai hua (There was no use of my performance)”

His frustration is not misplaced. Despite his performance, and Ravinder Pahal’s efforts in defence, Bengaluru Bulls lost 29-24 to Tamil Thalaivas. Just a day earlier, their team work was on display when they triumphed over the Bengal Warriors. Rohit had managed only 3 points in that match but it was a day when he played a more withdrawn role while Ajay Kumar plundered the opposition defence. “At his best, he can dismiss an entire team,” said an elated Rohit after that match.

But on Friday, Ajay went for 10 raids and managed just one point out of them all. Ashish Kumar went in five times and scored two points. Apart from this and Rohit’s own gargantuan effort, one find nobody worth a mention at the end of the match on Friday.

The last time these two sides met was the first time the Bulls played in Nagpur. At the time, they took a seemingly unbreakable lead at half time. But the Thalaivas almost found a way back, losing the match by a margin of just a point. They seemed to start this match from where they left off on that day and were leading 8-12 at half time. This margin increased to seven points in the first few minutes of the second half.

Enter Rohit Kumar. He went in for consecutive raids and came back with points every time. He slid under a defenders, touched the mid line with the tip of his fingers from under another and even jumped over one and landed on his shoulder. He came back to defend, clutching that shoulder, then went back in and came out with a point. The way Tamil Thalaivas celebrated when they finally got him out is only proof of the effect he had on the game. Unfortunately for him, his team did not reflect his form and they slipped to a third defeat at home.

"Two families, a rape case and relief after a wedding in Bareilly","The teen at her in-laws’ house in Bareilly district. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra) The teen at her in-laws’ house in Bareilly district. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)

IT HAS now been a month that the 18-year-old has been married. To fellow residents of a village in Bareilly, she has been married to the man who had been accused of raping her. To the bride herself, she has finally been united with the man she loves. The teen, who also has a nine-month-old son, is now living happily in her in-laws’ house. Her nikah was attended by most villagers; the couple have also registered the marriage. Last week, her husband, 20, left for Delhi, where he sets up carts and sells vegetables.

“Now everything is fine. I am very happy that everyone has agreed and we are married,” she says, as she holds the baby and tries settling her red dupatta over her head. Wearing a printed salwar and her bangles tinkling, she walks about her husband’s brick house and its open spaces. A few months ago, it was a very different story. The two families were bitterly fighting it out in court.

Following a complaint that he had raped her for six months, a case under IPC sections 376, 323 and 504 had been lodged against him. He was arrested in August 2016 and was in jail for five months. “I was in love with him and then I got pregnant. He told me that he could not marry me,” she says. “By then my father had also come to know and he could not accept this and a complaint was filed.”

Her father is a daily wager who has seven more children to support. The family is happy that she has settled in her in-laws’ home, which is a few steps away from theirs. Apart from relief, it was also a question of two more mouths to feed. “Fighting the court case cost us a lot of money. Hamare paas bahut karza hai so aur kuch nahin karsakta tha,” says the girl’s mother, sitting on one of four charpoys in the two-room house where people and animals live together. Her daughter, however, recalls that they had got some compensation after the complaint. “I don’t remember how much it was. But I know the money came to my father’s account,” she says.

At the nikah, her mother gifted her a goat. Her husband’s family too is relieved. His elder sister says, “We had said we are ready to get the two married. I don’t know what happened with her father that he should go and file a complaint against my brother. And then came a series of court cases.” “We were tense for the last one year and we also spent a lot of money,” says the youth’s mother. “For every hearing we had to go to Bareilly, travelling almost 45 km.”

The village has mostly narrow kutcha roads and people transport their goods on horse-driven carts. Many villagers feel that the matter was needlessly allowed to blow up. “Usi chakkar mein sab ko pareshani hui. Achcha hai aab sab thik ho gaya,” says Shamina, of the village. At Shergarh police station, senior officer Umesh Singh says they have received a letter from the SDM, Mirganj, that the marriage has been registered.

“We had filed a chargesheet, so from our side the matter was fully investigated,” Singh says. The couple now need to take the marriage certificate to court at the next hearing to get the case quashed. “We are just hoping this gets over for good — that the court accepts the marriage and the false cases against my brother are gone,” says the youth’s sister. “It has been too much pressure on us.”

Australian football crisis deepens as FIFA fails to end dispute,"A joint FIFA-Asian Football Confederation delegation arrived in Sydney two days ago to try to broker an agreement but is departing back to Zurich with no such result. A joint FIFA-Asian Football Confederation delegation arrived in Sydney two days ago to try to broker an agreement but is departing back to Zurich with no such result.

Officials from football’s international governing body FIFA have failed to resolve a dispute between Australia’s Football Federation (FFA) and the A-league but discussions will continue, local media reported on Thursday.

The 10 clubs that make up the A-league have been pushing for the FFA to expand its 10-member Congress into a more democratic model but the FFA has been reluctant to meet the demands.

The Congress, which elects the FFA board, has representatives of the country’s nine states and territories but currently just one delegate for all 10 clubs in the top-flight A-League and none representing the players.

The clubs say they generate 80 percent of revenues for football in Australia and want at least five seats on the Congress. The FFA, however, have offered the clubs two additional votes and one for the players on an expanded 13-member Congress, which both the clubs and FIFA have rejected.

A joint FIFA-Asian Football Confederation delegation arrived in Sydney two days ago to try to broker an agreement but is departing back to Zurich with no such result, the Sydney Morning Herald and Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported, citing sources involved in the discussions.

However, the FFA said discussions were continuing. FIFA will disband the FFA if no solution is reached by Nov. 30. The global body as said it would install a ‘normalisation committee’, which would effectively take over governance of the sport.

“We are bitterly disappointed at not having reached consensus with our fellow stakeholders,” Greg Griffin, chairman of Adelaide United and of the Australia Professional Football Clubs Association, was quoted as saying by both the AAP and Sydney Morning Herald.

He accused the FFA board of “obstructing the process”.

FFA Chairman Steven Lowy said in a statement on the FFA website (www.footballaustralia.com.au) that the federation was still hopeful of an agreement before the deadline. “A wide range of options has been robustly discussed over the past 48 hours,” he said.

“Everyone, including the FFA Board, A-League club owners, Member Federations and the PFA have shown willingness to move from their original positions and this has been noted by the FIFA/AFC delegation.”

Malaysia moves closer to scrapping mandatory death penalty for drug traffickers,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

Malaysia’s cabinet has agreed unanimously to do away with the mandatory death penalty for drug traffickers, a minister said on Monday, but the decision still has to be approved by parliament. The cabinet agreed to amend the colonial-era Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 to give courts a choice in sentencing, Azalina Othman Said, a minister in the prime minister’s department, said in a written parliamentary response.

Capital punishment is mandatory in Malaysia for murder and drug trafficking, among other crimes. A total of 651 Malaysians have been sentenced to death since 1992 – most of them for drug offences, Azalina said.

In March, human rights group Amnesty International ranked Malaysia tenth in the use of death penalty among the 23 countries that carried out capital punishment last year.

“While the announcement for changes to the mandatory death penalty in its limited form to drug trafficking is a welcome move, it must only be considered a first step towards total abolition,” Shamini Darshni Kaliemuthu, executive director of Amnesty International Malaysia, said in a statement. It was not immediately clear when the amended law would be put before parliament, but it is expected to be approved.

"Monsoon session: Attacked over mohalla clinics, Jain tells Oppn ‘to get L-G nod’","Delhi health Minister Satyendar Jain (File Photo) Delhi health Minister Satyendar Jain (File Photo)

Delhi health Minister Satyendar Jain, while fielding questions regarding delay in setting up of more mohalla clinics from his own party’s legislators, lost his temper when he was criticised by BJP MLAs. Jain retorted by saying why the BJP MLAs “don’t approach” Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal for his nod on the project.

Jain claimed that the delay in setting up the clinics — a key project for the Arvind Kejriwal government — was because officials were repeatedly seeking clearance from the L-G’s office for changes, ranging from increased security to questions of land. But BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa repeatedly alleged that due to the AAP government’s “failure”, the project had not taken off with full strength.

The issue was brought up when AAP MLA Rajesh Gupta asked Jain “whether the government had proposed to open 1,000 mohalla clinics all over Delhi” and what their “current status” was.

AAP MLA Mahender Goyal added that in the “first rung clinics, all tests were taking place” but this wasn’t the case in the “second rung of clinics”. AAP MLA Sahi Ram raised the issue of a recent theft at a clinic in Lado Sarai.

“The government has prepared four Cabinet notes about it (mohalla clinics). Recently, the L-G had given his approval to it, but there is confusion among officers on whether the L-G has given his go-ahead to all clinics or some such facilities,” the health minister told the House. Jain alleged that hurdles are being created in setting up mohalla clinics and a solution to this will be found soon.

A government source said, “A number of officials are simply scared to put their assent on any file and want everything to be cleared by the L-G. As a result of this, no work is getting done. After a CBI case against former health secretary Tarun Seem, things only became slower.”

Although AAP MLAs Rajesh Gupta and Ritu Raj sought to know why the L-G’s nod is required “in everything”, the BJP claimed that the AAP was attempting to pin the blame on the L-G to hide their own failures. “The AAP has failed the project,” claimed Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta. The trading of charges that followed saw Jain lose his temper. “If (BJP MLAs) are so keen then why don’t they approach the L-G and ask him to give the nod,” he said. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel also suggested that a five-member delegation consisting BJP and AAP MLAs can meet the L-G over the issue.

President Nicolas Maduro vows ‘maximum penalty’ for attack on Venezuela base,"Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro speaks during his weekly broadcast “Los Domingos con Maduro” (The Sundays with Maduro) in Caracas, Venezuela August 6, 2017.

(Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS)

President Nicolas Maduro vowed that a band of anti-government fighters who attacked a Venezuelan army base will get the “maximum penalty” as his administration roots out his enemies.

Troops killed two of the 20 intruders who slipped into the Paramacay base in the central city of Valencia early Sunday, apparently intent on fomenting a military uprising, Maduro said in his weekly broadcast on state television. One of the invaders was injured, seven captured and 10 got away, the embattled leader said. “We know where they are headed and all of our military and police force is deployed,” Maduro said. He said he would ask for “the maximum penalty for those who participated in this terrorist attack.”

The attack came as Venezuela’s controversial constitutional assembly is getting down to work, signaling in its initial decrees last week that delegates will target Maduro’s foes as he had warned. The new assembly, whose powers supersede all other branches of government, voted to remove the nation’s outspoken chief prosecutor Saturday. On Sunday, Maduro announced that a new “truth commission” created by the assembly had been installed to impose justice on those fueling the unrest that has wracked the country since early April.

The constitutional assembly is expected to meet again Tuesday, while lawmakers in the opposition-controlled National Assembly scheduled their own session for Monday, vowing to continue fulfilling their responsibilities no matter what the assembly might do. Leaders of opposition groups, which boycotted the July 30 assembly election, called for renewed protests on Monday, though turnout at demonstrations has been sparse in recent days.

Residents who live near the army base in Valencia attacked Sunday said they began hearing bursts of gunfire around 4:30 a.m. A video showing more than a dozen men dressed in military fatigues, some carrying rifles, began circulating widely on social media around that time. In the recording, a man who identified himself as Capt. Juan Caguaripano said the men were members of the military who oppose Maduro’s socialist government and called on military units to declare themselves in open rebellion. “This is not a coup d’etat,” the man said. “This is a civic and military action to re-establish the constitutional order.”

Maduro said 20 men entered the base and managed to reach the weapons depot undetected, but then an alarm sounded alerting troops to the incursion. He said 10 of the invaders fled, some carrying off arms, while those left behind exchanged gunfire with soldiers until about 8 a.m. before all were either killed or captured. “Today we had to defeat terrorism with bullets,” he said.

Nearby residents who saw the dissident group’s video online gathered around the military base chanting “Freedom!” Other protests also emerged around Valencia into the afternoon. Troops dispersed protesters with tear gas and a man was fatally shot at a demonstration less than a mile from the base, said Haydee Franco, coordinating secretary of the opposition Progressive Advance party.

More than 120 people have been reported killed in four months of unrest that has been fueled by anger at the socialist government over food shortages, soaring inflation and high crime.

Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez characterized the attackers as a “paramilitary” expedition, saying the intruders were civilians dressed in uniforms. He did not identify any of the participants, but said they included a lieutenant who had abandoned his post. He said the man who recorded the video was a former officer dismissed three years ago after being charged with rebellion and betraying the homeland.

In 2014, Caguaripano released a 12-minute video denouncing Maduro during a previous wave of anti-government unrest. He later reportedly sought exile after a military tribunal ordered his arrest, appearing in an interview on CNN en Espanol to draw attention to what he said was discontent within military ranks.

Venezuela’s latest bout of political unrest erupted in protest to a Supreme Court decision in late March ordering the National Assembly dissolved. Although the order was quickly lifted, near-daily demonstrations snowballed into a general protest calling for a new presidential election.

Opposition leaders have urged the military, which historically has served as an arbiter of Venezuela’s political disputes, to break with Maduro over what his foes consider violations of the constitution. But the president is believed to still have the military’s support.

Like Sunday’s uprising, most manifestations of dissent among troops have been small and isolated so far. “It’s still very hard to know to what extent there are significant divisions within the military,” Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said recently.

Veggie bank notes? Bank of England sticks with animal-fat cash,"The new polymer five pound note at Whitecross Street Market in London, Britain. (Source: Reuters) The new polymer five pound note at Whitecross Street Market in London, Britain. (Source: Reuters)

Britain’s new plastic bank notes will continue to be made with traces of animal fat despite thousands of complaints from vegetarians and religious groups. The Bank of England said on Thursday there were environmental risks to using the alternative, derived from palm oil, and that the government had ruled it too expensive.

The BoE last year launched its first polymer banknotes which it said were more durable and harder to fake. But more than 130,000 people signed an online petition calling on the BoE to stop using animal products in the notes after it emerged that they contained small amounts of tallow — which comes from cows and sheep — prompting the central bank to launch a consultation.

Some Hindu temples and vegetarian cafes refused to accept the new five pound note which features World War Two leader Winston Churchill. “The Bank fully recognises the concerns raised by members of the public … and has not taken this decision lightly,” it said on Thursday.

The only alternative for its polymer banknotes was to use more expensive chemicals derived from palm oil, and that its suppliers were unable to commit to that in an environmentally friendly way, the BoE said. Britain’s planned new polymer 20-pound and its 10-pound notes, which will be launched in September, are also affected by Thursday’s announcement.

The BoE said that as well as the environmental concerns about palm oil, cost was a consideration: the switch would add about 16.5 million pounds ($21.45 million) to the cost of making bank notes over the next 10 years.

“Her Majesty’s Treasury advised the Bank that it does not believe switching to palm oil derivatives would achieve value for money for taxpayer,” it said. Britain’s polymer bank notes typically contain less than 0.05 percent of animal products, the BoE said.

Narada probe: ED quizzes Kolkata Mayor,"Sovan Chartterjee outside ED office in Kolkata. (Express photo) Sovan Chartterjee outside ED office in Kolkata. (Express photo)

After evading summons thrice, state Fire Minister and Kolkata Mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Thursday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in connection to the Narada Sting probe. He was questioned at the ED office in Kolkata for nine hours.

The Narada sting videos, released just before the 2016 Assembly elections, had showed several Trinamool Congress leaders purportedly accepting money from a fictitious company. The CBI had booked 12 Trinamool leaders in the case, following which, ED, too, had initiated a case to probe the money trail.

“Chatterjee initially denied accepting money… Later, when he was grilled for long and officials asked him if generally people come and donate money to him, he said yes… However, he still didn’t give a clear statement on why and how much money he had taken. Thus, the interrogation continued for long. He will be called for interrogation again,” said a source in the ED.

"Centenary celebrations of Deendayal Upadhyay: Theory of integral humanism shows the way to serve the last man, says CM","CM Devendra Fadnavis and legislators from the state Assembly and Legislative Council square off against each other in a friendly football match, at the Vidhan Bhavan on Thursday. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar) CM Devendra Fadnavis and legislators from the state Assembly and Legislative Council square off against each other in a friendly football match, at the Vidhan Bhavan on Thursday. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar)

The RSS and BJP ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay’s theory of integral humanism held at its core the highest service to the nation and the mankind that transcends beyond the trappings of crony capitalism and class conflict, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Thursday. He mooted a resolution in the Maharashtra legislative Assembly to commemorate the the centenary celebrations of Upadhyay, describing him as a visionary whose concept of “Antodaya” is being pursued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reach the socio-economic benefits to the last mile and the man in the country.

The BJP ideologue evolved a theory that would be more relevant to the ancient civilisation of the East while subscribing to the modern scientific mindset of the West. Explaining the central theme of integral humanism, Fadnavis said that Upadhyay believed the “devotion to Bharat Mata was supreme. How could any body compromise on one’s motherand? Therefore, it was always asserted that a person was more valued than the purse. The party more valued than the person. And the nation above the party.”

The socio-economic model that has been recommended through human integralism has evolved on national concerns and the highest principles of mass welfare, Fadnavis said. Upadhyay believed that India required its own socio-economic model for the development in the national interest that was inclusive, he added.

“Upadhyay believed in the development and integration of minorities with the mainstream but did not subscribe to their appeasement; no hatred against the community,” Fadnavis said.

Cutting across party lines, the Congress and the NCP leaders also hailed the ideologue. NCP leader Jayant Patil highlighted the personal facets of Upadhyay. He recounted several instances of his austerity, simplicity and honesty in public and private life. Citing an example, he said: “Once the socialist leader, Rammanohar Lohia, had sent a delegation for discussing an important national issue. When the delegates reached, they were surprised to see Upadhyay washing his own clothes. He made the delegates comfortable and continued washing and also simultaneously discussed the national issue. The incident shows the down-to-earth attitude of the great leader.”

Senior Congress leader Patangrao Kadam recounted the academic excellence and immense work done by Upadhyay in the field of water conservation. “Yes, we belong to different political parties, but we have to acknowledge the stature and contribution of leaders to the nation,” he said.

Earlier, the state Assembly and the Legislative Council felicitated Nanaji Deshmukh, who always shunned power and position in politics and instead, dedicated himself to public service. The services of former Congress leader and home minister late Balasaheb Desai were also recalled by leaders across party lines.

"Interview: Equity exposure for govt, non-govt employees should be uniform, says PFRDA chairman Hemant Contractor","Mandatory annuity is there to the extent of 40 per cent of the corpus of NPS. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Mandatory annuity is there to the extent of 40 per cent of the corpus of NPS. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)

Hemant Contractor, chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), which regulates the National Pension System (NPS) with a corpus of close to Rs 2 lakh crore, says that it has managed to get over 10 per cent returns for its 1.67 crore subscribers in the past 8 years. In an interview with GEORGE MATHEW, Contractor, who was earlier the managing director of State Bank of India (SBI), spoke about the new plans and initiatives of the regulator. Edited excerpts:

What are your plans to expand the pension scheme? Have you worked out the auto-enrolment system?

Auto-enrolment is a concept which is popular in the UK and New Zealand, among other countries. These are voluntary schemes. What happens is that if a sector is covered under auto-enrolment, all the people working in that sector will automatically get covered under the pension scheme unless they chose to opt out. This has been tried out successfully in some countries. We feel that in India also there is a scope. This proposal is now with the government. This is mostly for the unorganised sector.

Are you planning to rework or review mandatory annuity under NPS?

Mandatory annuity is there to the extent of 40 per cent of the corpus of NPS. We have been discussing with the government some alternatives like systematic withdrawal plan. This is still under discussion with the government. We do feel that some choices should be given to the subscribers in addition to annuity.

Is PFRDA working on a plan to provide housing for members?

We had set up a committee. They had sent the final report last week. We will look into that. In many countries, people who join the pension scheme do have the facility of using some of the funds for the housing needs. Even the EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation) is doing it.

Hemant Contractor, chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). Hemant Contractor, chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).

What has been the response of the private sector to the pension scheme?

The private sector has grown very well. The All Citizens Scheme has grown by almost 100 per cent. The Atal Pension Scheme has also grown by 100 per cent. We have 60 lakh subscribers in Atal schemes. These schemes are doing well.

Employee provident fund (EPF) has more tax advantages when compared to NPS. Are you satisfied with this system?

We should keep it at par with EPF. Both are pension schemes. Treatment should be alike. That’s the stand we have taken.

Mutual funds and insurance firms are running pension schemes. They are regulated by sectoral regulators like Sebi and IRDAI. Don’t you think such schemes should come under PFRDA?

We have taken it up with the government. Any pension scheme should be under our regulation. We were not a statutory body till about two years ago. Now, we are established as a statutory body and we are charged with the task of regulating the pension sector.

Are you planning to review the investment pattern of government employees under NPS?

We’re investing around 13-14 per cent of the corpus in the equity market. We are planning to increase it. We have put up a proposal to the government to increase it to 50 per cent. In the case of government servants, the equity investment is limited to 15 per cent, whereas in the case of non-government employees, it can go up to as high as 50 per cent. It should be uniform for all.

Are you batting for uniform investment pattern in stock market investment?

We have said that government servants should be given the same choice. If that happens, it will be a big change. Government employees’ contribution accounts for 87 per cent of the total funds. That could make a lot of difference. In the long term, it has shown that equity is the better investment in terms of returns.

Can you share the returns on investment under NPS?

For the past eight years, we have given over 10 per cent return. Last year, on the equity investment, we generated 18 per cent return, corporate bonds around 12 per cent and government securities less than that. Returns are as good as what you can get in the market. However, in the changing interest rate scenario, the returns can also come down. The general trend is that interest rates will come down. These will come down. It will be within the range of the market.

What has been the growth of NPS?

The growth this year has been as good as previous year. Last year, the number of subscribers grew by around 27 per cent. We are maintaining that pace of growth in the number of subscribers. Investments also grew by around 47 per cent last year. This year also we are averaging around the same growth. The amount that we have under investment is just under Rs 2 lakh crore — that’s Rs 1,98,000 crore. The number of subscribers is around 16.7 million now.

What has been the growth in government subscribers?

The growth in number of subscribers in the government sector is around 11-12 per cent, which is less than the average that the PFRDA has clocked. The growth in government subscribers depend on the retirement that’s taking place and replacements.

How long will it take for the country to become a pensioned society?

We have a long way to go. As of now, the pension coverage is about 16 per cent of the working population. This will require lot of initiatives from the government. Pension schemes will not take off on its own. It needs a lot of support from the government.

"Mumbai: Amid SP walkout, BMC makes Vande Mataram must in schools","Following the Madras High Court ruling making Vande Mataram mandatory in schools in Tamil Nadu, Sandeep Patel, a BJP corporator from P-South Ward (Goregaon West) of the BMC had demanded that singing of the national song be made compulsory in BMC-run schools. (File photo) Following the Madras High Court ruling making Vande Mataram mandatory in schools in Tamil Nadu, Sandeep Patel, a BJP corporator from P-South Ward (Goregaon West) of the BMC had demanded that singing of the national song be made compulsory in BMC-run schools. (File photo)

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Thursday passed a proposal to make singing of national song Vande Mataram compulsory in all civic schools, even as Samajwadi Party corporators walked out of the general body meeting in disagreement. The proposal, which might be extended to government-aided schools in BMC jurisdiction, will now be sent to BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta for his remarks.

After the proposal was tabled before the civic general body, corporators of the SP and the Congress sought a discussion in the matter. However, the proposal was passed without a discussion and debate. This prompted the SP corporators to stage a walkout.

“We had sought a discussion, and also asked for voting to be conducted on the proposal. This was not considered and the proposal was cleared without any discussion. This is against the rule,” said SP corporator Raees Shaikh.

Following the Madras High Court ruling making Vande Mataram mandatory in schools in Tamil Nadu, Sandeep Patel, a BJP corporator from P-South Ward (Goregaon West) of the BMC had demanded that singing of the national song be made compulsory in BMC-run schools.

Patel filed a notice of motion (NM) regarding it before the general body and the same was tabled on Thursday. The NM filed by Patel stated that every civic school student must sing Vande Mataram at least twice a week. Patel has also demanded that the national song be sung before all BMC committee meetings. Patel said the move will help instill a sense of patriotism among people.

“This will help instill a sense of patriotism among citizens, especially the youth. They need to remember the freedom struggle,” Patel added.

However, Shaikh, while clarifying that neither his party nor he were against Vande Mataram, said: “Our stand is clear. The national song should not be imposed on people. I stand in respect every time Vande Mataram is sung before general body meetings. However, making it mandatory amounts to imposing it on school students.”

Meanwhile, civic officials said there is no set time frame for the civic chief to submit his remarks on the proposal.

“There is no deadline as such for the BMC commissioner to submit his remarks on the proposal passed by the house. However, depending on the civic chief’s remark, the proposal is likely to be discussed again in the general body,” said a senior BMC official.

The HRD Ministry’s plans to set up an agency to conduct all national entrance tests for admission to higher education institutions has hit a bump. The ministry, which was ready with the Cabinet note, has now been asked by the Prime Minister’s Office to consult UPSC, Railway Recruitment Board, Central Staffing Board, among others, to see if the proposed National Testing Agency (NTA) can also conduct recruitment examinations. NTA was initially proposed to relieve CBSE of the additional responsiblity of conducting exams like NEET and UGC-NET. The PMO’s suggestion means the HRD Ministry will have to consult more stakeholders and that could delay the setting up of the agency.

Eating chocolate may provide relief from bowel disease,"ThinkStock Images ThinkStock Images

Consuming protein rich foods such as nuts, eggs, seeds, beans, poultry, yogurt, cheese and even chocolates may foster a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment, which could mean relief for people living with abdominal pain and diarrhoea of inflammatory bowel disease, a study has said.

These food items contain an appreciable amounts of tryptophan — an amino acid used in the buildup of proteins — which when fed on mice led to the development of immune cells that foster a tolerant gut, the study said. The findings indicated that a protein rich diet triggers the appearance of immune cells in Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) — a bacterium that normally lives in the gut, and together these promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut immune system.

“We established a link between one bacterial species — Lactobacillus reuteri — that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and development of a population of cells that promote tolerance,” said Marco Colonna, the Robert Rock Belliveau, Professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis. “The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had,” Belliveau added.

For the study, published in the journal Science, the team examined mice that had lived under sterile conditions since birth and was germ-free. When L. reuteri was introduced to these mice, the immune cells arose. Further, when tryptophan was doubled in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 per cent.

Humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tracts. “The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” explained Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, Postdoctoral researcher from the varsity.

“High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population,” Cervantes-Barragan said.

"North Korea nukes, missiles top concerns in Japan defence review","North Korea has been increasing the range, accuracy and versatility of its missiles and diversifying its launch sites and methods. (Representational) North Korea has been increasing the range, accuracy and versatility of its missiles and diversifying its launch sites and methods. (Representational)

The threat to Japan from North Korea has reached a “new stage” now that the country is capable of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile and its nuclear weapons program has advanced, a defense ministry report said today. North Korea was the main concern cited as Japan’s Cabinet approved the report, less than two weeks after the North test-fired a second ICBM that analysts say has a range that could include more of the US mainland, including Los Angeles and Chicago.

The security review came just a week after Itsunori Onodera, who was defense minister in 2012-2014, resumed that job when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe revamped his Cabinet after a slew of politically costly scandals. Onodera told reporters Friday he planned to update Japan’s defence guidelines to reflect the threat from the North, suggesting he may seek an offensive missile capability.

“North Korea’s missile launches have escalated tensions both in terms of quality and quantity. I would like to study if our current missile defense is sufficient just with the Aegis destroyers and (surface-to-air) PAC 3,” said Onodera, who headed a ruling party study in March that called for beefing up Japan’s missile response capability. The ICBM North Korea tested July 30 flew on a highly lofted trajectory and landed about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off Japan’s Hokkaido island.

North Korea has been increasing the range, accuracy and versatility of its missiles and diversifying its launch sites and methods. It has conducted two nuclear tests and more than 20 missile launches over the past year alone, exceeding the total of 16 missiles launched over 18 years under former leader Kim Jong Il, the report said. “North Korea’s development of ballistic missiles, along with its nuclear program, are becoming increasingly real and imminent problems for the Asia-Pacific region including Japan, as well as the rest of the world,” it said.

The 532-page defense report also raised concerns over China’s ongoing assertiveness in air and maritime activity in the regional seas, and raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the country’s military buildup with its budget tripling over the past decade.

UK ready to pay up to 40 billion euros to leave EU: Sunday Telegraph,"FILE- June 23, 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to address a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels.

Britain is prepared to pay up to 40 billion euros ($47 billion) as part of a deal to leave the European Union, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported, citing three unnamed sources familiar with Britain’s negotiating strategy. The EU has floated a figure of 60 billion euros and wants significant progress on settling Britain’s liabilities before talks start on issues such as future trading arrangements. The government department responsible for Brexit talks declined to comment on the article. So far, Britain has given no official indication of how much it would be willing to pay.

The newspaper said British officials were likely to offer to pay 10 billion euros a year for three years after leaving the EU in March 2019, then finalise the total alongside detailed trade talks. Payments would only be made as part of a deal that included a trade agreement, the newspaper added.

“We know (the EU’s) position is 60 billion euros, but the actual bottom line is 50 billion euros. Ours is closer to 30 billion euros but the actual landing zone is 40 billion euros, even if the public and politicians are not all there yet,” the newspaper quoted one “senior Whitehall source” as saying. Whitehall is the London district where most British government departments and ministers are based.

A second Whitehall source said Britain’s bottom line was “30 billion euros to 40 billion euros” and a third source said Prime Minister Theresa May was willing to pay “north of 30 billion euros”, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Britain’s Brexit minister David Davis said on July 20 that Britain would honour its obligations to the EU but declined to confirm that Brexit would require net payments.

British foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit advocate, said last month the EU could “go whistle” if it made “extortionate” demands for payment. Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave said speculation about a divorce bill was “unhelpful”.

“With the EU Brexit negotiations, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” said the groups’ co-chair Richard Tice. “The focus should be on accelerating talks with the aim of concluding them at the end of 2017. This would enable businesses to adapt during the 15 months leading to March 2019.”

The Telegraph said advisers in May’s office had warned bosses in London’s financial sector that Britain walking out of Brexit talks was a “real possibility” if the impasse over the bill cannot be broken. Former European Commision head Romano Prodi told the Observer newspaper said it would be economic “suicide” for Britain to fail to reach a compromise on Brexit, and called on the EU to preserve as much trade with Britain as possible to avoid damaging both sides.

If Britain cannot conclude an exit deal, trade relations would be governed by World Trade Organization rules, which would allow both parties to impose tariffs and customs checks and leave many other issues unsettled. Last week the Bank of England said Brexit uncertainty was weighing on the economy. Finance minister Philip Hammond wants to avoid unsettling businesses further.

The EU has also wants agreement by October on rights of EU citizens already in Britain, and on border controls between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland, before trade and other issues are discussed. ($1 = 0.8495 euros)

"China earthquake: Death toll touches 13, survivor says it felt like a ‘heavy-duty truck roaring past’","China earthquake: Chinese paramilitary police take care of a survivor after an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou county, Ngawa prefecture, Sichuan province. (Source: CNS/Chen Yunhua via Reuters) China earthquake: Chinese paramilitary police take care of a survivor after an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou county, Ngawa prefecture, Sichuan province. (Source: CNS/Chen Yunhua via Reuters)

At least 13 people were killed and over 175 injured after a 6.5 magnitude earthquake shook a mountainous region in southwestern China’s Sichuan province on Tuesday. China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported that at least five of the dead were tourists and 28 people had serious injuries. Power and phone networks were affected by the quake, reported The Associated Press. The quake also caused some damage to buildings in the area.

Following the earthquake, President Xi Jinping issued orders to respond to the quake and rescue the injured. Medical teams, rescuers and other resources were dispatched to the location by the authorities. The quake, which struck at around 9:20 pm Tuesday, affected the region bordered by the provinces of Sichuan and Gansu. Since the area is on the edge of the Tibetan plateau, it is home to many Tibetan and other ethnic-minority villages.

The region is also located close to the national reserve park Jiuzhaigou, or Jiuzhai Valley, which is known for its waterfalls and and karst formations. Xinhua also reported that more than 30,000 tourists at Jiuzhaigou had been relocated to safety. A worker at the Jiuzhaigou park told Xinhua that some houses in the tourist site collapsed or cracked following the quake and that authorities were organising evacuations of residents.

Jiuzhaigou also faced a massive power outage after the quake. “The tremors were very strong,” a woman in Jiuzhaigou town told AP. She added that the damage in the town center seemed minimal other than the suspension of electricity. “People from other regions are a pretty frightened,” she said.

“I was getting into a car at the time of the quake, and it felt like a heavy-duty truck roaring past,” said Liu Yanrong, a local township official, told Xinhua.

According to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake was 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) deep. However, the China Earthquake Networks Center contested that saying the 7.0 magnitude quake struck at a depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles). The epicenter was about 39 kilometers (24 miles) from the county of Jiuzhaigou, which has a population of around 80,000, and was 285 kilometers (177 miles) from Chengdu, the densely populated capital of Sichuan province, reported AP.

People took to social media to share photos showing buildings sustaining minor damages, rocks scattered on the road and people taking to the streets. Some of them also shared footage to show the impact of tremors. Xinhua said strong tremors could be felt in Chengdu. The Sichuan provincial government’s news website said that after the quake struck, a number of train services to Chengdu and other cities were suspended.

On Wednesday morning, another strong earthquake struck in far northwestern China, some 2,200 kilometers (1,360 miles) away. It was measured at magnitude 6.3 by USGS and 6.6 by China’s agency and was in a sparsely populated area of the Xinjiang region. No casualties have been reported there yet.

BEST bus strike brings Mumbai life to a halt,"After holding millions of commuters to ransom on Raksha Bandhan Day, around 37,000 employees of the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) called off their 16-hour-long bus strike here on Monday. The withdrawal came after the intervention of Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, who met leaders of the nine BEST employees unions leaders, including Shashank S. Rao, at his residence.

Mumbaikars, including three million commuters who use BEST buses daily as their lifeline, faced a harrowing time as the entire fleet of nearly 3,800 buses remained in bus depots across the city as employees belonging to nine unions didn't work. However, the strike proved a boon for auto-rickshaws and taxis which were in huge demand to ferry people going from one place to another or railway stations. (Source: Express photo by Deepak Joshi)

The strike was to press for various demands, including irregular payments of salaries by the the BEST, run by the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corp (BMC).(Source: Express photo by Deepak Joshi)

Union leader Shashank S. Rao said the employees had demanded that their salaries should be paid on time and a written undertaking should be given but the BMC administration failed to provide it.

An Afghan official says that at least 30 people including women and children have been killed by Taliban fighters in northern Sari Pul province. Zahir Wahdat, the provincial governor for Sari Pul, says Sunday that the victims are mostly civilians and some local security forces. The shootings took place Saturday morning after the Taliban seized control of the strategic Mirzawalang area in Sayad district.

Wahdat says Afghan forces retreated form the area after they couldn’t gain ground or air support from the central government. Earlier reports indicated that over a dozen people had been killed by the Taliban. Qari Yusouf Ahamdi, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for the attack, but not the civilian deaths.

Ten Taliban fighters were also killed, according to Zabi Amani, a spokesman for the provincial governor.

Javier Hernandez keen to hammer home importance of Old Trafford return,"West Ham United’s Javier Hernandez in action with Manchester City’s Fernandinho. (Source: Reuters) West Ham United’s Javier Hernandez in action with Manchester City’s Fernandinho. (Source: Reuters)

West Ham United forward Javier Hernandez is eager to showcase his talents on the return to his former stomping ground when the London visit Manchester United in their opening fixture of the 2017-18 Premier League campaign on Saturday.

The Mexico international, nicknamed Chicharito, enjoyed a productive four-year spell at United from 2010, scoring 59 goals in more than 150 appearances as the club won two league titles and reached the 2011 Champions League final.

Following a season-long loan spell with Real Madrid, Hernandez moved to Germany’s Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 before joining West Ham last month, and the 29-year-old is focused on putting on a good display during Saturday’s emotional return.

“To start my new chapter in this second part of my English life and in the Premier League, it’s going to be something happy,” Hernandez told British media. “I have very good memories of those four years that I lived in Manchester…

“Now I’m very glad to be back in England… I’m looking forward to try to show that happiness and confidence on the pitch.

“It’s going to be emotional to be in my old house against my old club, of course. But I am with my new team, my new chapter and I want to do as best as I can. It’s an important moment for me.”

Hernandez said that he was focused on helping West Ham achieve their goals rather than comparing the two clubs.

“I prefer not to think about if it’s different or not (at West Ham),” Hernandez added. “I’m feeling the same way I did in my first day in England… because I love this game.

“I want to deliver positive numbers and, hopefully, we can achieve the main aim of the club to be in the European places.” (Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru;

"Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections: Ahmed Patel wins, a look at all that happened","Following a dramatic series of events that lasted till the wee hours of Wednesday, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel was re-elected to Rajya Sabha from Gujarat along with BJP president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani. (PTI photo)

Patel polled 44 votes, the required number to cross the line after the Election Commission declared two votes cast by rebel Congress legislators invalid. Shah and Irani received 46 votes each. Express photo by Javed Raja

Congress, veteran leader Shankarsinh Vaghela, who recently quit from all posts, announced that he hadn’t voted for the party candidate as he “wasn’t going to win”. Express photo by Javed Raja

The Congress filed two applications for rejection of votes tendered by two MLAs, Bhola Bhai Gohil and Raghav Bhai Patel, for violating the polling procedures. The party claimed the MLAs had shown their ballot papers to Amit Shah. Express photo by Javed Raja

After the petition was first rejected by the Returning Officer, a delegation of Congress leaders including party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and former minister RPN Singh met with Election Commission officials in New Delhi and raised objections to the RO’s decision. Express photo by Javed Raja

They submitted that their allegations could be reviewed using video footage of the voting. Ahmed Patel also e-mailed the Commission requesting cancellation of the two votes. (PTI photo)

Swinging into action, the BJP sent its own representatives, including Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad to convince the Commission to proceed with counting. Express photo by Javed Raja

In the words of the EC, the leaders “added that the concept of secrecy in the elections to the Rajya Sabha is no more valid because the Parliament itself has made elections to the Rajya Sabha through open ballot.” Express photo by Javed Raja

The ping-pong match did not end here, as Congress subsequently sent a second delegation led by Ghulam Nabi Azad to reiterate their demand to the Commission. And then, Jaitley met the Commission for a second time, again calling for commencement of the counting of vote. Express photo by Javed Raja

In a huge sigh of relief for the Congress, the two votes were disqualified. This meant, Ahmed Patel now required only 44 votes to secure a fifth term in Rajya Sabha. Express photo by Javed Raja"

"Break has refreshed the mindset of players, says Australia coach Darren Lehmann","Australia are scheduled to play two Test matches in Bangladesh in August-September. (Source: AP) Australia are scheduled to play two Test matches in Bangladesh in August-September. (Source: AP)

After all the confusion and dispute over pay, Australian cricket is all set to return to action when they take on Bangladesh in a two-match Test series later this month. Coach Darren Lehmann, while taking to cricket.com.au, suggested that the players have been training and working hard on their game despite being away from it for a while.

“We’re squeezing enough in this next week, and guys have been doing stuff with their states. Even through the MOU (negotiations) they were training and preparing as though they were playing. So in terms of fitness, they are probably ahead of the game, they’re really strong and fit which is really pleasing. Now it’s just getting their skills up to the required level before we leave,” he said.

Talking about the break that the players got, the left-hander insisted that his troops got sometime to refresh themselves.

“The break’s been good for some of them, they’ve been at the back of a long summer with a lot of travel in the schedule so sometimes a refreshed mindset is really important,” Lehmann said.

Mentioning about his team’s preparations, the coach said Northern Territory Cricket Association (NTCA) have provided them with wickets similar to that in Bangladesh.

“They’ve all come in really excited to get going again. The NTCA have been fantastic, they’ve made wickets very similar to what we’ll get in Bangladesh – they’re low and they’re slow, and they will spin,” he said.

“There’s three wicket blocks that are more like Dhaka (which hosts the first Test from August 27-31), three wickets that are a bit like Chittagong (the second from September 4-8), and centre wicket facilities so we can play a match and work on our fielding. “So in terms of conditions and the heat and humidity that we’ll face when we get there, it’s great preparation especially for those who have come out of winter in the southern states (of Australia),” he told.

Moreover, the former international cricketer suggested that his team has enough time to get into the groove.

“We’ve got enough sessions in place, and then we’ve got enough time when we get there (to Bangladesh) weather permitting,” Lehmann said.

“I think we’ll be fine, we’ve got a two-day game which is a mixture of players, the wicket will be very similar to what we encounter for the first Test then we’ve got training sessions before that Test starts as well. “We’re squashing a lot into the eight or nine days before we go to Dhaka, then we just have to see what the weather and the facilities are like when we get there,” he added.

Seventeen people arrested in 3 countries in Australian drug bust,"The drugs were worth around 810 million Australian dollars (USD 640 million). (Representational image) The drugs were worth around 810 million Australian dollars (USD 640 million). (Representational image)

Police in three countries have arrested 17 people and seized nearly 2 tons of drugs in connection with what Australian authorities say was an effort by organised crime groups to transport large amounts of drugs into Australia. Australian Federal Police said 10 people in Sydney, five Australians in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and two people in the Netherlands were arrested today as part of an investigation into what police say were two interlinked crime syndicates operating across the three countries.

Officials in the Netherlands seized 1.8 tons of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, 136 kilograms (300 pounds) of cocaine and 15 kilograms (30 pounds) of crystal methamphetamine, all bound for Australia. The drugs were worth around 810 million Australian dollars (USD 640 million).

FBI: Explosive detonated at Minnesota mosque,"Law enforcement officials investigate an explosion at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday. Authorities say the explosion damaged one room but it didn’t hurt anyone. ( AP) Law enforcement officials investigate an explosion at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday. Authorities say the explosion damaged one room but it didn’t hurt anyone. ( AP)

The FBI was searching for suspects Saturday after an explosive device detonated at a suburban Minneapolis mosque as people were preparing for morning prayers, damaging a room but not causing any injuries, authorities and witnesses said.

The blast happened at around 5 a.m. at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, according to Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts. Windows of the imam’s office were shattered, either by the blast or by an object thrown through them, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported .

One worshipper saw a pickup truck speeding away shortly after the explosion, said Mohamed Omar, the center’s executive director. He said the mosque, which primarily serves people from the area’s large Somali community, occasionally receives threatening calls and emails.

“We came to this country for the same reason everyone else came here: freedom to worship,” Yasir Abdalrahman, a worshipper at the mosque, told the newspaper. “And that freedom is under threat. Every other American should be insulted by this.” Asad Zaman, director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, described the attack as a firebombing.

Richard Thornton, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Minneapolis Division, said during an afternoon news conference that the investigation will determine whether the incident was a hate crime and who may have been behind it.

Thornton said the explosion was caused by an “improvised explosive device,” and that investigators have recovered components of the device to figure out how it was put together. But he didn’t take questions during the news conference and declined to provide details about the device, citing the ongoing investigation, which is being led by the FBI.

Saturday’s bombing comes amid a rise in reports of anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S., including arson attacks and vandalism at mosques, harassment of women wearing Muslim head coverings and bullying of Muslim schoolchildren. Just recently in Minnesota, an Islamic cemetery in Castle Rock Township reported it had been vandalized with spray painted profanities and swastikas.

The mosque in Bloomington, just south of Minneapolis, serves as a religious center and community organizing platform for Muslim activists and leaders in the area, according to the society. The group is offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or conviction.

A $10,000 reward also is being offered by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. The group said its national office is urging Islamic centers and mosques to step up security. “If a bias motive is proven, this attack would represent another in a long list of hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions nationwide in recent months,” said Amir Malik, the local chapter’s civil rights director.

Along with a mosque, the building houses a community center that hosts computer classes, a basketball league, religious classes, lectures and other events.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the U.S., roughly 57,000 people, according to the latest census figures. The immigrants have been coming to Minnesota from their war-torn homeland since the 1990s, drawn by generous social services and the sense of community among the diaspora.

Cops begin probe in Gurgaon stalking case,"Two days after a Gurgaon resident filed an FIR at Sector 14 police station alleging that she was stalked by two men in a car while she was returning home from work on her two-wheeler, Gurgaon Police has started scanning CCTV footage along the route she took. According to police, the incident took place around 11.45 pm on Sunday when the woman was travelling from her office in Sector 18 to her home in Sector 12.

“We are examining CCTV footage along the stretch, but have not been able to get any strong leads yet. Although the vehicle following her is visible in some footage, it is difficult to determine the digits on the number plate and even the model because of the darkness… The camera is also at a distance,” Ravinder Kumar, PRO of Gurgaon Police, said.

He added, “We are procuring more footage and are hopeful of getting some clues that will help us crack the case.”

On Thursday, two special teams, under the supervision of Sumit Kumar, DCP (Crime), were constituted to look into the matter. In the afternoon, police escorted the woman along the route she took Sunday night.

“A case was registered under IPC Section 354 D (stalking). The woman provided us with some details of the number plate, but she is uncertain. However, further investigation is on,” ASI Dulichand, the investigating officer in the case, said. Recalling the incident, the 22-year-old woman said, “They stalked me for around 3 km; over 10 minutes. I kept changing my route, and took unexpected turns and routes and eventually managed to shake them off.”

“It was a very harrowing experience… It is very disappointing that something like this happened in Gurgaon, where so many women travel home from work late at night. There should be more police personnel on roads even at odd hours, to ensure our security,” she told The Indian Express.

"Mumbai: Star tortoises taken from Byculla, handed over to NGO for better care","The zoo authorities had then set up an enclosure measuring around 70 square feet and put the tortoises inside in a number of shallow trays. (Representational image) The zoo authorities had then set up an enclosure measuring around 70 square feet and put the tortoises inside in a number of shallow trays. (Representational image)

After the forest department handed over 23 rescued star tortoises that had been kept at the Byculla zoo to Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), the non-profit has said it is keeping the animals under close watch. The 23 surviving tortoises, a protected species, are from a batch of 107 that were rescued from various pet shops by the Thane forest department and placed in the care of the Byculla zoo in November 2015.

The zoo authorities had then set up an enclosure measuring around 70 square feet and put the tortoises inside in a number of shallow trays. After the forest department officials learnt that most of these animals had died, they decided to hand them over to the NGO earlier this week for better care. Denying allegations of negligence, the zoo maintained that the tortoises had been weak when they first arrived.

“They were in a bad shape when they were brought to the zoo, due to the poor conditions in which they had been kept at the pet shops. They were severely dehydrated too. In such species, many of the babies don’t survive and only around 20-25 per cent are known to make it to adulthood,” said an official.

He added that post mortem was conducted for a few of those who died and the cause of death was noted to be dehydration and infection.

Stating that it is unlikely that the tortoises would be dehydrated over a period of two years, Pavan Sharma, founder of RAWW, said, “When they were brought to us, their shells were oily and sticky and they were covered in each other’s excreta. We had to first clean them carefully. They have now been kept in batches according to their size, to ensure they get more attention. If you place all of them together, it is difficult to monitor them and one cannot know if all of them are eating well.”

China holds wargames as North Korea tensions spike,"A man stands on a fishing vessel at Yicuomao port in Dandong, Liaoning province, China, August 8, 2017. (Source: REUTERS) A man stands on a fishing vessel at Yicuomao port in Dandong, Liaoning province, China, August 8, 2017. (Source: REUTERS)

The Chinese navy and air force flexed their muscles in live-fire drills in seas adjacent to the Korean Peninsula, the defence ministry said, amid regional tensions over North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weaponry. The “large-scale” exercises were being conducted in the seas and skies off China’s east coast in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Gulf, and included the firing of dozens of missiles, a notice posted yesterday on the Ministry of Defence website said.

Naval and air force assets including dozens of ships, more than 10 aircraft, submarines and an unspecified number of coastal defence personnel took part in the drills, which the ministry said were aimed at testing weapons and honing the military’s abilities in conducting coastal assaults and intercepting air targets.

The ministry did not specify how long the drills were to last but a four-day shipping ban ending on Tuesday was issued for the area where the drills were held, according to notices by the military and local authorities. It was not immediately clear whether the wargames were meant to send any sort of message.

But the announcement comes just days after China backed a US-drafted UN Security Council resolution passed on Saturday that significantly stiffened sanctions against North Korea for its pursuit of nuclear and missile weapons systems.

In the wake of the resolution’s passing, China has reiterated its resolve to side with the international community in opposing North Korea’s nuclear weaponisation and aggressive sabre-rattling.

China has for some time been engaged in a modernisation of its once-backward armed forces, seeking military clout commensurate with its economic might, a drive that has caused unease among its regional neighbours.

China also has consistently railed against recurring US-South Korean wargames that are directed at deterring a North Korean attack, but which China blames for fanning regional tensions. North Korea vowed Monday that the tough new UN sanctions would not stop it from developing its nuclear arsenal, rejecting talks and angrily threatening retaliation against the United States.

"No malicious intent, more a misadventure: Investigators on IIT grad held in Aadhaar case","Abhinav Srivastava’s (31) arrest for accessing the data by piggybacking on the e-hospital app (Representational Image) Abhinav Srivastava’s (31) arrest for accessing the data by piggybacking on the e-hospital app (Representational Image)

An IIT graduate arrested by Bengaluru Police on charges of unauthorised access of Aadhaar demographic data did not have any malicious intent in accessing the data through an app he developed, a senior police officer investigating the case has said. However, Abhinav Srivastava’s (31) arrest for accessing the data by piggybacking on the e-hospital app — which is authorised to carry out Aadhaar authentication — does mean that UIDAI has to ensure that hundreds of user agencies accessing Aadhaar data for authentication do not leave loopholes that allow piggybacking, the officer said.

According to the official, Srivastava developed the app as part of his interest and the app on Google Play Store did not store data of nearly 50,000 users, but only provided demographic information.

“If there was malicious intent, he would not have left a trail. There does not seem to be criminal intent. It is more of a misadventure,’’ a police officer said.

“Though there has been no data theft, the incident does imply that UIDAI must enforce security in eKYC User Agencies (KUA) and Authentication User Agencies (AUA) who are authorised to submit and receive authentication data,’’ the police officer said. Agencies investigating the case are wary of providing technical details of how Srivastava’s app “piggybacked’’ the e-hospital app developed for Digital India initiative out of fears that it could cause data security problems.

Several independent data security experts have, however, weighed in on the technical modus operandi employed by Srivastava to indicate that he may have gained access to the authentication key employed by the e-hospital app to avail the Aadhaar authentication services.

“eKYC enables private companies to build their own parallel databases. The government continues to assure us that there haven’t been any data breaches etc. However, eKYC ostensibly makes such data breaches unnecessary — because they just hand all the demographic data on a platter to private businesses,’’ Anand Venkatanarayanan, a data security expert, has stated in an online article on the unauthorised access of Aadhaar data by Srivastava’s app. “Data received from eKYC is more than enough for Aadhaar Type 1 authentication by private operators in UIDAI ecosystem without user consent and all it takes is a shared KUA/AUA key,’’ he has stated.

A deputy director of UIDAI filed a police complaint on July 27, stating that Srivastava and Qarth Technologies, a start-up he co-founded, accessed Aadhaar data without authority.

South Korea urged North Korea on Thursday to stop all action that is driving up tension on the Korean Peninsula. The government also said it will seek all methods possible to resolving tensions with the cooperation of other countries. The remarks were made by presidential Blue House spokesman Park Su-hyun in a media briefing after the standing committee of the Blue House’s National Security Council held a regular meeting to discuss recent events.

Earlier on Thursday, North Korea dismissed warnings by US President Donald Trump that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States as a “load of nonsense” and outlined detailed plans on for a missile strike near the US Pacific territory of Guam.

"In Afghan review, Trump’s frustration carries echoes of Obama years","President Donald Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

Since taking office, US President Donald Trump has shown an affinity, and perhaps even a deference, to the generals he has surrounded himself with in his Cabinet and at the White House, save one exception: the war in Afghanistan. More than a dozen interviews with current and former US officials familiar with the discussions reveal a president deeply frustrated with the lack of options to win the 16-year-old war, described internally as “an eroding stalemate.”

The debate carries echoes of the same dilemma Barack Obama faced in 2009. Then, as now, odds are that Trump will ultimately send more troops, current and former officials say. “It’s the least worst option,” one former US official familiar with the discussions said, speaking on condition of anonymity, while acknowledging that with Trump, a pullout cannot be completely ruled out.

Trump’s defense secretary, retired Marine Corps General Jim Mattis, has had the authority for nearly two months to add thousands more troops to the roughly 8,400 there now (down from a peak of more than 100,000 in 2011). Army General John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, requested the troops back in February. But officials say Mattis won’t use his authority until he has buy-in from Trump for a strategic vision for America’s longest war. Beyond more troops for Afghanistan, the strategy would aim to address militant safe havens across the border in Pakistan.

That too has become a divisive issue, with several members of Trump’s inner circle split on how hard to press Islamabad. Sources say that the discussions – which included a high-level White House meeting on Thursday – could drag out for the rest of the summer, blowing past a mid-July deadline to present a war strategy to an increasingly impatient Congress.

After Thursday’s meeting, chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, people familiar with the deliberations told Reuters that a final decision did not appear imminent. Pentagon officials have declined to comment on internal deliberations. The White House has also declined to comment ahead of a decision on the strategy.

COMMANDER UNDER SCRUTINY

While US-backed fighters are rolling back Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the same cannot be said of the fight against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies.

During a July 19 meeting in the White House Situation Room, Trump said Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, might want to consider firing Nicholson, who was picked by Obama in 2016 to lead the war effort and has earned the respect of Afghan leaders. “We aren’t winning,” Trump told them, according to accounts of the conversation.

But current and former officials say the frustration had been mounting for months. At least as far back as February, one former US official said the internal deliberations about Afghanistan were not aimed at creating a broad set of options for Trump.

Shortly before McMaster was due to present his plan to Trump for approval ahead of the May NATO summit, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declined to endorse it, saying Trump was not being presented with options, the former official and another current official said. “The lack of options meant that the only recommendation that was originally to be put forward to the president was essentially the status quo,” the former official said, discounting the troop increase as any serious shift in strategy.

But in the months since, the possibility of a full pull-out has been repeatedly presented and refined along with a true “status-quo” option in which no new troops are sent to Afghanistan, but none are pulled out either.

Still, US defense leaders are not believed to be favoring those options. David Sedney, a former Pentagon policy advisor under the Obama administration, said failure to prioritize Afghanistan could replicate the mistakes by previous US presidents.

“We’ve been ambivalent about Afghanistan for the last 17 years and when you have an ambivalent policy, it fails,” said Sedney, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington. McMaster, Mattis, Tillerson, Dunford, Nicholson and some US intelligence officials argue that refusing to commit more US forces to train, equip and in some cases support the Afghan security forces would eventually result in the Taliban retaking most of the country from the US-backed government in Kabul.

Trump’s concerns about Afghanistan are shared by some senior officials close to the president, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, who, officials say, is skeptical about the need for an increase in troops in Afghanistan.

PAKISTAN ALSO DIVIDES TEAM

Divisions have also emerged within Trump’s administration on how much to pressure Pakistan, and how quickly, in order to address militant safe havens blamed for helping prolong Afghanistan’s war. Nicholson, McMaster and Lisa Curtis, senior director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, favor taking a strong hand with Pakistan to deal with Taliban militants using that country as a base from which to plot attacks in Afghanistan, current and former officials say.

On the other side are State Department officials and others at the Pentagon, including Dunford, who take a broader view of Pakistan’s strategic importance and are less convinced that harsh actions will secure more cooperation from Islamabad, they said. Pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militant safe havens on its territory.

The Trump administration is exploring a new approach towards Pakistan, Reuters has reported. Potential responses under discussion include expanding US drone strikes, redirecting aid to Pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan’s status as a major non-NATO ally.

Venezuela’s new assembly declares itself all-powerful,"The opposition to President Nicolas Maduro also faced another fight Wednesday before the government-stacked Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing on charges against a Caracas-area opposition mayor. (REUTERS/File) The opposition to President Nicolas Maduro also faced another fight Wednesday before the government-stacked Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing on charges against a Caracas-area opposition mayor. (REUTERS/File)

The new constitutional assembly assumed even more power in Venezuela by declaring itself as the superior body to all other governmental institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.That decree came Tuesday just hours after the assembly delegates took control of a legislative chamber and put up pictures of the late President Hugo Chavez, who installed Venezuela’s socialist system.

Delcy Rodriguez, the head of the ruling socialist party and leader of the body, said the unanimously approved decree prohibits lawmakers in congress from taking any action that would interfere with laws passed by the newly installed constitutional assembly. “We are not threatening anyone,” said Aristobulo Isturiz, the constitutional assembly’s first vice president. “We are looking for ways to coexist.”

Leaders of congress, which previously voted not to recognize any of the new super-body’s decrees, said lawmakers would try to meet in the gold-domed legislative palace Wednesday, but there were questions whether security officers guarding the building would let them in. The opposition to President Nicolas Maduro also faced another fight Wednesday before the government-stacked Supreme Court, which scheduled a hearing on charges against a Caracas-area opposition mayor. The judges convicted another mayor Tuesday for failing to move against protesters during four months of political unrest.

In calling the July 30 election for the constitutional assembly, Maduro said a new constitution would help resolve the nation’s political standoff, but opposition leaders view it is a power grab and the president’s allies have said they will go after his opponents. Before its decree declaring itself all-powerful, the assembly ousted Venezuela’s outspoken chief prosecutor, established a “truth commission” expected to target Maduro’s foes and pledged “support and solidarity” with the unpopular president.

The latest surge of protests began in early April in reaction to a quickly rescinded attempt by the government-supporting Supreme Court to strip the National Assembly of its powers. But the unrest ballooned into a widespread movement fed by anger over Venezuela’s triple-digest inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and high crime.Opposition lawmakers said security forces led by Rodriguez broke into the congress building late Monday and seized control of an unused, ceremonial chamber almost identical to the one where lawmakers meet.

“This government invades the spaces that it is not capable of legitimately winning,” Stalin Gonzalez, an opposition lawmaker, wrote on Twitter, alluding to the opposition’s overwhelming victory in the 2015 congressional elections. Before the assembly met Tuesday, the pro-government Supreme Court sentenced a Caracas-area mayor to 15 months in prison for not following an order to remove barricades set up during anti-government demonstrations.

Ramon Muchacho was the fourth opposition mayor ordered arrested by the high court the past two weeks. His whereabouts were not known, but he denounced the ruling on Twitter. The constitutional assembly’s meeting Tuesday came amid mounting criticism from foreign governments that have refused to recognize the new body.

The foreign ministers of 17 Western Hemisphere nations met in Peru to discuss how to force Maduro to back down. The ministers issued a statement after the meeting condemning the body and reiterating previous calls for the parties in Venezuela to negotiate on ending the political crisis. Meanwhile, leaders from the Bolivarian Alliance, a leftist coalition of 11 Latin American nations, met in Caracas and declared the creation of the constitutional assembly a “sovereign act” aimed at helping Venezuela overcome its difficulties.

“We reiterate the call for a constructive and respectful dialogue,” the alliance said in a statement read after the meeting. Since the disputed election, security forces have stepped up their presence. A U.N. human rights commissioner report issued Tuesday warned of “widespread and systematic use” of excessive force, arbitrary detention and other rights violations against demonstrators.

Only a few dozen demonstrators heeded the opposition’s call to set up traffic-snarling roadblocks in Caracas on Tuesday to show opposition to the new assembly, underlining the fear and resignation among that has weakened turnout for street protests that once drew hundreds of thousands. At least 124 people have been killed and hundreds injured or detained during the protests.

Christian Taylor once again upstages Will Claye in triple jump at World Championships,"Christian Taylor and Will Claye said they’re going to an event in the mountains of France next week to chase the mark. (Source: Reuters) Christian Taylor and Will Claye said they’re going to an event in the mountains of France next week to chase the mark. (Source: Reuters)

The gold will just have to do for Christian Taylor. The triple jump world record he desperately wanted? Maybe another time. Silver will also have to do for Will Claye. Beating his American teammate? Perhaps down the road.

Once again, Taylor and Claye engaged in an evening of one-upmanship in which one would take the lead only to watch the other surpass it. But once again, Taylor came out on top. Their finish at the world championships was a carbon copy of their result at the last two Olympics, including the one that took place in the same stadium as they jumped in Thursday.

These two always seem to bring out the best in each other. It’s been that way since the high school ranks. “As annoying as it is, I’m extremely grateful for it,” joked Taylor, who attended the University of Florida with Claye. “I would not be able to push myself without him. When he’s in the final, it’s going to be a fight. I’m not going to be given anything.”

Still, Taylor’s third world title came with more than a twinge of disappointment. He wanted to break the world record of 18.29 meters set by Jonathan Edwards of Britain in 1995. Taylor felt it would’ve been fitting to accomplish the feat in Edwards’ backyard and with Edwards in the stadium, no less. But Taylor’s best jump Thursday was 17.68 meters, while Clay went 17.63.

“I want to be the best ever,” said Taylor, whose best jump is 18.21 meters at the 2015 worlds in Beijing. “Unfortunately, every time the triple jump is announced (at a stadium) with the world record it’s going to be Jonathan. That does hurt me a little bit.

“But I hope the viewers abroad were happy with the competition, because we’re entertainers at the end of the day.” And good friends. So if Claye can’t win, he roots for Taylor and vice versa.

“If you have a brother, it’s that type of rivalry,” said Claye, who also earned a bronze medal in the long jump at the 2012 London Games. “You don’t want to lose to your brother. It’s very competitive. At the same time, you love him and no one likes to lose.”

Of course, losing doesn’t always mean playing second fiddle. Although Claye finished with the silver at the Olympics in Brazil last year, he found the spotlight by jumping into the stands and asking his girlfriend, hurdler Queen Harrison, to marry him . He even carried the diamond ring to the track in his backpack.

They will tie the knot next May. The honeymoon could be somewhere in the Caribbean. “A nice beach to get away and relax,” said Claye, a burgeoning musician who recently put out an album. “There have been a lot of track meets in the islands that want to give us as an appearance fee a honeymoon stay before the meet. We might do that.”

But first, there are more competitions to attend and more chances to break that elusive world record. Taylor and Claye said they’re going to an event in the mountains of France next week to chase the mark. They’ll be at high altitude, and will try to push each other to new heights.

“It may have an asterisk,” Claye said. “But, hey, I’ll take it.”

"US, allies slam Chinese island-building","The three nations also called on China and the Philippines to respect last year’s international arbitration ruling which dismissed much of Beijing’s claim in the sea (Reuters Photo) The three nations also called on China and the Philippines to respect last year’s international arbitration ruling which dismissed much of Beijing’s claim in the sea (Reuters Photo)

The United States, Australia and Japan on Monday denounced Beijing’s island-building and militarisation of the South China Sea, in contrast to the increasingly tepid response from Southeast Asian nations over the festering issue. China claims nearly all of the sea, through which USD 5 trillion in annual shipping trade passes and which is believed to sit atop vast oil and gas deposits.

Its sweeping claims overlap with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei — all members of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc –as well as Taiwan. But in recent years Beijing has managed to weaken regional resistance by courting some ASEAN members.

Yesterday, Beijing scored a coup when ASEAN ministers issued a diluted statement on the dispute and agreed to Beijing’s terms on talks during a security forum which the bloc is hosting in Manila. China insists that a much-delayed code of conduct between it and ASEAN members over the disputed sea must not be legally binding, a demand to which Southeast Asian countries have so far acquiesced.

But in a joint statement after their foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the same gathering, the US, Japan and Australia delivered a noticeably sterner rebuke to Beijing. Criticising ongoing “land reclamation, construction of outposts, militarisation of disputed features” in the disputed sea, the trio said any code of conduct must be “legally binding, meaningful and effective”, a demand noticeably absent from the ASEAN statement.

The three nations also called on China and the Philippines to respect last year’s international arbitration ruling which dismissed much of Beijing’s claim in the sea. The Philippines had been one of the most vocal critics of China and filed a case before a UN-backed tribunal.

But after the election of President Rodrigo Duterte last year, Manila has played down the verdict in favour of pursuing warmer ties with Beijing, a move that led to offers of billions of dollars in investments or aid from China. Critics of China have accused it of assiduously dividing ASEAN, which operates on a consensus basis, with strong-arm tactics and chequebook diplomacy, enticing smaller countries in the bloc such as Cambodia and Laos to support it.

Vietnam, which had been pushing for stronger language in Manila, has been largely left to fend for itself since Duterte’s China rapprochement. The US, Australia and Japan oppose Beijing building giant artificial islands that could be used as military bases, fearing it will eventually establish de facto control over the waters.

China insists the three countries should stay out of what it says are purely bilateral disputes with its neighbours. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned any interference from “outside parties” could jeopardise negotiations over the code of conduct.

Wrestler Vishal Kumar Verma dies of electrocution at Jaipal Singh Stadium,"Vishal Kumar Verma was electrocuted due to a short circuit at the inundated stadium building. (Source: File) Vishal Kumar Verma was electrocuted due to a short circuit at the inundated stadium building. (Source: File)

National level wrestler Vishal Kumar Verma passed away on Tuesday in an accident at the Jaipal Singh Stadium in Ranchi. As per reports, the 25-year old wrestler was electrocuted due to short circuit at the inundated stadium building. Vishal was spotted lying unconscious by locals and was declared dead by doctors after he was brought to the Sardar Hospital.

Jharkhand Wrestling Association president Bhola Singh has condemned the incident and announced an interim relief of Rs 1 lakh to Vishal’s family. The association will also give ten thousand rupees (Rs 10,000) every month to the family.

“It is extremely unfortunate. I don’t know why he went to the office which is sunk in deep waters. The situation of the stadium is pathetic and the building is in ruins. We have demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation from the government for the kin of Kumar,” said Singh.

Ganesh Jha, general manager of Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam (JBVNL), said that there was no fault in the power connection provided by his department.

“An executive engineer visited the site and reported that there is no fault in the power connection provided by JBVNL. However, there could be a loose connection in the building’s internal electrical wiring,” Ganesh told Times of India.

As per the investigation done by Shyamanand Mandal, officer in-charge of Kotwali police station, the faulty wiring of the water pump seemed to be the main cause of the incident.

“Preliminary investigation has revealed that death was due to electrocution. Vishal was using a water pump to clear out the water when the incident took place. Faulty wiring seems to be the main cause of this incident,” Mandal concluded.

Vishal was the lone bread earner in his family of six members with three unmarried sisters.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Strong defence, Super Raids push Bengaluru Bulls to win over Bengal Warriors","Ajay’s super raid gave Bengaluru Bulls a lead of four points, taking their points tally to 20-16. (Source: Pro Kabaddi) Ajay’s super raid gave Bengaluru Bulls a lead of four points, taking their points tally to 20-16. (Source: Pro Kabaddi)

Bengaluru Bulls’ coach Randhir Singh is not one to mince his words. He was scathing on his team’s defensive performance when they lost to UP Yoddha and was openly critical of Rohit Kumar’s inability to remain on court in their thrilling draw against Telugu Titans on Tuesday. Hence, when he is praising his team in a post match press conference, one can infer that the Bulls may have done well. They did and they got their second win since coming to Nagpur. It came against Bengal Warriors and the score was 31-25 in their favour.

“Our offence was always good, but today the defence was actually better,” said Randhir. But the fact remains that, despite a good defensive performance, the match will always be remembered for one specific raid that turned it Bengaluru’s way. For once, that moment was not brought on by Rohit Kumar but Ajay Kumar. Ajay Kumar went in for the raid and managed a touch. The Warriors clamped down on him but somehow, he managed to get to the mid line. Three others had touched him and four points came out of that one raid.

This happened a few minutes into the second half and the two teams were going toe to toe until that point. Suddenly, the Warriors had only two players left on their side of the mat and were four points behind from being level. They were all out in the next two minutes. “He (Ajay Kumar) has the ability,” said Randhir, “Somehow he was unable to show that on the mat.” This was something that was echoed by Rohit Kumar too. “Ajay, if he plays to his potential, can take three, four or five points. He can even inflict an all out by himself.”

Defensively, the Bulls showed more determination than they ever did. They had come close to being all out multiple times in both halves. Both times, they got out of the situation by the thick of their skin. Rohit Kumar, for a change, was as effective in defence as he was in attack. It was a win that the Bulls desperately needed and one that they got through some good defence and a Super Raid

"The game of getting Gareth Bale over before it even started, says Jose Mourinho","Jose Mourinho and Gareth Bale. (Source: Reuters) Jose Mourinho and Gareth Bale. (Source: Reuters)

After going down in the UEFA Super Cup final against Spanish reigning champions Real Madrid on Tuesday, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho said that their interest in Gareth Bale is over.

There were increasing reports lately linking the Welsch player with the Old Trafford side but Mourinho on Tuesday put them all to rest after the 2-1 defeat. He said, “Clearly the club wants him, the manager wants him and he wants the club so clearly game over, before it had even started, as everybody knows he is going to stay.”

Bale also commented on the ongoing rumours and said, “I’m not reading anything, although people tell me bits and bobs. I’m enjoying my football and playing as much as a I can and winning trophies.”

“It is obviously great to keep adding to the trophy collection. It was a difficult game but I think we played well and controlled the game very well. We want to keep winning and every game we still have the hunger and desire.”

The Portuguese manager Mourinho discussed the match ahead of the start of Premier League on Sunday. “I think we did well, I think we lost to one goal which shows the result was really short (tight) and one of their goals was an offside. With a good VAR system it would be 1-1 and extra time,” added the Portuguese coach, who has still yet to win the European Super Cup after three attempts,” he said.

“We were playing a team full of fantastic players but we discussed (contested) the result until almost the end. We gave them a fight but have reasons to leave optimistic and proud.”

Senior Haryana IAS officer Virender Kundu, whose daughter alleged she was chased and stalked in a kidnapping bid by state BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas, took to Facebook on Friday to recount the “stormy emotional journey” that resulted in the arrest of Vikas and his friend Ashish Kumar. The two accused in the case were sent to police custody for two days on Thursday and will again be produced in court on August 12. Virender added that Varnika reacted to the news saying, “Now I feel like I can eat. They have been arrested.”

“Within six days after the incident, our lives are changed in many ways. A stormy emotional journey that already feels epical. From the trauma of the actual incident, to the frustration and anxiety of engaging with the law enforcement agencies, the trepidation as the scenes unfolded, alternating states of anger and fear and hope, on to a rising sense of euphoria as the deluge of support and avowals of solidarity poured in from all corners of the country and the world,” Virender wrote on Facebook. Expressing gratitude for the support, he said “our bruised hearts were not only soothed, they swelled. With hope, and warmth, and love.” Also read: Haryana BJP president’s son Vikas Barala sent to two-day police custody. Click here.

Calling the arrests “small, but so significant”, he added that “seeing the once beastly hyena faces cowering and hiding into sweaty armpits of cops felt amazingly good.” Virender said the war is not over, and there’s a long way to go. However, he added, “We did let our hair loose after so many days of intense activity which had kept our minds occupied.”

“A lot of coping and healing still has to happen, I realized. A lot of hurt and pain yet to be felt. The heart, however, is warm, and glowing, with the love and support received,” Virender said, in a post on Facebook.

"Day after engineer’s suicide, colleague held","A 25-year-old software engineer was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her rented accommodation in Noida Sector 62 late Wednesday, police said. A day later, on Thursday, police arrested her male colleague, who she had blamed in her suicide note. “The arrest was made near the office where the woman and the accused used to work. An FIR was registered at the police station after the woman’s father filed a complaint.

"Lucknow-Kanpur module of IS: Ex-IAF man was inclined towards jihad in India, convinced others, says NIA","Explosion in 59320 Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train. (Source: ANI) Explosion in 59320 Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train. (Source: ANI)

The self-proclaimed Lucknow-Kanpur module of the Islamic State, which on May 7 allegedly carried out a blast on a Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train, may have been headed by Kanpur resident Atif Muzaffar, but its plans to carry out attacks in India were allegedly hatched by a former Indian Air Force man from Kannauj. An NIA chargesheet filed in a special court in Bhopal says that it was Ghaus Mohammed who motivated the group of eight people to carry out attacks in India rather than join the IS war in Syria. He allegedly oversaw the manufacturing of five bombs by the group which were planted at various places over six months.

The once Barelvi Muslim-turned-Ahle-Hadith follower allegedly convinced the group that going from Kanpur to Lucknow for the cause of jihad was ‘Hijrath’ (migration). “They (accused) were very serious about Hizrat and A4 (Ghaus) had once accompanied A1 (Atif) to Kolkata and Sunderbans to find a way to leave for Syria. A4, however, was more inclined towards doing jihad in India and he always tried his best to convince others to do jihad in India. In fact, it was his idea that moving from Kanpur to Lucknow was also Hijrat for jihad; which is how all the accused established their hideout in Lucknow,” the chargesheet says.

It was in Lucknow that, hours after the train blast that left 10 passengers injured on May 7, one of the accused, Saifullah, was engaged in a gunbattle with UP ATS at his hideout. Saifullah was eventually killed and police recovered arms and bomb-making material from the hideout. Ghaus had introduced Saifullah and others in the group to the landlord as his nephews. The chargesheet says that Ghaus worked with the IAF in Punjab but later retired and went to Saudi Arabia for work between 1996-98. It was here that he was influenced by Ahl-e-Hadith, the chargesheet says. It was through his son Adil that he came in contact with others in the group.

Later, Ghaus not only took oath of allegiance to the IS but allegedly oversaw assembly of bombs and choosing of targets. According to the chargesheet, in August 2006, Atif allegedly carried out the first trial of a blast at his home at Katripiparkheda in Jajmau, Kanpur. Next month he assembled another bomb in a pipe, which was exploded in an open field. A third bomb was made by the group in a plastic bottle and planted at Ghatampur Road beside the railway line. It was to be put in a busy square of Kanpur, but the group did not succeed. “Ghaus was aware of all these attempts,” the chargesheet says. In the first week of October, it says, the group allegedly made another bomb that was transported from Kanpur to Lucknow by Ghaus on his bike. On October 11, Atif and another associate allegedly planted this bomb at Ramlila grounds in Lucknow. No one was injured in these blasts.

“Atif made a fifth bomb in the second week of December to use against Bara Rabi-al-Alwal, which is a Barelvi rally. He made the bomb with a six-inch pipe and took it to Unnao… This didn’t explode. Later the bomb was retrieved and Atif kept it in his house in Kanpur…,” the chargesheet says, adding that the bomb was modified and used in the Bhopal-Ujjain train. After planting the bomb in the train, the accused allegedly took a picture of it and sent it to an online entity through Telegram for further transmission to IS.

"Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho spending heavily to dethrone Chelsea","Pep Guardiola has started rebuilding from the back by recruiting Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker. (Source: AP) Pep Guardiola has started rebuilding from the back by recruiting Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker. (Source: AP)

The way Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho have been spending, the Premier League trophy should be returning to Manchester in May. In an off-season that has seen more than 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) invested in players, Manchester rivals City and United have accounted for more than a third of that spending.

It was the inevitable reaction to feeble title challenges that saw Guardiola’s City finish 15 points behind the victorious Chelsea side in third place and Mourinho’s United drift over the line nine points further adrift.

For a serial collector of trophies at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, finishing his first season in English football without a single title was an unusual feeling for Guardiola.

If the overhaul of the squad, costing more than 200 million pounds, doesn’t deliver silverware there will be further uncomfortable questions for the Spaniard.

Guardiola has started rebuilding from the back by recruiting fullbacks Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker for around 50 million pounds apiece.

Signing Walker was particularly eye-catching. The England right back forced his way out of a Tottenham side that finished ahead of City in second place.

With its rigid pay structure, Tottenham lacks the will to break its budget to offer big salaries. Or, in this transfer window, spend anything yet on reinforcing a squad that delivered Tottenham’s highest league finish in more than 50 years.

Rather than being a platform to build on to challenge for a first title since 1961, Tottenham’s ownership appears more focused on building its new stadium. Still, the north London club has kept its key talent _ notably Harry Kane and Dele Alli who scored 47 league goals between them last season.

In search of goals, Manchester United turned to last season’s second-highest scorer. Striker Romelu Lukaku cost at least 75 million pounds, while Mourinho offloaded captain Wayne Rooney in the opposite direction to Everton.

Lukaku isn’t the only player being reunited Mourinho, who also convinced former club Chelsea to sell Nemanja Matic to United. A fee of 40 million pounds proved too substantial for Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to turn down, even if manager Antonio Conte wanted to retain the midfielder he still called “very important for our team” on Wednesday.

“Sometimes you must accept this crazy transfer market,” Conte told British broadcaster Sky Sports, “and sometimes you must accept different decisions. But he is a great loss for us.”

The danger for Chelsea is that the harmonious atmosphere re-established by Conte after Mourinho’s bitter departure is eroded. Although Conte has brought in striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, he is finding it hard to sell another forward _ Diego Costa.

Chelsea had wanted to bring Lukaku back to Stamford Bridge, a transfer thwarted by Mourinho. Despite finishing sixth in the league, the Portuguese coach completed his first season at United with two trophies. While the League Cup is little regarded, the Europa League provided a ticket into the Champions League _ and probably the signature of Lukaku.

It was one of the costliest moves in Europe during a summer transfer window that has seen United midfielder Paul Pogba replaced as the most expensive player in football by Neymar, who joined Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros ($262 million).

“I don’t think we’re going to see that replicated (in England),” Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore said. “And, in some ways, I’m glad it’s not the Premier League holding that particular record.”

Yet, there is set to be a knock-on effect, particularly at Liverpool.

Liverpool now appears to have a fight on its hands to retain attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho as Barcelona looks to reinvest some its Neymar windfall in another Brazilian. Losing such a key player would hamper Juergen Klopp’s hopes of using his second full season at Anfield to show his upbeat demeanor can be matched with silverware.

Arsenal also embarks on a new campaign uncertain whether it will hold onto a key member of its squad. Striker Alexis Sanchez, who has been ruled out of Friday’s opener against Leicester, is in the final season of his Emirates Stadium contract.

Losing Sanchez would jeopardize Arsenal’s attempt to rejoin the elite. For the first time in 20 years, Arsene Wenger’s side will be missing from the Champions League as a consequence of its fifth-place Premier League finish.

But Arsenal has already reinforced its attacking options by signing Alexandre Lacazette and brought in burly defender Sead Kolasinac. Wenger is also looking to trim players surplus to requirements _ an issue he discussed with fellow managers at a meeting this week.

“It looks like everywhere there is many, many players and a bit of congestion at the moment everywhere,” Wenger said.

The financial power of the Premier League means that promotion is usually accompanied by a spending spree to try to stay in the world’s richest football competition.

Brighton and Huddersfield, both playing in the top-flight for the first time in the post-1992 Premier League era, have been breaking their club transfer records.

Netherlands midfielder Davy Propper moved to south-coast club Brighton for around 10 million pounds from PSV Eindhoven. Huddersfield spent a similar amount on bringing striker Steve Mounie in from Montpellier _ the third time the northern club broke its transfer record in the off-season.

Brighton and Huddersfield were promoted alongside a Newcastle side making an instant return to the Premier League. Whether Newcastle is instantly relegated seems to depend on whether manager Rafa Benitez will be granted the funds he craves.

“I am not happy,” said Benitez, a Champions League winner with Liverpool, “but at the same time for me it’s a challenge.”

"Dutee Chand needs to focus more on training and doing better for herself, says Rio Olympics champion Caster Semenya","Dutee Chand had a disappointing show in the 100m Heats at the World Athletics Championship. (Source: AP) Dutee Chand had a disappointing show in the 100m Heats at the World Athletics Championship. (Source: AP)

There is no one better than Caster Semenya who can relate to the plight of Dutee Chand and the South African says the Indian should focus more on training than “boring and nonsense” discussion on her gender test.

Semenya, the Rio Olympics champion in women’s 800m, feels sorry for Chand since the Indian, just like her, is facing a gender test row. After winning the gold medal in the 2009 Berlin World Championships, questions were asked about Semenya’s gender and she ended up spending 11 months on the sidelines. The IAAF conducted a verification process before reinstating her.

Asked what she told Dutee when they met in Rio, Semenya said, “We did not talk much. We just exchanged ways and greetings and say how are you? That is it. She is a nice girl. She just needs to focus more on training and doing better for herself. I feel sorry for her, she is still young. But we are not the same, I do my things my own way.”

The Hyperandrogenism Policy of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) bars female athletes with high levels of testosterone from competing on the ground that they have an unfair advantage over their peers.

Dutee was banned by the Athletics Federation of India in 2014 under this policy but she challenged it in the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) in Lausanne in Switzerland. In July 2015, the CAS overturned the ban and also suspended Hyperandrogenism Policy for two years. The world’s top sports tribunal asked the IAAF to provide conclusive evidence to prove the policy.

As the two year period ended last month, the IAAF has decided to go back to the CAS to submit fresh evidence. The hearing is expected towards the end of next month.

Semenya won a bronze medal in the women’s 1500m on Monday at the ongoing World Championships and is favourite to win gold in the 800m race later this week. Semenya, 26, dismissed this talk of gender testing as ‘boring’ and ‘nonsense’. “For me I have no time for this talk. It has been nearly nine years and it is boring. I focus on the future, not the past. For me it is quite boring if you keep on asking me about one question. There is nothing I can do, you have to understand that I am an athlete and I focus more on running and nothing else,” she said.

When reminded that the IAAF is set to submit fresh evidence at the CAS and a favourable decision for IAAF could jeopardise her career, Semenya said, “I really don’t have time for nonsense. I do not think about something that might happen in eight months. I don’t focus on the IAAF. It’s their business. My business is to train hard and see what I come up with in competition. Those are the writings that I’ve been seeing since 2009. Sometimes you get annoyed or you get bored. Such situations are a waste of time for me.”

"Chandigarh stalking case: We’re there for Varnika if she needs help, says Kundu khap","“We are there for Varnika if she needs our help in her fight for justice. We can approach other Jat khaps also,” says Virender Singh. “We are there for Varnika if she needs our help in her fight for justice. We can approach other Jat khaps also,” says Virender Singh.

IT IS a ‘family’ of lakhs of people spread in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. They all call themselves “brothers and sisters”. And Varnika Kundu, on whose complaint the Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala and his friend Ashish Kumar, were arrested, is one of them. “She is the daughter of Kundus,” says Virender Singh Kundu, acting president of Kundu khap, headquartered in this village.

Two days ago, Kundu khap members had blocked National Highway-71 demanding the arrest of Vikas Barala. “We are pleased that Vikas and his accomplice have been arrested. We are there for Varnika if she needs our help in her fight for justice. We can approach other Jat khaps also,” says Virender Singh. Varnika’s IAS father, V S Kundu, belongs to Shahpur village of Panipat district, where six villages are dominated by Kundu gotra.

“A delegation from these villages had come to me to offer support. They had asked me what they should do. I suggested to them that there was no need to do anything,” says Kundu, who is Additional Chief Secretary (tourism) in the Haryana government. Kundu’s father Krishan Singh Kundu, a lawyer, had shifted to Chandigarh in 1967. “My father was the first graduate of our village,” said Kundu, who has two sisters.

The anger against the incident is evident in the village. “Ek taraf to Beti Bachao ka nara deve se aur dusari taraf yo hal se (They give slogan of Beti Bachao but on the other hand, this is the reality,” said Murti Devi, 55, wife of a retired Army Captain, Jagbir Singh. “To express our anger, we burnt an effigy of Subhash Barala after the stalking incident and we had warned that we would block roads if the accused were not arrested soon. It was not the fight of Kundus alone but of “36 biradaris”, said Ram Mehar Kundu, a farmer, in Shahpur village.

But the arrests have calmed tempers. Captain Jagbir Singh (retd) said, “We are satisfied that the accused have been arrested and appropriate sections of the IPC have been added against them.” In Haryana, according to the Kundu khap president, Kundus have a significant presence in more than 80 villages of Haryana, of which a few dozen are called ‘Kundu villages’.

"Indian-American fined $40,000 for filing false visa applications","New Hampshire businessman Rohit Saksena allegedly filed 45 fraudulent visa applications (Representational images) New Hampshire businessman Rohit Saksena allegedly filed 45 fraudulent visa applications (Representational images)

An Indian-American businessman from New Hampshire has been fined $40,000 and put on three years of probation by a federal court on charges of filing false H-1B visa applications, a US attorney has said. The businessman, Rohit Saksena, had previously pleaded guilty to making false statements to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to court documents.

Saksena, 42, president and chief executive officer of Saks IT Group LLC, a company based in Manchester, New Hampshire, allegedly filed 45 fraudulent visa applications, claiming that his company was hiring foreign workers to provide professional services to a California-based company.

However, the California company had not entered into a contract with Saks IT Group and had no vacancies for foreign workers. Saksena knew that foreign workers would not be employed, acting US attorney John J. Farley said yesterday.

Saksena filed visa applications that falsely claimed jobs awaited the foreign workers at the California company, the US Justice Department said. He supported those applications with bogus independent contractor agreements between the his IT group and the other company with sham work orders that purported to show that the foreign workers would provide professional services for the California company, it claimed.

“Some of the false visa applications resulted in foreign workers receiving H-1B visas. Many of the fraudulent applications were denied once Saksena’s deception came to light,” the department said.

Sri Lanka have lost quite a few players to injuries in the ongoing series against India and with Nuwan Pradeep and Rangana Herath also ruled out of the third Test, the hosts have to field a rather inexperienced squad in the third and final Test against India which begins from Saturday.

The hosts have named fast bowlers Dushmantha Chameera and uncapped Lahiru Gamage for the third Test after the exit of Pradeep and Herath. Danushka Gunathilaka has also been ruled out of the final Test. He made his Test debut in the first Test but had to make way for Dinesh Chandimal as the Sri Lanka captain return after attaining full fitness.

Pradeep pulled up his hamstring during the second Test and did not bowl after the first day while Herath was ruled out after a back injury as he complained about stiffness in his back.

Sri Lanka have already lost the series and with only one match left, they would like to end this series on a good note. They lost the second Test by an innings and 53 runs in Colombo.

The 16-man squad retained Lahiru Kumara and Vishwa Fernando. While Lahiru played the first Test in Galle, Fernando, a left-arm quick, sat out for both the Tests.

Sri Lanka are going in with a pace-heavy bowling attack and hope to counter India’s batting line-up which has posted 600-plus totals once in both the Tests so far.

Sri Lanka squad: Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Gamage, Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara, Lakshan Sandakan.

Related News At least six Buddhists killed in rising Rakhine violence

The Myanmar government’s inquiry into violence in northern Rakhine state last year that forced tens of thousands of Muslim Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh and led to U.N. accusations of crimes against humanity by the army has concluded that no such crimes happened.

Speaking at the release of the Rakhine Investigative Commission’s final report, Vice President Myint Swe — a former general — told reporters Sunday that “there is no evidence of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights claimed.”

He also denied charges that there had been gang rapes by the military as it swept through Rohingya villages in a security clearance operation. The army was reacting to deadly attacks against border police posts by a previously unknown insurgent group in October 2016 in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine.

The commission’s report did accept that some things might have happened that broke the law, attributing it to excessive action on the part of individual members of the security forces.

Rights groups have previously expressed their doubts over the commission’s work, saying it lacked outside experts, had poor research methodologies and lacked credibility because it was not independent.

The U.N. has mandated its own fact-finding mission to travel to the Maungdaw area to conduct its own inquiry, but the government has said its members will not be allowed to go.

Zaw Myint Pe, a senior member of the government commission, said the report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Of in early February, which included accusations of rights abuses by security forces, had failed to take into consideration violent acts committed by Muslim groups.

“The report does not contain forward-looking constructive recommendations but instead accuses Myanmar of committing genocide and ethnic cleansing by killing Muslims and it is terribly affecting our country’s image,” said Zaw Myint Pe.

The government has shut down northern Rakhine, where the allegations of right abuses are ongoing, to independent journalists, rights experts and humanitarian workers for almost nine months. The security forces launched an aggressive clearance operation in Rakhine in October 2016 after shadowy insurgents killed nine border guard police officers.

"Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport: Technical change in taxiway to boost operational capacity, say airport staff","The airport sees 48 flights and 52 flights in peak hours take-off and land every hour, respectively. ( File – Express Photo by Pradip Das) The airport sees 48 flights and 52 flights in peak hours take-off and land every hour, respectively. ( File – Express Photo by Pradip Das)

A technical change in the angle of the taxiway would add to the operational capacity of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA), Mumbai, officials from Air Traffic Control (ATC) said. The change, which would save five seconds per flight, will in turn add to the number of flights landing and taking off from the airport.

The airport sees 48 flights and 52 flights in peak hours take-off and land every hour, respectively. The angle of the taxiway would be changed from 90 degrees to 45 degrees for reducing the runway occupation times of the aircraft. “The experiment, if proved successful, could easily add the operation of one or two flights per hour. The effort is part of a move to improve the operational capacity of the Mumbai airport. We will analyse the process after due permissions are received,” an official from Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) said.

The official said that the airport, which sees an operation of 900 flights on an average, could see an increase of 15-20 flights. The move will specifically help the smaller aircraft that see 80 per cent traffic at the airport, officials from the ATC said.

“The turn will help pilots to vacate the runway with ease as compared to the time taken by them to make a turn and leave the airside slowly. It will also improve our traffic landing capacity,” an ATC official said.

A study will be conducted in detail to check the increase in flight operations after the change. While the alteration to the angle is in place, the authorities await the required permissions from the safety body and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to start using the same.

The effort is a part of the plan to introduce Rapid Exit Taxiway in the airport, a concept prevalent at the airports of Kolkata and Delhi. Experts believe that the increase in the operational capacity of the airport would be helpful till another airport is brought into use in the city.

Axar Patel named Ravindra Jadeja’s replacement for third Test,"Axar Patel, if given a chance, will be making his Test debut. (Source: BCCI) Axar Patel, if given a chance, will be making his Test debut. (Source: BCCI)

India have called in left-arm spinner Axar Patel to replace all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja in the squad for the third and final Test against Sri Lanka at Pallekele. Jadeja was handed a one match suspension by ICC after he had accumulated six demerit points inside two-year time period.

The third Test begins on Saturday in Kandy and Patel will join the team after his India ‘A’ tour South Africa which ended on Tuesday. But, whether the 23-year-old will replace the world number one bowler in the playing XI is yet to be seen.

India completed a series win by winning the second Test in Colombo on Sunday by an innings and 53 runs and shortly after, ICC announced that Jadeja has been handed a one-match ban. The ICC said that during Sri Lanka’s second innings, one of Jadeja’s throw was “in dangerous manner”.

Jadeja had fielded the ball off his own bowling and threw it at batsman Malinda Pushpakumara but according to on-field umpires, it was thrown in a dangerous manner.

On Tuesday, Jadeja, who is already the world number one bowler, was named the world number one all-rounder by ICC. He overtook Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib-Al-Hasan for the top position.

With Jadeja missing out, it will be either Patel, who has played 30 international matches, or chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav turning up for India in third Test, which will also be an opportunity to complete a series sweep. R Ashwin is India’s leading spinner at the moment and he remains a first choice.

Central Certification Board required for ITIs: Skill Development and Entrepreneurship minister Rudy,"“The government has decided to set up a central certification board to give equivalent certificates to students of ITIs, which currently number around 2.3 million,” Rajiv Pratap Rudy said (File Photo) “The government has decided to set up a central certification board to give equivalent certificates to students of ITIs, which currently number around 2.3 million,” Rajiv Pratap Rudy said (File Photo)

Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) will soon have their own central board of certification . Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Rajiv Pratap Rudy on Wednesday said that the board will grant students certificates on finishing school at ITIs to dispel the stigma around vocational education.

“The government has decided to set up a central certification board to give equivalent certificates to students of ITIs, which currently number around 2.3 million,” Rudy said at a media briefing in New Delhi. He added that ITIs have gone through a complete reform of their structure, curriculum, syllabus and assessments and will soon come to standards equaling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian School Certificate Examinations.

The move aims to help students at ITIs to pursue regular courses in other courses and colleges and is designed to further the mobility between vocational and formal education systems.

Earlier, he had announced that the Directorate General of Training was permitted by the Human Resource Development Ministry to conduct exams for 23 lakh students in ITIs at the matriculation, secondary and higher secondary levels and award those who clear these exams with certificates.

“Sadly, our policy has always been to put the students who didn’t perform well at school, or dropouts, into the ITIs… and they are not given matriculation or higher secondary certificates. So, we have ended up creating a system which has 18 lakh seats for engineering students, but of which 8 lakhs are lying vacant, without any takers,” the minister said on the subject of labour stigmatisation, adding that education in India has been biased against skills and that manual work has been looked down upon.

(AP Photo/Grace Garces Bordallo)

The Pacific island of Guam remained outwardly calm on Wednesday in the face of a threatened North Korean attack, and a senior official in the US territory urged people to “relax and enjoy paradise”. After US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” over its nuclear ambitions yesterday, Pyongyang raised the stakes just hours later — saying it was considering missile strikes near US strategic military installations on Guam.

In a televised address to the 162,000 residents on the Western Pacific island, Governor Eddie Calvo said Guam was working with Washington “to ensure our safety”. “I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island,” he said. George Charfauros, the territory’s homeland security adviser, said there was “0.000001 percent chance of the North Korean missile hitting Guam”.

His advice to residents to “relax and enjoy the paradise” appeared to hit home. There was no evidence of panic buying in stores Wednesday and gas stations were operating normally. Shop worker Chelsea Nu told AFP the threat of attack was not even a conversation topic in her store. “I haven’t heard people talk about it. The customer traffic is normal. They’re just buying school supplies because the school’s just opened.” Guam, which advertises pristine beaches, clear blue skies and “world-famous sunsets” is a popular destination, with tourism a key pillar of its economy.

But it is also home to about 6,000 US troops and houses two US military installations — the Andersen Air Force Base and the Naval Base Guam. Despite the significant contribution the military makes to the local economy, there is a small but growing opposition to its presence. Nationalists argue the territory is a potential target of aggression due to the presence of US forces.

But Calvo said it was the military which provided protection. “Those who are against the military will keep that distinction and make that argument. In the same manner, those who support the presence of the military on Guam will argue that this is what keeps us safe,” he said. Guam was described by President Barack Obama’s defence secretary Ashton Carter as “an important strategic hub for the US military in the Western Pacific”.

Calvo said there were “several levels of defence” strategically placed to protect Guam and he had been assured by the White House that a strike on the territory would be considered an attack on the United States. “They have said that America will be defended. I also want to remind national media that Guam is American soil and we have 200,000 Americans in Guam and the Marianas. We are not just a military installation.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have decided to resume high-level trade talks next month, the first such engagement between the two countries in nearly two years as Kabul wanted to involve India in dialogue. The proposal for resuming talks by convening a meeting of their Joint Economic Commission (JEC) in Kabul was made by Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan Hazrat Omar Zakhilwal during a meeting yesterday with Pakistan’s Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.

It will be the first high-level talks between the two neighbouring countries since November 2015 when Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s condition to continue talks with Pakistan on all issues, including trade, subject to involvement of India.

The deteriorating security situation also triggered an intermittent war of words between the two countries with Afghan officials holding Pakistan responsible for each such incident. “It will be a great opportunity for Islamabad and Kabul to repair their diplomatic and business relations which have discontinued since November 2015,” a source privy to the development told Dawn.

An official statement issued after the meeting said ambassador Zakhilwal stated that the next session of the Pak-Afghan Joint Economic Commission (JEC) was due and proposed that it might be held in Kabul in September. Dar welcomed the proposal and said mutually convenient dates be decided to hold the session next month.

The deadlock between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to Kabul’s insistence that India should be included in bilateral and trilateral agreements. Kabul wanted to include India in the Trilateral Transit Trade Agreement — Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan.

Afghanistan also wants access to markets of India and SAARC countries through Wagah border, according to officials. Dar was of the opinion that the JEC meeting should provide an opportunity to discuss measures for furthering the cause of economic cooperation between the two countries.

The Afghan envoy was informed that Pakistan’s economic affairs division would cooperate with the Afghan embassy to work out details for the JEC meeting whose main focus will be enhancement of bilateral trade and economic cooperation. The 10th Pak-Afghan JEC session was held on November 23, 2015, in Islamabad.

The JEC is a highly important forum that takes into consideration important issues, including trade facilitation, enhancement of bilateral and transit trade, highway and railway projects, scholarship scheme for Afghan students, as well as potential joint ventures in various other sectors.

One of the fallout of the suspension of talks was a decline in bilateral trade. Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan dropped by a significant 27 per cent over the past one year, owing to several factors.

Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan had reached an all-time high of USD 2.4 billion in 2010-11. It remained over USD 2 billion in the subsequent two years. Since then, exports started to dwindle and hit USD 1.43 billion in 2015-16. In the first quarter of the current financial year, exports were recorded at USD 362.5 million. It clearly reflects that the annual exports to Afghanistan will now be around USD 1 billion when the figure for 2016-17 is finalised.

Talks on several issues have been on the back burner for a couple of years because of Kabul’s loss of interest in concluding a trade liberalisation regime with Pakistan. In 2014, both sides agreed to initiate negotiations on a bilateral preferential trade agreement (PTA), with Pakistan sharing a draft text of the agreement with Afghanistan.

In 2015, Afghanistan conveyed to Pakistan that it would formally respond to the draft PTA by January 2016. This issue will be raised at the upcoming JEC meeting, the report said. To encourage business-to-business interaction between the two countries, a joint business council (JBC) comprising leading businessmen from both sides was established.

The first meeting of the JBC was scheduled for August 2015. When Kabul failed to send its response, a new date for the JBC meeting was scheduled for February 17 last year in Islamabad. However, no meeting of the JBC has been held so far.

Pakistan recently reminded Afghanistan to convene the 7th meeting of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Coordination Authority in Kabul as had been agreed at the last meeting held in 2016. It will be one of the important issues to be raised at the JEC meeting. The draft text on avoidance of double taxation was also shared, but no follow-up meeting has been held so far.

UEFA Super Cup: Romelu Lukaku joins illustrious list of debut scorers for Manchester United,"Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring their first goal. (Source: Reuters) Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring their first goal. (Source: Reuters)

Jose Mourinho used all his three new signings Romelu Lukaku, Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic in the UEFA Super Cup against Spanish champions Real Madrid on Sunday but it was Lukaku who made his mark in his debut on Tuesday as they went down 2-1 against Los Blancos.

Lukaku was the only saving grace for United and the Belgian footballer joins an illustrious list of debut scorers for United which includes Van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

It was Lukaku’s first appearance in competitive football after a succesful pre-season for the Red Devils and he did not waste the chance to prove that he was worth the £145.7million signing from Everton.

The 24-year old shot a rebound after Paul Pogba’s header was stopped by Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas. He made up for the first half blunder when he was offside. Instead of waiting for his teammate to run clear, the striker brought the attack to an end by running onto the ball.

United will now begin their Premier League with a match against West Ham on Sunday.

Trump commends UNSC for adopting new sanctions on North Korea,"“Trump commends the UN Security Council for passing a new resolution that increases sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests,” the White House said. (File) “Trump commends the UN Security Council for passing a new resolution that increases sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests,” the White House said. (File)

US President Donald Trump has commended the UN Security Council for adopting new sanctions on North Korea, calling it the single largest economic sanctions package issued against the reclusive nation that is expected to cost Pyongyang USD 1 billion. Trump also praised Russia and North Korea’s ally China for voting in favour of the sanctions.

The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution that significantly strengthened sanctions on North Korea, with a ban on exports aimed at depriving Pyongyang of USD 1 billion in annual revenue. The US-drafted measure, negotiated with North Korea’s neighbour and ally China, is aimed at increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang to return to negotiations on its nuclear and missile programs.

“Trump commends the UN Security Council for passing a new resolution that increases sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests,” the White House said. Trump said China and Russia voted with the US to pass what he called “the single largest economic sanctions package ever” on North Korea.

“The President appreciates China’s and Russia’s cooperation in securing passage of this resolution,” it added. “He will continue working with allies and partners to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to end its threatening and destabilising behaviour,” the White House said in a statement.

Food Review: Twist of Taste,"Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant.

With a modern dining room that exposes its busy brigade of chefs through a glass panel on the ground floor, and a cosier, more sequestered space tailored for groups of four or more on the floor above, where jazz plays unobtrusively and mood lighting nudges the gaze towards the table, W. D. House makes one thing very clear: your focus is meant to be on the food.

W. D. House travelled south from Chandigarh, where it is both recognised and glorified, to Delhi last month. Much like its neighbour in GK II’s M block, China Garden, the fine dining restaurant opens itself to patrons from noon to 3.30 pm and then from 7 pm to midnight. This edition of W.D. or Whistling Duck, aims to encourage conversations about the “indigenous modernity” of the ’40s and ‘50s — asserted with a single stem rose perched on tables dressed in lily-white covers and cane chairs, but also with its food. An ambitious menu — that can, perhaps, leave one confused — offers regional Indian, Southeast Asian, and European cuisines.

But, confusion is not a welcome guest here, and is soon defenestrated as head chef Richa Johari takes one through the menu. It is, then, easy to realise that the food here is as straightforward as her. You get what you ask for, but with a twist. Take, for instance, the Rhododendron squash, an enchanting, deep-pink drink made of the sweetly-scented flowers from Uttarakhand with celery and black salt. Or the Pashtun-style Chappali Kebabs, a compound of goat meat, coriander seeds, vetiver roots and pomegranate seeds, that followed soon after. The little frills are only a reflection of Johari’s deft hand with spices, and a result of her attention to detail evident in her zen-like precision to presentation.

Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Even with the Almond Crab Cake — flakes of almond-coated fat crab patties to be paired with a gandhraj (strong scented citrus from Kolkata) aioli — the flavours were neither big nor subtle. An attempt at choreographing a duet of textures came through in all the dishes.

If you want to better your relationship with karela, or bitter gourd, W.D. House should be your choice of counsellor. Rings of bitter gourd coated in batter and deep fried were tossed in a raw mango murabba dressing with raw onion, heirloom tomatoes and cucumber slices. This dish has the potential to convert the most ardent karela dismissers.

Another orthodox yet atypical offering from the restaurant’s kitchen was the Guay Tiew Moo, a dish popular in Thailand. Traditionally made with the meat that must not be named, this one was with pork that sat in the deep end of a bowl, amid lettuce, sprouts, and flat noodles, brimming with galangal flavoured broth with seemingly harmless red chillies that gave the soup a bit of a jolt. For the mains, a dish from Jharkhand, Dhuska — deep-fried discs made with rice, lentils and chillies — was paired with a chicken saag curry.

The dhuska mellowed the sharpness of the mustard oil that the chicken was cooked in, resulting in a harmony of flavours. The other main, a ravioli of blue cheese in a smooth, brighter-than-the-sun yellow, pumpkin puree came drizzled with basil flavoured olive oil and pine nuts. The umami from the parmesan, pungency of the blue cheese and sweetness of the pumpkin worked beautifully together, but the pasta was not al dente enough.

For dessert, we dug into the basil and lime cheesecake topped with a grape and balsamic reduction. The pairing of the basil with the reduction lent a sophisticated touch to the albeit slightly dry cheesecake, making for an intriguing conclusion to the eclectic meal.

"ASEAN, China adopt framework for crafting code on South China Sea","North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, left, poses with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi for a photo prior to their bilateral meeting in the sideline of the 50th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and its Dialogue Partners. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez) North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, left, poses with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi for a photo prior to their bilateral meeting in the sideline of the 50th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and its Dialogue Partners. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)

Foreign ministers of Southeast Asia and China adopted on Sunday a negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, a move they hailed as progress but seen by critics as tactic to buy China time to consolidate its maritime power. The framework seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea, which has mostly been ignored by claimant states, particularly China, which has built seven manmade islands in disputed waters, three of which are equipped with runways, surface-to-air missiles and radars.

All parties say the framework is only an outline for how the code will be established but critics say the failure to outline as an initial objective the need to make the code legally binding and enforceable, or have a dispute resolution mechanism, raises doubts about how effective the pact will be. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the adoption of the framework created a solid foundation for negotiations that could start this year, if “the situation in the South China Sea is generally stable and on the premise that there is no major interference from outside parties.”

He told reporters there had been “really tangible progress” so there was “a need to cherish momentum on the South China Sea”. Signing China up to a legally binding and enforceable code for the strategic waterway has long been a goal for claimant members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), some of which have sparred for years over what they see as China’s disregard for their sovereign rights and its blocking of fishermen and energy exploration efforts.

Beijing insists its activities are for defence purposes, in areas it considers its waters. Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines, however, all claim some or all of the South China Sea and its myriad shoals, reefs and islands. Some critics and diplomats believe China’s sudden interest in the code after 15 years of delays is to drag out the negotiating process to buy time to complete its strategic objectives in the South China Sea, through which more than $3 billion of ship-borne trade passes annually.

WEAKER HAND

Opponents also say it is being pushed through at a time when the United States, long seen as a crucial buffer against China’s maritime assertiveness, is distracted by other issues and providing no real clarity about its security strategy in Asia, thus weakening ASEAN’s bargaining position. The framework has not been made public but a leaked two-page blueprint seen by Reuters is broad and leaves wide scope for disagreement.

It urges a commitment to the “purposes and principles” of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) but does not specify adherence to it, for example. A separate ASEAN document, dated May and seen by Reuters, shows that Vietnam pushed for stronger, more specific text in the framework, wanting mention of a dispute resolution mechanism and respecting “sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction”.

Sovereign rights cover entitlements to fish and extraction of natural resources. Several ASEAN countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines, have said they still favour making the code legally binding, something experts say China is unlikely to agree to.

Wang said he would not try to anticipate what the code will comprise, but said whatever is signed must be adhered to. Robespierre Bolivar, foreign ministry spokesman of host Philippines, said the adoption of the framework symbolised the commitment to creating a “substantive and effective” code.

Shweta Basu Prasad’s digital playlist: The battle of love and fate is painted beautifully in Sand Storm,"Shweta Basu Prasad recommends Elite Zexer’s 97-minute Arabic film Sand Storm this week. Shweta Basu Prasad recommends Elite Zexer’s 97-minute Arabic film Sand Storm this week.

What is a tradition? A custom, a belief that is passed on generation to generation, right? A child is born into a family that he/she does not choose, but is destined to be born in. And that child follows that particular family/society’s traditions. Most of which is important and perhaps, are ought to be followed.

But what if some of the customs and beliefs are imposed to every passing generation? What if traditions become suffocating and need amendment? Why does family and society become more important than one self?

Isn’t living life about having freedom to choose what an individual wants, instead of being told what to do?

This week my recommendation is Elite Zexer’s 97-minute Arabic film Sand Storm (Sufat Chol) available on Netflix.

Logline: In southern Israel a teen’s forbidden love affair challenges the traditions of her Bedouin mother and father.

The film starts with Suliman (Hitham Omari) a mid forties man teaching his teenage daughter Layla (Lamis Ammar) how to drive a car, in a small village in the south of Israel. Layla looks happy and secure with her father. Suliman asks her about her studies and shows concern when he hears about her performance as a student. Suliman and Layla arrive at their house, where Jalila (Ruba Blal) Suliman’s wife and Layla’s mother, disapproves Suliman taking Layla for driving lessons on his wedding day. Visibly annoyed, Jalila sets up the bed in the adjacent house along with Layla’s for Suliman’s new bride. Jalila looks around at the red painted house and colorful ceiling lights with jealousy. Later, Jalila welcomes Affaf, Suliman’s young and pretty wife halfheartedly, along with their friends and relatives.

At the wedding celebration Jalila discovers that Layla has a boyfriend, when he calls on Layla’s phone. Jalila’s embittered heart hates the idea of love and forbids her daughter to meet the guy henceforth. An irritated Layla waits for her father to return from his honeymoon so that she can introduce her boyfriend Anwar to him. Suliman’s behavior towards Anwar surprises Layla. She realizes, after all, her father is not all that liberal. She soon learns that her wedding is fixed with someone else by her father. In the course of the film, Jalila becomes intolerant of Suliman’s norms and eventually gets banished by her husband, forced to leave her four daughters behind. What follows is the battle of love and fate painted beautifully by the maker with hues of sensitivity and shadows of patriarchy, everything shot like a visual poetry.

The story that starts with a hope of modernity from a father supervising his daughter to drive his truck to choosing her groom gives a bold message. Jalila’s frowning face and the look in her eye when she meets her husband after his wedding, as if he was a borrowed man steals the show. Suliman’s wedding with his young wife is left open for guessing. It could be because he already had four daughters from Jalila and wanted sons, performing a ritual or it simply was sex segregated. All the performances are wonderful, except a special mention for Ruba Blal playing Jalila, she lit up the screen each time. Writer- director Elite Zexer’s screenplay is well edited and to the point and the film well crafted. Small details like chipping walls in Jalila’s house and newly painted house for Suliman’s bride make a strong point.

Sand storm was shown in the Panorama section at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. At the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, it won the Grand Jury Prize in the World Cinema Dramatic section. It was selected as the Israeli entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards. Sand storm rates 7/10 on the IMDB and 94% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Zexer has said she was inspired to explore the subject after accompanying her mother, a photographer, to document a Bedouin village.

““On one of our visits, we escorted a young woman during her wedding to a strange man, a man she only married to please her family, while she secretly loved another. Minutes before she met him for the first time, she turned to me and said, ‘This will never happen to my daughter’”. Sand storm director Ms. Elite Zexer told the Guardian.

Ross and Rachel’s love story has been one of the most iconic ones in the history of television. Their roller-coaster ride went on to become the show’s highlight throughout its ten seasons. But, Twitter user @kaneandgriffin thinks otherwise. In a 100-tweet long Twitter thread, she expressed her views stating why Rachel should have ended up with Joey instead. In what could be almost 14,000 characters, she divulged how their relationship should have been the real love story on the popular sitcom.

“I’m formulating an epic tweetstorm in defense of Joey & Rachel you guys. There’s a word doc outline with bullet points,” she first warned her followers about the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. rant that was about to begin. Starting with the words, “In Defense of Rachel and Joey: A Thread,” she began her quest on the social media networking site. “A lot of people think it was weird or that it came out of nowhere, BUT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WHY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENDGAME,” she added. She also openly confessed her hatred for Ross, saying: “I am on record as being absolutely ride-or-die anti-Ross Geller, who is for my money one of television’s all-time worst human men.”

Not because they’re RIGHT for each other,” she tweeted.

Do you agree with her thoughts and feel that Rachel should have been with Joey in the end? Tell us in the comments below.

Israel moves ahead on underground wall around Gaza,"In this Wednesday, July 20, 2016 file photo, a Palestinian youth walks inside a tunnel used for military exercises during a weapon exhibition at a Hamas-run youth summer camp, in Gaza City.

(Source: AP Photo/Adel Hana, File)

Israel is pushing ahead with a project to build a giant underground wall around the Gaza Strip to block tunnels that could be used for attacks, the army said today. The project comes after the government faced heavy criticism over Hamas’s use of tunnels in the 2014 Gaza war, with a state inquiry earlier this year accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and army top brass of being unprepared for the threat. “In the coming months, we are going to accelerate the construction of the barrier,” Major General Eyal Zamir told journalists.

“We hope that construction will be complete in two years.” Army radio reported that the wall, comprising concrete planks and sensors, will stretch some 64 kilometres (40 miles). It is expected to be some six metres (20 feet) high and 40 metres (130 feet) deep, and cost around three billion shekels (710 million euros, USD 834 million). Construction Minister Yoav Galant said the wall will be built in Israeli territory parallel to the border fence sealing off the Palestinian enclave run by Islamist movement Hamas. “The fact that the work will be located in our sovereign territory rules out any justification for attacks against those working there,” Galant told army radio.

Attack tunnels were a key weapon for Hamas during the 2014 Gaza war. Hamas also built a vast network of tunnels under Gaza’s border with Egypt to smuggle goods and allegedly weapons. The Israeli army found and destroyed several tunnels during the 2014 war, while Egypt has also destroyed smuggling tunnels. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the Gaza Strip since the group wrested control of the territory from the rival Fatah movement of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in 2007. The 2014 war killed 2,251 Palestinians and left 100,000 homeless, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 74 people were killed, all but six of them soldiers.

Pro-boxing circus of India: Struggles of boxers,"Pro boxing in India. Pro boxing in India.

Back in June 2015 when he announced that he was turning pro, Vijender Singh’s decision hogged all the headlines, as did his debut bout, a win over Sonny Whiting four months later. Over the next 14 months, the Olympic bronze medallist boxer maintained an unbeaten run, coasting to a professional win-loss record of 8-0.

On Saturday, when Vijender stepped into the ring, the stakes were the highest they’d ever been. He was defending the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title while looking to take the Oriental Super Middleweight belt off China’s Zulpikaer Maimaitiali — his first undefeated opponent. Exactly who should have won the fight remains a debate for another day. But each punch that sent the Indian reeling shook the country’s nascent pro-boxing ambitions.

Vijender went the distance and walked away with the two belts. That British boxer Amir Khan believes he “hasn’t won half a major title” is a different matter altogether.

After eight drab fights, the novelty was long gone for the casual viewer; to the point that a glimpse of Baba Ramdev elicited more cheers than the in-ring action during Vijender’s two fights in Delhi. In that regard, the contentious ninth should at least fuel conversations. That it was postponed and took eight months to materialise though is worrying. Meanwhile, Vijender cut ties with Frank Warren’s Queensberry Promotions after the UK-based company shied away from putting together an overseas fight for the boxer.

Which leads us to the all-important question: if India’s biggest and most marketable star can’t sustain interest in pro boxing, what chance do the many hopefuls have?

Despite that, many an aspiring pugilist would have keenly followed every jab and hook Vijender threw on Saturday, hoping to follow in the trendsetter’s footsteps. Before any of them is able to set foot inside a ring, though, he or she will have to navigate a maze.

AIBA. APB. WSB. WBA. WBO. WBC. IBF. BFI. IABF. IBC. SBL. PBOI. IPBA. NIBA. In addition to an overwhelming myriad of acronyms, pro boxing in India suffers from backroom politics and lack of larger-than-life prizefighters.

The first call that all boxers have to take is to move away from the system that gives them medals, cash incentives and job security. The national body, for one, believes most still choose to stay on the well-trodden path of amateur boxing.

“Firstly, it is a matter of pride to represent your nation in international competition, to end up on the podium,” says Jay Kowli, general secretary of the Boxing Federation of India (BFI). “It has been applicable in the cases of Muhammad Ali to Mike Tyson. Then there’s cash prizes to be won at international events, and the kind of support that the government provides to amateur boxers, it is a great way of building a career as well.”

However, with the world body, International Boxing Association (AIBA), also giving a thrust to professional boxing in the form of AIBA Pro Boxing (APB) which facilitates pro boxers to compete at the Olympics, BFI can’t be dismissive of the alternate stream.

Kowli, however, believes, “Pro-boxing is never about producing boxers. They are not interested in promoting boxing, training people. They pick up boxers when they do well because they are just interested in big names and putting on their big shows. As far as the scene in India is concerned, everybody is free to assess. Brigadier (PK Muralidharan) Raja has his own boxing set-up. But what happened?”

What happened was, Raja — a boxing administrator who has been associated with the sport for upwards of three decades — launched his own pro boxing body Indian Boxing Council (IBC) in 2015, organised a few ‘fight nights’ and soon had to put them on hold indefinitely.

“It has not been a very happy journey so far,” Raja sums it up. “The plan was to organise around 30-40 fights nights. I was trying to put around 3-4 in a month. But I couldn’t do it all out of my retirement funds.”

Raja says he had plans to promote pro boxing before there was a bandwagon to jump on. While the idea first struck him in 2010 — when Vijender was still busy preparing for the London Olympics — Raja put in the homework during the last three years.

“I went all around the world to study this. I met promoters, bought books, studied the formats,” says Raja, former secretary general of the now-defunct national federation IABF. “The gameplan was simple. We needed to build the fighters. Give them fights, build their record. Once the good ones get filtered, we would get them national titles, then Asian, World. So, I put in whatever money I had, thinking once it picks up, people will come in. The people who did come in, didn’t have money themselves.”

While he is not out of the game yet — “IBC is willing to conduct technical operations” — putting together any more fight nights without a promoter is out of the question.

“We want it to happen. But I’ve spent close to Rs1 crore myself. My team can still help with the referees, judges, doctors and setting up the fights. If anybody wants to come on board as a promoter, the profit is theirs to keep.”

Many bodies, many minds

Jay Kowli clarifies that “I’m not happy when anything goes wrong because it is my sport.” While he wouldn’t comment on the ongoing Super Boxing League (SBL), other than wishing them luck, Kowli believes plans eventually go sour without proper streamlining.

“Because I’m coming from an organised system, I would like these set-ups to be accountable and answerable for everything. Otherwise, I feel it is very risky for boxing.”

As of now, there are multiple organisations and little streamlining. SBL — the second venture of promoter Bill Dosanjh after the MMA promotion Super Fight League — kicked off in July without much fanfare or the backing of the powers that be. Not that it bothers Dosanjh.

“At the end of the day, it’s best that it’s done by people who understand the sport,” Dosanjh told The Indian Express. “Me and Amir Khan understand the sport better than any federation set up in India. (BFI President) Ajay Singh is a chairman of SpiceJet, running a very successful business, but he doesn’t understand the sport. He has a special job at hand to build the fighters for the Olympics. We are here to help them turn pro with this exciting format.”

The format however reminds one of the old adage: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. What essentially is a sport of two people punching each other in the face has been twisted into a team competition, with six fighters per side fighting four 3-minute rounds and different number of points awarded to different finishes.

Raja explains: “League concept is not for boxing. It has been tried before by Don King in the 70s. The people trying to do it are thinking they’ll cash in on the mushrooming of leagues and sell franchises. At the end of the day, everybody will be taken for a ride. How are the franchises going to recover the money?”

“Bill has the money. But I don’t think these guys are here to develop things. They are not from India. Outsiders coming to India thinking they will get something with these one-off events is not what professional boxing needs. All of these small groups need to get together and make one consolidated effort. Currently everything is fragmented.”

Too many cooks spoil the pie, more so when each is in a hurry for a slice. India has a number of underground pro boxing bodies affiliated to organisations such as World Boxing Council (WBC), World Boxing Association (WBA) and World Boxing Organisation (WBO).

In addition to Raja’s IBC, there is the Professional Boxing Organisation of India (PBOI) which is overseeing the SBL. That the body’s general secretary Kunal Goyat’s brother Neeraj took part in the league, without an NOC from his employer Railways, adds to the convoluted mess. Then there’s Jai Shekhawat of Royal Sports Promotions and North India Boxing Association (NIBA) who alleges that the PBOI has breached an exclusivity deal by signing up with SBL, leaving his pro boxing league stuck in the pipeline.

There’s also the Indian Pro Boxing Association (IPBA), the president of which, Shahe Ali promises yet another league later this year, albeit one “on par with the IPL, to sell out the JLN and Indira Gandhi stadiums.” They sure have their task cut out, seeing how the Facebook page is still inviting donations. The group claims that it has also successfully invited Evander Holyfield to India to promote their league on Twitter, but have nothing more than the heavyweight legend’s retweets to cite.

Shekhawat, Ali and the elder Goyat were responsible for one of India’s earliest forays into professional boxing — a fight night in a Delhi mall two years back which launched Neeraj’s pro career. However, the infighting and the branching out stunted the growth of the sport. So what’s the solution?

“I would prefer a professional body set up under the federation,” says Kowli. “When the national federation runs pro boxing, the boxers will have more reason to be secure and in safe hands. The BFI is already working on a professional boxing programme of our own, to streamline everything. It’s in the final stages.”

Exactly what BFI plans to do with professional boxing remains a mystery. Meanwhile, some boxers who won laurels as amateurs, be it a national championship (Kuldeep Singh) or a Commonwealth Games bronze medal (Amandeep Singh), have taken the plunge and turned pro without waiting for BFI to clarify its intentions. Like the younger Goyat, Kuldeep and Amandeep also ran into trouble with the Railways for taking part in the SBL.

CHARACTER-BUILDING

Another odd stacked against pro boxing in India is that it is trying to take off when the sport has cooled off globally. The trash-talking draws of yesteryear are now few and far between. The ones who do crop up are plucked by MMA promotions.

Closer home, Vijender remains the only semblance of a draw. Neerav Tomar — head of IOS Boxing Promotions that has organised Vijender’s three home fights — admits that they need to look beyond the sole flag-bearer.

“Everything is on Vijender’s shoulders. Right now, it is just his stardom and success that we are capitalising on. At least till the time we find a new star,” says Tomar, adding that the 31-year-old is “still five or six fights away from a world title”.

Former light-welterweight world champion and Athens silver-medallist Amir Khan offers a more candid assessment.

“Vijender has not made a big noise,” the 30-year-old told The Indian Express. “He hasn’t won a major title, or even half a major title, which will make people regard him as a good fighter.”

The PR-driven, sanitised machine around Vijender hasn’t helped him develop an outlandish persona either, and the boxer himself has gone on record saying that “my conscience doesn’t allow me to talk trash.”

An exciting breakout is the need of the hour, and Brigadier Raja believes it could be a woman, citing 2014 CWG bronze medallist Sarita Devi as an example. Earlier this year, in front of a raucous crowd in her hometown Imphal, Sarita pummeled Hungarian Zsofia Bedo in her pro debut, only to return to the amateur fold soon after.

“I’m telling you, what we saw that night, she could be a world champion in 6-12 months. Same for Pinki Jangra. Unfortunately, I brought them here but couldn’t get further fights. So I talked to Mr Ajay Singh and told him that these girls are still the best in the country. I told him that let them be in the fray for the upcoming Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. And once they’re done, with your permission, they can return to pro boxing.”

Both Sarita and Pinki had to submit letters of apology to the federation, but Raja believes it was for the better. “I would also give priority to amateur boxing. Asian Games, Olympics is something special.”

Neeraj Goyat, however, wants to make his mark as a professional boxer. He came close too. The 25-year-old took part in AIBA’s Olympic qualifiers in Venezuela last year but fell one win short of booking a Rio berth.

“Amateur is important as you have to go to the nursery class to get to a college,” says Goyat, who defended his WBC-ABC welterweight title on Saturday. “But nobody remembers amateur boxers. Mike Tyson is famous because he was professional. Muhammad Ali wasn’t popular because of his Olympic medal. Boxing ka naam professionals ki wajah se hi chalta hai.”

Assad regime shelling kills 3 in truce zone near Damascus: International human rights monitor,"A civil defense member carries a dead child in a site hit by what activists said were airstrikes carried out by the Russian air force in the rebel-controlled area of Maaret al-Numan town in Idlib province, Syria. (Source: Reuters) A civil defense member carries a dead child in a site hit by what activists said were airstrikes carried out by the Russian air force in the rebel-controlled area of Maaret al-Numan town in Idlib province, Syria. (Source: Reuters)

Government bombardment killed three civilians on Thursday in a ceasefire zone near Syria’s capital, a monitor said, in the second day of deadly shelling on the rebel area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and local residents also reported violations in a second “de-escalation zone” in the central province of Homs.

The areas – in addition to a third ceasefire zone in the south – were announced in recent weeks by Syrian government ally Russia. But on Thursday, government bombardment on the zone near Damascus killed three civilians and wounded seven more. “The shelling hit the town of Hammuriyeh early today, killing a woman, a man, and a child,” said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.

The attack came a day after government shelling killed five civilians and wounded 10 more in the nearby town of Kfar Batna, the British-based Observatory said. Air strikes have also pummelled rebel-held parts of the Jobar district of Damascus and the adjacent district of Ain Tarma.

Further south, one man was killed in Syrian government air strikes in the northern parts of Homs province, according to the Observatory and a resident.

The raids were the first since the ceasefire in Homs was announced one week ago. “Four air strikes hit Al-Houla today,” resident Abbas Abu Osama told AFP, adding that four other surrounding towns were hit with one air strike each.

“We have our first casualty, killed in an air strike in Tal Dahab,” he said.

Abdel Rahman confirmed that a man was killed in a raid but could not specify whether he was a rebel fighter or civilian.

Under a plan hammered out in May between Russia, Turkey and Iran at peace talks in Kazakhstan, four “de-escalation zones” were to be established across swathes of Syria.

Last month, Moscow announced the establishment of the first two zones in southern Syria and in the rebel stronghold of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus.

The zone in Homs province was announced on August 3. The fourth zone, in northwestern Idlib province, has yet to be implemented.

Picture taken January 25, 2014. (Source: REUTERS)

German-born nun Ruth Pfau, who devoted her life to eradicating leprosy in Pakistan, died on Thursday in the southern city of Karachi, a hospital official said. She was 87. Widely known as Pakistan’s Mother Teresa, Pfau was eulogised by the prime minister and army chief for her contributions towards freeing the country of a contagious disease that can cause disfigurement. “Pfau may have been born in Germany, her heart was always in Pakistan,” Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said in a statement.

Born in 1929, Dr Ruth Katharina Martha Pfau had been living in Pakistan since 1960. She founded the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi, Pakistan’s first hospital dedicated to treating the disease, and opened branches across the country.

“It was due to her endless struggle that Pakistan defeated leprosy,” German Consulate Karachi posted on Facebook.

In 1996, the World Health Organisation declared that leprosy had been controlled in Pakistan, which led Pfau to the more challenging task of eliminating the disease. Last year, the number of patients under treatment for leprosy fell to 531 from 19,398 in the 1980s, the Dawn newspaper said.

Gujarat sets up 1555-hectare ‘Japanese Industrial Park’ ahead of Shinzo Abe visit,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be visiting India in September. (AP Photo) Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be visiting India in September. (AP Photo)

Ahead of the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s scheduled visit to India in September, Gujarat government is setting up a brand new “Japanese Industrial Park” on the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) passing through Ahmedabad, that is spread on 1555 hectare and is 15 times bigger in size compared to an existing one.

“A new Japanese Park will come up at Khoraj near Sanand. This is the second such park that we are setting up for the Japanese in the state,” said MK Das, Principal Secretary, Industries and Mines Department, Government of Gujarat. The state government is expected to spend over Rs 400 crore in building the basic infrastructure in this park. The Indian Express had reported earlier that the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) had acquired over 1000 hectares of land in a record 60 days in 2013, where a phenomenal Rs 1700 crore was paid out as compensation to over 400 farmers for the land acquired about six kilometers near Sanand.

“The existing exclusive “Japanese Industrial Park” near Mandal in Ahmedabad district has saturated and a need for a new one has risen,” Das said. The existing park located about 90 kilometers away from Khoraj in the same district is built over 100 hectares and operates on a unique plug-and-play model. It currently has about 10-12 Japanese MSME units.

The current Japanese investment in Gujarat is close of USD one billion and is expected to reach USD three billion by 2020. There are over 80 Japanese companies in the state including the likes of Maruti Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Nippon, Hitachi, Panasonic and others, say state government officials.

The push for a second exclusive Japanese Industrial Park at Khoraj in Ahmedabad district comes after a delegation from the Gujarat government visited four cities in Japan scouting for investments in July 2017. During this visit, Gujarat government had not only hard-sold the new industrial park that it is planning to build exclusively for Japanese companies, but had also inked deals with at least four Japanese companies who will set up their business in Gujarat in the near future. “The details of this will be made public, during Japanese PM’s visit,” the official said adding that Abe will also visit Gujarat along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The new Japanese Industrial Park is being built in close coordination with the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) which is also be setting up an office in Ahmedabad which will be as big as the one in Delhi. “This new JETRO office in Ahmedabad will help them handle and support trade between the two nations,” Das said.

The state-government arm, Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), has already floated tenders to appoint a master consultant for detailed project planning, and preparation of a Detailed Project Report. It has also initiated work on building basic infrastructure including roads, water pipelines and street lights. This industrial park will 969 hectares reserved for industrial development, 227 hectares for roads and transportation, 136 hectares of green spaces and 141 hectares of residential zone.

Johannes Vetter’s huge throw sets up German javelin showdown,"Johannes Vetter’s leading throw was almost five metres longer than the next best effort of Czech Petr Frydrych. (Source: Reuters) Johannes Vetter’s leading throw was almost five metres longer than the next best effort of Czech Petr Frydrych. (Source: Reuters)

Germany’s Johannes Vetter and Thomas Rohler will take their burgeoning javelin rivalry into a potentially riveting final at the World Athletics Championships after achieving the automatic qualifying mark on Thursday.

Yet the pair, who have this season both produced throws that have only ever been bettered by the great Czech Jan Zelezny, surpassed the 83 metres qualifying standard in contrasting style.

Vetter, who moved to second on the all-time list last month with a 94.44 metres effort in Lucerne, produced another fine throw of 91.20 metres at the first attempt to power into Saturday’s final as the top qualifier.

Olympic champion Rohler, in the second group, had to work harder, failing to make it with his first throw (80.88m) before his second effort cleared the 83m mark by 87 centimetres to make him the eighth best qualifier.

With Andreas Hoffman also making the final as fifth best qualifier (85.62m), Vetter, whose leading throw was almost five metres longer than the next best effort of Czech Petr Frydrych (86.22m), declared: “I am dreaming of three medals for Germany.”

"No more steeplechase for me, says former champion Ezekiel Kemboi","Ezekiel Kemboi trailing in men’s 3,000m steeplechase. (Source: AP) Ezekiel Kemboi trailing in men’s 3,000m steeplechase. (Source: AP)

Kenya’s four-time world champion Ezekiel Kemboi said Tuesday’s world championship final where he finished 11th would be his last outing in the 3,000 metres steeplechase.

Although he has previously backtracked on declarations to quit the event that he has dominated for more than a decade, Kemboi, 35, insisted that this time he meant it.

“This was my last steeplechase race. You will never see me run the race again,” said the man who had won the previous four world titles and finished second in the three before that.

“I am launching my road race career in two weeks with a 10km road race, a half marathon in December and a full marathon in April next year.

Kemboi was in contention until the final lap but could not respond when compatriot and Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto accelerated and went on to win in eight minutes, 14.12 seconds.

Moroccan Soufiane Elbakkali took silver and American Evan Jager bronze as Kemboi went backwards and recorded his worst finish in a major steeplechase.

“I am not disappointed. Contrary to many peoples’ opinion, I am happy to be here in London for my eighth “World Championships,” he said.

“Not many athletes are blessed with such staying power – it has been a long career. Kipruto was less than 10-years-old when I won my first major title.”

Although Kipruto’s victory maintained Kenya’s astonishing dominance of the gruelling event, Kemboi said it was not guaranteed to continue.

“You can no longer say this is a Kenyan race. Probably we will need new coaching techniques and tactics, we need to modify our coaching to return to where we were,” he said.

Kemboi won his first major steeplechase medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, where he took silver, and went on to take Olympic gold in 2004 and 2012.

Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane left with dilemma after Super Cup success,"Reverting to 4-3-3 might keep Zidane’s stars happy, but it could have negative consequences for the team. (Source: Reuters) Reverting to 4-3-3 might keep Zidane’s stars happy, but it could have negative consequences for the team. (Source: Reuters)

Real Madrid dominated Manchester United for large periods of the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday before winning 2-1, confirming their position as the best team in Europe. Now Madrid’s Zinedine Zidane faces a dilemma.

Madrid have won consecutive Champions League trophies, retaining the cup in June with a victory over Juventus. They took the Spanish league title, too, powering over the line as Zidane switched to a 4-4-2 from a 4-3-3 after Gareth Bale’s injury.

Zidane’s problem is whether to stick with the 4-4-2 for the new season, or revert to the 4-3-3.

In the 4-4-2, Isco was picked at the tip of the midfield diamond. He linked perfectly with Cristiano Ronaldo, who slipped into a No. 9 role with ease after years on the left wing.

The formation suited Madrid’s strengths, and Zidane use it again against Manchester United, even though Ronaldo was benched, since he had only recently returned to training after an extended summer break.

Bale played up front, alongside Karim Benzema, and he linked nicely with Isco, too. The Welsh winger crashed a shot against the crossbar and then created the winning Madrid goal, playing a one-two with Isco, which put the playmaker through to curl a strike past David de Gea.

Ronaldo appeared from the bench in the second half, and Zidane acknowledged that the striker was finding his fitness and may be in contention to start against Barcelona on Sunday in the Spanish Super Cup.

“He’s only been training with us for three days, but he’s well and thinking about Sunday’s game,” Zidane said.

But with the rise of Isco, the vaunted strike-line of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano no longer appears to be Madrid’s best option. Isco’s quality is undeniable, and he is a fan favourite, too.

“His game and goal were very good,” Zidane said after the Super Cup. “I’m very happy with him because he grows more and more. He’s got art.” said Zidane

However, Isco has the lowest profile, making him the easiest for Zidane to bench. Bale and Ronaldo are two of the most expensive signings of all time, and both Zidane and club president Florentino Perez are particularly fond of Benzema.

Reverting to 4-3-3 might keep his stars happy, but it could have negative consequences for the team, giving Zidane a problem to solve. It is a problem other coaches would love to have, but a problem nonetheless.

Maharashtra: PAC slams govt for laxity in police modernisation,"The committee has also raised objections regarding delays in releasing funds for the training and recruitment of police security guards. (File – Express photo by Santosh Parab) The committee has also raised objections regarding delays in releasing funds for the training and recruitment of police security guards. (File – Express photo by Santosh Parab)

Taking a strict view of the laxity on the part of consecutive state governments towards the modernisation of the police force, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the state legislature, in a report, has demanded action against those responsible. The committee’s report, placed before the legislature on Thursday, has also sharply criticised the office of Maharashtra’s Director General of Police (DGP), accusing it of “not being serious about the state’s internal security”.

The committee found that there was a significant delay in the procurement of vehicles and weapons for the police. “There was a delay in the procurement process even after 26/11. The procurement of vehicles and weapons is a sensitive issue on the internal security front, and this should have been taken up on priority basis. But the committee feels that the office of the DGP is not handling it with all seriousness,” the committee’s report stated.

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had previously slammed the state government for non-utilisation of the annual funds budgeted for the police modernisation in a time-bound manner. This, it ruled, had adversely impacted the training, mobility, communication and the machinery upgrade in the force.

The legislative committee has also objected to the non-utilisation of funds sanctioned for police housing and police buildings. Blaming the home department’s lack of preparedness and planning for the lapse, the PAC has observed that the money wasn’t spent as planned despite all approvals being in place. It has sought action against the officials responsible.

The committee has also backed the CAG’s objection that the programme for the improvement of forensic facilities had been delayed. It has demanded setting up of more forensic labs in the state and the modernisation of existing facilities on a priority basis.

The committee has also objected to low allowances being paid to home guards, and civil protection forces, while demanding that the year-round permanent work be given to home guards to sustain their families. The committee has also raised objections regarding delays in releasing funds for the training and recruitment of police security guards.

Related News Governor Ram Naik asks UP CM to sack technical varsity registrar

In his first major crackdown on government officers, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered the suspension of 11 officers and transfer of seven others in Maharajganj district. Sources said he acted against these officers, on charges of dereliction of duty, after receiving feedback from local BJP leaders, members of the Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV), and the general public.

According to a press release issued by the state government, Adityanath directed for suspension of Puranderpur police station officer (SO) Vinod Kumar Rao, SO of Pharenda police station Chandresh Yadav, SDMs Vikram Singh and Girish Chandra Srivastava, BDO Sanjay Srivastava, account officer in basic education department Ravi Singh, district agriculture officer Mohammad Mujammil, PWD executive engineer V N Ojha and casualty medical officer in the district hospital Dr Shailesh Kumar Singh.

Dr Shailesh Kumar Singh was allegedly suspended because he was absent from duty for a long time without giving any information to higher authorities, and for pursuing a private practice, sources said. The CM also ordered for suspension of Dr Arshad Jamal and Dr B N Vajpayee, both posted in the chief medical office, for dereliction of duty.

Adityanath has also ordered for transfer of seven officers including district supply officer Amit Tiwari, NRLM deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Maurya, programme implementation officer in-charge Gayatri Devi, additional mukhya adhikari Gyanendra Kumar Singh, Paniyara SO Sudhir Kumar Singh, Shyamdeurwa SO Srikant Rai and Kothibhar SO Ramakant Yadav.

Sources said the CM issued these orders during a meeting with district administration officials, local MLAs and MP in Maharajganj. Sources further said that a BJP MLA had made a complaint against repeated postings of PWD executive engineer V N Ojha in the same district for a long time. The CM also said it was a serious matter that improvement in law and order on ground was not according to the budget being spent on it.

He further said that police staff in towns bordering Nepal had been involved in extortion and there were also reports of misbehavior with tourists, which was “maligning” the image of the state. He directed the IG and circle officers to keep vigil on bordering areas and take action against staff involved in illegal acts. Prior to this, Adityanath had held a separate meeting with BJP MLAs, HYV members and local party district office bearers. Sources said that these leaders had complained that various officers in the districts were not redressing problems of the general public even after their recommendations.

(Representational image) The youth, Jitendra Kumar, lived with his family and worked at a factory. “He was friends with the two juveniles and Rahul, 19. (Representational image)

Three persons, including two juveniles, allegedly killed their 19-year-old friend in Rohini district’s Shahbad Dairy area after he complained to the family of one of the accused that they took drugs. Police said while two have been apprehended, one of the juveniles is absconding. The youth, Jitendra Kumar, lived with his family and worked at a factory. “He was friends with the two juveniles and Rahul, 19. They all lived in the same locality. Kumar and Rahul were childhood friends,” a police officer said.

The investigation revealed that Kumar used to meet them every fortnight. The last time they met, Rahul and the other two were taking drugs and also offered it to him. “Kumar tried to stop them but when they refused to listen, he left. He later informed Rahul’s parents. Rahul, who was scolded by his parents, found out that Kumar had informed them,” the officer added.

Rahul and the two juveniles decided to teach Kumar a lesson.

“On August 8, they asked Kumar to meet them. When he arrived, Rahul whipped out a knife and stabbed Kumar as the other two held him down. They fled, leaving him in a pool of blood,” an officer said, adding that locals informed police about the incident. Kumar was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Doctors said he died of excessive bleeding.

An FIR has been registered under IPC Section 302 in the matter. “Several police teams were formed under the supervision of ACP Saurabh Chandra. During spot visits, one of the teams came to know that Kumar was last seen with Rahul. Police detained Rahul, following which he confessed to the crime. Later, one juvenile, who is 17 years and eleven months old, was also apprehended. He was sent to a correctional home after he was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board,” the officer added.

The 19-day Monsoon Session of Parliament concludes today. In this short session, both Houses were expected to pass more than 25 Bills on a range of subjects. The items on the government’s priority list were four Bills to replace Ordinances promulgated by the President during the inter-session period. Three of these were related to the Goods and Services Tax regime; one was on the stressed assets of banks. Parliament, however, had limited time to scrutinise the government’s legislative agenda, and to discuss significant national issues.

Disruptions of the proceedings reduced the time available for deliberation. Both Houses tried to make up for lost time by sitting beyond their scheduled hours, but still fell short. Lok Sabha worked for approximately 70% of its scheduled time, and Rajya Sabha for about 73%. The available time was also reduced due to the adjournment of both Houses in memory of sitting members who had passed away. Lok Sabha did not take up any business on two days (in memory of Vinod Khanna and Sanwar Lal Jat); Rajya Sabha did not function on the first day of the session as a mark of respect to Anil Madhav Dave, Minister of State for Environment, who passed away in May.

Lok Sabha spent 28 hours, Rajya Sabha 22 hours, discussing Bills. The government’s legislative agenda sailed smoothly through Lok Sabha. Two Bills extending the GST regime to Jammu and Kashmir were among the 13 that were passed. The Lower House also passed a Bill giving the country’s 20 IIMs the status of institutes of national importance and the power to award degrees.

Among the Bills that witnessed a spirited debate in both Houses was the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, an attempt by the government to address the issue of rising corporate loan defaults. The Bill authorises the Reserve Bank of India to give directions to banks on recovering these loans. During the debate, MPs questioned the rationale of having RBI intervene in the day-to-day working of banks. Rajya Sabha passed the Bill on Wednesday.

In all, however, only seven Bills were approved by the Upper House. The government was also unable to secure the passage of a key clause in The Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill, which gives the National Commission on Backward Classes (NCBC) constitutional status. As reported by this newspaper, the main clause of the Bill which dealt with the composition of the NCBC, had to be dropped due to the absence of enough ruling party members in the Upper House.

National issues also resonated in Parliament. Approximately 55 hours were devoted to discussing the agrarian crisis, suicides by farmers, floods, mob violence, lynching, and atrocities on Dalits and minorities in both Houses. Rajya Sabha also discussed for more than five hours the country’s foreign policy and strategic ties with its neighbours. Question Hour was suspended in both Houses to discuss the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement. Both Houses passed a resolution pledging the building of a better India. The Session has not been free from controversy. The Speaker suspended five MPs for persistently and wilfully obstructing the proceedings of Lok Sabha.

Early on in the session, Rajya Sabha had to be adjourned because of lack of quorum in the House. On Wednesday, the government introduced the Code on Wages Bill at short notice and referred it to a Joint Committee of both Houses. This prompted protests from MPs who complained that they did not get the time to study the Bill, and that the reference to a Joint Committee would bypass scrutiny of the Bill by the Parliamentary Committee on Finance.

As the Monsoon Session ends and Parliament heads into an extended recess, the key takeaway remains slow legislative activity: of the 25 Bills listed, only nine could be passed by both Houses.

Chicago sues over sanctuary city threat; Attorney General Jeff Sessions fires back,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions (AP Photo) Attorney General Jeff Sessions (AP Photo)

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has taken his fight against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies to court, with Chicago becoming one of the first cities Monday to sue over what many U.S. cities argue are illegal bids to withhold public safety grants from so-called sanctuary cities. Hours later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions hit back at Chicago, saying the Trump administration “will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety.”

“So it’s this simple: Comply with the law or forego taxpayer dollars,” he said in a toughly worded statement. A 46-page lawsuit, which names Sessions, was filed earlier Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago a day after Emanuel announced the litigation and said the city won’t “be blackmailed” into changing its values as a city welcoming of immigrants.

It’s the latest round in a battle pitting several U.S. cities against the Trump administration. The cities have opted to limit cooperation with government enforcement of immigration law while federal officials threaten to withhold funding if those cities don’t comply. While estimates vary, there are thought to be about 300 jurisdictions including cities and counties with sanctuary-like policies. Among the other bigger U.S. cities with such policies are New York and Philadelphia.

A first order of business now that Chicago’s suit has been filed will be to ask a judge to put a freeze on the policy as the civil case plays out, said Edward Siskel, the head of City Hall’s legal department. That request for a preliminary injunction could be made within days. Chicago has received the grant funds at the heart of the lawsuit since 2005. It spent $33 million in grants to buy nearly 1,000 police cars in that 12-year period; it got $2.3 million last year. In addition to cars, funds were also used for radios and SWAT equipment.

While the grant money amounts to a fraction of Chicago’s public safety budget, Emanuel has said fighting the government now could help prevent the withholding of more money later. He described the Trump measures so far as just “the camel’s nose under the tent.” In his Monday statement, Sessions said Chicago stood out in its “open hostility” to enforcing immigration laws.

“To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system,” he said. Chicago’s suit focuses on new conditions set by Sessions for cities to qualify for grant money. They include the sharing immigration-status records with federal agencies, providing 48-hours notice of a detainee’s release if immigration violations are suspected and giving federal agents unfettered access to jails.

“The government,” the lawsuit says, can’t “unilaterally” set new conditions that weren’t approved by Congress “and that would federalize local jails and police stations, mandate warrantless detentions in order to investigate for federal civil infractions, sow fear in local immigrant communities, and ultimately make the people of Chicago less safe.” Chicago’s sanctuary policies date back to the mid-1980s and successive city councils have confirmed or expanded the protections.

The city prohibits police from providing federal Immigration and Customs officials access to people in police custody, unless they are wanted on a criminal warrant or have serious criminal convictions. Local police are also barred from allowing ICE agents to use their facilities for interviews or investigations and from responding to ICE inquiries or talking to ICE officials about a person’s custody status or release date.

City authorities say the policies help encourage residents of the immigrant community to inform police when they are victims of crimes. “If Chicago submits to the Department’s demands, it will forfeit decades’ worth of trust and goodwill that its police force has built in the communities it serves,” the new lawsuit argues. “And as those decades of experience show, that kind of trust, once lost, is lost forever.”

Sessions alluded to arguments also made by Trump that enforcing immigration laws can reduce crime. He calls Chicago’s “hostility” to such laws especially “astounding” given that numbers of homicides in the city in 2016 outpaced the numbers in New York and Los Angeles. “The city’s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve,” Sessions said. He also characterized Emanuel as complaining it would have to reorder longstanding policies to conform.

“But that’s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that rollback the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city,” Sessions said. The city’s lawsuit says the Trump administration’s contention that more lenient immigration policies contribute to crime “is divorced from reality.”

In March, the Justice Department sent letters to officials in California and major cities including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans, all places the Justice Department’s inspector general has identified as limiting the information local law enforcement can provide to federal immigration authorities about those in their custody.

The department warned that the administration will punish communities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally. But some of the localities remained defiant, despite risking the loss of funds that police agencies use to pay for everything from body cameras to bulletproof vests.

"Israel military says helicopter crashes, killing 1 pilot","Representational Image/ Reuters Representational Image/ Reuters

The Israeli military says a combat helicopter has crashed in a training accident, killing one pilot and critically injuring another. The military said early Tuesday that the accident happened at an air force base in southern Israel and that an investigation has been launched. Pending its result, the air force command has ordered that all Israeli combat helicopters be grounded.

The military identified the pilot killed as Major David Zohar, a 43-year-old reserve pilot. A second officer was evacuated to a hospital after the craft crashed at Ramon air force base. Israeli media said the Apache helicopter suffered a technical malfunction late Monday and crashed near the base’s landing pad.

"73,000 co-op housing societies ignore HC directive on holding polls","Cooperative housing societies form the bulk of cooperative bodies in the state. Cooperative housing societies form the bulk of cooperative bodies in the state.

In a landmark judgment, the Bombay High Court had mandated direct elections in cooperative bodies, including cooperative housing societies, in a bid to usher in transparency in their functioning. Of the approximately 98,000 housing societies in the state that are supposed to hold elections, only 25,000 have done so, while the rest have failed to do so. Cooperative housing societies form the bulk of cooperative bodies in the state. More than 60 per cent of these societies are located in Mumbai and Pune.

As per the Election Rules of the State Cooperative Election Authority, the onus is on the housing societies to notify the Authority, and to hold elections once the five-year term of the executive body gets over. Following the request by the housing society, the Authority nominates an observer, who conducts the election. Election expenses are borne by the society and normally amount to around Rs 7,000.

According to officials of the Authority, most housing societies avoid conducting the elections. District Deputy Registrars (DDRs), who have to look after more than 5000-6,000 cooperative societies of all types, usually can’t keep track of the expiry of terms of the executive bodies. “In case the term of the executive body expires, any decision by it will be deemed illegal and the executive committee members can be held responsible,” said an officer of the Authority.

Lack of both awareness and interest by members of the cooperative society play a role in the issue. Advocate Suresh Doddamani, vice-chairman of the Pune District Housing Federation Limited, admitted that elections were often not held. “We have sent out notices… yet, people are not interested in taking part in the election process,” he said.

Doddamani warned that societies which fail to hold elections were going to run into legal troubles in the future. Activist Vivek Velankar said the elections were not considered a priority due to a lack of awareness, as well as apathy on part of the society members. Velankar said it was the duty of the Authority to raise awareness about the legal necessity of holding such elections in cooperative housing societies.

Attack on UN office in Colombia injures police officer,"Cauca police general Edgar Rodriguez said the ELN was to blame. (Representational image) Cauca police general Edgar Rodriguez said the ELN was to blame. (Representational image)

A police officer was injured in an attack on a UN mission monitoring the disarming of FARC rebels in Colombia as part of the group’s peace deal with the government, authorities said. Assailants attacked the location where the FARC rebel group had a weapons stash in the southwestern town of Caloto, in Cauca department, according to police, who said a splinter group of the Marxist rebels or the smaller National Liberation Army (ELN) could have been behind the violence.

But Cauca police general Edgar Rodriguez said the ELN was to blame. The ELN is currently the only group fighting the Colombian government, though it is seeking to negotiate its own peace deal. The United Nations said in a statement that a team of their observers, national police and former FARC rebels were ambushed in Caloto.

The disarmament, mainly in June, by the roughly 7,000 members of Colombia’s biggest rebel group under the 2016 peace accord brought a halt to the war. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for reaching the historic deal with the FARC. It was signed last November.

The conflict left a quarter of a million Colombians dead, about 60,000 unaccounted for and seven million displaced. The FARC was born in May 1964 from a peasants’ revolt. Its ranks were made up mostly of country dwellers who rallied behind the group’s Marxist-Leninist ideology, with land reform its focus.

Them becomes us: Maria Qamar’s Hatecopy spurs desi sarcasm in hilarious cartoons,"The hate is real: Artwork from Maria Qamar’s Hatecopy. The hate is real: Artwork from Maria Qamar’s Hatecopy.

When Maria Qamar moved to Canada from Pakistan as a nine-year-old in 2000, the transition was challenging. At her elementary school, she was picked on for her skin colour, her accent, and the smelly food in her lunchbox. While most kids would resort to writing a journal to deal with their feelings, Qamar turned to art – making comic strips in her sketchbook. “I would draw out what happened that day, and give it a happy ending. In real life, I got an egg thrown on my head; in my world, I was getting revenge or having the last laugh,” she says.

Today, Qamar, 26, is known as the artist of Hatecopy — whose Lichtenstein-style posts on desi oddities have racked up over one lakh followers on Instagram and found fans in Mindy Kaling and Lena Dunham. The central characters in Hatecopy are aunties — the judgmental tribe offering unsolicited advice, and the artwork hilariously depicts the struggles of south Asian immigrants in the west. In one, a wife tells her husband that their daughter didn’t pick up the phone and so, is obviously dead. In another, a shocked mother discovers that her “beti is an artist” — her husband says it’s her fault. This one is rather personal.

Despite her talent, Qamar was not allowed to pursue a career in the arts, with her mother even ripping off her drawings from her bedroom wall at one point. She took up advertising in college, and later, got a job as a copywriter. “It was a very sterile environment, with no real room for creativity. I would write jingles I thought sounded punny or quirky and, after 20 rounds of revisions, it would end up as something I didn’t even conceptualise… the work of 20 white dudes in suits,” she says.

After she was laid off from her copywriting job in early 2015, she started working on her art in between looking for other corporate jobs. She drew her first aunty, saying “I burned the rotis”, and put it on Instagram. “Little by little, it became a body of work.” Instagram offered the safe space Maria needed to reclaim her desiness.“The post about throwing a kurta over a crop top to get out of the house is so real. At school, there’d be girls coming in hijabs and taking them off to do their hair and make-up in the washroom. Many would have mini skirts underneath sweatpants. A lot of the humour is rooted in trauma… girls getting scrutinised for their choices,” says Qamar.

Maria Qamar. Maria Qamar.

Hatecopy offers a hyperbolic commentary on subjects like marriage and gender roles, and it also explores ignorance and cultural appropriation. “When I was bullied, I was often called a Paki dot. As a kid, I didn’t even know what that meant until I realised they were referring to the bindi, which is actually common to Indians, Sri Lankans and even Bangladeshis. It was annoying and I know girls who stopped wearing it,” she says, “Looking back, it’s like they tried to erase a part of our culture by beating us up over something they now make money off and wear at Coachella. They now market it as exotic jewels to wear at outdoor festivals. Why don’t you market it as a Paki dot, because that’s what you coined it?” she asks, also pointing to the appropriation of Indian food: “You now have packaged curries that make it easier for white people to make ‘korma sauce’ at home. The same thing we were shamed for is now a thing in your kitchen cabinet.”

Now, the Toronto-based artist is retailing Hatecopy merchandise, has had several exhibitions and is set to come out with an illustrated book, Trust No Aunty, next month. “It’s a collection of short interactions with different kinds of aunties, like the weight-watcher aunty and the online-stalker aunty, and the different ways of dealing with them,” she says.

While Instagram made her famous, Qamar hopes to do bigger exhibits, seeking greater representation for south Asians at mainstream gallery spaces. “It’s difficult to explain to a desi family why a career in the arts is realistic because they can go into a gallery and say, ‘where are we?’. It’s the fault of the art community as well, it’s not really a domain where people of colour are featured that often, whether it’s the Museum of Modern Art in New York or Louvre in Paris. If my work’s on display, other desi girls can show it to their families and explain that it can be a lucrative business.”

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Haryana Steelers finally open their account,"So far into the season, Haryana Steelers have managed to put up all-round performances. (Source: Pro Kabaddi) So far into the season, Haryana Steelers have managed to put up all-round performances. (Source: Pro Kabaddi)

The Haryana Steelers have been an unlucky lot. They lost their first match against U Mumba by just a point. Their second match against Gujarat Fortunegiants remains the only draw and the most thrilling clash of the season thus far. In both those matches, they showed their ability to fight back from almost hopeless situations. Their moment of reckoning finally came when they defeated faced Gujarat once again and won 20-32. “We needed this win,” said coach Rambir Khokhar in an interaction with the media after the match, “We wanted to win the first two matches and came very close. But today the boys have shown what we can do.”

That Haryana Steelers had a reliable defensive setup, was known to everyone. But, so far into the season, Haryana have managed to put up all-round performances. Surender Nada and Mohit Chillar have been solid in defence and it has been 19-year-old Vikash Khandola who has led from the front in attack. On Tuesday, he scored six points for Haryana. Has he got the potential to become the best in the league? “Not just the league,” said Khokhar, “In the next Asian Games he will show that he is one of the best raiders in the country.”

The first half was a continuation of the match that the two sides played in Hyderabad. Haryana dominated the first few minutes but Gujarat clawed their way back in. If Vikash Khandola was the star of the match for Haryana, Sachin was Gujarat’s man in the first half. He scored five of the six points that Gujarat got in the first 13 minutes of the match. Much of Haryana’s points, on the other hand, came from their tackles, possibly a reason why their coach branded it as the best in the league after the match. “Our defence was brilliant today. We had planned that the two corners need to be as effective as possible. Mohit (Chillar) and Surender (Nada) led well today.” Chillar and Nada’s brilliance was on display when Haryana Steelers started pulling away towards the end of the first half. Sukesh Hegde was raiding for Gujarat, Chillar and Nada were at the two corners. As soon as he saw the chance, Chillar bent his head and took on a charging Sukesh Hegde, Nada clamped in from behind and Hegde was out, a Super Tackle went the Steelers’ way. At half time, Haryana were leading 9-13.

The second half turned out to be a more one sided affair. Nada and Chillar kept the defence tight while raiders such as Khandola and Surjeet Singh started collecting points from the other end. With 11 minutes left, the first all out of the game was inflicted on Gujarat Fortune Giants. Just three minutes later, Gujarat’s Mahender Rajput got a Super Raid. Event that, though was not enough to prevent them from slipping into an eight-point defeat.

UP govt asks madrasas to host cultural events on Independence Day,"At present, around 8,000 madrasas in UP are recognised by the Parishad. Among these, 560 are fully aided by the state. (Representational photo) At present, around 8,000 madrasas in UP are recognised by the Parishad. Among these, 560 are fully aided by the state. (Representational photo)

The Yogi Adityanath government has asked madrasas affiliated to the Uttar Pradesh Madarsa Shiksha Parishad to pay tribute to freedom fighters and organise cultural programmes on August 15. While in the past, madrasas were directed to hoist the National Flag and recite the National Anthem, this is reportedly the first time that they have been asked to hold cultural programmes on Independence Day.

Moreover, the circular issued by UP Madarsa Shiksha Parishad to district minority welfare officers has also stated that along with photographs, videos be shot of the programmes. The officers would have to get the videos shot at all madrasas and keep with them.

At present, around 8,000 madrasas in UP are recognised by the Parishad. Among these, 560 are fully aided by the state.

According to the circular, on Independence Day, flag hoisting and recitation of the National Anthem will be take place at 8 am. Following this, tribute will be paid to the martyrs of the freedom struggle. Also, students will sing songs on nationalism and be told about the history of August 15 and the freedom fighters. Further, cultural programmes will be organised on the theme of national unity, along with sports activities. Sweets will be distributed at the end of the session.

The circular asks minority welfare officers to direct all madrasas to ensure that Independence Day is celebrated with zeal and that all the programmes mentioned above are organised.

The Parishad, in the circular, has also sent the text of the National Anthem in both Hindi and Urdu. Sources said that in the past, some madrasas had argued that their students know only Urdu and were not fluent in Hindi.

Sources in minority welfare department said that events would have to be videographed, as there had been allegations in the past that some madrasas had not hoisted the National Flag on Independence Day.

A district minority officer said: “Directives for hoisting the National Flag and reciting the National Anthem had been issued to madrasas earlier as well. But this is the first time when madrasas have been directed to pay tribute to freedom fighters and organise cultural programmes on the theme of national unity. Only photography had been done in the past, videography will be done for the first time this Independence Day. These videos will be kept as an evidence to prove that all programmes were organised in madrasas as per the directives of the state government.”

When contacted, Minority Welfare Minister Laxmi Narain Chaudhary said: “The directives have been issued because recognised madrasas, which get grants from the state government, are supposed to celebrate all national festivals, including Independence Day. Through cultural programmes, students of the modern generation will be made aware about the history of freedom movement and its martyrs.”

“Videography will be done so that videos of the best programmes could be played in madrasas and students could take inspiration from them… The best cultural programmes will be replicated in other madrasas in the future,” he added.

UK ready to pay 40 billion euro Brexit divorce bill: Report,"Britain is open to paying up to 40 billion euros ($ 47.1 billion) towards a so-called Brexit divorce bill to the European Union as long as a future UK-EU trade deal can be secured, a media report said today. Three separate sources within the UK civil service and government with knowledge of the UK’s Brexit negotiating strategy have confirmed the figure, dismissing previous reports that British Prime Minister Theresa May would agree to a 50-billion-pound bill as “too high”.

According to the report published in ‘The Sunday Telegraph’, the UK government negotiators for Britain’s exit from the European Union have been able to ascertain that the 27-member EU’s actual opening position is around 60 billion euros – not 100 billion euros as previously suggested.

“The 27 say they can’t knock off the bits of their ‘bill’ until the very end – but politically we can’t move on money until the 27 member states start to show compromise. As a negotiation process, it just doesn’t work,” a senior civil servant based at Whitehall in London told the newspaper.

“We know their position is 60 billion euros, but actual bottom line is 50 billion euros. Ours is closer to 30 billion euros, but the landing zone is 40 billion euros, even if the public and politicians are not all there yet,” the official added.

A second Whitehall source confirmed the UK bottom line was “30 billion euros-40 billion euros” while a third political source put the figure in May’s mind at “north of 30 billion euros”. Making such a large offer is likely to prove politically divisive for Theresa May.

Brexiteers within the Conservative party will find it hard to accept paying such a sum, especially if it was not in exchange for a workable future relationship.

British Brexit negotiators concluded after second-round talks last month that the EU had created a non-negotiable stance by refusing to talk about trade until it had reached a settlement on citizens’ rights, money and Northern Ireland.

UK officials have been looking at a compromise by proposing a transition deal in which Britain would offer to continue to make net payments to the EU of some 10 billion euros a year for up to three years after Brexit.

According to the latest estimate, this continued EU budget payment for 2019-2021 could represent a partial down-payment on a final 40-billion-euros bill that negotiators hope will jump-start talks on trade and future relations. Britain voted with 52 per cent in favour of leaving the European Union in a referendum last year.

Islamic State still a threat as Mosul residents return to city in ruins,"Like Abu Ghazi and Raad Abdelaziz, dozens of those displaced by the fighting have returned to West Mosul, which saw some of the fiercest fighting in nine-month battle to rout the militants from their stronghold in Iraq’s second-largest city. (Representational Image) Like Abu Ghazi and Raad Abdelaziz, dozens of those displaced by the fighting have returned to West Mosul, which saw some of the fiercest fighting in nine-month battle to rout the militants from their stronghold in Iraq’s second-largest city. (Representational Image)

Abu Ghazi stood smoking a cigarette outside what used to be his home in Mosul’s Old City, where only the sound of the footsteps of a few soldiers on patrol and twisted pieces of metal and fabric flapping in the wind disturb the eery silence. “They should just bulldoze the whole thing and start over,” he said, gazing at the rows of collapsed buildings with their contents strewn across the upturned streets. “There’s no saving it now, not like this.”

Hundreds of yards away on Wednesday Federal Police shot dead a senior Islamic State judicial officer after storming an underground tunnel where he was hiding, on Makkawi Street. Similar stories have been reported by aid workers and residents of West Mosul in the past few days. “West Mosul is still a military zone as the search operations are ongoing for suspects, mines and explosive devices,” a military spokesman said.

“The area is still not safe for the population to return.” However, in nearby Dawrat al Hammameel, with machines whirring in his workshop, Raad Abdelaziz said he has encouraged neighbours to return despite the still very real danger weeks after the government declared victory over the jihadists. Just this week, his nephew, Ali, saw a militant emerge from under a house and try to injure some civilians before he was caught and handed over to the Federal Police.

But Abdelaziz, whose factory was up and running just two weeks after he returned to Mosul with his family, persists: We want people in the neighbourhood to come back to their jobs.” He is already filling orders for water and gas tanks from residents intent on rebuilding. “Life is already coming back gradually,” he said.

FLOCKING OVER THE PONTOON

Like Abu Ghazi and Raad Abdelaziz, dozens of those displaced by the fighting have returned to West Mosul, which saw some of the fiercest fighting in nine-month battle to rout the militants from their stronghold in Iraq’s second-largest city. At the northern pontoon, one of two remaining access points between East and West Mosul, hundreds walked towards the western half of the city, carrying suitcases, household goods and livestock. Others drove across the makeshift bridge in overflowing coaches.

About 230,000 people cannot hope to return “anytime soon” as their homes in West Mosul were completely destroyed, the United Nation’s Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, said at a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. The city had a pre-war population of more than two million. Ziad al Chaichi came back to reopen his tea shop in West Mosul a week ago, having fled his nearby home in March.

“Everything’s still a mess we have nothing. No water, no electricity we need the essentials,” he said in his shop where dainty porcelain tea pots hung from the walls. He was thankful that some people were buying his tea, including Abdelfattah, a neighbour who sat with a group of men outside. “We want life to return here,” said Abdelfattah, 60, who came back to a partially collapsed home with his family about three weeks ago. “Not for us the older generation but for the children. Until then, we’re just sitting here patiently, drinking tea.”

PUNGENT REMINDER

Even in death, the militants haunt Mosul’s residents. A handful of their bodies are lying around the Old City, a pungent reminder of the last ten months. “We wish they would just take them away,” said Najm Abdelrazaq. But unlike with civilian bodies, the police and the military refuse to allow it, he said. “Why should we dignify them and remove the bodies?” one soldier said, when asked why the bodies were being left to rot in the 47 degree Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) heat. “Let them rot in the streets of Mosul after what they did here.”

Returnees are concerned about the smell and the risk of disease, but they’d rather have the bodies of their neighbours recovered first. Around the corner from Chaichi’s shop, scrawled across several collapsed houses in blue ink was: “The bodies of families lie here under the rubble.”

Indonesia and Russia pledged today to strengthen cooperation in cyber-security and counter-terrorism as concern grows about the spread of radicalism in Southeast Asia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who is on a two-day visit to Indonesia, said the two countries would work together more closely to counter the spread of Islamic State (IS) ideology.

“The threat that the ISIL is has not vanished. Its members have been spreading all over the world, including areas close to the Russian and Indonesian borders,” Lavrov said, using another acronym for the group. Hundreds of radicals from Indonesia have flocked abroad to fight with IS, and the country has seen a surge in plots and attacks linked to the jihadists over the past year.

Indonesian officials have also said dozens of Indonesians have travelled to the southern Philippine city of Marawi to fight with militants loyal to IS.

The militants seized parts of the city over two months ago and have resisted all attempts by the Philippine army to evict them. “We have agreed that our special services will pay particular attention to increasing coordination in our joint efforts to fight this scourge,” Lavrov said. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the two countries had strong ties on political and defence issues, and Indonesia wanted to deepen trade ties.

The ministers also discussed tensions on the Korean peninsula, the South China Sea and conflict in the Middle East, but gave no details.

The flaws in India’s internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries’ judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed — so far, at least.

Balachandran’s book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was “certainly a lapse”. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. “What was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)”. It was a “leadership failure” of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn’t institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown “no interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security”. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for “immaturely” dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

Bundesliga clubs need help to battle ultra fans,"Burnley’s pre-season match with Hanover 96 on Saturday was abandoned “on police advice”. (Source: Reuters) Burnley’s pre-season match with Hanover 96 on Saturday was abandoned “on police advice”. (Source: Reuters)

German football clubs will need the help of the league and the country’s football association to handle trouble by “ultra” fans, club executives said, days after a friendly match in England had to be called off.

Premier League Burnley’s pre-season match with Bundesliga club Hanover 96 on Saturday was abandoned “on police advice”, Burnley said in a statement. Media reports said German fans threw seats and surged towards Burnley fans during the first half, shortly after Burnley took the lead.

“Ultra groups are being formed across the country and we will need to find answers,” Cologne sports director Joerg Schmadtke said in a round table discussion in Duesseldorf on Monday.

“But we, the clubs, won’t be able to do so, on our own. The DFB (the German Football Association) as the umbrella organisation and the DFL (the German Football League) need to get on board.”

Dortmund CEO Hans Joachim Watzke said this week he believed “there is the tendency for ultras to come stronger together.”

His team has had its share of fan trouble. It was given a 100,000-euro fine last season after its supporters attacked visiting RB Leipzig fans.

“The clubs can only deal with the groups around them and try to influence them,” Cologne’s Schmadtke said. But stiff fines from the DFB were not necessarily the solution, he said.

“The way the DFB is doing things at the moment, with these various sanctions, we will not stop the cycle. It is not improving the atmosphere.”

Jack Cork relishing Burnley stability after unsettling Swansea spell,"Jack Cork played under five managers during his two-and-a-half years Swansea. (Source: Reuters) Jack Cork played under five managers during his two-and-a-half years Swansea. (Source: Reuters)

Burnley midfielder Jack Cork is happy to play under Sean Dyche at Burnley, claiming managerial changes at his former club Swansea affected players during their relegation battle last season.

The Welsh club sacked Francesco Guidolin and Bob Bradley before Paul Clement’s impressive rescue job in the second half of the campaign kept them in the Premier League.

“It was tough with the change of managers at Swansea, it did affect us last year,” Cork, who left Liberty Stadium to join Burnley last month, told reporters.

“Everyone has seen things in the way he (Clement) does things and how he works. Trust in him has paid off and he’s shown what a good manager he can be.”

Cork played under five managers during his two-and-a-half years Swansea, including Alan Curtis’ two spells as caretaker.

With Dyche being in charge at Turf Moor since Oct. 2012, Cork said he could see the positive impact of stability at the club.

“It’s good to come to a stable club with the manager here,” the 28-year-old added. “The board and players trust him and enjoy working with him.”

Cork could make his Burnley debut in Saturday’ league game at Chelsea, the club where he started his career.

Love Diaries : अन् माऊलीने मुक्ताचा हात सोडला… (भाग २),"तो तिच्यासोबत खूश होता यातच मुक्ता खूश होती. तिचे बाकीचे मित्र-मैत्रिणी तिला सतत विचारायचे की तू ठिक आहेस ना? तेव्हा ती ठामपणे हो असं उत्तर द्यायची. एकदा माऊली त्याच्या गर्लफ्रेण्डची ओळख ग्रुपमध्ये व्हावी म्हणून तिला डिनरला घेऊन आला होता. तेव्हा मुक्ताच्यासमोरच तिच्याशी काय बोलायचं यावरुन इतर मित्र-मैत्रिणी थोडे गप्पच होते. ती शांतता पाहून मुक्ताच तिच्याशी बिनधास्त बोलायला लागली. तिच्या ऑफिसबद्दल, आवडींबद्दल सगळ्याबद्दल सहजतेने बोलत होती. माऊली गप्पांच्या ओघात सहज बोलून गेला की, ‘मुक्ता हिच्यासमोर काहीच नाही…’ ते एक वाक्य तिच्या मनात खोलवर रुतलं. त्याच्या त्या वाक्याने ती आतून पुरती कोसळली होती. डोळ्यात आलेलं पाणी कोणाला दिसायला नको म्हणून तिने अथक प्रयत्न केले होते. त्याचं हे वाक्य तिथे जमलेल्या सगळ्यांच्याच लक्षात आलं. तिच्या बाजूला बसलेला तिचा मित्र भाग्येष हळूच तिच्या कानात बोलला, ‘घाबरू नकोस मी आहे.’ पण रंगाचा बेरंग नको म्हणून ती काहीच बोलली नाही. मनावर दगड ठेवून हसायचं कसं हे ती पहिल्यांदा अनुभवत होती. त्यानंतर कोणचं माऊलीशी आणि त्याच्या गर्लफ्रेण्डशी बोलायला तयार नव्हतं. म्हणून ते दोघं जाईपर्यंत मुक्ता एकटी तिच्याशी बोलत होती. मुक्ता तिच्याशी एवढं का बोलते याचा सुरुवातीला इतरांना फार राग आला. त्यांनी तिला तसा जाबही विचारला. तेव्हा मुक्ता म्हणाली की,

“आपलं नाणं खोटंय, त्यात त्या मुलीचा काय दोष. तिला आपल्या ग्रुपमध्ये काय चालतं ते थोडीच माहिती आहे. दुसऱ्या मुलीला दोष देण्यात काहीच अर्थ नाही. जे काही बोलला ते माऊली बोलला ती नाही.”

काही महिन्यांनी माऊली आणि त्याच्या गर्लफ्रेण्डचं ब्रेकअपही झालं. पण मुक्ताने का झालं, कसं झालं, कधी झालं असे प्रश्न विचारले नाहीत. तिला त्यात काहीही स्वारस्य नव्हतं.

माऊलीचा स्वभाव इतर मुलांसारखा नव्हता. तो समजायला थोडा कठीण होता. शिवाय तो नेहमीच बोलायचा,

“प्रत्येकजण चेहऱ्याला मास्क लावून फिरत असतो. आपला खरा चेहरा कधीच कोणाला कळत नाही. माणूस घरी एक असतो, मित्रांसोबत एक तर ऑफिसमध्ये अजून वेगळा असतो. प्रत्येकजण आपल्या सोयीप्रमाणे मास्क लावतो.” त्याच्या या वाक्याप्रमाणेच त्याचं वागणंही होतं.

तो घरी श्रावणबाळ होता. जो कधीही आई-वडिलांच्या आज्ञेबाहेर नसणारा. पण बाहेर मित्रांमध्ये मात्र तो पुरता वेगळा होता. पार्टी, नाईट-आऊट करणं यात त्याचा हात कोणीही धरू शकत नव्हता. पण तरीही त्याचं मन तिला कळायचं. तो काय विचार करेल किंवा ती काय रिअॅक्ट करेल ही गोष्ट दोघांनाही अगदी न सांगता अचूक कळायची. त्याची ती मास्कची फिलॉसॉफी मुक्ताकडे फारशी चालायची नाही.

तिचं आणि माऊलीचं नातं थोडं वेगळंच होतं. दोघांचं एकमेकांशिवाय पटायचं नाही. सहा–सात महिने एकमेकांसोबत चांगले गेले की कोणत्याही शुल्लक गोष्टींवरून त्यांच्यात असा काही वाद व्हायचा की ते परत एखादं दोन महिने बोलायचेही नाहीत. मग कधी तरी पुन्हा बोलणं सुरू व्हायचं. तिने एकदा त्याला प्रपोजही केलं होतं. पण त्याने मात्र नकार दिला होता. त्याने नकार दिला म्हणून तिने त्यांच्यातलं मैत्रीचं नातं कधीच तोडलं नव्हतं. माझं प्रेम आहे म्हटल्यावर समोरच्याचही आपल्यावर प्रेम हवंच असा काही तिचा अट्टाहास नव्हता. पण आपल्या मनातल्या भावना त्याला कळल्या पाहिजेत म्हणून तिने त्या सांगितल्या होत्या. असेच दिवसांमागून दिवस जात होते आणि ती दोघं एकमेकांसोबत चांगला काळ घालवत होती.

तिला डायरी लिहायची प्रचंड आवड. दिवसभरात जरी ते शक्य झालं नाही तरी ती सुट्टीच्या दिवशी नक्कीच एखादं पान तरी लिहितेच. आतापर्यंत तिला अनेक डायरी माऊलीने गिफ्ट म्हणून दिल्या होत्या. त्यात ती तिला सुचणाऱ्या कविता, चारोळी, काही चांगली वाक्य आणि सर्वात महत्त्वाचं म्हणजे तिच्या मनातलं सारं काही ती डायरीमध्ये लिहायची. दोघांमध्ये ठरलेला खोटा वाद म्हणजे डायरी वाचायला देणं. मुक्ताला तिची डायरी वाचलेली अजिबात आवडायची नाही. ती वाचायची माऊलीलाही परवानगी नव्हती. पूर्ण मुक्ता कोणाला कळू नये एवढंच तिचं म्हणणं असायचं. पण मुक्ताला अधिक जाणून घ्यायला किंवा नेमकी त्याच्याबद्दल त्या डायरीमध्ये तिने काय लिहिलंय हे जाणून घेण्याची त्याची उत्सुकता असायची. स्वतःची डायरी वाचायला देणं सोडून मुक्ताने त्याची एकही गोष्ट ऐकली नाही असं कधी झालं नाही.

दोघांचे असेच हसत- खेळत दिवस जात होते. अचानक एक दिवस ऑफिसमधून येताना माऊलीच्या गाडीचा अपघात झाला. तेव्हा मुक्ताही ऑफिसमध्ये होती. जेव्हा तिला हे कळलं तेव्हा ती सगळं सोडून त्याच रात्री त्याला भेटायला गेली. त्याला काही झालं तर नसेल ना या विचाराने तिचं डोकं बधिर झालं होतं. तिच्याच ग्रुपमधला मित्र शरद आणि ती एकत्र त्याला पाहायला गेले. नंतर प्रत्येक दिवशी ती त्याला त्याच्या तब्येतीबद्दल आणि पायाबद्दल विचारायची. असंच एका रात्री एक-दोन वाजेपर्यंत बोलणं झाल्यावर दोघं झोपी गेले. दुसऱ्या दिवशी ठरल्याप्रमाणे तिने गुड मॉर्निंगचा मेसेज त्याला टाकला. पण त्याचं नेट बंद असल्यामुळे व्हॉट्सअपवर तो मेसेज त्याला गेलाच नाही. उशिरा उठेल या विचाराने ती ऑफिसमध्ये गेली आणि ऑफिसच्या कामात व्यग्र झाली. दुपारी जेवताना त्याला मेसेज करावा म्हणून तिने व्हॉट्सअपची त्याची चॅट विंडो ओपन केली तरी तिला एकच टीक दिसत होती. अजूनपर्यंत त्याने नेट कसं काय बंद ठेवलं या विचाराने तिने माऊलीला फोन लावला. त्याचा फोनही लागेना म्हणून तिने त्याला टेक्स्ट मेसेज टाकला. एक, दोन, तीन १०-१२ टेक्स्ट मेसेज, कित्येक व्हॉट्सअप मेसेज आणि फोन करुनही त्याच्याबद्दल तिला काहीच कळत नव्हते. आता मात्र तिचं मन घाबरायला लागलं. इतर मित्रांना विचारावं तर तू अजूनही त्याचीच काळजी करतेस का, असा उलट ओरडा तिलाच पडणार म्हणून तिने कोणाला विचारलेही नाही.

मन चिंती ते वैरी न चिंती अशी अवस्था तिची झाली. तो संपूर्ण दिवस आणि ती रात्र मुक्ता एक मिनिटही स्वस्थ बसली नाही. डोळ्यातून सतत वाहणाऱ्या धारा घरातल्यांना कळू नये म्हणून फार मुश्किलीने तिने रोखून धरल्या होत्या. रात्री न राहून तिने ग्रुपमधल्या एका मैत्रिणीला नयनाला त्याच्या घरी फोन करुन त्याची तब्येत विचारायला सांगितले. मिनलने दुसऱ्या दिवशी माऊलीच्या घरी फोन केला तेव्हा त्याच्या पायाचं ऑपरेशन झालं असं कळलं. मुक्ताला हे कळताच तिच्या मनातल्या काळजीची जागा रागाने घेतली. आदल्या रात्रीपर्यंत बोलत असतानाही माऊलीला उद्या माझं ऑपरेशन आहे, असं साधं सांगावसंही वाटलं नाही, याचा तिला भयंकर राग आला.

"No plans to replace UGC, AICTE with single regulator: HRD Minister","Minister of State for HRD, Mahendra Nath Pandey Minister of State for HRD, Mahendra Nath Pandey

The Minister of State for Human Resource Development Mahendra Nath Pandey today said that the government is not planning to merge the UGC and the AICTE into a single higher education regulator at present

“No such proposal is under consideration at present, to merge the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) into a single higher education regulator,” said the Minister in a written response in the Rajya Sabha.

However, some recent reports suggested that the government is planning to scrap the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education. Some HRD officials said they’ll introduce a common regulator which will be called Higher Education Empowerment Regulation Agency (HEERA). The aim for this replacement is to eliminate overlaps in the jurisdiction and remove irrelevant regulatory provisions.

The HRD Minister also informed that the idea of establishing a single regulator for higher education has been proposed by various committees.

“While the National Knowledge Commission (2006) recommended an independent regulatory authority for higher education, the Committee on Renovation and Rejuvenation of Higher Education (2009) advocated an apex regulatory body by converging multiple regulatory agencies in the field of higher education.

“The UGC Review Committee in 2014 had also recommended that the commission should be replaced by an apex institution titled National Higher Education Authority,” Pandey said.

WATCH: Nick Kyrgios practices with fan on Twitter request,"Nick Kyrgios of Australia. (Source: Reuters) Nick Kyrgios of Australia. (Source: Reuters)

After being highly criticised for retiring from a match for a third consecutive time last week in Washington DC, Nick Kyrgios offered his services to fans all week at the Rogers Cup this week and even practiced with one on Tuesday.

It was a low week for Kyrgios in Washington where the cameras even captured him telling his mother that he did not want to play. But there was a new wave of positive energy this week as the Australian kept his promise to a fan that he would hit with him for five minutes during practice.

A fan called Matt Morin contacted Kyrgios on Twitter saying, “@NickKyrgios I’m at rogers cup on Tuesday, I know this is a long shot but could we hit for 5 minutes if you’re practicing? That’d be dope!”

To his surprise, he got a reply from the tennis player in one hour on Sunday who said that he would. And he actually did on Tuesday.

Kyrgios went on to invite other plans to help him during practice all week. He said in another tweet, “Also anyone at rogers cup throughout the week can come on my practice court and chill and hit if u want.”

After the nets, he went on to beat Viktor Troicki 6-1, 6-2 and will now face Paolo Lorenzi in the second round on Wednesday.

South African Tourism eyes one lakh Indian visitors despite post-GST apprehensions,"South Africa offers more than 60,000 different and customised tourism packages to the visitors. (Source: Pixabay) South Africa offers more than 60,000 different and customised tourism packages to the visitors. (Source: Pixabay)

Notwithstanding its apprehensions about the footfall of Indian tourists after the implementation of GST on July 1, South African Tourism is eyeing one lakh visitors from India in 2017-18, an official said on Tuesday. Despite a steady surge of 21.7 percent in the number of Indian leisure visitors in the African nation during the last calendar year the apprehension comes from the decline they witnessed in the numbers of Indian tourists for a few months since demonetisation in November.

“The reason why we are a bit apprehensive about the post GST scenario is because we did not think that we are going to get effected by the demonetisation. We were between 28-35 percent up month on month until October last year. But after demonetisation, we were not just down by two to three percent for a few months but we also lost our momentum of growth,” Hanneli Slabber, Country Manager India of South African Tourism, told reporters during the seventh edition of its travel trade training session.

“So now we are a little bit reluctant to say that the number of Indian visitors to South Africa would not be affected by the GST. We are hopeful that it would go in our favour,” she said adding that India held the eighth position in South Africa’s international source market last year with more than 95,000 visitors. Mentioning that South Africa offers more than 60,000 different and customised tourism packages to the visitors, Slabber claimed, under the new tax regime in India it would be much more beneficial for the leisure visitors to buy a package tour rather than paying separately for the stay and travel as less tax would be levied.

“If someone buys a package tour, he is going to pay five percent tax according to the new tax regime in India. However, if someone decides to break up the expenses and buy individual packages from individual operators, they would end up paying 18 percent tax under GST,” she said. Underscoring the massive opportunity of adventure tourism in their country, Slabber said Indian tourists are the biggest buyers of adventure packages there and thus helps in creation of more job opportunities among the locals compared to the tourists from other parts of the world.

“The Indians in South Africa pay for almost six activities in a day while the average tourists pay for only two. So in a way the Indian tourists help a lot more in terms of tourism related job creation in South Africa than the average tourists. They are also the biggest buyers of adventure packages,” she said. She also added that according to their records in the last few years, Indian women take up more adventure packages like bungee jumping and snorkelling, than the Indian men.

About tourists from Bengal, Slabber said Kolkata has been one of the most unique and rapidly growing source market driving tourist traffic to South Africa and said they are planning to customise Kolkata specific packages in South Africa. “The number of tourists from Bengal has gone up from two percent to seven percent in the last few years. “Also, this is the only market ever where we have been asked about art galleries, museums and more intellectual pursuit of holiday. That is something really unique about the market in West Bengal,” she added.

Toilet Ek Prem Katha box office prediction: Akshay Kumar’s film is definitely not going down the drain,"Akshay Kumar’s Toilet: Ek Prem Katha will be one of the biggest openers of the year. Akshay Kumar’s Toilet: Ek Prem Katha will be one of the biggest openers of the year.

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha will mark Akshay Kumar’s second film this year and trade analysts are confident that this film will be one of the biggest openers of the year. They say it may cross the Rs 50 crore mark within the first weekend.

In an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com, trade analyst Girish Johar said,”I am expecting a good number. Somewhere between Rs 13 to Rs 15 crore on Friday. By the end of the weekend, it would be ideal if the film crosses the half century mark (Rs 5o crore mark).”

Akshay Kumar’s Toilet: Ek Prem Katha also has the advantage of the Independence Day holiday which falls on Tuesday. The film is expected to dominate the box office if it delivers powerful content.

“There are no good films at the box office. The actual word-of-mouth might boost Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. It will definitely affect the collection of Shah Rukh Khan’s Jab Harry Met Sejal and Anil Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor’s Mubarakan. This is the biggest release of the week so far and naturally, this will be the first choice of movie-goers this weekend. Also, people have not liked the content of Jab Harry Met Sejal,” Girish added.

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, starring Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar, deals with the problem of open defecation in rural areas of the country. The film will hit screens on August 11.

I am happy that we have finally started depending on fast bowlers: Kapil Dev,"Kapil Dev scored 175 runs against Zimbabwe in 1983. (Source: Express Photo) Kapil Dev scored 175 runs against Zimbabwe in 1983. (Source: Express Photo)

Former India captain Kapil Dev has claimed that the current Indian team has a fine crop of quality pacers at its disposal and hence this team can rely on them for taking wickets consistently and delivering when required. This will no doubt be a great feeling for skipper Virat Kohli going into foreing tours.

Speaking at the sidelines of an event, Kapil Dev specially singled out Umesh Yadav for special praise and said, “Your question has made me so happy because today we have started depending on fast bowlers. There was a time we didn’t have any fast bowlers and today we have so many fast bowlers. The people who are sitting out could have played for India any day.”

Refusing to comment on Ravi Shastri’s analysis that the current team is better than those existing before, Dev said, “That is his (Shastri’s) thought, either you take it or drop it, whatever you like.” and added, “That is his thought process, I have my own thought process. I always believe that younger teams are much better, they have done well and we should be proud about that,” said Dev, one of the finest all-rounders India has ever produced.”

Kapil Dev also complemented all-rounder Hardik Pandya and said, “He has the ability (to become a good all-rounder) and he has to keep on performing”.

Earlier, in a recent interview to Times of India, former Indian all-rounder Kapil Dev had also lauded the selection by the Indian selectors and said, “If you look at previous tours, India depended greatly on their batsmen to flourish and show the way. This is the first time we are depending on four outstanding seam bowlers to deliver the goods.”

British election failure shakes confidence in Theresa May’s Brexit strategy: ORB poll,"FILE- In this Friday, June 23, 2017 file photo British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to address a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels.

British Prime Minister Theresa May’s botched gamble on a snap election has shaken public confidence in the government with nearly two thirds of voters now negative about her government’s approach to Brexit talks, an ORB opinion poll indicated. Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in late March 2019.

May is reeling from a crisis of her own making – the loss of her parliamentary majority in a June 8 snap election which she had called to strengthen her hand. The EU’s top negotiator has warned that formal talks could be delayed. An Aug 2-3 opinion poll for ORB International showed 61 percent of British voters disapproved of the government’s handling of the Brexit negotiations, up from 56 percent last month and 46 percent in June.

The data showed most voters approved of May’s handling of Brexit negotiations this year until the start of June when May lost of her majority. “This months Brexit tracker suggests the damage from a poor election result is continuing to cast doubt over Brexit,” Johnny Heald, managing director of ORB, said. “Confidence that the prime minister will be able to negotiate the right deal remains brittle,” he said.

When asked if whether they were confident May would get the right deal, 44 percent of people said they were not confident. Just 35 percent were confident May would get the right Brexit deal while 21 percent said they did not know. ORB asked 2,000 voters across the United Kingdom. The margin of error is around 2.2 percent.

Will ensure that athletes are not adversely affected by imposition of GST on sports goods: NRAI,"NRAI Senior Vice President and Member of Parliament, Kalikesh Narain Singh Deo, raised the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on shooting and sports equipment. (Source: Express Archive) NRAI Senior Vice President and Member of Parliament, Kalikesh Narain Singh Deo, raised the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on shooting and sports equipment. (Source: Express Archive)

After the imposition of GST on sports equipment, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) has decided to approach the finance ministry and reiterate the concerns surrounding the shooting community so that they are not affected by the rise in price.

This concern comes on the backdrop of inclusion of sports goods under the high tax slabs of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

NRAI president Raninder Singh spoke to PTI in an interview and said, “We have taken it up officially with the Finance Ministry and are hopeful of an early resolution to the issue. NRAI will do everything in its power to ensure that the athletes and the sport are not adversely affected.”

Coach of the Indian junior pistol team, Jaspal Rana said, “Imposing GST on sports goods will act as an obstacle, especially to those who are financially weak. Instead of encouraging the athletes who can bring glory to the country, you are imposing an additional unnecessary burden of 18-28 percent of GST on sports equipment.”

“Parents of aspiring shooters coming from not-so well-to-do families buy equipment after taking loans from banks or borrow money, just imagine what will they do now. These equipment are not produced in India, they have to be imported, so how will an athlete from a poor family manage.”, he added.

Raising concerns on behalf of the athletes, he said, “I don’t see any step being taken in this regard by the federation or the government. About the problems faced by the sportsman till now, none from the government or federation has expressed concern on the social media or any other platform. Whereas our sports minister has enough spare time to inaugurate a range of five lanes.”

“As I have already spoken on the day of the NRAI elections held recently, 18 percent GST imposed on all imports including duty-free imports will definitely have an adverse impact on the shooting sport. All world-class equipment needed in the sport needs to be imported and were till now part of the customs duty free list. A steep imposition of 18 percent is sure to affect a majority of athletes who are vying to bring glory to the country. Weapons and equipments used in shooting sports are imported from countries such as Germany, Italy and UK.”, he concluded.

1930s imperial propaganda: How star-studded western films justified British colonialism,"How cinema carried imperial propaganda about pre-independence India. Examining The Drum (1938), Gunga Din (1939) and The Rains Came (1939). How cinema carried imperial propaganda about pre-independence India. Examining The Drum (1938), Gunga Din (1939) and The Rains Came (1939).

A series of Hollywood and British films were made between 1929-39 with India as their central theme. Historical or current affairs accuracy was not their main concern. Racial stereotypes and stock characters of Indians as a generally ‘inferior’, silly and mutually divided people were all too common in their backdrop. A look into them suggest that back in time, we Indians may have had stronger reasons than vagrant thin-skinnedness to be mad at some of the movies.

Indian audience for cinema in the 1930s had been a robust and fast growing one, although western films found a far smaller niche among them. The western high-adventure film with its action draw was an exception to that, as movies like Robinhood, Tarzan, King Kong, Ape Man etc (to name a few) were hardly limited by the language barrier and did enormously business on the Indian box office. Therefore, similar films with an Indian setting and Indian characters (and employing some Indians as actors) were expected to general plenty of interest among Indian audiences. This was for true for some films, but not all.

Below are three films with a well known star cast of the time that performed splendidly at the box office in the US and Britain. They all had a strong subtext of the Indian socio-political situation, and different, distorted interpretations of it. And they elicited the strongest reactions in India. Examine their plots below and understand why they would have riled up Indian audiences.

The Drum (1938)

The Drum had been one of the most successful British empire films in terms of box office collections in 1938. However, within a week of its release in Bombay in September 1938, it spurred a wide-scale agitation among Indians which resulted in a law and order problem in the city. It took the police a week long effort and the film’s removal from exhibition to bring the situation under control.

The story, featuring Sabu, Raymond Massey, Roger Livesey and Valerie Robson, openly claimed to be set in 1938 India. It showed its hero — a British official — Captain Carruthers (Livesey) offer a ‘treaty of peace and friendship’ to the Emperor of Tokot, a fictional Kingdom located in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) near the Afghan border, to make it into a British subsidiary in return of a generous subsidy. The ruler accepts it, stating “If England is our friend, we shall have peace” and his subjects are seen as happy and jubilant at the prospect of being rendered safe from the ‘enemies’. He is however murdered by his brother, Gul Khan (Massey), who usurps the throne. The rightful heir to the throne, Prince Azim (Sabu), escapes being killed narrowly with the help of Carruthers and his wife (Robson). Gul plots to kill the Carruthers and his men at the Muharram feast but Azim saves his British friends by beating the warning drum he has learnt from his Scottish drumboy friend. Gul is murdered and the throne is restored to the young, British loyalist Azim.

Ideology and politics:

The film was deemed severely inflammatory and objectionable in India for maligning the character of Pathans, portraying them as barbaric brutes through savage dialogues and for its unabashed propaganda of the British Frontier policy, which in reality had been severely criticised in and outside India. Conversely, it is also showed that the ‘good’ Pathans like Azim and his father were friends of the British, when in fact the Pathans had been by and large vociferously anti-British.

In 1937, the British had been alarmed and confounded by the Hindu-Muslim unity of Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s Khudai Khidmatgar and the Congress in the NWFP. The ideology of The Drums was overtly degrading to the fabric of communal harmony. The movie also implied that British were the bulwark preventing a Muslim takeover of India. The way archvillain Gul Khan is depicted was highly reminiscent of a Muslim conqueror who voices that he intends to kill (non-Muslims) en masse and oversee the rise of mosques all over India. These were precisely the fears being stoked by communal Hindu organisations like Hindu Mahasabha and Sanatan Dharm Sabha, who had also been active in the NWFP.

Gunga Din (1939)

At a time when British empire in India was facing serious challenges from the raging anti-colonial struggle, Gunga Din (intended to be pronounced “Ganga Deen”) “gave a clarion call of ‘All’s well’ … for the benefit of the white audience,” writes historian Prem Chowdhry, the author of Colonial India and the Making of Empire Cinema.

Starring Cary Grant, Victor McLagan and Douglas Fairbanks and directed by George Stevens, Gunga Din (1939) was based on a popular short poem by Rudyard Kipling with the same name, in which a low-caste bhishti (water carrier) loses his life in the course of fulfilling his duty while quenching the thirst of wounded soldiers of the British Indian army.

Gunga Din tells the adventure tale of three adventure-loving British sergeants — Ballantine, Cutter and MacChesney — in the British Indian army who are sent to investigate an outstation in North Western Frontier Province attacked by ‘thuggee’, an ancient murderous cult and worshippers of Kali. In process of the plot, the sergeants have violent confrontations with the thugs and eventually discover their hideout in a Kali temple.

While the three officers alone easily overpower and outwit the hordes of thugs on all occasions, towards the climax they are wounded and captured. The bhishti Gunga Din’s bravery in alerting the regiment at the cost of his life saves the officers’ lives and prevents the regiment of the British Indian army coming for their rescue from walking into a deadly ambush. The sergeants are rescued and the uprising is stamped out by the British India army. Gunga Din is recognised as a hero and suitably rewarded: he is posthumously made a corporal in the British Indian army.

Ideology and politics:

Gunga Din glorified the Raj at the expense of the Indians. Noting its effect, an Indian film journal hit out: “All the British characters are honest, jolly souls while all the ‘natives’ are scheming, treacherous, unscrupulous devils. All but one, the solitary exception is Gunga Din … He is always cringing before them … That is how all loyal ‘natives’ must behave in presence of their rulers.”

The late 1930s had been a period of consolidation of communal forces in India, clamoring for the ‘two nation’ idea. During the 1937 provincial elections, after passing of the 1935 Government of India Act, the Muslim League failed to win many seats in the NWFP despite it being a Muslim majority area, which mainly went to Congress under Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s leadership. Therefore, in those days, it had been actively propagating that the nationalists in the Congress, being Hindus, were hell bent on creating a ‘Ram Raj’ which no true Muslim could align with.

Gunga Din too in its plot associated Thuggee with Hindus (Muslims were selectively excluded) and the Hindus with the nationalists. In a reversal from The Drum, the film showed a horde of killing thuggees overrunning the Frontier region, which in reality was a Muslim majority region. Thus reinforcing the idea of the danger of Hindu domination, which was in line with the British propaganda to communalise the nationalist movement. The Thuggees’ proclamation to take over all of India was projected to be as much against the Muslims as against the British.

Moreover, the portrayal of the Thug master, inciting the masses “to kill!” quite literally, is unmistakably cast in the mould of Mahatma Gandhi. Through this thinly veiled gag, the film caricatured Gandhi (a Vaishnavite and follower of Bhakti), by showing him as a worshipper of Kali and a believer in the cult of murder and violence to pursue his furtive agenda.

Another fault line that the film exploited was caste divides. The British had long projected themselves as the protector of downtrodden untouchables of India from the high caste Hindus of Congress. The film turns Gunga Din, a bhishti within Kipling’s poem, into a ‘loyal humble servant of the empire’ — whose yearning desire is to be a soldier in service of the Queen.

Released in the USA in February 1939, Gunga Din was one of the most popular and highly rated adventure films which broke box office records in the USA and Britain. Needless to say, however, the ‘heroism’ and ‘loyalty’ of Gunga Din, which resulted in the death of thousands of Indians, was a bitter pill for the Indian audience to swallow, who would have seen him as little more than a traitor. Gunga Din was banned in Bengal (citing potential disturbance to intercommunal harmony) and in Bombay, followed by other provinces as soon as moves were made to release it.

The Rains Came (1939)

By May 1939, Gunga Din and The Drum were publically affirmed by the British officials in India as causing ‘disturbances to Indian opinion’. “The successive banning of these two films was the proverbial last straw for many studios in the USA, where similar projects were abandoned,” writes Chowdhry. Gears were shifted in tune with the contemporary situation, the adventure plots were abandoned and a new sophisticated film came about: It was a grand narrative of progress and development in India under British colonial domination and also a romance. It was released in India in 1940.

The Rains Came, starring Hollywood actors Myrna Loy, George Brent and Tyrone Power, projected a new image of the British Empire in relation to the colonised: as one of a development partnership led by the Indian monarchs moral patronage and paternalism. It portrays princely India as the ‘real India,’ slowly coming out of backwardness, poverty and stagnation with the moral and material support of the British.

Rains tells the tale of Major Rama Safti (played by Power, a major Hollywood star in the 30s), a young Western educated Indian doctor in the Indian kingdom of ‘Ranchipur’, who is also the chosen heir of the Maharaja and the Maharani. He is friends with the British people living in Ranchipur, which is clearly a subordinate of the Raj. A married and wealthy English woman named Edwina (Loy) falls in love with Safti but soon earthquake and flood destroy the city and plague falls upon its residents. The Maharaja dies from it. Under the Maharani’s leadership, Safti’s tireless medical service and Britain’s unrestrained help, Ranchipur slowly begins to cope with its woes. Edwina, as a medical volunteer dies of the plague, but leaves her money for the cause of rebuilding Ranchipur. The able Rama Safti is crowned Ranchipur’s new King, with the blessings of the British.

Ideology and politics:

Marking a departure from the previous films, Rains avoids crude racial stereotyping of Indians to a large extent. The calibre of the monarchs and educated Indians is shown in a favourable, modern light. Britain is, of course, ever present – – to protect them and to assist them in uplifting their people. Imperialism is reimagined and recast in a softer, nurturing light — abandoning its aggressive presence for a maternal avatar here. Instead of a exploitative and degrading role, the colonisers are shown as helpful, modernising agents to the Indian society. In reality, one knows that British indifference was responsible for the Bengal famine of 1943.

The British position in India at the end of 1930s had been made shaky by the ability shown by the Indians post 1935 in tackling democracy. As demands of Indian nationalists for Purna Swaraj were growing louder, The Rains Came “tried to assert that the ‘injection of democracy’ was not required and that the traditional Indian rulers were capable of governing their people well, that is, with the patronage of the British,” writes Chowdhry. As a film that tried to propose an alternative for India within the British empire in 1940, The Rains Came failed to impress Indians, who had long written off princes and rulers as indolent and conspirators with the British — and with good reason. The new India would not look back to its Princely past.

Cinema’s early development coincided with the high noon of the British empire and it quickly emerged as the most influential propaganda vehicle of imperialists. Empire films The Drum, Gunga Din and The Rains Came attempted to respond to the anti-colonial developments by denying them. At the same time, they were a testament to the fact that Britain could no longer ignore the rise and ambition of nationalism of Indians.

"Sharad Yadav says two JDUs, one sarkari, other of workers","Sharad Yadav at the Patna airport on Thursday. (PTI photo) Sharad Yadav at the Patna airport on Thursday. (PTI photo)

At a time when speculation is rife over a possible split in JD(U) over Bihar CM and party chief Nitish Kumar’s decision to break ranks with the Grand Alliance and join hands with BJP, senior JD (U) leader Sharad Yadav Thursday said there are two JD(U)s, “one is sarkari JD (U) in which people have become CM and ministers and the other is that of workers”.

Yadav has expressed displeasure with Nitish’s decision and has decided to hold public interactions in various parts of Bihar. Launching his programme, “janta se seedha samvad”, from Dudhaila village in Sonepur, the Rajya Sabha MP said the Grand Alliance split was not just a “betrayal of agreement with people of Bihar, but also of people across the country” who hailed the Grand Alliance victory in the 2015 Bihar polls. Yadav said he had not seen any other instance of “such breach of people’s trust” in the 70 years after Independence.

Sharing the dais with Yadav were Sonepur’s RJD MLA Ramanuj Rai and local Congress leader Jitendra Singh. While the function was organised by Samajwadi Jan Morcha, an apolitical organisation, some JD (U) flags were seen on the stage. The function was organised on private land after the state government refused permission for the event.

Speaking about his interaction programme, during which he is scheduled to attend 25 public meetings over three days in Hajipur, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga and Madhubani, Yadav said: “People say I have come out to the road, but this is where I have always been. Power comes from the people and vote is the engine of democracy.”

“(BJP used) 26 helicopters and 12 planes in 2015 Bihar polls. We formed the Grand Alliance that was supported by Left parties, BSP and SP… people of Bihar gave the Grand Alliance two-thirds majority. People of country too hailed this. But who has broken that trust? This is why I have come to people. You have to make Grand Alliance stronger,” said Yadav, drawing applause from hundreds who waited for nearly two hours in rain for Yadav to arrive.

“There was a manifesto of Grand Alliance prepared by Laluji, Nitishji, Congress and me and there was another manifesto of BJP, of PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah. The people’s mandate was for five years. Can one think of another example where two manifestos are implemented?” said Yadav.

RJD workers were present at the event in large numbers. A supporter of RJD MLA Rai said: “We campaigned in villages to get maximum crowd at Sharad Yadav’s function”.

Sonepur is dominated by OBC Yadavs and upper-caste Rajputs. Some local residents present at the meeting claimed that Bihar CM was harassing Yadavs by cracking down on illegal sand mining. “Everyone knows several Yadav families are in the sand business. The government must nab wrongdoers, but not stop the sand business,” said an elderly Yadav who retired as a railway gateman.

“Had Nitish taken any step towards becoming Prime Minister, we would have appreciated it, but by joining BJP, he has lost his credibility,” said Nagina Yadav, a local resident.

"Gorkhaland demand: Centre yet to respond, GJM to spread agitation in plains","With the GJM trying to spread the agitation in the Terai and Dooars areas (part of the proposed Gorkhaland) of the plains, a confrontation with tribal bodies and the Trinamool Congress is likely. (Source: PTI) With the GJM trying to spread the agitation in the Terai and Dooars areas (part of the proposed Gorkhaland) of the plains, a confrontation with tribal bodies and the Trinamool Congress is likely. (Source: PTI)

With the Centre yet to respond to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s (GJM) demand for a separate state of Gorkhakand and the indefinite bandh in the Hills entering the 57th day on Thursday, the GJM has decided to take its agitation to the plains. It has also decided to send delegations to Northeastern states, many of which, are sympathetic to the Gorkhaland cause.

In an official release on Thursday, GJM general secretary Roshan Giri said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s statement in the state Assembly — calling for talks on the issue — was an eyewash since no formal communication has reached them and police and administration continued to commit atrocities in the Hills. With the GJM trying to spread the agitation in the Terai and Dooars areas (part of the proposed Gorkhaland) of the plains, a confrontation with tribal bodies and the Trinamool Congress is likely.

From August 9 to 15, GJM planned to take out ‘Tiranga Yatra’ not only in the Hills but also in Terai and Dooars. Rallies will also be undertaken along National Highway 10 — the only and vital link to Sikkim. Recently, there have been reports of vehicles plying along NH-10 being ransacked. The Sikkim chief minister has already supported Gorkhaland, much to the discomfort of the Bengal government, which raised the issue with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.

GJM chief Bimal Gurung has also called on the tribals, who form a sizable population in Terai and Dooars, to support the movement. He has assured that 6th Schedule status will be granted to the tribals to protect their culture and lifestyle. At present, 6th Schedule status refers to powers enjoyed by the autonomous district councils of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura.

However, in 2015, tribal bodies had opposed the idea. Now, too, they are refusing to be a part of the agitation. “We will neither be a part of the agitation nor will allow it in Tera and Dooars, which is our land. For ages, we have been residing with Gorkhas in these areas. But if they come down to the plains and try to create problems, we will give them a befitting reply. We are watching,” said Birsa Tirkey, state president of Akhil Bhartiya Adivasi Bikas Parishad.

Trinamool too has been holding rallies in the plains for the last three days. “We will not allow GJM to disturb peace in the plains. Their agitation is undemocratic,” said Tourism Minister Gautam Deb.

Amid all this, GJM’s move to send representatives to the Northeast is expected to further create pressure on the Centre as most of the states in the region favour Gorkhaland. “Delegations are being sent to Delhi as well as to the Northeast states. Our teams will meet MPs, chief ministers and leaders of the seven Northeast states. We will explain to them our demand and seek their support,” said GJM assistant general secretary Binay Tamang.

Patrick Patterson: Journey in finding one of West Indies’ most lethal bowlers,"Updated: July 23, 2017 1:20 pm

The most fearsome of Caribbean pacers disappeared into oblivion in the 1990s. Patrick Patterson is still around, though he does not quite remember the man he was, or his bowling spells which went down in history. But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door — to hear his story.

There had been murmurs around about Patterson’s present state — that he’s lost in the bush or is in an asylum; maybe, even roaming the streets as a destitute."
The mother’s legacy: The blue-and-white stripe sari of Saint Teresa is now an intellectual property of Missionaries of Charity,"Spin me a yarn: A nun at the centre. (Express photo by Subham Dutta) Spin me a yarn: A nun at the centre. (Express photo by Subham Dutta)

About 400 workers walk on muddy tracks sandwiched between railway tracks and multiple cow sheds to reach the Gandhiji Prem Nivas Leprosy Centre every day, except Sunday. Here, workers, once leprosy patients who got healed, produce distinctive blue-and-white border saris — they are worn exclusively by Missionaries of Charity (MoC) nuns across 749 centres over 120 countries, including the Vatican City. A five-minute walk from Titagarh Railway Station in North 24 Parganas district, this centre is the only place in the world — run by MoC Sisters and maintained by MoC Brothers, where these unique saris are produced.

Recently, the-blue-and-white sari, first worn by Saint Teresa (known as Mother Teresa before her canonisation last September), has been recognised as the Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity, which was founded by her. The unique pattern is now a registered trademark with the government of India’s Trade Marks Registry and no one can use that border design without the permission of the MoC.

According to the official website of Mother Teresa of Calcutta Centre, the Mother used to buy these saris from Harrison Road (now known as Mahatma Gandhi Road) in Kolkata in 1948. The three blue borders of the sari signify the vows that the nuns at MoC take. “The first band represents poverty, the second obedience, and, the third broad band represents the vows of chastity and wholehearted service to the poorest of the poor,” says Brother Harry D’Souza, in-charge of the handloom at the Centre. Saint Teresa and the MoC nuns continued wearing the saris till it became very difficult to get them in large numbers.

Eventually, the MoC, which had set up Gandhiji Prem Nivas Leprosy Centre in 1979 for leprosy patients, decided to give these patients the work of weaving this particular saris for its nuns. “Since then, these patients weave the saris. But they are not sold to outsiders. Only MoC nuns get to wear them once they take their first vow after five years of training. This is the only place in the world which produces this sari,” says the director of the Centre, Brother Marianus.

The workers get Rs 6,000 per month, and, sometimes, a bonus if they produce more saris. “We also provide food, clothing and medical care. We have set up three nivas (quarter) for them. Those who have settled outside the centre come regularly to work here,” says Marianus.

Out of 50 looms at the Centre, only seven are used for weaving the saris, which are called Sister Saris. “Besides Sister Saris, workers here produce bedsheets, bandages and uniforms for leprosy patients at various centres,” says D’Souza.

Mithun Haldar, 26, who has worked at the Centre for the last 10 years, was happy to learn that the border of the Sisters Saris has been recognised as the intellectual property of MoC. “It is good to know that no one except us can make these saris now,” he says.

“I had come here as a patient in 1978. When the centre was set up, I was given a job. Since then I have been working here,” says Shefali Roy who has been associated with the centre for the last 40 years.

After the completion of the weaving processes, the saris are sent for packaging. The packed saris are then sent to Nirmala Shishu Bhavan at Lower Circular Road in Kolkata from where the saris are distributed to the centres of MoC across the world.

One prisoner died and five were injured in a clash involving some 50 inmates in Guatemala, state prison authorities said. Special forces of the Pavon Prison, located just outside the country’s capital, intervened to regain control of the institution that houses some 4,000 inmates, prison system spokesman Rudy Esquivel told journalists.

He said the cause of the clash was under investigation, adding that victims showed signs of blows and wounds “presumably” caused by knives.

The prison was the scene of a July 2016 riot that left more than a dozen dead, including an ex-soldier imprisoned for killing a Roman Catholic bishop almost two decades ago. The Guatemalan Penitentiary System administers 21 prisons nationwide with a maximum capacity of 6,809 prisoners — but 22,574 people are currently in custody, according to official data.

President Donald Trump may be out of town, but one plucky protester is keeping an eye on the White House. A giant inflatable chicken bearing the unmistakable hairstyle of the commander in chief transfixed tourists and television cameras in the nation’s capital Wednesday afternoon.

Twitter users quickly posted dozens of images of the irate-looking fowl with a golden pompadour seemingly glaring down at the White House from a nearby green space known as the Ellipse. The chicken even appeared clearly in the background of a major news network’s live interview.

The Trump chicken balloon has appeared in Washington before, most recently before a protest in April to pressure Trump into releasing his tax returns. It even has its own Twitter account: (at)TaxMarchChicken.

Maine man sentenced to life in prison for violent rampage,"Representational Image Representational Image

A man who killed two people and injured four others was sentenced to life in prison Monday for a rampage that left a trail of death and destruction across northern Maine. Explaining his actions for the first time, Anthony Lord told the judge that he’d sought counseling to no avail after his baby son’s death left him overcome with grief before the shootings. Lord, 37, said of the families: “They can’t be given back what they lost.”

Justice Ann Murray imposed two life sentences, the maximum sentences for the two counts of murder, during the hearing at the Penobscot Judicial Center. In Maine, there’s no possibility of parole. The rampage began in July 2015 when Lord, of Crystal, set fire to a barn, stole firearms from a Silver Ridge Township home and beat a man after tying him to a chair. That was just the beginning.

After the barn fire, Lord went to Benedicta, where his ex-girlfriend was staying, and fatally shot her boyfriend, 22-year-old Kyle Hewitt. He also kidnapped 22-year-old Brittany Irish, the former girlfriend, and shot and wounded her 55-year-old mother, Kim Irish. Later, he killed 58-year-old Kevin Tozier at a woodlot where he stole a truck. He was also accused of shooting and injuring two other people.

Kyle Hewitt’s mother, Shelly, said after the sentencing that closure isn’t possible in so traumatic of a crime, but she also said she is glad Murray imposed the maximum possible sentence. She said in court on Monday that the case has left her suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and she can’t shake the events of Lord’s crime spree. “All of us have been given a life sentence with these changes,”she said in court. “It’s the least he deserves.”

Lord, who has a lengthy criminal history, was arrested in his uncle’s home in Houlton. He pleaded guilty last month to spare the victims’ families the ordeal of a trial. Lord’s attorney’s said on Monday that an appeal of his sentence is possible. Murray described Lord’s actions as a “criminal rampage” that had a “devastating effect” on the families and victims, and that a life sentence was the only appropriate punishment.

Lord didn’t offer a clue about what prompted the violence until Monday, when he said none of the events would have taken place if his son hadn’t died in May 2015. A Millinocket man is awaiting trial for his son’s death. “I do know how it feels to have a son murdered,” Lord said in a statement that was read aloud by one of his defense lawyers, David Bate. “I do hope you all will find peace. I know there is nothing I can do or say that will bring Kyle and Kevin back.” “I’m sorry I took your daddy away,” the attorney read.

The parents of Brittany Irish said previously that Lord was furious at their daughter when she went to police about him abducting her and attacking her two days before the rampage. Because of his lengthy criminal record, he didn’t care about the consequences, they said.

"Sarahah is an anonymous messaging app: What’s the purpose, how to use and more","Sarahah, which has been created by Saudi developer ZainAlabdin Tawfiq has gone viral for a simple reason – it lets you send anonymous messages to people. Sarahah, which has been created by Saudi developer ZainAlabdin Tawfiq has gone viral for a simple reason – it lets you send anonymous messages to people.

We’ve all wanted to tell our friends or perhaps our bosses about their annoying habits. But most of us don’t have the courage to do this face-to-face. Well there’s an app that will let you deliver some criticism constructively. Sarahah, created by Saudi developer ZainAlabdin Tawfiq, has gone viral and allows anonymous messaging. But of course, the risk is that people will quickly start sending hateful texts to their friends, acquaintances and that’s already happening with Sarahah.

The idea is so popular, Sarahah was on top of Apple App Store in over 30 countries in July. The app has also become popular on Snapchat with people linking their Sarahah profiles to Snapchat Stories. According to a BBC report, this has over 300 million users already. So what is this viral messaging app all about? We answer everything you need to know.

What is Sarahah app?

“Sarahah helps people self-develop by receiving constructive anonymous feedback,” reads the apps description on Google Play Store. Interestingly, Sarahah means ‘honesty’ in Arabic, though this honesty is delivered anonymously. The app is available in English as well as Arabic for iOS and Android users.

So how does Sarahah app work?

Like any other app, after you’ve downloaded Sarahah, you’ll have to set up an account. Simply put in your username, name, email, and enter a password. This messaging app doesn’t require your mobile number, which makes sense given this is about anonymity.

Once logged in, you can share your Sarahah link (it usually reads xyz.sarahah.com) on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp or copy the link and post it to a different social network. Anyone who has the link will be able to send you messages. This could be friends, even strangers who are on the app or those who are not even on the app.

For sending a message, a user has click on the link, which will open a text box with a message, “Leave a constructive message.” Obviously, the constructive part is lost on most folks. People can type in their message and hit send. When a user receives the message, they just get the text and don’t know who sent this particular message.

What else does Sarahah offer? Is it like a regular messaging app?

No, this is not a regular messaging app, and other than sending random anonymous messages to people it doesn’t offer much. The tabs on the app are limited to Messages, Search, Explore, and Profile. All received, sent and favourite messages appear in ‘Messages’ tab. When you receive a message you can favourite it or block the user or even report it. Though what happens after you report a message is unclear.

The ‘Favorite’ tab shows messages where you have tapped the heart symbol. Sent shows all the ‘constructive’ criticism you have been sending on the app. Meanwhile ‘Search’ tab lets you search for people to send them anonymous messages. Next up, there’s an ‘Explore’ tab which isn’t live yet. “SOON. This feature will be available next update, be alert!,” reads the page. We’re not sure what the developers plan to do with this.

“Sarahah helps people self-develop by receiving constructive anonymous feedback,” read Sarahah’s description on Google Play Store. “Sarahah helps people self-develop by receiving constructive anonymous feedback,” read Sarahah’s description on Google Play Store.

Finally, the ‘Profile’ page lets you manage your profile. It shows a user’s profile picture along with Sarahah username, and number of messages received.

This app sounds like a nightmare. What are the privacy options?

Sarahah is perfect territory for cyber bullying. The problem is that avoiding some of the hate on the app is not easy. You can report a message, block user but what happens to those who send abusive messages is unclear.

Further you can go in the settings and disable the option to ‘Appear in search’. Another setting ensures that non-registered users can’t message you on the app. The big problem is there’s no way of knowing who’s sent you a message.

The app shows four icons below each message – a red flag to report message, block icon, reply, and a heart icon to mark message as favourite. Don’t mistake the reply button for actually replying to the person, who sent you the message. Reply, for some weird reason, lets you forward a message to friends via social media platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and more.

Sarahah is perfect territory for cyber bullying and in fact the app is popular with teens, who have been sharing their profile links on Snapchat. Sarahah is perfect territory for cyber bullying and in fact the app is popular with teens, who have been sharing their profile links on Snapchat.

Sarahah offers limited setting options as of now. While there’s an option to Logout of the app, we couldn’t find one to delete account on the app itself. To delete the account, you have to log into the website version of the messaging service and go to settings to remove accounts.

Where Sarahah’s privacy policy goes, the company says they won’t disclose the identity of the logged-in senders to users, except with their consent. So yes, if someone starts sending hateful messages or threats on the app, there’s no way of knowing their identity.

So should you be using Sarahah?

Sarahah is masquerading as a fun app to let friends or colleagues know their irritating public habits. But these things can quickly spiral out of control. The internet still remains a place which brings out the worst in people and with anonymous messaging there are grave risks attached.

Sarahah might remind some of apps like Secret, Whisper. The truth is that receiving rude messages will be a harrowing experience for most. While the app talks about giving ‘constructive feedback,’ remember even anonymous messages have the power to hurt.

Getting closer to deciding Afghan policy: Donald Trump,"US President Donald Trump. US President Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump has said that he is close to taking a decision on Afghanistan, for which his administration is carrying out a review of policy, with Senator John McCain unveiling his own plan for the war-torn country.

“We are getting close. We’re getting very close. It’s a very big decision for me,” Trump told reporters on Thursday at Bedminster in New Jersey, where he is on a vacation. “I took over a mess, and we’re going to make it a lot less messy. But that has been a place — 17 years, our longest war, I read in one of your columns. And, frankly, it’s going to be a decision that’s going to be made very soon,” Trump said without giving a timeline for the policy review.

The State Department said the US’ Afghan policy review is still under way. “There have been a lot of conversations and negotiations with the president’s national security team. Of course, that includes Secretary (of State) Tillerson as part of that,” State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said.

“We are looking at this as not just a solution to Afghanistan, but also a broader concern that incorporates India and Pakistan as well as a regional solution. We just don’t have that plan,” she said in response to a question. Earlier in the day, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee John McCain said that the US is losing in Afghanistan as he unveiled his own strategy for the war-torn country.

“We must face facts, we are losing in Afghanistan and time is of the essence if we intend to turn the tide,” McCain said as he announced introducing the new Afghan strategy as an amendment to the National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA) 2018, which is slated to come up for discussion before the Senate next month.

The goal of this strategy, he noted, is to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a sanctuary for terrorists to plot and conduct attacks against America, its allies, or their’s. “To accomplish this goal, we need an integrated civil-military approach to bolster US counter-terrorism efforts, strengthen the capability and capacity of the Afghan government and security forces, and intensify diplomatic efforts to facilitate a negotiated peace process in the country in cooperation with regional partners,” he said.

Calling for an enduring American troop presence in Afghanistan, McCain has proposed tough measures against Pakistan for its continued support to terrorists. “Imposing graduated diplomatic, military, and economic costs on Pakistan as long as it continues to provide support and sanctuary to terrorist and insurgent groups, including the Taliban and the Haqqani Network,” said the McCain strategy on Afghanistan.

Simultaneously, he proposed outlining the potential benefits of a long-term US-Pak strategic partnership that could result from the latter’s cessation of support to all terrorist and insurgent groups and constructive role in bringing about a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan.

He also called for intensification of American regional diplomatic efforts working through flexible frameworks for regional dialogue together with Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, India, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and other nations to promote Afghan political reconciliation.

Calling for increasing the number of US counter-terrorism forces in Afghanistan, McCain proposes providing the US military with status-based targeting authorities against the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and other terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its allies, and core interests.

America is adrift in Afghanistan. President Obama’s “don’t lose” strategy has put the US on a path to achieving the opposite result, McCain said. “Now, nearly seven months into President Trump’s administration, we’ve had no strategy at all as conditions on the ground have steadily worsened. The thousands of Americans putting their lives on the line in Afghanistan deserve better from their commander-in-chief,” he said.

Snapchat parent Snap misses growth estimates as Facebook copying takes toll,"Number of daily users actually was below expectation. Revenue also disappointed, and the shares tumbled as much as 18 percent in late trading. (Image Source: Bloomberg) Number of daily users actually was below expectation. Revenue also disappointed, and the shares tumbled as much as 18 percent in late trading. (Image Source: Bloomberg)

Snap Inc.’s growth again fell short of estimates, feeding fears that aggressive competition from Facebook Inc is blunting the younger social-media company’s potential just months after its initial public offering.

The Los Angeles-based company said daily active users reached 173 million in the second quarter, compared with 166 million in the prior period. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected 175 million on average. Revenue also disappointed, and the shares tumbled as much as 18 percent in late trading.

Since its March public debut, the maker of the Snapchat mobile application for sending disappearing photos and videos has said it would become more popular as the company innovates and adds tools. In the second quarter, Snap added a maps function for users to see where friends are, as well as a search section. Yet rival Facebook has been successfully copying some of Snap’s key features on its larger social-media properties, drawing away users that might otherwise have downloaded Snapchat.

Facebook is also exerting pressure in the mobile advertising market. Snap said quarterly revenue was $181.7 million, missing the $185.8 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. While Snap has been updating its offerings to give advertisers more sophisticated options, the company has been struggling to prove it can secure its position in a market dominated by Facebook and Alphabet’s Google Inc.

Also read:Snapchat isn’t interested in becoming Facebook: Report

This was a “make or break quarter” for Snap, James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi Hardt & Co., said in a note to investors. “Snap has tremendous potential if it can capitalize on the opportunity in front of it as an alternative platform for advertisers,” but the company is “under pressure from multiple fronts. The company’s shares slid as low as $11.31 in extended trading following its earnings release. The stock has slumped 19 percent since Snap’s March 1 IPO at $17 a share, closing at $13.77 in New York on Thursday.

On a call with investors Thursday, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel dismissed the threat from rival services. “We’ve always been last to market competing against giant companies, and we’ve historically been able to grow our business in markets that are highly competitive and saturated by our competitors because we’re so focused on innovation,” he said.

Spiegel has been urging investors to think of Snap as different from Facebook. For example, the Snapchat app works more like a messaging product with a curated media section — it doesn’t have a feed with ads slotted in like Facebook’s namesake network and its Instagram app The company isn’t focused on getting as big as possible, like Facebook. Instead, it wants to add users in the most lucrative markets — such as the U.S. — and get them more deeply addicted.

“We’d have to add more than 10 million daily active users in the rest of world for every 1 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada in order to make the same amount of money,” Spiegel said.

Snap reported average revenue per user of $1.05 in the second quarter, with most of its growth coming from North America, bolstering the company’s argument that it’s growing in the right places. Daily active users on average posted 20 snaps a day. Users under 25 years old spent 40 minutes a day on Snapchat, compared to the 32 minutes a day for that age group that Instagram reports.

The company reported a net loss in the period of $443.1 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with a loss of $115.9 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. The stock also traded lower last week as some inside investors got the ability to sell their shares for the first time, after a lockup period following the IPO. The first lockup expired July 31. Spiegel said he and co-founder Bobby Murphy won’t sell any of their shares this year, even once they’re free to do so.

As Snap becomes cheaper, the company could be attractive to acquirers, said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities. Spiegel, who has the majority of the voting power along with Murphy, is unlikely to want to sell this early, Seyrafi wrote in a note to investors. “However, if Facebook continues to shamelessly copy Snap’s features and there is no clear road ahead for Snap to become net income or free cash flow positive, Mr. Spiegel’s position may change,” Seyrafi said.

AIFF to evaluate bids of four new clubs for I-League on August 18,"Ozone FC and Kerala’s Gokulam FC are two of the four teams who have submitted the bid documents. Ozone FC and Kerala’s Gokulam FC are two of the four teams who have submitted the bid documents.

The All India Football Federation’s (AIFF) bid evaluation committee will meet on August 18 to decide the fate of four new clubs from Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat and Rajasthan that are keen to participate in the 2017-18 I-League.

Bengaluru’s Ozone FC and Kerala’s Gokulam FC are two of the four teams who have submitted the bid documents, a senior I-League official said.

“The decision will be taken on August 18,” he said.

The I-League has never seen participation from Rajasthan and Gujarat in its 10 years’ history.

If Ozone FC, which competes in I-League second division, makes the cut then there will be two teams from Bengaluru in I-League and ISL.

Bengaluru FC have opted for ISL after it was given an official status of an AFC Cup berth as both the tournaments will run parallel after AIFF’s merger plan failed.

If Gokulam FC’s bid is accepted, they will be the first team from Kerala after Chirag United were relegated in 2011- 12.

Liverpool reject Barcelona’s 100 million euros bid for Philippe Coutinho: Reports,"Barcelona want Philippe Coutinho to replace Neymar. Barcelona want Philippe Coutinho to replace Neymar.

Liverpool reportedly stuck to their stand on Wednesday that their striker Philippe Coutinho is not for sale when they rejected the second bid from Spanish giants Barcelona for 100 million euros (£90 million).

The Reds, who bought Coutinho from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013 are intent to not let go of the Brazilian, who scored 14 goals last season for the Premier League club. In January, he signed a new five-year deal with Liverpool but had expressed his desire to play for the Catalans.

After Neymar’s departure from the club to Paris Saint Germain in a record 222 million euros deal, Barca had stepped up their bid to get a forward that can replace the void left by Neymar. Last weekend, the Spanish club directors are in England to close the deal.

On Tuesday, there were reports that Barcelona directors Oscar Grau, Raul Sanllehi and Javier Bordas were in England to close a deal on the 25-year old Coutinho. The Spanish club’s initial bid was at £70m.

According to a Mirror.co.uk report, Barcelona are even ready to offer a player to exchange of Coutinho. The report further suggests that the player being offered by Barceclona is reportedly Andre Gomes, who joined the club from Valencia in 2016 but failed to impress.

"Only when authorities consider racers for Arjuna awards, motorsport will gain popularity: Gaurav Gill","Gaurav Gill is a two-time Asia Pacific Rally (APRC) Champion. (Source: Express Archive) Gaurav Gill is a two-time Asia Pacific Rally (APRC) Champion. (Source: Express Archive)

Indian rally driver Gaurav Gill is the latest sportstar to hit out at the Arjuna awards selection committee. This came after he was ignored for the prestigous award. Stating that the panel should have recogized rally driving for the Awards, Gill questioned that if other sports like golf and cuesports can be recognized by the government then why not motor racing. It may be recalled here that only in 2015 did the Sports Ministry recognise motor racing as a sport by including FMSCI in the list of national sports federations.

In an interview with the PTI, Gill, said, “I would call them games (golf, carrom and cuesports), not even a sport with due respect to the people who have received the awards in these disciplines”.

Gill who is a two-time Asia Pacific Rally (APRC) Champion, said, “It is only when the authorities consider racers for Arjuna awards, motorsport will gain popularity and will become a career option for masses. It cannot be the other way around”.

Gill also spoke about popular sports and how the system is biased towards. The 35-year-old said, “Any cricketer who throws 10 good balls or does well once in a while, is awarded. It is a joke,” and added, “In my sport, I have been competing with best in the business but still there is no support.”

China: Death toll in Sichuan earthquake mounts to nine,"Chinese paramilitary police take care of a survivor after an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou county, Ngawa prefecture, Sichuan province. (CNS/Chen Yunhua via Reuters) Chinese paramilitary police take care of a survivor after an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou county, Ngawa prefecture, Sichuan province. (CNS/Chen Yunhua via Reuters)

At least nine people were killed and 164 other injured after a 7-magnitude earthquake jolted a remote but popular tourist destination in China’s southwest last night, the state media reported on Wednesday. The quake has left nine people dead and 164 others injured. Five among the dead were visitors to the popular tourist destination of Jiuzhaigou national park, Xinhua news agency said citing a China Earthquake Networks Center (CENC) statement.

The massive earthquake struck at 9:19 PM (local time) Tuesday and the epicenter was monitored at a depth of 20 km, it said. Jiuzhaigou, or Jiuzhai Valley, is a national park known for spectacular waterfalls and karst formations. More than 34,000 people visited the tourist attraction Tuesday. So far, 31,500 tourists have been relocated to safe places.

The local government has organised tourist coaches and private-owned vehicles to rush to the affected areas to help transport the stranded tourists. Power, communication and water supply in the county seat have basically recovered. So far, the Jiuzhaigou County has dispatched more than 90 emergency vehicles and 1,200 personnel to participate in the rescue work. The county also sent consultants to hotels, rural inns and streets to offer possible counselling service for tourists.

The quake was felt in the provincial capital Chengdu, about 300 km south of the epicentre, and other regions in the neighbouring provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi, the Xinhua report said. President Xi Jinping has called for all-out efforts to rapidly organise relief work and rescue the injured people.

Authorities should check the impact of the earthquake, evacuate and settle visitors and local people, and reduce death and injuries as much as possible, Xi said. As the earthquake took place during the flood period and tourism season, authorities should enhance meteorological early warning and geological monitoring to guard against other disasters and try their best to protect people’s lives and property, he added.

Premier Li Keqiang also urged local authorities to go all out in relief and monitoring work. China’s cabinet, the State Council, has sent a national work team to the disaster-hit area to guide relief work. Local governments have also activated top-level emergency response procedures.

Sichuan is a quake-prone region. In May 2008, an 8.0-magnitude earthquake struck Wenchuan and killed more than 80,000 people. In 2013, a 7.0-magnitude quake hit Lushan, in which 196 people were killed.

Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia gets permanent bail in graft charges,"In 2011, the anti-corruption watchdog sued the BNP chief and three others for embezzlement of 31.5 million Bangladeshi Taka of the Zia Charitable Trust. (File Photo) In 2011, the anti-corruption watchdog sued the BNP chief and three others for embezzlement of 31.5 million Bangladeshi Taka of the Zia Charitable Trust. (File Photo)

The High Court today granted permanent bail to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in a corruption case involving embezzlement of 21 million Bangladeshi Taka. The graft case was filed in 2008. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) case accused Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and four others in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.

The bench of Justice M Enayetur Rahim and Justice Shahidul Karim passed the order today after holding the final hearing on a ruling issued by the High Court in 2008, The Daily Star reported. Khaleda, accused in 37 cases, is now on bail in all the cases, said Advocate Zakir Hossain Bhuiyan, a lawyer to the BNP chief.

The court in 2008 issued a rule asking the government to explain why the BNP chief should not be granted regular bail in the case. The court said if Khaleda misuses the bail, the trial court concerned may scrap her bail.

Of the six accused, Khaleda, former BNP lawmaker Salimul Haq Kamal and businessman Sharfuddin Ahmed are on bail while the others including Tarique have been absconding, the report said. In 2008, the ACC filed the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case against six, including Zia and her son Tarique Rahman.

It alleged that the defendants had embezzled 21 million Bangladeshi Taka from funds meant for the trust, which reportedly came from a foreign bank. In 2011, the anti-corruption watchdog sued the BNP chief and three others for embezzlement of 31.5 million Bangladeshi Taka of the Zia Charitable Trust. The orphanage case is under trial at the Dhaka Special Judges Court 3.

Suffering from lower back pain? A new smart underwear may help,"The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs. (File Photo) The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs. (File Photo)

Scientists have developed a smart, mechanised undergarment that can help reduce stress and pain on the lower back muscles. Engineers at the Vanderbilt University in the US combined biomechanics and advances in wearable technology to create the undergarment. Over half of all adults will experience low back pain in their lifetimes, researchers said. The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs.

The sections are connected by sturdy straps across the middle back, with natural rubber pieces at the lower back and glutes. The device is designed so that users engage it only when they need it. A simple double tap to the shirt engages the straps. When the task is done, another double tap releases the straps so the user can sit down, and the device feels and behaves like normal clothes. The device also can be controlled by an app that the team created users tap their phones to engage the smart clothing wirelessly via Bluetooth.

Eight subjects tested the device leaning forward and lifting weights while holding their position at 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Using motion capture, force plates and electromyography, researchers showed that the device reduced activity in the lower back extensor muscles by an average of 15-45 per cent for each task. The team’s testing proved that the smart clothing offloads stress on the low back. The focus of the technology is not to treat those with existing back pain but to prevent it by reducing stress and fatigue on the low back muscles.

National-level wrestler electrocuted: Officials say ‘building may have been declared condemned; power connection was illegal’,"A wrestler died after being electrocuted. (Representational image.) A wrestler died after being electrocuted. (Representational image.)

A 22-year-old wrestler, who had played at national level and had won many medals at the state level, was electrocuted when he allegedly tried to get water pumped out from the waterlogged office of the Jharkhand State Wrestling Association (JSWA), operating out of a dilapidated pavilion of Jaipal Singh Stadium in Ranchi on Tuesday.

The building where the incident occurred may have been declared “condemned or dangerous”. Also, the power connection to the building was illegal.

The Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) has set up a probe to ascertain the facts. The State Sports Department too has launched its own probe into the incident. The police said that the wrestler died due to electrocution and registered a case of unnatural death.

The stadium is being re-done to give way to a multi-purpose cultural centre hub, to be called Rabindra Bhawan, the foundation stone for which was laid by former President Pranab Mukherjee on April 2. The mega complex, to be constructed at a cost of over Rs 150 crores, was supposed to have conference halls, seminar rooms and place for exhibitions.

According to the police, Vishal Kumar Verma, son of Basant Ram Verma, a resident of Bhutaha Mohalla (Chaiti Tola), had gone to the building in Jaipal Stadium, where the JSWA office was located, to pump out the water that had entered the office in the wake of heavy downpour in the capital over the last fortnight. Some other wrestlers also used live in that building on the first floor.

“In the process, Vishal got electrocuted around 1 p.m. He was rushed to Sadar Hospital by his fellow wrestlers, who lived on the first floor of the building. Verma was declared brought dead. The hospital authorities informed us. We have registered a case of unnatural death. Following a detailed post-mortem report, we will proceed further. Investigations so far has revealed that the electricity connection to the office was illegal,” said officer-in-charge (Kotwali) Shyam Nandan Mandal.

The honorary secretary of JSWA, Bhola Nath Singh, said that Vishal used to live nearby and would often be entrusted with the keys to the office.

“He was well disciplined and we often would give him the keys, as he stayed close by. I had not gone to the office for the last 45 days because, during the rainy season, the condition had become very bad. The entire field has been dug up for the new project (Rabindra Bhavan) and there is no provision for drainage. As a result, the entire office was flooded. Vishal had met me on Tuesday morning. He was at home when he got a call from somebody and then left. I do not know what exactly led to the incident. We have contributed Rs 1 lakh to the family and will continue to help them,” said Singh, holding the post since 2000.

Singh also claimed that the space was provided to the JSWA in 1998 by the then District Sports Officer. “There were other offices too. Then, in 2007, we were asked to shift to Birsa Munda Stadium, as it had bigger space. In the mean time, we were given some grant by the government to open an office. We opened it in Jaipal Singh stadium, as we were already using that space,” he said, adding that he was not aware of any notice regarding power connection.

Singh added that Vishal had got the fourth position in the last national level event, besides winning gold many times at the state level. “He was good at Greco-Roman and Freestyle both. I had suggested him to fill up a form for job in Central Coalfields Limited as a helper on the basis of his performance. However, he was yet to do it,” he said.

Vishal was the youngest among six siblings, while his father worked at a clothes shop. The family has demanded compensation from the government.

Director (Sports) Ranendra Kumar said: “A team has been constituted to probe the circumstances leading to the incident. We will be giving his family compensation, as per the existing policy. Nothing written has come on record to show that the office was allotted to JSWA. The facts are being ascertained.”

Executive Engineer (New Capital Division) of Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited, Ravi Shanker, said: “The power connection to the building had been disconnected more than two years ago. We were also given to understand that the building had been declared dangerous. We had given temporary connection to contractors there for carrying out their renovation work regarding Rabindra Bhavan. A small office of Municipal Corporation there too has a connection. But the building, where the incident occurred has no connection.”

RMC spokesperson Naresh Sinha said: “The complex was handed over to the RMC from Ranchi Regional Development Authority (RRDA) about two years ago so that we can carry out the renovation. We were given to understand that the pavilion building had been declared dangerous or condemned. However, we have constituted a team to inquire into it and submit report within seven days. This will ascertain the status of that building.”

Kenyans choose next president in fiercely contested vote,"Voters line up early morning in cold weather at a polling station in the Kibera Slums Nairobi, Kenya, Tuesday, Aug. 8, 2017, to cast their vote.

Kenyans on Tuesday voted in large numbers in an election that pits President Uhuru Kenyatta against challenger Raila Odinga in this East African economic hub known for its relative, long-term stability as well as the ethnic allegiances that shadow its democracy. Voters formed long lines at many polling stations before dawn, waiting for the chance to cast ballots in the tightly contested race for the presidency as well as for more than 1,800 elected positions, including governors, legislative representatives and county officials.

A key concern was whether Kenya would echo its 2013 election, a mostly peaceful affair despite opposition allegations of vote-tampering, or the 2007 election, which led to violence fueled by ethnic divisions that killed more than 1,000 people. Kenyatta, the 55-year-old son of Kenya’s first president after independence from British colonial rule, campaigned on a record of major infrastructure projects, many backed by China, and claimed strong economic growth. Odinga, 72, is also the son of a leader of the independence struggle and has cast himself as a champion of the poor and a harsh critic of endemic corruption in many state institutions.

However, many voters are expected to vote along ethnic lines. President Kenyatta is widely seen as the candidate of the Kikuyu people, the country’s largest ethnic group. Odinga is associated with the Luo voting bloc, which has never produced a head of state. More than 300 people, including ethnic Maasai draped in traditional red blankets, waited for hours in the dark before polling station opened in the Rift Valley town of Il Bissil. Kenyan television also showed long lines of voters in the port city of Mombasa.

“This is a positive feedback for us,” polling official James Njaya said of the high turnout in Kibera, a poor area in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Like many Kenyan voters, 34-year-old Fred Nyakundi arrived at a polling station several hours before it opened and waited in line in the dark before casting his vote.

“The exercise is very slow, but I am happy with the service I got,” said Nyakundi, who owns a carpentry business in Nairobi. “I am going home to open the business and wait for results.”

Another voter, 41-year-old Fatuma Ramadhan, thought the voting procedure was speedy. She was able to vote at 6 a.m., when polling stations opened, and then opened her restaurant to serve breakfast to other voters. Reaction to the result could partly depend on the performance of Kenya’s electoral commission, which will collect vote counts from more than 40,000 polling stations. Fears of violence were increased by the murder of an electoral official in charge of technology days ahead of the election.

The election commission has said that about 25 percent of polling stations won’t have network coverage, meaning officials will have to move to find a better signal and transmit results by satellite telephones. By law, election officials have up to a week to announce results, though many analysts believe the outcome of the presidential race will be declared far sooner, possibly within one or two days.

The winner of the presidential race must get more than 50 percent of the votes as well as one-quarter or more votes in at least 24 of Kenya’s 47 counties, according to election officials. If the front-runner falls short of those benchmarks, the two top contenders will contest a run-off vote.

President Kenyatta and challenger Odinga also faced off in the 2013 election. Kenyatta won by a thin margin, with just over 50 percent of the vote; Odinga alleged voting irregularities and took his case to Kenya’s highest court, which ruled in Kenyatta’s favor by validating the results.

Kenya has nearly 20 million registered voters out of a population of more than 40 million. Former US Secretary of State John Kerry is among thousands of observers in Kenya for the election. The European Union has also dispatched monitors. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki is leading an African Union delegation.

In a speech late Monday, Kenyatta appealed to Kenyans to vote peacefully in large numbers. “How you have voted should not in any way reflect or change the manner in which you have related to your neighbor,” Kenyatta said. “Shake their hand, share a meal and tell them, ‘Let us wait for the results,’ for Kenya will be here long after this general election.”

Vishnu Vardhan out of singles but makes doubles semis with N Sriram Balaji,"Vardhan was the only Indian surviving in the singles but with his defeat, it ended the country’s challenge. Vardhan was the only Indian surviving in the singles but with his defeat, it ended the country’s challenge.

Vishnu Vardhan was ousted from the singles event following a straight-set defeat in the second round but progressed to the doubles semifinals with compatriot N Sriram Balaji at the ATP Challenger event in Jinan, China.

Vardhan was the only Indian surviving in the singles but with his 4-6 4-6 defeat against the sixth seed Ricardas Berankis from Lithuania, it ended the country’s challenge. Saketh Myneni, Sidharth Rawat, Balaji, Sasi Kumar Mukund and N Vijay Sundar had all bit dust in the first round itself.

Vardhan and Balaji though had success in the doubles as they made it to the last four with a fighting 7-6(4) 6-3 win over local pair of Di Wu and Zhzhen Zhang in the quarterfinals.

Last week, Vardhan and Balaji had won the doubles title at the USD 125,000 Chengdu Challenger, defeating the Taipei pair of Cheng-Peng Hsieh and Hsle-Yin Peng.

India drop place to 97th in FIFA rankings,"India retain their top 100 spot in the latest FIFA ranking. India retain their top 100 spot in the latest FIFA ranking.

India dropped a place in the latest FIFA rankings released on Thursday to stand at number 97. In July, India had reached their best FIFA ranking in the last 21 years as they stood at 96, the second highest ranking for the country ever.

The Blue Tigers did not play a single International match in the last one month, which resulted in a dip in the ranking. Stephen Constantine’s side, however, remained in the top 100 rankings. They last played against Nepal in a friendly on June 2 and defeated them 2-0 at home.

India currently stand at 341 points on the 97th position, four points behind 96th placed Zambia. The team has progressed brilliantly under the English manager Constantine, who started coaching the team when it was ranked 171st in the world. This is his second stint with India after taking charge. India have been on a seven-game winning streak.

We’re ranked 97 in the latest released @FIFAcom rankings. Keep supporting Indian Football #BackTheBlue #IndianFootball pic.twitter.com/oyNTXjCOSA — Indian Football Team (@IndianFootball) 10 August 2017

Constantine had said earlier in an interview to PTI, “I am not very good at mathematics. But if we are 93, I would be the happiest man. That would be the historical highest. I am going to do it.”

India will now play a three-nation tournament with Mauritius and St. Kitts and Nevis at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium in Chennai from August 19th to 27th. India will then play against Palestine in a friendly on October 2.

Floods in northern Vietnam have killed 26 people and washed away hundreds of homes over the past week, causing damage estimated at more than 940 billion dong ($41 million), the government’s disaster agency said on Monday. Fifteen people were still missing and the search had been hampered by damage to roads from floods and landslides, the agency said in a report.

Flooding has crippled four provinces, damaging water systems and farms, where rice and fruit are grown, it added, with about 200 homes destroyed and 400 more affected. “We are fixing roads, water systems and other infrastructure to make sure people can resettle,” the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said in the report.

"Casemiro, Isco score to help Real Madrid win the Super Cup, watch highlights","Real Madrid’s Isco celebrates scoring their second goal. (Source: Reuters) Real Madrid’s Isco celebrates scoring their second goal. (Source: Reuters)

Real Madrid outclassed Manchester United on Tuesday to win the UEFA Super Cup despite a rather sad pre-season. Goals from Casemiro and Isco sealed the victory for Los Blancos while Romelu Lukaku shone as he joined the illustrious list of debut scorers for the Red Devils.

It was the Santiago Bernabeu side’s second consecutive Super Cup title under manager Zinedine Zidane after back to back Champions League trophies.

Here are all the goals of the Super Cup final:

Real Madrid 1 – 0 Manchester United

Casemiro opened the goal scoring in the 24th minute with a fine converseion of Carvajal strike. He timed his run so well that it even confused the commentators if it was offside. He got beyond Lindelof and slid in the ball to get the better of De Gea.

Benzema set it up well for Isco to display his own skills before he hit the ball in in the 52nd minute to dent further chances of United making a comeback. He ran through three United defenders to take the return ball and roll his shot into the far corner.

China uses forced labour to export products to US: Report,"“China maintains a network of prison labour facilities that use forced labour to produce goods intended for export — a violation of US-China trade agreements and US law. “China maintains a network of prison labour facilities that use forced labour to produce goods intended for export — a violation of US-China trade agreements and US law.

China continues to use forced labour to produce goods intended for export to the US, a violation of the American law and bilateral trade agreements, according to a report. The report titled ‘US Exposure to Forced Labour Exports from China: Developments since the US Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015′ states that the value of the Chinese forced labour exports to the US is unknown as China’s forced labour industry has long been opaque.

This opacity is exacerbated by the use of middlemen companies to market the products in question for export, by US inspectors’ lack of access to suspected sites and by the Chinese government’s refusal to agree with the US government on what constitutes forced labour and thus which products are governed by relevant bilateral agreements, it said. “China maintains a network of prison labour facilities that use forced labour to produce goods intended for export — a violation of US-China trade agreements and US law.

“US officials continue to face considerable difficulty in combating exports of these forced labour products, since cooperation from Chinese interlocutors has remained at low levels for years,” the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in the report released yesterday. It said the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had not been permitted to make site inspections in China since 2009. The report said Chinese officials routinely deny that the suspected forced labour was occurring, claiming the factories in question do not exist or that they do not make the products in question.

According to the US Department of Labour, known products linked to Chinese forced labour as of September 2016 are artificial flowers, bricks, Christmas decorations, coal, cotton, electronics, fireworks, footwear, garments and construction nails. ICE, the agency responsible for identifying foreign manufacturers that use forced or child labour, has only five agents in mainland China and three in Hong Kong. An ICE official told the Commission in February this year that the agency’s agents had not been permitted to conduct inspections of suspected forced labour facilities since 2009, the report said.

Discovery of India,"Photograph by Anushree Fadnavis Photograph by Anushree Fadnavis

In one photograph, Anita, a transgender, strikes a model-like pose in a black sari at the door of the women’s compartment of a Mumbai local. Adorning her back is the tattoo of an angel, which she believes protects her at all times. In another frame, a woman channels her inner leopard — if her appearance is anything to go by. She is dressed in a top and a scarf printed with the spots of the wild cat.

These photographs, shot by 29-year-old photojournalist Anushree Fadnavis on her mobile phone since 2013, reveal a deep fascination with the ladies compartment of Mumbai’s local trains. Part of her series Train Diaries, which is a hit on Instagram, these photographs form her exhibition, “A Million Mutinies Later – India at 70”, at Ffotogallery’s Turner House Gallery and The Angel, in Cardiff, Wales. The exhibition is on till July 22.

“A lot of women use their time during their commute on the train very creatively and almost become like a second family after getting to know each other. They knit, do crochet, cut vegetables, apply henna on their their hands, and even get dressed here. In the men’s compartment, conversations are about work. In the women’s cabin, the chitter chatter is fuelled by emotions. Many a times, I have cried, become angry and let go of a lot of emotions in the women’s compartment,” says Fadnavis.

Held in partnership with the Nazar Foundation/Delhi Photo Festival for UK-India Year of Culture 2017, the exhibition offers a bird’s eye view of India since Independence. Nineteen artists, including Bharat Sikka, Javed Iqbal and Arko Datto, have investigated the everyday revolutions that have transformed the social, cultural and political fabric of the nation through their lens-based art, such as photographs, films and videos. “Looking at the last 70 years, the economic liberalisation of India has brought a range of changes. We wanted to explore the different themes of representing India, which is very dynamic. Usually, one looks at a revolution to define a nation. We were looking at the million small revolutions taking place across the country, whether in the community, nation or its people,” says Anshika Varma, one of the curators.

Through street photography, Delhi-based photographer Monica Tiwari has documented the rise of Gurgaon, its urbanised setting surrounded by the remnants of its rural past. A group of Haryanvi women, with faces hidden under their pallu, are seen dancing to musical beats. “She has ended up documenting a space that is at that moment of transition. It is not a village or a town and is on its way of becoming an urban city,” says Varma. A line of cows stands tall before one of Gurgaon’s enormous glass skyscrapers, which are a storehouse for the MNC offices mushrooming within its commercial hub, Cyber City. “Revolution happens in many forms, it is not merely shouting ‘Inquilab Zindabad’. It might mean migrating from smaller places like villages to cities. That itself is a revolution, where one goes ahead and explores the horizons, and migration is a sign that things are changing. This ambition that has come is representative of India’s youth,” she adds.

Artist duo Yashaswini B Raghunandan and Ekta Mittal’s project “Behind the Tin Sheets”, comprises three films on the migration of labourers from across the country to Bangalore for the metro construction. Sikka’s series Matter offers a contemplative look through the landscape view of a mountain terrain enveloped in snow, reminiscent of the Himalayas, shots of a horse with trees behind and of a bandbajawallah, alongside the close-up of a CD. “He looks at the transition and change all over the world and how we come from the same matter. You can go from landscape to people to cosmos but it will still remain matter,” says Varma.

"Donald Trump warns North Korea, says ‘fire and fury’ not tough enough","Donald Trump took specific aim at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he had “disrespected our country greatly. He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he’s not getting away with it,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. (AP/File) Donald Trump took specific aim at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he had “disrespected our country greatly. He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he’s not getting away with it,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. (AP/File)

President Donald Trump warned North Korea again on Thursday not to strike Guam or U.S. allies, saying his earlier threat to unleash “fire and fury” on Pyongyang if it launched an attack may not have been tough enough. After North Korea disclosed plans to fire missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, Trump said the move would prompt “an event the likes of which nobody’s seen before.”

He took specific aim at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he had “disrespected our country greatly. He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he’s not getting away with it,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. “It’s not a dare. It’s a statement,” Trump said. “He’s not going to go around threatening Guam. And he’s not going to threaten the United States. And he’s not going to threaten Japan. And he’s not going to threaten South Korea.”

North Korea’s army will complete the plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near Guam, when they will be ready for Kim’s order, state-run KCNA news agency said. The plans called for the missiles to land in the sea 30-40 km (18-25 miles) from Guam. “Let’s see what he does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody’s seen before, what will happen in North Korea,” Trump said, without offering specifics.

Shortly after Trump spoke, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters in Mountain View, California, the United States still preferred a diplomatic approach to the North Korean threat and a war would be “catastrophic.” Asked if the United States was ready if North Korea took a hostile act, he said: “We are ready.”

Tension in the region has risen since the reclusive communist country, which staged two nuclear bomb tests last year, launched two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July in defiance of world powers. Trump has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. Far from toning down his words after saying on Tuesday that any threats by Pyongyang would be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,” Trump said those remarks may have not gone far enough. “Maybe it wasn’t tough enough,” Trump said.

Trump’s Tuesday comments unnerved allies in the region and drew criticism from some politicians and foreign policy experts at home as needlessly pugnacious at a time when more measured language would be appropriate. On Thursday in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on a working vacation, Trump also declared the U.S. nuclear arsenal “in tip-top shape, and getting better, and getting stronger.”

Asked if he would consider a pre-emptive strike against North Korea to deny it the ability to launch a nuclear attack against the United States, Trump said, “We’ll see what happens.” The United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. Trump also said new sanctions on North Korea approved by the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 5 that could slash by a third the country’s $3 billion annual export revenue probably would not be as effective as hoped. He pressed China, North Korea’s most important ally and trading partner, to do more.

‘CHINA CAN DO A LOT MORE’

“I think China can do a lot more, yes. … And I think China will do a lot more,” Trump said. Trump has threatened to impose punitive trade restrictions on China for its alleged trade abuses, and has delayed actions to impose broad restrictions on steel imports. He also has shelved plans to investigate misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property by China after Beijing signed on to deeper U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Trump said the United States loses a lot of money on trade with China. “It’s not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade,” Trump added.

The tensions between North Korea and the United States spurred a broad market sell-off in U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed with a 1.4 percent loss, marking the biggest one-day drop since May and registering just the third day all year that it closed with a loss of more than 1 percent. Wall Street’s fear index hit its highest level since Trump was elected, as investors snatched up insurance to protect against future stock market losses. Former defense officials and experts say any new military conflict with North Korea would likely escalate quickly to the use of nuclear weapons, bringing catastrophic casualties not seen since World War Two and an untold economic impact worldwide.

They warned the escalating war of words could risk a miscalculation that could result in conflict far beyond the scale of the 1950-53 Korean War, which claimed the lives of millions of Koreans, tens of thousands of Chinese and Americans and thousands from U.S. allies like Britain. Trump said the United States would “always consider negotiations” with Pyongyang, but faulted three of his predecessors, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, on their approach to North Korea.

Guam, a tropical island more than 3,000 km (2,000 miles) to the southeast of North Korea, is home to about 163,000 people. It has a strategically located U.S. air base, a Navy installation that includes a submarine squadron, a Coast Guard group and roughly 6,000 U.S. military service members. “Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,” KCNA said, calling Trump’s “fire and fury” comment “a load of nonsense.”

Congress accuses PM Modi of hypocrisy in fight against corruption,"Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi claimed that there had been a systematic dilution of the principal anti-corruption laws in the past three years. (File photo) Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi claimed that there had been a systematic dilution of the principal anti-corruption laws in the past three years. (File photo)

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for special initiatives to end corruption by 2022, the Congress Thursday accused him of hypocrisy and questioned the government’s resolve to fight corruption. It said the government has diluted the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, failed to appoint a Lokpal in the past three years on suspicious grounds and weakened the Prevention of Corruption Act while talking big on rooting out corruption.

Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi claimed that there had been a systematic dilution of the principal anti-corruption laws in the past three years. He said that amendments proposed by the government to the Whistle Blowers Protection (Amendment) Bill will make whistle-blowing “nugatory”.

He said the Amendment Bill prohibits reporting of disclosures related to corruption under 10 categories, including information that is likely to prejudicially affect sovereignty and integrity of India, security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the state, relations with foreign state or lead to incitement of an offence. “The 10 items are so broad, so subjective that the so-called exceptions will swallow the rule…” he said.

He said the government has not made a simple amendment to operationalise Lokpal Act. The Act, he said, states that the Lokpal may be appointed by a selection committee that shall comprise, among others, Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha.

"Banished from IPL, Raj Kundra starts another IPL — Indian Poker League","Raj Kundra flashed a smug smile as he launched the Indian Poker League (IPL). (Source: PTI) Raj Kundra flashed a smug smile as he launched the Indian Poker League (IPL). (Source: PTI)

“IPL just couldn’t keep me away, so I’m back.” Raj Kundra flashed a smug smile as he opened proceedings with this line. It wasn’t the only time that the uncanny similarity between his previous venture and the latest one popped up, either deliberately or otherwise, as he launched the Indian Poker League (IPL) on Tuesday.

It wasn’t the only time the former co-owner of the Rajasthan Royals, flanked by Bollywood actress and wife Shilpa Shetty, played on the identical acronym to introduce his latest project either.

As the afternoon progressed, it was clear that all parties involved in promoting the poker league had one agenda on their priority list: to shake off the gambling stigma intrinsically associated with the card game. It was ironic that the man leading that charge was one who was banished by the IPL (cricket) on proven allegations of betting.

Not surprisingly, Kundra couldn’t avoid being asked about his views on the IPL he used to be associated with even if he seemed adamant on only answering those about the IPL he now wants to be associated with. So when asked about the cricketing version of the IPL, the British national took the liberty of picking the tournament he wanted to talk about. “This is an ideal opportunity to put India on the global poker map,” said Kundra. “The winning team here will play as Team India at the World Cup.”

Kundra is no stranger to the business of sport having tried his hand at mixed martial arts in the past while he still co-owned Rajashtan Royals. Kundra is no stranger to the business of sport having tried his hand at mixed martial arts in the past while he still co-owned Rajashtan Royals.

The new venture, which has been recognised by the International Federation of Poker (IFP), has secured a spot for the Indian team in the Nations Cup, to be held in Oxford, England, in December. This will be the second time an Indian team will feature at an IFP event, after their sixth-placed finish at the 2013 Asian Nations Cup in China.

The two-day event, which will be held in Mumbai in October, is Kundra’s third business venture involving sport. His first came to an abrupt end, after the Lodha Commission banned him from the IPL (cricket) while suspending the team he then owned for two years in 2015.

“As part owner having 11.7 per cent of the franchise, Kundra should have conducted himself in accordance of his stature. Betting is a crime punishable in India and it is corrupt practice against BCCI constitution. It is difficult to accept that as an UK citizen, he did not know that betting was against the law in India,” Justice RM Lodha had observed after the verdict was passed on Kundra regarding his betting links to the 2013 IPL scandal.

Funnily enough, the one line Kundra repeated the most on Tuesday was that poker, the IPL in particular, ‘is not about gambling’.

Kundra is no stranger to the business of sport having tried his hand at mixed martial arts in the past while he still co-owned Rajashtan Royals.

The Super Fight League, that he had started in 2012 along with Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt, though hardly garnered much attention and is now co-owned by British businessman Bill Dosanjh and 2004 Athens Olympics silver medal winning boxer Amir Khan. And now comes his third foray, fuelled by an ominously familiar acronym.

"‘Poets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion’: Kiriti Sengupta","“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) “You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this — the state of a poet’s being — the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem’s purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem’s composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

“I think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,” Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no “great intention” when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of “changing the society” through his poems. “Poetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,” he added.

Sengupta’s “My Glass of Wine” is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India’s first poetry trilogy, “Dreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral”, which also bears two other works, “The Reverse Tree” and “Healing Waters Floating Lamps”. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,” quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer’s bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

“I’ve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don’t find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets’ work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,” he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible “to earn a living from writing poetry” in India. “Poets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,” said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled “Solitary Stillness” and is due to be published in August.

"Brighton won’t roll over for Manchester City, says Bruno","Bruno’s men begin their premier League challenge against Manchester City. (Source: Reuters) Bruno’s men begin their premier League challenge against Manchester City. (Source: Reuters)

Brighton and Hove Albion are eager to make their Premier League debut against Manchester City on Saturday and while the newly-promoted south coast club will enjoy the occasion there will be no party atmosphere at Amex Stadium, said captain Bruno.

“They have top players, but it is just 11 v 11 on the pitch and we need them to be uncomfortable,” the Spaniard told the club’s website.

“If they want to get something here, then they have to show their quality. If not, then we’re going to be ready to get the three points.

“We know it’s going to be a special day because it’s the first Premier League game at the Amex, and the first Premier League game for the club. But it’s not a party for us and we need to win.”

The 36-year-old also praised City manager and compatriot Pep Guardiola, who won 21 trophies in seven years while in charge of Barcelona and Bayern Munich before arriving at Man City ahead of last season.

“For me he is a brilliant manager because of his personality; he wants to play his football and doesn’t want to change,” Bruno added.

“That shows a lot of personality and character. When you also have the players he has, that makes it a massive challenge for us. It’s going to be a tough game.”

"West Bengal: Businessman shot at in Khardah, one arrested","Police have arrested one person in the case. (Representational image) Police have arrested one person in the case. (Representational image)

A 30-year-old businessman was shot at in broad daylight allegedly by two men from a point black range at Khardah in North-24 Parganas district on Thursday. Police have arrested one person in the case. Sources said that Babun Das sustained serious injuries on the lower portion of his abdomen, but his condition is stated to be stable.

Lot of construction works are ongoing in the area where the incident took place. Police are investigating whether the attack was planned by some syndicate group.

Italy shooting: Four killed in Southern Italy’s Puglia region,"More than 230 people have been murdered in Los Cabos alone so far this year. More than 230 people have been murdered in Los Cabos alone so far this year.

Four men were shot dead in an apparent gangland killing on Wednesday in southern Italy, police said, with two of the victims believed to be farmers who were targeted because they had witnessed the attack. The men were gunned down close to a railway crossing near the village of San Marco in Lamis in the Puglia region.

Two of the dead were named by police as Mario Luciano Romito, a well-known local crime boss, and his brother-in-law Matteo De Palma. They were travelling together in a black Volkswagen Beetle when a car drew alongside and fired at them.

The assailants then opened fire on two farmers sitting nearby in their car, killing one on the spot. The second died later in hospital. Italian media reported that they were brothers who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Galatasaray plotting to bring back Arda Turan from Barcelona,"Arda Turan spent seven seasons at Galatasaray – from 2004 till 2011. (Source: Reuters file) Arda Turan spent seven seasons at Galatasaray – from 2004 till 2011. (Source: Reuters file)

Galatasaray are trying to bring out-of-favour Barcelona forward Arda Turan back to the Turkish club, president Dursun Ozbek said on Tuesday. Arda, who made his professional debut for Galatasaray in 2004 and stayed at the club until joining Atletico Madrid in 2011, was an unused substitute in Barcelona’s 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense on Monday, even though coach Ernesto Valverde made 11 changes.

His exclusion has been reported in the Spanish media as a sign the Turk does not feature in Valverde’s plans for the season and that he is on his way out of Barca.

“Arda is a Galatasaray fan, he really loves the club and he is going to play for us again,” Ozbek told a news conference on Tuesday. “His only chance of playing in Turkey is here, and we hope he ends up seeing out his career at Galatasaray. We are working on his transfer.”

Arda has scored 15 goals in 55 appearances for Barca but has failed to hold down a first team place at Barca since switching from Atletico Madrid in 2015 for 34 million euros.

He made 14 league starts last season. His progress in his first campaign was stunted because he was banned from playing the first half of the 2014/15 season by the club’s existing transfer ban.

Galatasaray are Turkey’s most successful club with 20 league titles, but they finished fourth in the top flight last season, 13 points behind champions Besiktas.

Australia’s PM Malcolm Turnbull says same-sex wedding could be law this year,"Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. (File Photo) Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. (File Photo)

Australia’s prime minister said Tuesday that Parliament could legalize gay marriage this year if the nation’s voters endorse it in a rare nonbinding poll in November.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he expected the public would support marriage equality in the so-called plebiscite, and that he would personally campaign for a `yes’ vote. It would be only the fourth time in Australian history, and first time in 43 years, that the government puts a legally nonbinding question to the electorate. “I have other calls on my time as prime minister, but I will certainly support a `yes’ vote,” Turnbull told reporters.

The conservative Liberal Party-led coalition was narrowly re-elected in July 2016 with a promise to let voters decide whether Australia should recognize same-sex marriage through a popular vote. But the Senate in November blocked the plebiscite, which would cost 170 million Australian dollars ($135 million) and promote a divisive public debate.

The Liberal Party held a crisis meeting late Monday to resolve infighting and rejected a push to allow lawmakers to decide the issue now. The government on Tuesday endorsed the party decision to ask the Senate this week to reconsider allowing the plebiscite, which would be held Nov. 25. Voting would be compulsory and failure to vote would be punishable by a fine, though a voluntary vote would be held if the Senate again rejects the measure.

The result would not be legally binding and some lawmakers have already declared it would not sway their vote on gay marriage legislation. If most Australians want gay marriage, the Parliament would vote on legislation before the last two-week session of Parliament of the year ends on Dec. 7. “Strong leaders carry out their promises, weak leaders break them,” Turnbull told reporters.

Gay-rights advocates say enough lawmakers already back marriage equality to make same-sex marriage legal in Australia now. For the first time in Australian history, both the prime minister and opposition leader back the reform. Rights advocates see the plebiscite as both a delaying tactic forced by a hard right-wing minority and a strategy to undermine political support.

Opponents of the plebiscite argue that the government-funded advertising campaigns for the cases for and against would give authority to bigoted and homophobic arguments. Supporters say it would give ordinary people a voice in a debate dominated by activists.

If the Senate again blocks the plebiscite, the government intends to hold a voluntary postal plebiscite by Nov. 15. Voters would mail in their opinions instead of using ballot boxes at a cost of up to AU$122 million. Responses would be voluntary and therefore less indicative of public opinion.

Opponents argue that the postal plebiscite would also need Senate approval, and have threatened a court challenge if it proceeds. Turnbull said he is confident that the postal option did not need Senate endorsement. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, the government’s deputy Senate leader and an opponent of same-sex marriage, said some type of plebiscite is essential if Parliament is to decide the marriage equality question.

Sen. Nick Xenophon said his minor party’s opposition had not changed since they opposed the plebiscite in the November vote. Lyle Shelton, managing director of the Australian Christian Lobby, said his advocacy group had collected 55,000 signatures on a petition demanding a plebiscite. Sheldon handed the petition to Sen. Cory Bernardi, leader of the minor Australian Conservatives party, to present to the Senate. Bernardi has said he would vote against gay marriage regardless of what the plebiscite found.

"Scientists march against ‘unscientific, obscurantist ideas’ in Delhi","Scientists and students take part in ‘March for Science’ in Delhi on Wednesday. (Photo by Gajendra Yadav) Scientists and students take part in ‘March for Science’ in Delhi on Wednesday. (Photo by Gajendra Yadav)

In the first of its kind mobilisation by the scientific community, several hundred scientists and students from top institutions staged marches in more than 25 cities to raise voice against “propagation of unscientific, obscurantist ideas and religious intolerance” and stifling of funds for scientific research. The marches were held in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune and Bhubaneswar among other cities.A few institutions asked their scientists not to participate in the ‘March for Science’.

A mail sent out by the office of the director of Delhi-based CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) asked its scientists to stay away from the march. “I am directed to inform all the members of CSIR-IGIB that they are advised not to take part in the March for Science that is being organised tomorrow,” the mail said on Tuesday. IGIB is in additional charge of Sanjay Kumar, director of Palampur-based CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology. He could not be contacted and his office in Palampur said he was travelling. A source in CSIR headquarters, however, said there was no such direction from the top.A few other heads of institutions had also been circumspect about their scientists participating. Director of Pune-based NCCS Shekhar Mande had told The Indian Express a few days ago that although he agreed with some of the concerns raised by his peers, a publicly funded research laboratory like his should not “go against the government”.

The event was modelled on a similar march organised in about 600 American and European cities on April 22 this year, calling for more “robust funding for science” and “demanding that the governmental policies be guided by scientific evidence”. In Mumbai, more than 200 scientists participated in the march. “The rally is not just to demand more funds for science. It is time scientists come together to speak about the shift we are seeing in government funds for unscientific research,” said Aniket Sule, astrophysicist attached with the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education.N Krishnan, scientist with Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), said, “Funding is seen as a way of controlling. We have to beg for funds for a process which should not be controlled by an entity that does not understand the process of research.” He said scientists were forced to protest openly because they perceive there is an attack on science. In Pune, more than 600 students, scientists and social activists marched the streets.

Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti’s Hamid Dhabolkar, son of slain anti-superstition activist Narendra Dhabolkar, said his late father would have been happy to witness such a march. “My father worked tirelessly all his life to eradicate superstition. He taught people to reason and question. I am elated to see the younger generation act responsibly and take to the streets for their rights…,” he said. With ENS, Mumbai, Pune

China urges North Korea to make ‘smart’ decision after sanctions,"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, second from left, prepares for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, second from right, in the sidelines of the 50th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and its Dialogue Partners Sunday, Aug. 6, 2017 in suburban Pasay city south Manila, Philippines.

(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged North Korea today to make a “smart decision”, after the United Nations imposed tough new sanctions on the isolated regime over its missile and nuclear programmes. “It will help the DPRK to make the right and smart decision,” Wang told reporters, according to a translator, after discussing the sanctions with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Hong-Yo ahead of a regional security forum in the Philippine capital Manila.

However Wang also emphasised that negotiations were the only way to solve the issue, after the United States had left open the possibility of military action against Kim Jong-Un’s regime. Wang called for a resumption of the stalled six-nation talks — hosted by China and including the United States, Japan, Russia as well as the two Koreas — aimed at curtailing the North’s atomic ambitions.

“It’s not that easy but it is a direction we need to work together towards,” Wang said of the six-nation talks.

“Only dialogue and negotiation is the correct way out to address the Korean peninsula issue.” The top diplomats from all those nations are in Manila for the ASEAN Regional Forum, an annual security forum, which begins on Monday.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has no plans to hold talks with Ri in the Philippines, his aides have said, but could meet him inside one of the meetings. The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously backed a US-drafted resolution that significantly strengthened sanctions on North Korea, imposing a ban on exports aimed at depriving Pyongyang of $1 billion in annual revenue.

The sweeping measures were the first of that scope to be imposed on North Korea since US President Donald Trump took office and highlighted China’s willingness to punish its Pyongyang ally.

The resolution imposed a full ban on exports of coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore as well as fish and seafood by the cash-starved state — stripping North Korea of a third of its export earnings estimated at $3 billion per year. US Ambassador Nikki Haley said the stiffer measures brought the penalty imposed on North Korea for its ballistic missile tests “to a whole new level” and that the council had put Kim “on notice”.

"India vs Sri Lanka: Excited and nervous to perform in third Test, says Kuldeep Yadav","Kuldeep yadav picked four wickets against Australia on his debut. (Source: PTI) Kuldeep yadav picked four wickets against Australia on his debut. (Source: PTI)

Kuldeep Yadav remains a leading contender to come in to the lineup for India against Sri Lanka in the third Test that begins at Pallekele from Saturday. The chinaman, however, will face competition from Axar Patel who was brought in as the replacement for Ravindra Jadeja into the squad following his one match suspension due to breach of ICC code of conduct. Even though Axar has been called in, Kuldeep remains the overwhelming favourite to come into the XI as he has been in the island nation since the beginning of the series and is more aware of the conditions.

“Obviously there is excitement. I was excited to play my debut Test as well. So if I get a chance to play in Sri Lanka I will be very happy because this will be a result of my hard work. While I am excited, I am also nervous because I want to perform,” said Kuldeep to Hindustan Times.

“It is still not clear (if I will play) because there are three days left for practice. But ever since I have come here, (Ravi) Shastri sir keeps on motivating me. I have been doing nets and he has been talking to me during the nets from even before the first Test. It is a good experience,” he added.

Should Kuldeep play, it would be his second Test match. He had made his Test debut against Australia earlier in the year and had made an instant impact in Dharamsala. He picked up four wickets in the Test and steered India to a 2-1 series win in the process. Ever since, he’s been made to play the waiting game with R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja holding the leading spinners role.

“Definitely you will have to wait for your chance if the No. 1 and No. 2 spinners in the world are in the same Test squad. You cannot walk into the team so easily and you have to wait as that’s the rule of cricket. I try to stay with them mostly and keep talking to them and they help me a lot. So I have learnt a lot from them especially playing Test cricket with them.”

“I have also been working with Bharat Arun for the past 10 years, ever since I was playing in Under-16 and then in Under-19 cricket too. I share a lot of things with him and he tells me a lot about bowling as well. He has been seeing me ever since I was a junior cricketer and he knows what I should do and what not to do,” Kuldeep said.

He recalled the opening Test where he picked up 4/68 in the opening innings and admitted that he had entered that fixture having spent sleepless night. “For me, the single biggest important thing was playing in the debut Test. There cannot be a bigger moment than that. I was very nervous too, there was a lot of pressure and I couldn’t sleep at night. Obviously when you are close to achieving your dream there is nervousness and playing Test cricket has always been my dream,” said the 22-year-old spinner.

“In my head I wasn’t thinking who I am playing against, whether Australia or New Zealand, I was only thinking about taking as many wickets as possible. I just wanted to show what skill I have. And that is what I did. Anil sir and Ajinkya bhai both told me to just enjoy my bowling and do what I do in nets or what I have been doing since childhood.”

“And in my head, the first ball was very important. I wanted to bowl the first ball very well and that was my thinking. So when the first ball was good, and 1-2 overs went well, I grew in confidence and lost my nervousness,” he added.

India will be without Ravindra Jadeja in the third and final Test against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters) India will be without Ravindra Jadeja in the third and final Test against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters)

Even though he didn’t get a Test match thereafter, he did get a chance to don the India colours in the limited overs format when India toured the Caribbean. “Ahead of the ODI debut I wasn’t as nervous. There was pressure in ODIs as well because the batsmen are attacking you. It took me three overs to settle down on my ODI debut before I figured out how to adjust my lengths as the wickets were very slow in the West Indies.”

“I also talked to Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) and Virat (Kohli) bhai and it became easier for me to perform in every match. It helps if the captain believes in you as half your work is done. Captain’s belief is very important and Virat bhai supports me a lot.

Sri Lankan players employed the sweep technique effectively in the second Test but Kuldeep said it also opens up doors for the spinners to pick up wickets. “I didn’t plan anything in particular before coming to Sri Lanka. But I did work a little bit on my mindset because you are bowling on overseas wickets. Here wickets are a bit similar to Indian wickets so you do have an idea how to bowl. Only the batsmen are a bit different in terms of their approach so obviously I have planned a little bit,” he said.

“Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne batted very well in the last Test. They played sweep very well. It is difficult for spinners if the batsmen are playing the sweep so effectively. But playing sweep also means a lot of chances for bowlers, so if you plan even a little about them it becomes very helpful,” Kuldeep concluded.

"Taliban, IS jointly massacred 50 civilians: Afghan officials","An Afghan policeman stands guard near to the site of a suicide bomber struck at a NATO convoy in Kandahar southern of Kabul, Afghanistan, Wednesday. (Source: AP) An Afghan policeman stands guard near to the site of a suicide bomber struck at a NATO convoy in Kandahar southern of Kabul, Afghanistan, Wednesday. (Source: AP)

The Taliban and Islamic State group jointly massacred dozens of civilians in an Afghan village, officials said today, highlighting rare co-operation between the insurgents that could increase the strain on Afghanistan’s beleaguered security forces. The fighters killed more than 50 men, women and children in the remote Sayad district of northern Sar-e Pul province on Saturday after overrunning the Afghan Local Police (ALP) – a government-backed militia – in a 48-hour battle, according to local officials.

“It was a joint operation by Daesh (IS) and Taliban fighters. They had recruited forces from other provinces of the country and attacked Mirzawalang village,” Zabihullah Amani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, told AFP. The spokesman alleged that dozens of Taliban and IS group fighters under the command of Sher Mohammad Ghazanfar, a local Taliban commander who Amani claims pledged allegiance to IS, launched a co-ordinated attack on the area on Thursday.

“The fighters overran the area and it led to the massacre of innocent and defenceless civilians,” he said. Most of those killed were shot but some were beheaded, Amani said. Verifying information from poor, mountainous areas of Afghanistan made inaccessible by fighting and with patchy communications is difficult, and AFP was not able to access the village.

Mohammad Noor Rahmani, head of Sar-e-Pul’s provincial council, said 44 of the 50 victims were believed to be civilians, with the ALP militia also suffering casualties. “This is not the final toll. It might change because the area is inaccessible and no telephone networks are working to get an update,” he told AFP.

The Taliban and Islamic State fighters have regularly clashed since the latter gained a foothold in eastern Afghanistan in 2015, as the two vie for supremacy in the war-torn country. An Afghan security source told AFP there had been around three incidents in the past where fighters from both groups had teamed up to deal a blow to Afghan forces in certain areas.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, confirmed to AFP that it had captured Mirzawalang village but said it had done so alone. It also denied allegations it had killed civilians. “It was an independent operation by our mujahideen forces. There is no cooperation with the Islamic State on the operation,” said the spokesman.

England are blessed to have Moeen Ali in so many ways: Nasser Hussain,"Moeen Ali picked up a hat-trick in third Test. (Source: Reuters) Moeen Ali picked up a hat-trick in third Test. (Source: Reuters)

Former England captain Nasser Hussain that Moeen Ali is one of the most popular cricketers in England because of the whole package and what it means to the nation for us to have someone like him. He also praised the way he followed his Islamic beliefs of not being associated with alcohol when England celebrated their series win over South Africa with champagne-spraying.

“With England, Ben Stokes always gets a huge roar because of the way he plays, then Moeen is right up there because of the whole package and what it means to the nation for us to have someone like him. It is a sign, in many ways, of how far we have come,” he wrote in his Daily Mail column.

“It was clear the rest of the squad appreciated everything Moeen stands for, not just as an outstanding cricketer but also as a man of Islamic faith who has become such an important sporting figure in our country,” he wrote.

Moeen was instrumental with the ball in England win against South Africa in the fourth Test which game them a 3-1 series win. He also picked up a hat-trick in the third Test, also won by England.

“He has become one of England’s best players and, without being too heavy about it, can be a force for good in troubled times. We are blessed to have him in so many ways,” he wrote.

Hussain was of the view that England should tap the talent the British-Asians as though they are proud of their roots, they are loyal to England cricket and also bring in a lot of talent to the ground.

“Why are we still not tapping into that market and producing more England cricketers from those backgrounds? I used to see loads of talented young kids, third or fourth-generation British Asians, at my dad’s cricket school in Ilford when I played and you could see and appreciate their love of the game.”

His poem ‘Madras Central’ garnered rave reviews from critics as well as the others, for which he went on to win the All India Poetry Competition organised by the Poetry Society of India in association with the British Council.

A graduate from IIT Madras, Chennai, Nambisan also translated the devotional poetry of famous poets — Poonthanam and Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri. His wife Kavery Nambisan, a famous writer herself, wrote books like ‘The Scent of Pepper’, ‘The Truth (Almost) About Bharat’ and ‘The Story That Must Not Be Told’ which went on to be nominated for Man Asian Literary Prize 2008.

Many, including Thayil, Ramachandra Guha took to Twitter to pay their condolences to the veteran writer.

High Court says no protests within 100 metres of admin block in JNU,"Students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) cannot hold demonstrations within a 100-metre periphery of the university’s administrative block. (Express Archive) Students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) cannot hold demonstrations within a 100-metre periphery of the university’s administrative block. (Express Archive)

Students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) cannot hold demonstrations within a 100-metre periphery of the university’s administrative block, the Delhi High Court has ruled. On Wednesday, Justice Vibhu Bhakru said that CCTV cameras could also be installed at JNU’s main entry gate, besides in and around the administrative block. If students flout the order, the footage could be provided to police so they could take appropriate action, said the judge.

Noting that the JNU authorities had provided designated places to students to hold protests, the judge directed the students not to “prevent the ingress and egress of people in the administrative building”. The administration could call police in the case of any obstruction, the judge added.

Earlier, the JNU administration had moved the court seeking directions to restrain the students from holding any demonstartions within a100-metre periphery of the block. Counsel for JNU had underlined that students had, in March, staged a protest outside the block and prevented officials from passing through.

Meanwhile, PTI reported that the court had asked police to keep away from the campus unless there is evidence of disruption of law and order or unless the varsity sought assistance.

Overworked Virat Kohli deserves a mini break,"Virat Kohli has missed just one of India’s 43 games over the last year. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli has missed just one of India’s 43 games over the last year. (Source: AP)

The Indian selectors will meet in two days’ time to pick the squad for the five ODIs and solitary T20 in Sri Lanka. And if they aren’t planning to give skipper Virat Kohli a break for the limited-overs leg of the tour, they might be well-advised to do so.

For, since the time the Indian team left for the Caribbean in July 2016 for a four-Test series, Virat Kohli has played a match nearly every third day. India have played 43 international matches across all formats, including the second Test against Sri Lanka at SSC, in that 12-month period and their captain has appeared in 42 of them — having missed the Test against Australia at Dharamsala owing to a shoulder injury.

Only Sri Lanka’s Kusal Mendis has played more international matches, 46, in this time but those include just 13 Tests compared to Kohli’s 18. In addition, Kohli also played 10 matches for RCB in IPL X.

And there’s no break in sight for Kohli and his team either with India’s tour of Sri Lanka set to be followed by the busiest home season yet—3 Tests, 13 ODIs and 11 T20s—between September and December before they head to South Africa in January.

You won’t expect Kohli to sit out of a series involving Australia, the first of three visitors to India, and it’s unlikely he will anyway be left on the sidelines when there’s a home series on, regardless of whichever format it’s being played in.

A facile ODI series against a struggling team, that’s yet to confirm their direct qualification for the next World Cup, in venues including Dambulla and Pallekele is the best opportunity for MSK Prasad and his colleagues to give Kohli the much-needed time off. If they do go that way though, India will have to find a new captain in Sri Lanka. Ajinkya Rahane, who has led India before in three ODIs, will be a natural choice being the vice-captain of the team.

But despite his man-of-the-series winning performances in the Caribbean last month, his place in the ODI team still remains dependent on the more established ones missing out. In the West Indies he opened in place of Rohit Sharma, who was given some extra time to recuperate from his surgery, and it’s likely he will step in at No.3 if Kohli, who’s traveled more miles over the past year than Ferdinand Magellan did during his voyage around the earth, is rested here.

But the uncertainty about his long-term position in the 50-over playing XI could lead to Rohit, the most successful captain in IPL history, being handed the reins.

Brighton agree club record fee for Colombia’s Jose Izquierdo,"Brighton kick off their Premier League campaign at home against Manchester City on Saturday. (Source: AP Brighton kick off their Premier League campaign at home against Manchester City on Saturday. (Source: AP

Premier League newcomers Brighton and Hove Albion are poised to break their transfer record for the third time since June after announcing they have agreed a fee for winger Jose Izquierdo from Belgian side Club Brugge.

Media reports indicated that Brighton would pay Brugge an initial 13.5 million pounds ($17.54 million) for 25-year-old Izquierdo, with adds-ons potentially taking the total value up to 16 million.

Brighton said on Thursday that the deal for the Colombia international would be a new record for the club, but did not give the exact amount.

It said Izquierdo has also agreed personal terms with the club, although the deal is subject to a medical and him getting international clearances and a work permit.

The club broke their transfer record in June when they signed Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan for a reported 5.2 million pounds from Valencia.

And on Monday, the club announced the signing of Dutch international Davy Propper from PSV Eindhoven for a fee reported by British media to be between 6 million and 10 million pounds.

“Jose is someone we have been aware of for some time and has been one of the standout players in the Belgian league over the past three years,” Brighton boss Chris Hughton told the club website. (www.brightonandhovealbion.com)

“He’s been an exciting player for Club Brugge and in the season he helped the club win the title in 2015-16, he was also Belgium’s player of the year.”

"Chairman Mallya ceases to be director, says United Breweries","Mallya, whose now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes more than Rs 9,000 crore to various banks, had fled India on March 2, 2016. (Source: PTI Photo) Mallya, whose now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes more than Rs 9,000 crore to various banks, had fled India on March 2, 2016. (Source: PTI Photo)

United Breweries Ltd (UBL) on Thursday said its Chairman Vijay Mallya has ceased to be director of the company following market regulator Sebi’s order against him. On January 25 this year Sebi had restrained Mallya from holding position as director or key managerial personnel of any listed company which has not been vacated till date, UBL said in a regulatory filing. “The board at its meeting held today has authorised filing of requisite forms/intimations with the Registrar of Companies and other authorities notifying Vijay Mallya’s cessation from holding position of director in the company,” it said.

In January, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had restrained Mallya and six others from the securities market and also from “buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly” till further directions.

The market regulator’s order was issued close on the heels of CBI naming Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines and eight others in a chargesheet related to loan default case.

Mallya, whose now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes more than Rs 9,000 crore (including interest) to various banks, had fled India on March 2, 2016.

The CBI has two cases against him — one related to the IDBI Bank case and the other related to a loan default of over Rs 6,000 crore filed on the basis of a complaint from a State Bank of India led consortium.

Passenger knocked out as whale slams into Australia boat,"A helicopter escorted the boat to shore where four men were sent to hospital. (Source: Wikimedia Commons/ Representational Image only) A helicopter escorted the boat to shore where four men were sent to hospital. (Source: Wikimedia Commons/ Representational Image only)

A man was knocked unconscious and three others suffered facial fractures and broken ribs after a whale slammed into a charter fishing boat off Australia’s north coast, the skipper said on Monday.

The 30-foot vessel was returning to port in the Whitsundays off the Queensland state coast with eight passengers on board when a humpback whale rammed it from below, sending it airborne. “Within a split second we all hit the floor, the boat launched up into the air and it dislodged everyone off their feet,” captain Oliver Galea told AFP of the drama on Saturday. “None of us knew what happened.”

A 71-year-old South African man was knocked out and tended to by the boat’s crew while they alerted emergency services. A helicopter escorted the boat to shore where four men were sent to hospital. The tourist was treated for a broken nose, while Galea needed eight stitches for a nasty head wound. A third passenger suffered facial fractures and another broken ribs.

“We see whales all the time, but it’s never (been) known for this sort of thing to happen,” Galea said, adding that some of the passengers spotted what they believed to be a humpback in the water after the accident. Each year humpback whales migrate north from the Antarctic to the warmer climate off Australia’s coastline to mate and give birth. They can grow up to 16 metres (52 feet) long.

The ordeal has not deterred any of the passengers, Galea said, who were “all in good spirits” after they got together Sunday to eat their previous day’s catch. “The main thing is we all got home, and we have a few battle scars to show,” he added

China’s Lijiao Gong ends long wait for shot put gold,"Gong had won five silver and bronze medals at the World Championships and Olympics but never a gold. (Source: Reuters) Gong had won five silver and bronze medals at the World Championships and Olympics but never a gold. (Source: Reuters)

China’s Gong Lijiao ended her long wait for a global outdoor title when she won the shot put gold medal at the World Championships on Wednesday, utterly dominating the competition.

The 28-old-year had won five silver and bronze medals at the World Championships and Olympics but a gold had always eluded her until a chilly, wet night at the London Olympic stadium.

Gong made of light of the conditions as she broke 19 metres with five of her six attempts and won with a fifth throw of 19.94 metres.

There were only two other throws over 19 metres – Anita Marton’s final effort of 19.49 which won silver for the Hungarian and American Michelle Carter’s third throw of 19.14 which took bronze.

“It’s a very special moment for me. Of course, the rain affected the competition and that is the reason we didn’t go past 20 metres tonight,” Gong said. ” I am glad to show all the hard work I’ve done in the past with this gold medal.”

Gong first appeared one the scene as an 18-year-old at the 2007 World Championships where she finished seventh.

She won Olympic bronze in Beijing in 2008 and silver in London in 2012 as well as world silver in Beijing two years ago.

Gong was agonisingly close to ending that run in Beijing when she threw 20.30m in the opening round but lost out to Germany’s Christina Schwanitz by seven centimetres.

Sunny Leone’s daughter Nisha made Raksha Bandhan cards for daddy Daniel Weber and we cannot stop looking at her,"Small gestures of kids give lifetime memories to their parents. Something similar happened with the Laila of Bollywood Sunny Leone and her husband Daniel Weber when their munchkin Nisha Kaur Weber made beautiful Raksha Bandhan cards for daddy Daniel, her uncles and brothers. Sharing the special moment with her many fans, Sunny captioned the photo, ""Nisha made all her Mamaji, brothers and Daddy Raksha Bandan Cards! Lol so sweet!

In the photo, daddy Daniel is seen gushing over the cute pink card made by daughter Nisha. He is happily posing along with the card and his ear to ear smile is a testimony of how this father is proud of his baby girl.

The 21-month-old Nisha is winning hearts as she is engrossed in making beautiful Raksha Bandhan card for her new family members. The little one is trying her best to hold the crayon and we must say she doing much better than any other kid of her age.

Sunny Leone, without caring about the world, happily adopted Nisha ‘without looking at colour, background and health status’. She was earlier quoted as saying, ""We were not brought up here but certain things, on an everyday basis, breaks your heart. While going to the airport, you cross this overpass and see little kids with no clothes, no shoes or no food, and it’s heart-breaking. Maybe, we can’t save every child but can do it for one little girl.""

A few days back there were reports of Sunny expecting her first child. However, the actor refuted the rumours. It was later announced that Sunny adopted a baby girl to start her family."

"No place for corrupt in my government, says Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe","“There is no place for robbers in our government. We will remove them,” Wickremesinghe said in the hill town of Hatton. (Source: Express Photo) “There is no place for robbers in our government. We will remove them,” Wickremesinghe said in the hill town of Hatton. (Source: Express Photo)

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Sunday his government will not tolerate corruption and “remove” all those found involved in graft cases. Wickremesinghe’s comments came amid a controversy over Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake who has faced calls for resignation following his testimony at a probe on the issuance of Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s bonds during 2015 and 2016. Karunanayake is unlikely to resign. Wickremesinghe said all allegations of corruption under his government would be investigated and action will be taken depending on the outcomes.

“There is no place for robbers in our government. We will remove them,” Wickremesinghe said in the hill town of Hatton.

He said all allegations of corruption under his government will be investigated and action will be taken depending on the outcomes.

He said a senior minister’s quizzing for wrongdoing by the Attorney General reflected the freedom his government has brought in.

“We have filed cases against the Rajapaksa government’s corruption. Cases are ongoing. When the Central Bank Bond issue allegations were made against my government, I appointed an internal probe and later it was referred to a parliamentary committee headed by an opposition member,” Wickremesinghe said.

The current unity government formed in 2015 with the ouster of the former Mahinda Rajapaksa regime by Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena has faced its biggest scandal in the form of the Central Bank Bond issue.

Perpetual Treasuries, a Central Bank primary dealer, has been accused of benefiting through insider information during the Governorship of Arjuna Mahendran whose son in law Arjun Aloysius is linked to the firm.

Mahendran, Wickremesinghe’s close friend, was later removed from the job by Sirisena.

Iran papers slam MP ‘selfies of humiliation’ with EU diplomat Federica Mogherini,"European foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini attends a swearing-in ceremony for Iranian president Hassan Rouhani for a further term, at the parliament in Tehran. (Source: Reuters) European foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini attends a swearing-in ceremony for Iranian president Hassan Rouhani for a further term, at the parliament in Tehran. (Source: Reuters)

Iran’s newspapers were dominated on Monday by accusations lawmakers had embarrassed themselves by clamouring to take selfies with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini during her visit to parliament.

Mogherini was among dozens of foreign guests in Iran for the inauguration of President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday, but she appeared to capture the most attention as members of parliament crowded round to grab a snap with her.

Images of the lawmakers perched on desks and lining up with their smartphones in front of the Italian diplomat triggered a storm of anger and ridicule on Iranian social media under the hashtag “selfies of humiliation”. “Dear MPs, thank you for disgracing 80 million people,” wrote one Twitter user.

Others drew comparisons with iconic images such as Walt Disney’s seven dwarves lining up to fawn over Snow White. At least one lawmaker apologised for his lack of decorum, but the issue still dominated Monday’s front pages.

The reformist Ghanoon daily had a cartoon of Mogherini in the style of Edvard Munch’s famous painting “The Scream”, with Iranian parliamentarians peeping from the corners with their mobile phones snapping away. The episode “shows the lack of proper education in the country”, it wrote in its editorial.

But the ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper did not see the funny side. “Those who are supposed to defend the rights of the nation against the enemy queue up to snap photos in a humiliating way with the violators,” it said.

Mogherini, who held talks with Rouhani as part of the European Union’s bid to rebuild trade ties with Iran, did not comment on the controversy.

"Delay in MU results affects admissions in Pune: Few applications in some departments, too many in others","“… Without their marksheets, students will not be able to apply. The post-graduate admission process is either over or is about to be completed, while many MU students have not even received their results… Many students are coming here to inquire about admissions… but what can we do…” -Dilip Sheth, Principal, S P College. “… Without their marksheets, students will not be able to apply. The post-graduate admission process is either over or is about to be completed, while many MU students have not even received their results… Many students are coming here to inquire about admissions… but what can we do…” -Dilip Sheth, Principal, S P College.

The delay in the declaration of results by the Mumbai University (MU) is affecting admissions in Pune, especially in post graduation courses. In some departments at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), the number of applications from students are low, while in several affiliated colleges, the situation is completely different. At SPPU’s Hindi department, which has received fewer applications than previous years, officials said the reason could be the delay in declaration of results by other universities, such as Mumbai.

“Every year, we get a sizeable number of applications from Mumbai, which didn’t happen this year since the deadline for applications has elapsed and MU students haven’t got their marksheets yet. This year, nearly 30 seats combined are vacant in the Hindi department’s two post-graduate specialisations. To fill these seats, students from non-Hindi backgrounds have applied for admissions. Had the Mumbai University results been declared on time, we would have had no vacant seats and no need for a second round of admissions,” said Sadanand Bhosale, head of the SPPU’s Hindi department.

Even as some departments pointed out the low number of applications for post-graduate seats, principals of a few affiliated colleges said that the current situation has created a demand for additional seats, to accommodate MU students this year. The post-graduate admission process has either ended or is about to come to an end in most Pune colleges, but principals of these colleges said they are receiving desperate requests from students, who are urging them to either postpone the procedure or consider them for admissions.

AT SP College, Principal Dilip Sheth said the institute is still receiving applications for post-graduate seats in “popular courses” such as Mathematics and Psychology.

“All post-graduate admissions are on the basis of merit, which is decided by graduation marks. Without their marksheets, students will not be able to apply. At our college, most of the post-graduate admission process is either over or is about to be completed, while many MU students have not even received their results… Many of the students are coming here to inquire about admissions… but what can we do? Of the total seats that we have, only 10 per cent seats are reserved for students from other universities. And there are other universities in the state besides MU, so we have to consider those as well,” he said.

Modern College is facing a similar problem, as it has a limited number of seats and a large number of applications from students of other universities. “We can only tell the students that admissions for certain departments like Economics or Hindi is still on, and they can try there. But as far as other courses are concerned, we can’t give them seats despite knowing that the students are not at fault here… what the government needs to do is grant an additional quota of seats only for this year, so that we are able to accommodate these students,” said Rajendra Zunjarrao.

SP College Principal Sheth also said that a ‘quota’ only for MU students seemed to be the only solution. “As of now, that is the only workable solution…,” he said.

SPPU Vice-Chancellor N R Karmalkar said he was aware of the plight of students from MU, who were seeking admissions in Pune. “I am aware that the deadlines are over and some students may miss out on admissions. We are trying to see what we can work out, since we also have to follow certain rules. But we will take a humanitarian view of this situation,” assured Karmalkar.

Meanwhile, varsity officials said they might consider extending the deadline for online registrations for PhD seats — which is August 14 currently — for MU students. “We may extend the deadline,” said A D Shaligram, registrar in-charge.

Antonio Conte wants more Chelsea signings to cope with Champions League,"Antonio Conte coached have signed four players so far, including striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid. Antonio Conte coached have signed four players so far, including striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte believes the club need more signings to cope with the added demands of playing in the Champions League and warned his players they will have to work even harder than they did during last season’s title-winning campaign.

Chelsea, who were not in Europe but won the domestic title by seven points in Conte’s first season in charge, have signed four players so far, including striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid.

Goalkeeper Willy Caballero joined on a free transfer from Manchester City, with defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko and centre-back Antonio Rudiger the other additions.

“I think these are good signings for us,” Conte told Sky Sports on Wednesday. “We solved a lot in this summer, and for this reason it’s very important to try to improve our squad because we have one more competition.

“We have to play Champions League. It’s not easy. It’s very important to try to find the right solution, to try to improve the squad, to improve the quality before (we) start the season.”

Chelsea have sold midfielder Nemanja Matic to Manchester United and Diego Costa is also poised to leave. Conte was reported to have irked the club’s hierarchy when he informed the striker via a text message that he was not in his plans.

British media reported that the text was not appreciated because it weakened Chelsea’s bargaining position after it was made public, but Conte denied there being tension between himself and Roman Abramovich, the club’s owner.

“I think I have for sure a good relationship with the club, with my owner,” he said. “I like to work, I like to work very hard and my owner appreciates a lot this characteristic.”

Chelsea begin their title defence at home against Burnley on Saturday and Conte expects tougher campaign than the one before.

“It won’t be easy to repeat an amazing season like last year,” he said. “Because to finish with 93 points, to finish with 30 wins, it won’t be easy. But for sure we want to try to fight, to fight until the end, to try to retain the title.

“We have to know that only through the work we can improve a lot and that we must work harder than last season … For sure it won’t be easy to win, but we want to try to fight to win something this season.”

"Mexico drug lord Damaso Lopez, son indicted on US drug charges","In Picture, Mexico drug lord Damaso Lopez (AP Photo) In Picture, Mexico drug lord Damaso Lopez (AP Photo)

A Sinaloa cartel leader and his son have been indicted on drug smuggling charges in the United States in what U.S. authorities called a blow to one of Mexico’s most powerful drug rings. The indictment against Damaso Lopez Nunez was unsealed in Virginia as his 29-year-old son made his initial court appearance in San Diego. The son, Damaso Lopez Serrano, turned himself in to U.S. border inspectors in California less than two weeks ago.

Damaso Lopez Nunez has been battling for control of the Sinaloa cartel following last year’s arrest of billionaire kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, who faces drug charges in the United States. Known by the nickname “El Licenciado,” a title for college graduates, Lopez was long considered Guzman’s right-hand man and helped him escape from a Mexican prison in 2001. Mexican authorities arrested him in Mexico City in May, and U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition.

The younger Lopez, known as “Mini Lic,” surrendered to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers July 27 in Calexico, east of San Diego, authorities said. He entered a plea of not guilty Monday at a hearing held under tight security and was ordered to be held without bail. He is believed to be the highest-ranking Mexican cartel member ever to surrender to authorities in the United States. David Shirk, an associate political science professor at University of San Diego, said it was highly unusual for a cartel operative to turn himself in to U.S. authorities and that it may be another sign that the Sinaloa cartel is “under siege.”

“The fact that a member of this organization is surrendering to U.S. authorities shows that something is going on and that something may be going wrong for the Sinaloa cartel,” Shirk said. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the indictments show that the Justice Department has made going after Mexican cartel leaders a top priority.

“We will continue to go after these cartel leaders in order to dismantle their organizations from top to bottom, and today’s announcement should send them a clear message: you can turn yourselves in the easy way, or we will find you and bring you to justice the hard way,” Sessions said in a statement. The elder Lopez is believed to have been locked in a dispute with Guzman’s sons for control of the cartel’s territories. The head of Mexico’s federal detectives’ agency, Omar Garcia Harfuch, said in May that Lopez was “one of the main instigators of violence” in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and the southern part of Baja California.

The father and son are named in the indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia, which was filed in December. They are charged with conspiracy to import and distribute controlled substances. The San Diego indictment, which was filed in August 2016 and ordered unsealed Monday, charges Lopez Serrano with conspiracy to import and distribute methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin. Also charged was Nahum Abraham Sicairos Montalvo, who was arrested last month near Mexico City and identified by Mexican authorities as a major financial operator for the Sinaloa cartel.

Adam Braverman, an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, said the investigation lasted five years and involved intercepts of more than 250 communication devices. In 2015, there were tens of thousands of communication intercepts and “a number of (drug) seizures” in Mexico and the United States. Lopez Serrano appeared in an orange uniform for jail inmates and said little in court. His attorney, Michael Littman, entered the not-guilty plea on his client’s behalf.

US should keep its diplomacy ready amid Doklam standoff: Bruce Riedel,"India and China have been locked in a face-off in Doklam for 50 days after Indian troops stopped the Chinese Army from building a road in the area. India and China have been locked in a face-off in Doklam for 50 days after Indian troops stopped the Chinese Army from building a road in the area.

The standoff between India and China at the Doklam area of the Sikkim section has enormous consequences for the world, including America, so the Trump administration should have its diplomacy at the ready, a former CIA analyst said today. Bruce Riedel, who is now working with the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think-tank said both India and China have built up their conventional forces facing each other in the Himalayas.

“China and India are now nuclear weapons powers with nuclear armed missiles targeting, respectively, New Delhi and Beijing. Both are huge economic powers with considerable trade between them,” Riedel wrote in an op-ed in the Daily Beast. India and China have been locked in a face-off in Doklam for 50 days after Indian troops stopped the Chinese Army from building a road in the area. “This is a face-off with potentially enormous consequences for the world. Neither side has asked for American intervention but American interests are very much at stake,” he said.

The Chinese incursion into Bhutan coincided with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House, probably a deliberate move by Beijing, he wrote. “Washington should have its diplomacy at the ready. We need experienced hands in the State Department South Asia bureau. We need the best possible ambassadors on the scene. Our military ties to India need to be on watch. JFK was ready in 1962, we should not be caught off guard today,” Riedel said.

In 2015, Riedel wrote a book ‘JFK’s Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA, and the Sino-Indian War Hardcover’, whose paperback edition is coming out soon. The book gives an account of how then US president John F Kennedy came out in support of India during the 1962 war with China.

"To boost jobs, Gujarat govt to give Rs 730 crore to MSMEs","Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani (File Photo) Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani (File Photo)

The Gujarat government will disburse Rs 730 crore as “capital incentives” to over 16,000 MSMEs, a year after 42,500 units were reported sick in the state. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani will disburse the checks at an event on August 19. “Every year, the government gives an assistance of about Rs 300 crore. We will give a total of Rs 730 crore this year as capital incentives to 16,000 MSMEs to help them expand or set up new units. This will create over 1.6 lakh new jobs,” said M K Das, Principal Secretary, Industries and Mines Department.

This disbursal will be done as per the Industrial Policy-2015, under which the state government had promised to provide financial assistance on term loans provided by banks to the MSMEs. The government is also providing 50 per cent capital subsidy on investments in clean technology, which includes purchasing equipment to meet national and international safety, energy and pollution standards.

The 16,000 MSMEs are expected to make a cumulative investment of Rs 19,000 crore for which they have sought Rs 11,000 crore loans from various banks between April and July, added Das. The aid has come at a time when the number of sick MSMEs has been rising. From 20,452, that were reported sick in 2013, the number has risen to 42,500 in 2016. Gujarat currently has the third highest number of sick MSME units in India, just behind UP (95,989 units) and Maharashtra (52,576).

"Would love to see India play Pakistan in a Test series, says Dean Jones","India played Pakistan in the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Final. (Source: AP File) India played Pakistan in the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Final. (Source: AP File)

India are the top-ranked Test side in the world having and have extended their dominance at the top following a comprehensive innings and 53 runs win over Sri Lanka in the second Test at Colombo. Overall, India are on a eight series wins run which began in 2015 back in Sri Lanka. Next up on this list with most consecutive Test wins is Australia who won nine straight between 2005 and 2008. But former Australia top-order batsman Dean Jones believes this top ranked means nothing if you don’t play all sides and he would want to see an India-Pakistan Test series.

“I’m a firm believer that there is no such thing called No.1 side in cricket. India became the ‘No.1 Test’ side without facing Pakistan. I would love to see the two teams play in a Test series. In last two-three years, there is so much improvement in Pakistan cricket. The Pakistan Super League has transformed them into a professional unit. The Champions Trophy success can also be attributed to the players who emerged through PSL. Pakistan just have to get their first-class structure right. In recent times, there were quite a few terrorist attacks in Europe including London and sporting events are going on as usual. But teams refuse to travel to Pakistan. The hypocrisy is overwhelming!”, he said while speaking to the Deccan Chronicle.

India haven’t played Pakistan in a Test series since 2007-08 with the two countries choosing not to play cricket with each other outside ICC events due to the political scenario between the two neighbours. That time, Pakistan had toured India in a three Test series which India won 1-0.

The 57-year-old Aussie despite playing 52 Tests made more of an impact in the shorter version of the game. He said the difference in game between the 80s and now is that players then ran better between the wickets. Though, he complimented MS Dhoni as great runner in straight lines. “The art of running between the wickets hasn’t improved a bit. I look with keen interest whenever they show replays to check no-ball. Generally, batsmen at the non-striker end look down the pitch, but ideally they should be looking at the bowler side-ways,” he said while on a visit to Bengaluru.

“They also don’t know how to run in straight lines. M.S. Dhoni is the only exception. He not only runs fast, but is also smart in judgment. In the 80s, we felt running between the wickets was very important because the team that scores more singles and twos wins the game. The grounds were bigger and you could even start your third when the fielder prepares to throw. While batting we concentrated on hitting flat. The current generation of cricketers really needs to work on this while playing on bigger ground,” he added.

He stressed on the need of playing tri-series over the current numerous bi-lateral series that many teams engage in. “People don’t just look for cricket to be fillers; it got to have something on it. What I would like to see more is some significance attached to a bilateral series. Otherwise, the mediocrity of these stupid and meaningless one-day bilateral series is not going to help the sport. We need more triangular series. Isn’t fun to have India, Australia and South Africa featuring in a tri-series?”

Jones claimed he was happy that the ODI series between India and Australia was taking place after the the pay dispute looked to have caused a possible disruption in those plans. “I’m glad the India-Australia series is going to happen because at one stage it never looked possible with Cricket Australia and players embroiled in pay dispute. However, I feel it’s yet another meaningless ODI series. I just hope their rivalry and some interesting characters involved will spice it up. What I admire about the likes of Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane is the element of classic technique associated with their side-on batting. Some of our guys are front-on and their back-lift is bad. They are getting away with all these as they play on flat tracks in Australia these days.”

With Test cricket not getting the due attention and crowds the world over, Jones said the game could attract more viewers if ICC could introduce a World Test Championship and reward teams for aggressive play. “I was telling one of the broadcasters about a plan for the World Test championship. Ten teams have to be divided into two divisions and they play four matches each. If it’s a four-day match with 100 overs a day, the tournament can be done and dusted in 50 days. If a team scores more than 300, you get four batting points. If you get all 10 wickets before 100 overs, you get your bowling points. So teams will be aggressive in their approach. In the mid 90s, county cricket in England had this format when I was playing there. I think the current Futures Tour Programme (FTP) gets over in June 2019. If ICC works out a plan for a World Test championship, three out of every four years we will have a major tournament. That will be good for the sport,” he concluded.

"It was nice to score runs again, says Haseeb Hameed","Haseeb hameed scored a half-century against Hampshire for his Lancashire county side. (Source: AP) Haseeb hameed scored a half-century against Hampshire for his Lancashire county side. (Source: AP)

Haseeb Hameed might have looked a promising cricketer when he first stepped out in the middle donning the English Test kits but an injury at the early stage of his career and a dismal performance with the bat in subsequent domestic matches kept him out of contention from getting picked in the England team. But a half-century in the second innings for his county side Lancashire against Middlesex has given the much required “confidence” to the 20-year-old.

“It was nice to get that confidence and that feeling of having scored runs again,” he was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

“That second innings I gave myself the best chance to succeed and was determined to make it difficult for them to get me out, to go back to the basics,” he said. “Thankfully I could do that, and I was happy. The longer I spent out in the middle the better I felt. I was very happy with it,” he added.

Talking about his innings, Hameed insisted that “keeping things simple” was the key to success in this particular knock.

“Last year I had a good season and I guess when you are doing things well, there’s a nice rhythm and tempo to it, and you keep things simple. That’s what I tried to do this innings – I didn’t overthink things too much, I just focused on the things that I do well, the things that I did in the past – that one-ball focus, each ball as it comes. I’m glad I could execute the way I wanted,” Hameed said.

“You are always optimistic that the work you put in will come to fruition. This year it has taken longer for this to happen. I wouldn’t say I had doubts about when I would score runs again, it is just I have had to make sure I have continued to learn from those phases, from the down times,” added Haseeb.

Mentioning about the different formats, the youngster said that changing between them is challenging as the players need to play in a slightly different manner.

“It is challenging to change between the different formats. Although my game doesn’t change too much for white-ball cricket there is a slightly different skill set, you do take more risks and play in a slightly different manner, so definitely that’s been one of the learnings I’ve taken from this season.”

“Definitely that’s been one of the learnings I’ve taken so far from this season,” he said. “You hear a lot of successful sportspeople say that these tough times make you a better cricketer and a better person, and I feel like I have learned a lot about myself not only as a player, but as a person as well. Hopefully I can look back on the last few months and say ‘you know what, they have made me a better player than I would have been had things gone my way from the word go,” he added.

Haseeb talked about England batting coach Mark Ramprakash and the kind of learning he has been getting from the former cricketer.

“I had a really good session with Ramps and I enjoy working with him,” he said. “He told me ‘the game is in good order, all you need is one score’, so it gave me a lot of confidence to hear that from the England batting coach. That net was really good and being around the group was quite nice.

“Ramps is very confident in me understanding and knowing my game. He doesn’t try to tinker with it too much. I’m sure that, if there is something he thinks will benefit me, then he will tell me. In that instance there was nothing he told me, if anything he was just reassuring me and giving me the confidence that my game is in a good place so I could approach this game with confidence,” he said.

"Doklam standoff: Do not underestimate China’s resolve to defend territorial sovereignty, says Chinese state media","Doklam standoff: Chinese state media People’s Daily has issued told India that it should not underestimate the China’s resolve to defend its territorial sovereignty. Doklam standoff: Chinese state media People’s Daily has issued told India that it should not underestimate the China’s resolve to defend its territorial sovereignty.

In a fresh warning to India, Chinese state media People’s Daily has said that India should not underestimate China’s resolve to defend its territorial sovereignty. The warning was issued in a commentary carrying a byline of Zhong Sheng. The daily alleged that Indian border troops had crossed the China-India boundary in the Sikkim sector into Chinese territory and that it was totally illegal. It said China will take “all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests.”.

On August 2, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued an official document titled ‘The Facts and China’s Position Concerning the Indian Border Troops’ Crossing of the China-India Boundary in the Sikkim Sector into the Chinese Territory’ giving its side of the story.

It alleged that Indian troops were illegally staying in Chinese territory after illegally crossing the border on June 18. Nonetheless, the daily didn’t acknowledge that the area in question is disputed between Bhutan and China, and China had moved to disrupt the status quo, thereby violating a 2012 agreement between India and China. The agreement was regarding tri-party discussion in issues related to tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries like the one in Doklam.

The article said that what India did can be defined as illegal and that it aims at nothing but making trouble. The daily cited a convention signed between Britain and China relating to Sikkim and Tibet and said that according to that convention, Doklam was indisputably Chinese territory.

It alleged that India invented excuses to justify illegal action since the incident of border crossing broke out while also calling India’s security concerns over China’s road-building activity as ill-founded.

It said that India’s claim that Doklam is a disputed area between China and Bhutan is against the truth and the law. “The Doklam area has all along been part of China and under China’s continuous and effective jurisdiction. There is no dispute in this regard,” it said, adding that India had no right as a third party in the equation to make territorial claims on behalf of Bhutan. Although, taking the same liberty it said that India’s position posed a challenge the sovereignty and independence of Bhutan.

It said that “the rhetoric that India upheld, namely that China and India have been in discussions on making the boundary in the Sikkim Sector an “early harvest” which proves the area is disputed, is a sophistry.” While it admitted that both sides were in discussion for making the Sikkim Sector boundary an early harvest in the entire boundary settlement, it reiterated the current position on the 1890 convention. It said that “China and India ought to sign a new boundary convention in their own names to replace the 1890 Convention.”

It went on to say that “since the incident occurred, China has sought to communicate with India through diplomatic channels to resolve the incident. But no country should ever underestimate the resolve of the Chinese government and people to defend China’s territorial sovereignty”, adding, “China will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests.”

The Doklam stand-off startedin mid-June when India accused China of constructing a road in the disputed territory towards Doklam Plateau. It was an objection raised also by the Royal Bhutanese Army. Doklam is essentially a tri-junction between India, China and Bhutan. The road construction work by the Chinese in the area posed a security crisis in the region. India took an intervening stand and helped Bhutan’s position. The Indian Army asked the Chinese to halt the construction work in the area to which China retaliated with an argument that Doklam was an undisputed Chinese territory. A standoff ensued between the Indian and Chinese border troops. Soon, both sides started sending reinforcements and increasing the military deployment to prepare for armed conflict.

The standoff has continued and the situation between the two countries remains tense. China has repeatedly demanded India to withdraw its forces from the region and claiming it is prepared to do everything necessary to defend its territorial sovereignty. India, meanwhile, maintains that the Chinese construction work was done without consultation with Bhutan thereby changing the status quo and violating the understanding on tri-junction boundary points.

UN condemns brutality of Yemen conflict after airstrikes on civilians,"People stand on the debris of a house at the site of a Saudi-led air strike on an outskirt of the northwestern city of Saada, Yemen August 4, 2017. REUTERS/Naif Rahma People stand on the debris of a house at the site of a Saudi-led air strike on an outskirt of the northwestern city of Saada, Yemen August 4, 2017. REUTERS/Naif Rahma

A top United Nations official in Yemen said reported airstrikes in which at least 12 civilians were killed, including children, were an example of the “disregard” for civilians’ safety shown by all the combatants in Yemen’s civil war. The civilians were killed and 10 others wounded in Sa’ada province after attacks on a house and a private vehicle, the UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said, citing reports from fellow aid groups.

Reuters reported on Friday that three women and six children from the same family were killed in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on their home in the area, according to a local health official. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to a request for a comment. Yemen has been torn apart by a civil war in which the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to push back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of the north, including the capital Sanaa.

The new incidents were an example of the “brutality” of the conflict, McGoldrick said in the statement in which he expressed deep concern. “All parties to the conflict continue to show a disregard for the protection of civilians and the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in the conduct of hostilities.”

Saada, a stronghold of the Houthi group, has been repeatedly hit by air strikes since the coalition of Arab states joined the civil war in March 2015. They see the war as an attempt by Iran to expand its influence in Yemen.

North Korea releases jailed Canadian pastor amid standoff with US,"South Korea-born Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim stands during his trial at a North Korean court in this undated photo released by North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang December. (Source: Reuters) South Korea-born Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim stands during his trial at a North Korean court in this undated photo released by North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang December. (Source: Reuters)

North Korea freed a Canadian pastor serving a life sentence on humanitarian grounds, the official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday, just hours after the United States warned it would counter any threat from the North with “fire and fury.”

There was no clear connection between the release of Hyeon Soo Lim and the heightened rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang. Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country’s national security adviser had gone to North Korea to discuss Lim’s case.

Lim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.

“Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,” said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. “They hope that Canada presents some

moderating influence on the Trump administration.

“(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the US president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.” KCNA said Lim had been released on “sick bail” by the country’s Central Court for humanitarian reasons.

Lim, accompanied by his wife and son, is expected to return to Canada on Thursday and will be hospitalized on arrival at his wife’s request, a source familiar with the matter said.

“So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,” said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak

to media.

Lim’s family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to

15 years’ hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.

Canadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim’s release, said Lim was hospitalized during his imprisonment.

“They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should,” he said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office did not comment on Wednesday.

North Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of US citizens.

North Korea is still holding three Americans. The US State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country from September.

Lim’s Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.

On Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury.”

US aircraft carrier to visit Vietnam next year: Pentagon,"A US aircraft carrier will visit Vietnam next year, the Pentagon said in a statement on Tuesday, in a sign of improving relations between the two countries. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Vietnamese Minister of National Defense Ngo Xuan Lich agreed to the carrier’s visit in a meeting at the Pentagon on Tuesday, the statement said.

It is believed to be the first visit by a US aircraft carrier since the Vietnam War ended in 1975. President Donald Trump discussed the possibility of a US carrier visit with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc when the two leaders met in May at the White House, Vietnam’s government said at the time.

"4,500 families, major dam affected by Venezuela flooding","Representational Image/ Reuters Representational Image/ Reuters

Torrential rain in southeast Venezuela has affected 4,500 families and is sending floodwaters gushing through the country’s major hydroelectric dam, authorities and local media said. The precipitation caused the two main rivers in the country, the Orinoco and the Caroni, to surge over their banks, causing damage in the states of Bolivar, Delta Amacuro and Amazonas, the Civil Protection service said.

Local media showed images of flooded houses and streets, and residents trying to save furniture from the water. They also showed video of water gushing through Venezuela’s Guri hydroelectric dam, which provides 70 percent of electricity for the country.

The opposition called on the government to take urgent action with the dam to prevent the flooding from worsening, adding another point of discord in the country, which is in the grip of a deep economic and political crisis.

Chandigarh stalking case: UT Police to reward its PCR 6 for prompt response to Varnika’s distress call,"T Luthra, Chandigarh IG. (Source: ANI) T Luthra, Chandigarh IG. (Source: ANI)

At a time when the Chandigarh Police is facing flak for its initial kid glove treatment of accused Vikas Barala and Ashish Kumar in the Varnika Kundu abduction attempt case, the six policemen who responded promptly to Varnika’s distress call around midnight of August 4 and helped her drive to safety as they nabbed the two men, are being seen as the much-needed silver lining. DGP T S Luthra said the police department was planning to reward the six men for conducting a flawless operation from start to finish.

The police personnel involved in the 10-minute rescue operation were Constable Ajay, Head Constable Satish Kumar, Home Guard volunteer Baisakhi Ram, Assistant Sub-Inspector Ishwar Singh, Constable Devinder and Sub-Inspector Vijay Kumar.

Constable Ajay attended Varnika’s call in the Police Control Room and assured her prompt help. He asked Varnika if she could stop and wait for help to arrive. But when she informed him that the two men chasing her were trying to forcibly block her way and open her car’s door, Ajay advised her to keep moving. She told him that she was heading towards her home in Sector 6, Panchkula.

S-I Vijay Kumar was the night duty incharge in the Control Room. On being alerted by Constable Ajay, Vijay Kumar flashed a message from the control room. PCR vehicles available along the route Varnika was taking towards Panchkula, were immediately alerted and diverted towards Housing Board lightpoint with instructions to help the woman in distress, intercept the Tata Safari in which she was being chased and nab the two men stalking her.

Two PCR vehicles with the call signs “Echo-38” and “Amb-25” began the operation by driving towards Varnika from two directions. Echo-38 that was patrolling in Manimajra reached Housing Board lightpoint where Varnika was heading. Amb-25 spotted Varnika being chased by two men in a Tata Safari at Transport Lightpoint and started following the Tata Safari.

Describing the fool-proof operation conducted by the PCR to rescue Varnika, a senior police officer said, “We approached Varnika from both the directions so that she could be rescued in time and the accused could not escape. Finally, we succeeded and the investigation part was subsequently handed over to the police station, Sector 26.”

Subsequently, S-I Vijay Kumar also monitored the movement of the PCR vehicles — Echo-38 and Amb-25 — on the Global Positioning System installed in the Control Room at the police headquarters in Sector 9.

ASI Ishwar and Constable Devinder were on Amb-25 PCR vehicle, and Head Constable Satish Kumar and Home Guard volunteer Baisakhi were in Echo-38. Eventually, both the PCR vehicles intercepted the Tata Safari. Since they had instructions to stop the vehicle and detain the occupants, they did so and allowed Varnika to move on. She reached home and informed her father V S Kundu about the entire incident.

Immediately on intercepting the Safari, Head Constable Satish first deftly removed the keys from the ignition, and caught hold of Vikram Barala who was driving the vehicle and Home Guard volunteer Baisakhi Ram caught hold of Ashish Kumar. Subsequently, ASI Ishwar alerted the Control Room that the vehicle was intercepted and both the accused were detained at the spot.

Talking to Chandigarh Newsline, Baisakhi Ram said, “Both the men were reeking of alcohol. We asked them their identities and why they were chasing the woman’s [Varnika’s] car. But they started arguing with us and asked us why we stopped them. We told them to stay quiet and alerted the police station personnel to reach the spot and take charge of further investigations.”

DGP Luthra said, “We have decided to reward all these six policemen for their prompt response.

Sources in the party said each of the 44 MLAs has been kept under the watch of two Youth Congress workers in the resort. (Source: Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)

The Gujarat Congress MLAs were in Bengaluru since July 29 to prevent their possible poaching by the ruling BJP for the Rajya Sabha election where the Congress is attempting to get Ahmed Patel, the political aide to party president Sonia Gandhi, re-elected. Following senior party leader Shankersinh Vaghela’s resignation, six Congress MLAs had followed suit, putting Patel’s re-election to the Upper House in jeopardy. As of now, the strength of the Congress in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly has slid to 51 from 57. (Source: Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)

On Monday afternoon, families of two MLAs –Dhiru Bhil from Naswadi and Ramesh Chavda from Kadi–arrived to tie rakhi. Both the families, it is learnt, were made to wait at the entrance of the resort till Congress workers confirmed their identities. (Source: Express Photo by Bhupendra Rana)"
19 killed in clashes between militias in Somalia,"“Forces loyal to Muktar Robow pushed the Al-Shabaab fighters out after several hours of fighting. Many people were killed,” Fiqi said on Thursday. (File) “Forces loyal to Muktar Robow pushed the Al-Shabaab fighters out after several hours of fighting. Many people were killed,” Fiqi said on Thursday. (File)

At least 19 militants were killed in fierce fighting between Al-Shabaab fighters and president Mohamed Hassan Fiqi backed loyalists of the former group’s leader Mukhtar Robow in Somalia’s southwestern region of Bakool.

Al-Shabaab militants stormed the Abal village, located southwest to capital Mogadishu and forced Robow’s loyalists to retreat from Abal village. But they later returned to beat back their attackers in a midday counter offensive.

SouthWest state (which encompasses the Bakool region) acting president Mohamed Hassan Fiqi said that the fighting which continued all through Wednesday in the Bakool region, killed 13 Al-Shabaab and six Abu Mansoor militants.

“Forces loyal to Muktar Robow pushed the Al-Shabaab fighters out after several hours of fighting. Many people were killed,” Fiqi said on Thursday.

Abdirasak Abdi, the state deputy security minister confirmed that his administration is backing the Abu Mansoor group, a move it has taken to defeat the Al-Shabaab group, which aims to establish Sharia rule in the region, Anadolu news reported.

Abu Mansoor, a top leader of the Al-Shabaab group, deserted it in 2013 and the U.S. removed his name from the list of wanted terrorists.

"BCCI to award Rs 15 lakh each to men, women team selectors","BCCI office bearers met with CoA to discuss multiple issues. BCCI office bearers met with CoA to discuss multiple issues.

Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have announced that they will be awarding Rs 15 lakh each to members of the men’s and women’s team selection committee. The decision in this regard was taken at the meeting of the BCCI office bearers and the Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) for selecting ‘good teams’ in the recently concluded tournaments. “They have been rewarded for selecting good teams,” said member of the CoA Diana Edulji on Wednesday.

The meeting also considered the possibility of India competing in the Olympics but Edulji said that the decision would be taken by the general body. It is expected that BCCI will stick to its previous stance of not wanting to compete in the Olympics as it would mean that the board and the team would have to come under the Olympic charter. That would imply BCCI would have to be registered as a national sporting federation. The players would then be bound under WADA’s whereabouts clause (which they currently oppose).

As per reports, Edulji also raised the issue of rewarding women selectors more handsomely thanks to their second place finish at the ICC Women’s World Cup. However, her view point was protested by BCCI’s acting president CK Khanna who said that if women were rewarded then men should be too considering both finish second in their latest ICC tournament. India women lost in the final to England while India men’s team went down to Pakistan in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy.

She also added that the board is trying its best to stick to the Lodha Panel recommended 15-day window between an international assignment and the Indian Premier League. “We are trying our level best. We will try and adhere to it as far as possible since the Future Tours & Programmes (FTP) are decided way in advance,” she said.

A main point of discussion at the meeting surrounding former skipper Mohammed Azharuddin’s pending dues has been referred to the general body. Azhar had been suspended for life by the BCCI on charges of match-fixing. It comes just two days after S Sreesanth’s life ban was revoked by the Kerala High Court despite the charges being dropped by a Delhi court in 2015. For Azhar, the Andhra High Court had dropped match-fixing charges levelled against him in 2012. “Azharuddin’s case has been referred to the general body and Sreesanth’s case, the legal team is still studying,” Edulji said. Acting president Khanna said: “Azharuddin’s case was discussed at length. The legal team has given its opinion and I believe general body will take a favourable decision.”

"UK to scrap ‘outdated’ landing cards for Indians, others","A plane approaches landing over the rooftops of nearby houses at Heathrow Airport in London, Oct. 25, 2016. . (AP Photo/Frank Augstein) A plane approaches landing over the rooftops of nearby houses at Heathrow Airport in London, Oct. 25, 2016. . (AP Photo/Frank Augstein)

Non-EU visitors including Indians arriving in the UK will soon be no longer required to fill the “outdated” landing cards as part of the ongoing digital transformation of border controls, the Home Office has said. Landing cards are filled out by an estimated 16 million international visitors from outside the European Union (EU), including Indians, annually.

Under proposals published yesterday, the UK Home Office said the paper-based system, which costs the UK public around 3.6 million pounds (USD 4.6 million) each year, will be replaced as part of the UK Border Force’s ongoing digital transformation of border controls.

“We are modernising border technology to ensure Border Force staff stop dealing with outdated paperwork and can continue to focus on security and protecting the public,” said Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis. “In addition, this change will improve the experience for arriving passengers so they get an even better welcome when they land in the UK,” he said. The withdrawal of landing cards, filled out by non-EU passengers since 1971, will not result in the loss of any data that is used for security checks, the Home Office said.

All passengers arriving from outside the EU will continue to be checked against the variety of police, security and immigration watch lists which are used to verify the identity and confirm the status of every passenger arriving at the British airports. The Home Office has launched a four-week consultation with carriers/airlines, ports and those that use statistics gathered from landing card data before it comes into force later this year.

According to the department, the changes are expected to free up staff and enable Border Force to better deploy their resources. At the same time, the changes will improve the experience for travellers as passengers will no longer need to fill out the paper cards while on board the flight or in queues at airports and ports. The airports and ports, on the other hand, will no longer have to purchase and distribute them. It is expected that queue lengths will be shortened and passenger flows improved at British airports, a move welcomed by Heathrow airport, the largest UK hub.

Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said in a statement: “We warmly welcome this proposed change which would give visitors to Britain an improved experience, whilst maintaining a secure border into the UK”. “In post-Brexit Britain, it will be even more important to show we are open for business and make sure that we give investors, tourists and students a great welcome to our country.

“We look forward to continuing to work closely with the new Immigration Minister and Border Force over the coming years to keep improving the passenger experience at the UK’s border,” Holland-Kaye said. The proposals have been characterised as part of the Home Office’s ongoing transformation at the border which is enhancing Border Force’s ability both to facilitate legitimate travel and ensure the security of the border.

“This programme of work has already seen the introduction of 232 e-gates at 21 ports and since June has seen more than a million passengers use them each week. This has enabled Border Force officers to work on other security and intelligence matters,” the Home Office said.

The changes are in addition to the ongoing Digital Services at the Border (DSAB) programme, which is modernising technology at the border to improve intelligence gathering on goods and passengers and increase security. The UK Border Force has also increased the use of Advance Passenger Information, with systems in place to receive data on 100 per cent of scheduled flights for all international journeys to and from the UK.

Delhi Dynamos sign Venezuela international Gabriel Cichero,"Gabriel Cichero can play both as left-back and left-stopper. (Source: Reuters) Gabriel Cichero can play both as left-back and left-stopper. (Source: Reuters)

Delhi Dynamos have roped in 33- year-old veteran Venezuelan international Gabriel Cichero as their fourth foreign recruit for the next season of Indian Super League (ISL).

Cichero, who can play both as left-back and left-stopper, is currently a part of the Venezuela squad for the ongoing 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers.

This will be Cichero’s second coming to India – the last time he was here was back in 2011, when Venezuela played Argentina in a historic match at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.

Cichero, has already made 51 appearances (full internationals) for the senior national team, having scored four goals, including one against Chile in the 2011 edition of Copa America.

Cichero has won the 2008 Western Conference Championship in the United States with New York Red Bulls. At FC Caracas, his hometown club, he won the Venezuelan Championships twice in 2009 and 2010, along with winning the Domestic Cup competition in 2009.

Capable of playing as a full-back as well, Cichero will offer new defensive possibilities to head coach Miguel Angel Portugal.

The veteran defender will also bring in an enormous amount of experience to this Delhi Dynamos squad. Cichero said: “I am very happy to join Delhi Dynamos. Football is my life and I will work hard and help the team to achieve the objective of being the champions of the ISL.

“Happy to see a lot of South American players in the team, the adaptation will be faster for all of us. I want to thank our Coach Portugal and all staff of the team for this opportunity.”

Cichero previously plied his trade in Uruguay for Montevideo Wanderers, and has had short stints in Italy with Lecce and in Bulgaria with VihrenSandanski. The 33-year old has also played in Ligue 1 with FC Nantes and RC Lens and was also part of Newell’s Old Boys in Argentina.

The full back last represented Deportivo Lara in the Venezuelan top division.

“Gabriel is a player, who will bring a lot of experience and leadership to the Delhi Dynamos this year. He has represented Venezuela numerous times and has played in extremely high profile tournaments.

“This shows the quality of player Gabriel is and his ability to go up against some of the world’s best. Gabriel is going to be a tenacious defender for the Lions this year and I can’t wait to see the havoc he will inflict on opposing teams,” Delhi Dynamos Director Rohan Sharma said

Prachanda’s daughter wins mayoral election in Nepal,"In Picture, Nepal former Prime Minister Prachanda’s daughter Renu Dahal (twitter.com/renu_dahal) In Picture, Nepal former Prime Minister Prachanda’s daughter Renu Dahal (twitter.com/renu_dahal)

The daughter of Nepal’s former Prime Minister Prachanda on Sunday won the mayoral election of Bharatpur city. Renu Dahal, who secured 43,127 votes, defeated her nearest rival – CPN-UML’s Devi Prasad Gyawali – by 203 votes.

Gyawali got 42,924 votes and gave a tough fight to the daughter of CPN-Maoist Centre’s chief. Re-polling was conducted in Ward number 19 as per the court’s verdict as counting of votes of Bharatpur Metropolis, under the second phase of local-level election, was put off after some people vandalised the ballot box. Nepali Congress’ Parvati Shah won the post of Deputy Mayor, beating her rival Divya Sharma Acharya of CPN-UML.

The ruling parties, Nepali Congress and CPN-Maoist Centre, had electoral alliance against CPN-UML in Bharatpur. Election was held earlier in the metropolis on May 14 in the first round of civic polls. However, some cadres had damaged the ballot papers on May 28 when vote counting was underway.

Prachanda in May resigned after a brief stint of nine months, honouring a power sharing understanding with the ruling coalition partner Nepali Congress to hand over the country’s leadership to the largest party in Parliament. His resignation cleared way for his former political rival and Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba, who took over as the prime minister. The local-level polls are being held in Nepal for the first time in almost two decades.

Kenya’s former champion Eunice Sum pulls out of world 800m,"Former world 800 metres champion Eunice Sum has withdrawn from the World Athletics Championships due to illness, Kenyan officials said on Thursday.

Sum, who won gold in Moscow in 2013 and bronze in Beijing two years ago, was scheduled to race in the 800m heats on Thursday and though she said on Wednesday she was pulling out, officials initially said there was still a chance she could run.

However, they issued a statement on Thursday confirming her withdrawal.

“A decision has been made by Team Kenya in consultation with the athlete and Kenyan and IAAF medical staff for her to withdraw on medical grounds,” the statement said.

“She has not been feeling well since arriving on Aug. 6 and the cold weather of the past two days has only made her case worse.”

South Africa’s Olympic and former world champion Caster Semenya, who won bronze in the 1500m on Monday, is the strong favourite.

Uber investor sues to force former CEO Travis Kalanick off board,"Benchmark Capital is suing former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. REUTERS/Shu Zhang/File Photo Benchmark Capital is suing former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. REUTERS/Shu Zhang/File Photo

Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital is suing former Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick to force him off the board of the ride-services company and rescind his ability to fill three board seats, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit filed Thursday accuses Kalanick of concealing a range of misdeeds from the board and scheming to retain power at the company even after he was forced to resign as chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc in June following a series of scandals.

The company is currently seeking a new CEO, a search that has proved difficult.

Benchmark’s lawsuit marks a rare instance of a Silicon Valley investor suing the central figure at one of its own start-ups. The well-regarded venture firm was an early investor in Uber and said in the lawsuit that it owns 13 percent of Uber and controls 20 percent of the voting power.

Kalanick issued a statement calling the lawsuit “completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.” The statement accused Benchmark of “acting in its own best interests contrary to the interests of Uber” and denounced the legal action as a “transparent attempt to deprive Travis Kalanick of his rights as a founder and shareholder.”

Uber and Benchmark Capital declined to comment.

Around Silicon Valley, the case surprised many technology investors, who deemed it “the nuclear option” for a venture firm. At the $68 billion valuation that Uber achieved last year, Benchmark’s stake would be worth almost $9 billion.

Bill Gurley, the venture capitalist who led Benchmark’s investment into Uber, was once a mentor to Kalanick and one of his closest confidants. Gurley resigned from Uber’s board in June after he grew increasingly unhappy with Kalanick’s behavior, according to sources close to the situation.

The lawsuit filed Thursday in a Delaware court opens another chapter in a saga of woe at Uber that has cast doubt on the future of the world’s most highly valued startup company.

Uber’s troubles include a trade-secret lawsuit by Alphabet Inc’s Waymo unit that led to the departure of a star engineer and hobbled Uber’s self-driving car program; sexual harassment allegations that led to a major internal investigation and the dismissal of several top executives; and alleged misconduct by Kalanick and other executives in handling a rape committed by an Uber driver in India.

In its lawsuit, Benchmark argued that Kalanick was aware of these problems when Uber’s board in 2016 agreed to expand the number of voting directors from eight to 11, with Kalanick having the sole right to fill those seats.

Benchmark, which still holds one of the seats on the Uber board, said that it never would have given Kalanick the three extra seats if it had known about his “gross mismanagement and other misconduct at Uber,” the lawsuit said. Kalanick appointed himself to one of the seats after he was ousted as CEO, and the other two remain vacant.

Uber is seeking not only a CEO but also a number of other senior executives, and for now is being run by a group of 14 employees. Uber co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp wrote a letter to employees earlier this week stating that “Travis is not returning as CEO,” after reports that Kalanick was hoping to reclaim the top job.

“The combination of this lawsuit and his cofounder’s statement that he’s not coming back are pretty strong statements,” said Ben Narasin, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. “Put a fork in it. He (Kalanick) is done.”

Benchmark’s lawsuit alleged that Kalanick was scheming to regain power by attempting to “pack the board.” The lawsuit seeks an injunction to block Kalanick’s right to appoint new directors, asserting he had agreed to give up those rights when he stepped aside as CEO.

Kalanick’s continued role at the company has complicated the CEO search and scared off some good candidates, according to one Uber investor.

Uber’s head of operations, Ryan Graves, one of the company’s first employees and a long-time Kalanick ally, announced earlier Thursday that he would resign from his job at Uber to focus on his role as a board director.

Benchmark’s lawsuit will cause investors to rethink the recent practice of granting founders extensive power over their firms, said Bob Ackerman, founder of venture firm Allegis Capital, which is not an investor in Uber.

“A lot of sins get overlooked when everything is going right from a financial perspective,” Ackerman said.

Still, the case could be a tough one for Benchmark to win, said Erik Gordon, an entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

“Even if you assume that Kalanick acted outrageously improperly, where was Benchmark when he was acting out?” Gordon said. “Did Benchmark fight tooth and nail against Kalanick’s conduct, or were they willing to put up with it as long as the company’s valuation, and the value of their investment in it, skyrocketed?”

The lawsuit was first reported by news website Axios.

"Kenyatta surges ahead, Kenya opposition claims polls ‘hacked’","Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, the presidential candidate of the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition, address a news conference on the concluded presidential election in Nairobi, Kenya. (Source: Reuters) Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, the presidential candidate of the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition, address a news conference on the concluded presidential election in Nairobi, Kenya. (Source: Reuters)

President Uhuru Kenyatta appeared headed for re-election on Wednesday but his rival Raila Odinga claimed a massive hacking attack had manipulated results, ratcheting up tensions in east Africa’s richest economy. With ballots from 92 percent of polling stations counted, electoral commission (IEBC) results showed Kenyatta leading with 54.4 percent of the nearly 14 million ballots tallied against Odinga’s 44.7 percent, a difference of 1.3 million votes.

“These results are fake, it is a sham. They cannot be credible,” Odinga told a press conference in the early hours of the morning as partial results fell quickly via an electronic tallying system aimed at preventing fraud.

He later detailed accusations of a massive hacking attack on the electronic system, saying hackers had gained entry to the system using the identity of top IT official Chris Msando, who was found murdered and tortured late last month.

“This is an attack on our democracy. The 2017 general election was a fraud,” said Odinga, claiming detailed evidence of the hacker’s movements. He would not say how he got the information, as he wanted to “protect his source”.

Odinga claimed the IEBC had not provided the scanned forms meant to accompany the results.

The 72-year-old, who is making his fourth bid for the presidency as the flagbearer for the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition, accused his rivals of stealing victory from him through rigging in 2007 and in 2013.

“You can only cheat a people for so long,” he said. In 2007, the disputed vote resulted in two months of ethnically driven political violence that killed 1,100 people and displaced 600,000, a major blow to a nation seen as a regional bastion of stability.

The contested election in 2013 was taken to the courts and ended largely peacefully, though Odinga lost.

Odinga urged his supporters to “remain calm as we look deep into this matter.” But he added: “I don’t control the people.” As his speech ended scores of supporters gathered at a roundabout in his western stronghold of Kisumu and began burning tyres. Riot police carrying shields, assault rifles and batons fired teargas and the crowd quickly dispersed, said an AFP reporter in Kisumu.

Local media urged the losers to peacefully accept the result and turn to the justice system with their grievances. “The voters, too, must await the results while acknowledging that their favourite candidate can actually lose. It is a critical measure of democracy that there will be winners and losers,” read an editorial in the Daily Nation newspaper.

The normally traffic-choked streets of Nairobi were largely deserted Wednesday, and some businesses remained closed as the country held its breath over the results.

"Ravindra Jadeja spends time with Ravi Shastri, team India enjoys off day","Ravindra Jadeja edged out Shakib Al Hasan to claim the numero uno spot among all-rounders in the latest ICC Test rankings. (Source: Reuters) Ravindra Jadeja edged out Shakib Al Hasan to claim the numero uno spot among all-rounders in the latest ICC Test rankings. (Source: Reuters)

Suspended from the third Test, all- rounder Ravindra Jadeja was seen having discussions with chief coach Ravi Shastri even as the rest of the Indian cricket team enjoyed an off day after its thumping win in the second match. Amid the disappointment of missing out on the match, there was some consolation for Jadeja as he edged out Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan to claim the numero uno spot among all-rounders in the latest ICC Test rankings.

As the Indian players relaxed at their hotel here or went out simply taking some time off, the left-arm spinner spent the evening with Shastri and other members of the support staff.

It was not known what transpired but Shastri has been a thoroughly acknowledged motivator for the players in rough times.

Jadeja has a somewhat tumultuous past in terms of discipline. There was the 2014 incident at Nottingham when on his first tour to England, clashing with pacer James Anderson in the pavilion.

Then skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had stood his ground in support of Jadeja as it escalated into a small diplomatic crisis. In the end, both Anderson and Jadeja escaped punishment, with the latter losing 50 percent of his match fee back then (later repealed).

The spinner has lost a similar amount of his match fee for the second Test but what will rankle him more is the chance to get onto the field as the No.1 bowler/all-rounder as he serves the suspension.

This particular suspension also comes about as the result of accruing demerit points. Jadeja already had three points after he was found guilty of ‘running in and damaging the protected area of the pitch’ in the third Test against New Zealand at Indore last October.

India wrapped a second consecutive Test series’ win in Sri Lanka after winning the second Test at the SSC in Colombo by an innings and 53 runs.

The visitors had won the first Test at Galle by 304 runs, and both victories have come comfortably within four days. It is a repeat of India’s 2-1 series win here in 2015, only this time the lead going into the third and final Test in Pallekele (starting August 12) is an unassailable 2-0.

For the first time in a long while, an Indian team stands on the cusp of a series whitewash away from home. The match could another chance for young Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav to prove his mettle just like he did on his debut against Australia earlier this year.

It is also to be noted that India haven’t really played ‘away’ from home conditions in a peculiar way. Since 2015, they have only toured either Lanka or West Indies, and played a long season at home.

India tour South Africa, England and Australia next, conditions and opposition that are sure to test both their skipper’s and the team’s resolve.

Four policemen killed in northern Sinai: Egyptian officials,"Egyptian security officials say four policemen have been killed in an ambush in restive northern Sinai peninsula where Islamic militants are active. They said the policemen were heading to the town of el-Arish today when gunmen attacked the car they were riding in and opened fire, killing one police officer, a low-ranking policeman and two conscripts.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. Egypt in recent years has been battling a stepped-up insurgency in northern Sinai, mainly by militants from an Islamic State group affiliate.

The campaign accelerated after the military ousted elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.

Switzerland is known for many things, from snow-capped mountains to Swiss chocolates, there is no dearth of reasons why one must visit the magical place. And to top that, it has now officially opened the world’s ‘longest’ suspension bridge. The 494m-long pedestrian hanging bridge is perfect for hikers and for wanderers who love to explore nature at its best. But, it is not for the faint-hearted. The adventurous walk down the ‘Europabruecke’ bridge, connecting Grächen and Zermatt, is at a “dizzying height”, according to the Zermatt tourism board website.

The bridge is located along the Europaweg trail offers views of the Matterhorn, Weisshorn and the Bernese Alps mountains. The bridge will also provide an opportunity for travellers to witness the highest mountains in Switzerland the Dom (4,545m).

However, along with breathtaking view, it could literally take away the breath of people with vertigo. “The path runs between 1,600m and 2,200m above sea level and high above the deepest cut valley in Switzerland,” the tourism board added.

BJP mulling to bring six former Tripura Trinamool MLAs to campaign in West Bengal,"Representational image Representational image

In a bid to expose the alleged nexus between the ruling Trinamool Congress and Left Front, the state BJP is mulling bringing six former Tripura Trinamool MLAs, who had recently joined BJP, to campaign for the party in West Bengal.

Rebel Trinamool MLAs Sudip Roy Barman, Asish Saha, Pranjit Singha Roy, Diba Chandra Hrankhawal, Dilip Sarkar and Biswa Bandhu Sen had joined the BJP at a public meeting in Agartala on Monday. They had met BJP national president Amit Shah in New Delhi on Saturday before joining the party.

On July 3, Trinamool had severed all ties with these MLAs after they expressed their desire to vote for NDA’s presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind. While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had asked all party MPs and MLAs to vote for Opposition’s presidential candidate Meira Kumar, the six MLAs had said they would not vote for someone supported by the Left Front. Following this, they were expelled from Trinamool. Earlier, too, protesting against the Congress’ electoral understanding with CPM ahead of the 2016 Bengal polls, these six MLAs had quit Congress and joined Trinamool.

“There is no immediate plan to bring them (the six MLAs) here. But we must try to bring them to West Bengal to expose both Left Front and Trinamool,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said.

With Trinamool and CPM-led Left Front coming together to support Meira Kumar, BJP has been alleging a nexus between the two.

“Even in the recent civic polls, we have witnessed both parties contesting after entering into a tacit understanding to prevent the rise of BJP. All Opposition parties are coming together to stop BJP. It is time that the nexus is exposed,” said BJP president Dilip Ghosh.

Sources in the BJP said chances are high that the six MLAs would campaign for the party in West Bengal. “Firstly, they are well aware of the politics pursued by both Trinamool and Left Front, as the latter is in power in Tripura. Secondly, they were with Trinamool, which will help us put pressure on the ruling party in Bengal.

Lastly, they are from a Bengali speaking state, which will help them communicate better with the people of West Bengal,” said a senior BJP leader.

The leader added that the Tripura MLAs are likely to campaign for BJP in next year’s panchayat elections, likely to be held ahead of the Assembly polls in Tripura.

"Anukul Roy, Himanshu Rana lead India U-19 team to victory over England","Anukul Roy bowled a brilliant spell of left arm spin and ended with figures of 4/27. Anukul Roy bowled a brilliant spell of left arm spin and ended with figures of 4/27.

Courtesy of a fine unbeaten 74 by Himanshu Rana and a brilliant bowling performance by the duo of Anukul Roy and Rahul Chahar, India U-19 secured a second consecutive win over their English counterparts by 8 wickets on Thursday at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.

After winning the toss, the England U19 side led by Harry Brook opted to bat first. The home side got off to a steady start and was cruising at one point with the score board on 83/1. But a fine spell from Anukul Roy put the breaks on the scoring. Roy first scalped Liam Trevaskis and then got rid off skipper Harry Brook in successive overs. From thereon the English side could not put on a steady partnership which ultimately saw them getting bundled out for 175. Tom Lammonby and Liam Trevaskis were the only ones who stood out with the bat with scores of 30 and 35 respectively. For India, the performers with the ball were Anukul Roy (4/27) and Rahul Chahar (3/26). Abhishek Sharma also chipped in with a couple of wickets.

Chasing a target of 176 could have proved tricky but India got off to a fine start as the duo of Prithvi Shaw and Himanshu Rana put up a hundred run opening partnership. This virtually sealed the match for the visitors. While Shaw was dismissed for 48, Rana scored a fine 74 to take India to a win in the 2nd Youth ODI. With this victory, India has also won the series.

India Squad: Prithvi Shaw (c), Himanshu Rana, Shubman Gill, Het Patel (wk), Salman Khan, Abhishek Sharma, Anukul Sudhakar Roy, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shivam Mavi, Yash Thakur, Rahul Chahar, Shiva Singh, Harvik Desai, S Radhakrishnan, Ishan Porel

Here’s how the last five films of Shah Rukh Khan fared at the box office,"After an entire weekend at the theaters, we can now safely say that neither the audience nor the critics have taken to Shah Rukh Khan's Jab Harry Met Sejal. SRK's films in the recent past have suffered the same fate, and maybe even worse. Even as Jab Harry Met Sejal has barely managed to cross the Rs 50 crores mark, let's take a look at the box office performance of five recent Shah Rukh Khan films. (Source: Photo by Twitter)

Raees: Shah Rukh Khan broke the romantic hero mold with his turn as a gangster in Raees. This bad boy was good at heart but the script failed to keep up with Shah Rukh's ability to pull off such a role. On top of it, the film's clash with Hrithik Roshan starrer Kaabil affected its box office prospects too. Raees earned Rs 147 crores. (Source: Photo by Twitter)

Dear Zindagi: Shah Rukh Khan played a psychologist helping Alia Bhatt cope with depression caused by different episodes in her life. While the film revolved Alia's character, Shah Rukh's role was an extended cameo, which did not feel like a cameo at all. His character was met with mixed response from fans. At the box office, the mood of the audience became quite evident. The film could only manage a lifetime business of just Rs 68.16 crores. (Source: Photo by Twitter)

Fan: This Shah Rukh Khan film was a treat for the audience as he was trying something out of the box. SRK was stepping into the shoes of his fans, crazy fans to be precise. While the concept struck a chord with the audience, the VFXed 20 something version of Shah Rukh failed to impress fans. The film did a lifetime business of Rs 84.10 crores at the box office.

Dilwale: While Dilwale was a sad comeback for one of Bollywood's favourite jodis - Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, the film managed to mint Rs 148.72 crores. (Source: Photo by Twitter)"
"North Korea war would be ‘catastrophic,’ diplomacy bearing fruit: Jim Mattis","Speaking at an event in California yesterday, Mattis said his mission and responsibility was to have military options ready “should they be needed” but stressed the US effort is currently focused on diplomacy. (File) Speaking at an event in California yesterday, Mattis said his mission and responsibility was to have military options ready “should they be needed” but stressed the US effort is currently focused on diplomacy. (File)

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on has warned that war with North Korea would be “catastrophic” and said diplomatic efforts were yielding results. Speaking at an event in California yesterday, Mattis said his mission and responsibility was to have military options ready “should they be needed” but stressed the US effort is currently focused on diplomacy.

“The American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results and I want to stay right there right now,” Mattis said at an event in California. “The tragedy of war is well-enough known it doesn’t need another characterization beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic,” he added.

Mattis’ comments came shortly after President Donald Trump warned North Korea it should be “very, very nervous” if it thinks of attacking America, and doubled down on a vow to rain “fire and fury” on Pyongyang if it continued to threaten the US. Mattis did not elaborate on the diplomatic results he referenced, but the UN Security Council at the weekend passed a new set of sanctions against Pyongyang over its weapons program, including bans on the export of coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore as well as fish and seafood.

In a diplomatic win for the United States, the measures were approved unanimously — including by Russia and China, the North’s sole major ally. The Pentagon chief on Wednesday issued a carefully worded statement telling North Korea it would be “grossly” outmatched in any conflict with the US, and warning Pyongyang to stop considering any action that risked “the destruction of its people.” (AFP)

Medical courses: UGC to set up panel to fix deemed varsities’ fee,"Currently, there are a total of 123 deemed universities across the country. (File photo) Currently, there are a total of 123 deemed universities across the country. (File photo)

The government has asked University Grants Commission (UGC) to set up a committee to regulate the tuition fee for medical courses offered by self-financed deemed universities.

The HRD Ministry, in a letter dated July 26, has nominated Sanjay Shrivastav, a retired professor of opthalmology, and B Srinivas, assistant director general at the Directorate of Health Services under the Health Ministry, to the committee. The Indian Express could not reach UGC’s acting chairman V S Chauhan for comment.

The proposed committee is being set up in compliance with the order of the Madras High Court, which is currently hearing a PIL seeking to fix tuition fee charged by deemed universities offering medical courses.

Currently, there are a total of 123 deemed universities across the country. Of these, about 30 offer medical courses. Among them are Manipal University, SRM University in Tamil Nadu, NIMHANS in Bengaluru and Jamia Hamdard University.

The PIL filed in Madras High Court said deemed universities offering medical courses were profiteering and operating with the sole intention of amassing wealth through unfair means. The plea has been admitted by the bench and all medical deemed universities in the state have been made respondents to the PIL.

The court also asked the government to set up a panel to regulate the fee charged by deemed universities offering medical courses, but the decision of the fee panel will abide by the final ruling on the PIL. Under the UGC [Institutions Deemed to be Universities] Regulation, 2016, the commission is empowered to fix the fee charged by deemed varsities.

Sparring partner Paulie Malignaggi slams ‘scumbag’ Conor McGregor,"Malignaggi said McGregor used him like a pawn, disrespected him in the dressing room. (Source: AP) Malignaggi said McGregor used him like a pawn, disrespected him in the dressing room. (Source: AP)

Former boxing champ Paulie Malignaggi says he has no regrets about quitting Conor McGregor’s training camp, describing the mixed martial arts fighter as a “scumbag” who surrounds himself with “a bunch of yes men.”

McGregor is preparing to face boxing star Floyd Mayweather in a Las Vegas boxing ring on August 26 in what could be one of the richest fights in history.

The 36-year-old Malignaggi, who retired from boxing five months ago, walked out of training camp last week after he said McGregor used him like a pawn, disrespected him in the dressing room and housed him and the other sparring partners in dumpy accommodations.

“He’s a scumbag,” Malignaggi said of McGregor in an interview Monday with the American website The MMA Hour. He also gave a detailed breakdown of how their sparring sessions went, no doubt providing Mayweather with a blueprint on how to beat McGregor.

Malignaggi, a former multiple world champion, said despite training little during retirement he had no trouble getting the better of McGregor.

Malignaggi said McGregor is more concerned about putting on a spectacle in training camp than getting ready for a serious boxing debut against one of the greatest fighters of all-time.

Malignaggi was also upset about training camp pictures made public that show the Irishman in a positive light.

“The guy is all about his ego. He’s actually not trying to get better. He’s got a bunch of yes men in his corner who tell him he’s doing good even if he’s doing bad. It is just about him and cheerleading,” Malignaggi told MMA Hour. He said he asked McGregor to stop releasing misleading sparring photos that showed the MMA fighter getting the better of the exchanges. McGregor refused.

“At this stage I’m waiting for Ashton Kutcher to walk into the dressing rooms and tell me I got Punk’d. I thought it was a joke. I thought there was no way this guy is that much of an asshole,” he said.

Some kind of crackhouse

“I showed up with the best intentions to camp and at a certain point you start to realize you are being used as a pawn where somebody’s trying to get ahead at your expense and not through your help.

“I said ‘I can’t deal with this.’ His team is a bunch of cheerleaders. They are not improving him. I don’t need to be around these people. It is not like they brought me in for anything tactical.”

He said the training camp accommodations were better suited to drug dealers. “They put me in some kind of a crackhouse,” he said.

Malignaggi indicated that Mayweather should have little trouble with McGregor over 12 rounds of boxing as long as he goes to the body on a regular basis.

“From about six rounds on, he became very hittable,” the

“From about six rounds on, he became very hittable,” the former champ said. “So much more hittable that I was putting more weight on my shots and sitting down more on my shots, and of course, the body shots started to affect him more and more.

“In MMA the body shots aren’t the same as in boxing in that there is consistency to body shots in boxing. There is a debilitating breakdown from the body shots in boxing. Little by little you feel the air come out of you with fatigue.”

He said McGregor’s biggest asset against Mayweather will be his excellent conditioning.

“Conditioning wise he could push the issue a little bit more than I could,” he said.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says US ‘not trustable’ partner,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi/Files) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi/Files)

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday the US is not a trustable country to work with over international issues. Speaking in his swear-in ceremony in the Iranian parliament, Rouhani criticized the US for threatening the implementation of the nuclear deal, Xinhua reported.

He said that the Islamic republic would remain committed to the international nuclear deal and would not violate the nuclear deal signed between Iran and the six major powers two years ago. “However, Iran would not be silent in the face of US threats to the implementation of the deal,” he said, adding that “Tehran would reciprocate every threatening move by Washington in this regard.”

The Iranian President warned that “those who are thinking of tearing the accord into pieces, in actuality, would harm their political life.” The world would not thrust the United States anymore, he said.

Rouhani was alluding to the US President Donald Trump’s comments on Iran’s nuclear deal during his presidential campaign, as Trump repeatedly criticized the accord, calling it “the worst deal ever negotiated.” On Thursday, Iran denounced the recent endorsement of new sanctions against Tehran by the US President, saying that it violates nuclear deal.

Recent unilateral sanctions against Iran by the United States are mainly in response to Tehran’s growing missile program, the White House says Iran’s ballistic missile tests are in violation of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Tehran has emphasized that its ballistic missile advancement is for deterrent purposes and the country will never negotiate over it. Tehran also said that the new US sanctions against Iran aimed at threatening the international community against cooperating with Iran, which will ultimately limit Iran’s gain from the fruits of the deal.

Iran and six world powers, namely Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, reached an agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue in July 2015, which put Tehran on the path of sanctions relief but with more strict limits on its nuclear program.

"Will support S Sreesanth, subject to clearance from BCCI: Kerala Cricket Association","The Kerala High Court lifted the ban on pacer S Sreesanth clearing him of all charges. The Kerala High Court lifted the ban on pacer S Sreesanth clearing him of all charges.

After the Kerala High Court lifted the ban on pacer S Sreesanth the Kerala Cricket Association has written to the BCCI in a bid to know the decision pertaining to Sreesanth’s involvement in playing cricket. The KCA also went on to reveal that Sreesanth has stated the body of his decision to make a comeback by getting to play to play first class cricket.

In a statement released, the KCA wrote, “With the domestic season around the corner, KCA would also like to support him and provide an opportunity to train/practice in the pre-season preparatory camps and selection trials at the earliest instance, subject to clearance from the Committee of Administrators/BCCI”.

Earlier, Sreesanth had gone to say that he is dreaming of playing in the 2019 World Cup after the ban was lifted.

“My dream is to play 2019 World Cup for India,” Sreesanth told The Times of India in an interview. “But I know it is next to impossible and it would be a miracle if I play in that World Cup. But I have always believed that miracles can happen. There might be stiff competition for fast bowlers’ spots now. But there was competition even when I made my way into the Indian team. I have always felt that competition gets the best out of me. I just hope that I can do justice to my talent on my comeback.”

“It is a new life for me. Even the biggest of criminals don’t go through what I or my family went through. “A small incident was portrayed in the wrong way in front of the world. Maybe that’s how the world works, I don’t know.”, Sreesanth added.

"India, China should ink new boundary pact in Sikkim sector: Chinese scholars","Doklam standoff: Of the 3,488-km-long India-China border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim. Doklam standoff: Of the 3,488-km-long India-China border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim.

Notwithstanding the Doklam standoff, Chinese military analysts say that India and China should sign a new boundary convention in the Sikkim sector to replace the 1890 Great Britain-China agreement and make it more contemporary.

“For China early harvest means, we want to have a new agreement with India, because the 1890 convention was signed between Great Britain and China,” Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhou, Director at the Centre on China-America Defence Relations of the Academy of Military Science, told an Indian media delegation here yesterday.

“At that time, it was not the People’s Republic of China, (PRC). India became independent in 1947. It is better we change the signatures of the convention, that is what I mean early harvest,” he said.

“It is very essential because there are territorial disputes in the eastern, central and western sectors of the India-China border. Only in the Sikkim section we have the fixed border. So, we want to start from the easiest, that is what we call early harvest,” he added.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry too in its August 2 fact-sheet on Doklam standoff referred to Beijing’s expectations of an “early harvest” in the Sikkim sector.

“The Chinese and Indian sides have been in discussion on making the boundary in the Sikkim Sector an ‘early harvest’ in the settlement of the entire boundary question during the meetings between the Special Representatives on the China-India Boundary Question,” it had said, referring to the 1890 convention.

“The boundary in the Sikkim sector has long been delimited by the 1890 Convention, which was signed between then China and Great Britain. China and India ought to sign a new boundary convention in their own names to replace the 1890 Convention. This, however, in no way alters the nature of the boundary in the Sikkim sector as having already been delimited,” it had said.

On the Sikkim part of the boundary, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in its June 30 statement on the Doklam standoff had said, “Where the boundary in the Sikkim sector is concerned, India and China had reached an understanding also in 2012 reconfirming their mutual agreement on the ‘basis of the alignment’. Further discussions regarding finalisation of the boundary have been taking place under the Special Representatives framework.”

Therefore “it is essential that all parties concerned display utmost restraint and abide by their respective bilateral understandings not to change the status quo unilaterally. It is also important that the consensus reached between India and China through the Special Representatives process is scrupulously respected by both sides,” the MEA had said.

Of the 3,488-km-long India-China border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim.

India and China have been locked in a face-off in the Doklam area of the Sikkim sector for the last 50 days after Indian troops stopped the Chinese People’s Liberation Army from building a road in the area.

China claimed that it was constructing the road within its territory and has been demanding immediate pull-out of the Indian troops from Doklam. Bhutan says Doklam belongs to it but China claims sovereignty over the area. China also claims that Thimphu has no dispute with Beijing over Doklam.

(Source: Reuters file) Viktor Axelsen would hope to add to his Olympic medal in 2016 with a World Championship medal. (Source: Reuters file)

Olympic bronze medallist Viktor Axelsen feels India’s Kidambi Srikanth along with legendary Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan will pose serious threats to his World Championship title dream. “There are a lot of threats on my way to gold (at World Championships). (Kidambi) Srikanth of India has been playing really well, and of course there are the likes of Lin Dan, Chen Long and Lee Chong Wei,” Axelsen said. “It’s a really open category at the moment. There are too many names to say and just a few people who could do well,” he added.

The World No. 3 had some gruelling duels against Srikanth and the duo are currently locked 2-2 in the head-to-head count. with the Denmark shuttler having beaten the Indian twice in straight games in the last two encounters.

Axelsen has been busy trying to regaining his full fitness following a foot injury and said he needs to keep faith on his skills to clinch the medal. “The World Championships, along with the Olympics and Thomas Cup, are the events which we most look forward to, so I’m really excited,” said Axelsen, who already has the European and Thomas Cup titles to his name. “I’ve had a few issues with my foot leading up to this tournament, however, it is under control now. I am getting more and more into rhythm. Hopefully I can be in good form. I have to believe in myself and believe that a world title is possible,” he added.

Axelsen, who won a bronze on home soil three years ago, said he will keep chasing his dream of winning the gold at World Championship. “Since I was a little child, I have always dreamt of becoming world champion. It would be a huge achievement, and something that I will keep chasing for the rest of my career,” he said.

CoA leaves it to BCCI’s general body to decide on Mohammad Azharuddin’s dues,"Though BCCI members will take a call on it in future, there will be other cricketers who will also benefit if Azhar’s plea is accepted. (File photo) Though BCCI members will take a call on it in future, there will be other cricketers who will also benefit if Azhar’s plea is accepted. (File photo)

The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) has left it to BCCI’s annual general body to decide whether they should clear the dues of former captain Mohammad Azharuddin post his life ban for alleged match-fixing.

Azhar had written to the CoA requesting it to clear his old dues — his monthly pension and one-time benefit given to past cricketers, pointing out that the Andhra Pradesh High Court had held the BCCI ban “illegal” and “unsustainable”. Though BCCI members will take a call on it in future, there will be other cricketers who will also benefit if Azhar’s plea is accepted.

Former cricketers Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar and Ajay Sharma, who too have served bans on similar charges, will also hope to get their pending dues. The BCCI had imposed a five-year ban on Jadeja, for six years on Prabhakar and a life ban on Sharma when the match-fixing scandal broke out in 2000.

“If Azhar’s plea is accepted, then indirectly, the board will have to give pending dues to the other three cricketers too who were convicted by the BCCI. The members will have to take a call when the board’s AGM takes place,” a top BCCI official said.

On a day when the CoA met BCCI office-bearers in New Delhi, Azhar was hopeful of matters being settled, especially after the Kerala High Court order to lift the life ban on S Sreesanth.

“My expectations are positive; I never think negative. The letter that I sent to the Indian cricket board was put on the agenda of the meeting so that means they are serious about it. I am hoping this case is resolved at the earliest and we move ahead,” Azhar said.

Meanwhile, the BCCI will appeal in the Supreme Court against the order of the Kerala High Court, which gave a clean chit to Sreesanth in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal.

‘Decide alternate venues’

CoA head Vinod Rai is upset with BCCI’s choice of two new venues — Thiruvanantpuram and Guwahati — to host international games against Australia and Sri Lanka. The Kerala Cricket Association and Assam Cricket Association have come up with the two new venues which are yet to get the go ahead from the ICC. At the same time, it is learnt that the UP Cricket Association wants to hosts an ODI at the newly constructed Ekana Stadium in Lucknow. The CoA has asked BCCI to look for alternative venues which have the requisite ICC clearance to host international games.

While Monica Gill plays his love interest, Ishita Dutta also plays a significant part in the movie. Few reports also suggested that Kapil had to lose a lot of weight to look his part in the film.

With all these details, Kapil Sharma fans must be waiting to see him on the big screen. His first film was Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon, helmed by Abbas Mustan, which was not a big success at the box office.

Latest at IP College: Room to sit back and enjoy some music,"The room at IP College can be used for recording as well. (File Photo) The room at IP College can be used for recording as well. (File Photo)

The next time you visit Delhi University’s Indraprastha College for Women in Civil Lines, you can sit in a room and engage in the solitary pursuit of listening to rare musical recordings. The college — the oldest women’s institute in the university — will, on Friday, inaugurate Music Archives and Listening Room (MALR), which aims to revive the ‘Baithak’ culture that has been vanishing slowly.

A brainchild of the college principal, Babli Moitra Saraf, the MALR is an unique centre where youngsters will be made aware of the nuances of music, especially Hindustani classical. “Our country has a rich musical heritage and we cannot just let it go into oblivion. So MALR is a dedicated centre where rare recordings have been digitised for the informed and those appreciating the art form to learn and enjoy it,” said Saraf.

Kanav Gupta, a teacher in the Department of English, has helped Saraf in the project by identifying donors — mostly music lovers and practitioners who have given their recordings in different embodiment and manifestations. An elaborate catalogue of the digitised music has been maintained and students can sit and listen to them in the listening room, which can accommodate at least 25 people. There is also a studio and a recording room at MALR. The centre also plans to translate musical treatise, which are available in other Indian languages.

“Places like Doordarshan do archive the music but we wanted to make something which is readily available and accessible to the public. If the contemporary artists want to use the space for recordings that can also be done. Their interviews can be recorded and then further digitised,” Saraf said. From time to time, the centre will also hold lecture demonstration for students of the college so that they can understand the rich legacy of music. “We will also start a music appreciation course, which will be of 10-hour duration,” the principal said. The centre will remain open on all days except Tuesday and Sunday. The centre, however, will be open at different times on each day. MALR is a second unique project started at IP College. In 2015, the college had started the Museum Archive and Learning Resource Centre.

US destroyer challenges China’s claims in South China Sea,"The guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain approaches the aircraft carrier USS George Washington for a fueling at sea. (Source: Reuters) The guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain approaches the aircraft carrier USS George Washington for a fueling at sea. (Source: Reuters)

A US Navy destroyer carried out a “freedom of navigation operation” on Thursday, coming within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, US officials told Reuters. The operation came as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs and could complicate efforts to secure a common stance.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the USS John S. McCain traveled close to Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals. China has territorial disputes with its neighbors over the area.

It was the third “freedom of navigation operation” or “fonop” conducted during Trump’s presidency. Neither China’s defence ministry nor its foreign ministry immediately responded to a request for comment.

The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, and comes as Trump is seeking China’s cooperation to rein in North Korea.

Tensions have risen recently after North Korea carried out two nuclear tests last year and two ICBM tests last month, prompting a strong round of UN sanctions which angered Pyongyang who threatened to teach the United States a “severe lesson”.

Trump in turn responded by warning North Korea it would face “fire and fury” if it further threatened the United States.

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a stark warning to North Korea on Wednesday, telling Pyongyang that it should stop any actions that would lead to the “end of its regime and the destruction of its people.”

The United States has criticized China’s construction of islands and build-up of military facilities in the sea, and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement.

The US military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and they are separate from political considerations.

The Trump administration has vowed to conduct more robust South China Sea operations. In July, a US warship sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam.

Experts and officials have criticized President Barack Obama for potentially reinforcing China’s claims by sticking to innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping.

China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

"Strong AIADMK good for BJP; they must solve issues’: P Muralidhar Rao, BJP general secretary TN","BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao during the Idea Exchange programme on Thursday. Gajendra Yadav BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao during the Idea Exchange programme on Thursday. Gajendra Yadav

Amid the increasing possibility of an AIADMK merger and its joining the BJP-led NDA, a senior BJP leader on Thursday said a “united AIADMK” was good for the ruling party at the Centre.

“A united AIADMK is very much a force in Tamil Nadu and it is not in conflict with the BJP’s thinking or against its interest… A strong AIADMK is good for the BJP,” said P Muralidhar Rao, BJP general secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu affairs, in an Idea Exchange programme at The Indian Express office.

However, he said resolving issues such as succession was the AIADMK’s internal business. “Our role or scope of functioning is limited (in resolving issues and uniting the factions). We cannot make them united,” Rao said. He did not rule out the AIADMK joining the NDA government at the Centre, but said it had not unfolded yet. “When the situation comes, we will analyse it. Nothing is unfolded yet,” he said.

Two factions of the AIADMK emerged after the death of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa last December. One faction led by former CM O Panneerselvam and the other by current CM E Palaniswami held a meeting in Chennai on Thursday. Party sources said both sides, apparently under pressure from the BJP to keep aside their differences, could announce a merger soon. Jayalalithaa’s companion V K Sasikala, who replaced her as party chief and tried to become chief minister before she was convicted of corruption, and her aides may be jettisoned to facilitate the merger.

Rao made it clear that while the two major parties in Tamil Nadu were going through a transition at the leadership level, the BJP preferred AIADMK. “Definitely BJP cannot have an understanding with the DMK. The DMK is aligned with the Congress for more than 12-13 years… But AIADMK, though it was not in NDA, supported BJP and Modiji’s leadership. The relationship is cordial… there is a positivity between the two support bases,” he said. According to Rao, while the BJP could win only one seat in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, its presence in the electoral field helped the AIADMK win 37 seats.

Maintaining that leadership is the AIADMK’s internal issue, Rao said, “Unless they resolve those issues, they cannot be united, unless they are united they cannot retain power, unless they are in power they cannot deliver good governance and what Amma (Jayalalithaa) had promised to people of Tamil Nadu. Unless they deliver promises, the leadership will not seen as credible and serious… they have to solve it.”

The BJP general secretary said a number of party leaders had been in touch with superstar Rajinikanth, but not as a political party. “We are not in touch with Rajinikanth as a political party, but everyone of us is in touch with him. He is close to many of us,” he said, adding that it was up to the actor to decide on forming a political party or joining a party or having anything to do with politics. “But going by his expressions, people tend to develop a feeling that he is not so reserved (over his political entry) and he may.”

Jordan Spieth starts grand slam quest in front of huge gallery at PGA Championship,"Jodan Spieth, wearing a green horizontal striped shirt and dark blue trousers, tipped his cap to polite applause after descending the bridge from the practice green. (Source: USA Today Sports) Jodan Spieth, wearing a green horizontal striped shirt and dark blue trousers, tipped his cap to polite applause after descending the bridge from the practice green. (Source: USA Today Sports)

A huge gallery lined the par-five 10th hole from tee to green as Jordan Spieth started his quest for the elusive grand slam at the PGA Championship on Thursday.

Despite the early hour, thousands of spectators, including swimming champion Michael Phelps, had already filed into Quail Hollow by time Spieth arrived at the tee at 8.23 a.m. local time (1223 GMT), a couple of minutes after Sergio Garcia and Brooks Koepka, the three majors champions of 2016 grouped together for the final major of the year.

Koepka politely introduced himself as “Brooks” to the standard bearer and scorer, as if they did not recognise the U.S. Open champion.

The tee was still in shadow, the early-morning sun still trying to peak over the five deciduous trees on the left side of the tee.

Spieth, wearing a green horizontal striped shirt and dark blue trousers, tipped his cap to polite applause after descending the bridge from the practice green.

The group’s tee time was delayed two minutes because the preceding threesome had not played their second shots at the hole, which is reachable in two shots for most players.

Spite was last to drive, and he quickly reached down to pull his tee out of the ground, happy with his opening shot as the gallery applauded warmly.

He subsequently had a tap-in par in a smooth start as he attempts to become the sixth man to complete the career grand slam of all four modern majors and, at 24, to supplant Tiger Woods as the youngest.

Earlier, there was hardly a breath of wind when local North Carolinian Grayson Murray struck the first tee shot at 7:20 a.m. local time (1120 GMT).

The forecast suggests there will be no stoppages during the first round, with only a 20 percent chance of a stray late-afternoon thunderstorm.

Rory McIlroy, a two-time winner at Quail Hollow, and defending champion Jimmy Walker are among those who start in the afternoon half of the draw.

What to expect from upcoming English Premier League,"Manchester United is expected to return from its slumber. (Source: Reuters) Manchester United is expected to return from its slumber. (Source: Reuters)

English Premier League finally returns this weekend, and having kept a close tab on the teams during the pre-season, fans have reason to be somewhat anxious for their respective clubs. It is difficult to point out potential champions, or even the top-four teams, but based on previous season and the activity by most clubs in the summer, some general predictions can be made.

Return of Manchester United

A giant will return from its slumber. After three years of identity crisis, which Manchester United suffered following Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, United are finally back at the top of the food chain. Or so it seems. They have a star-studded squad, a decorated manager, and most importantly, the humongous fan base of this club is finally happy. Jose Mourinho is a manager who has won it all, yet what he still longs for is a footballing dynasty. Having never lasted at a job for more than three years and criticised for not nurturing young talent, Mourinho is seeking a change in his image as a manager by virtue of a long-term job where he can develop a team according to his style of football. That is reflected in the young players he has invested in – Romelu Lukaku, Victor Lindelof, and Eric Bailly being some examples. Now he has the squad, the support base, and a season of experience at the helm to put in a strong title challenge, and fans should expect no less.

Big title race

With the ever-increasing financial might of the Premier League, the best players in the world are happily joining mid table premier league teams such as West Ham United, Stoke City, and Southampton. This year, the competition will likely be even more intense, and fans all over the world will be licking their lips at a possible 7-way title race involving Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, and Spurs. All of the above teams, barring Spurs, have invested heavily in their squads to fill in gaping holes. Manchester City looked unstoppable in pre-season as they finally solved their defensive problems, while Ronald Koeman has completely revamped Everton’s starting eleven. Similarly, the other title contenders have cut out their weaknesses and last year’s new managers, Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, have now had enough time to get used the Premier League way of things. Meanwhile, last year’s runaway title winners Chelsea have looked unconvincing in pre-season, leaving a vacuum at the top of the table.

Goals Galore

One thing fans can most certainly expect is plenty of goals. There have been a lot of movement on the forwards front amongst Premier League teams, and fans face the prospect of a mouth-watering face-off for the golden boot. Last season, Harry Kane treated us to a spectacular comeback as he scored a flurry of goals towards the end of the season to steal the golden boot from Lukaku. This season, however, Lukaku’s fire power is packed by United’s star studded midfield engine with the likes of Juan Mata and Paul Pogba supplying him. Meanwhile, there will be new world class strikers such as Alexandre Lacazette and Alvaro Morata plying their trade for title contenders Arsenal and Chelsea. Javier Hernandez (Chicharito) will be looking to show Manchester United what they missed out on after two prolific seasons with Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen. While Davy Klaassen would want to follow on the path of Premier League icons Robin Van Persie and Ruud Van Nistelrooy rather than flops Memphis Depay and Vincent Janssen. The sure-shot contenders would be Harry Kane, Sergio Aguero, Morata, Lacazette, and Lukaku; but there are a number of dark horses too such as Chicharito, Jermain Defoe, Marcus Rashford, Alexis Sanchez, Eden Hazard, and Gabriel Jesus. The number of names in the mix represents the tight race for the golden shoe we are about to witness. While it will be difficult to predict who really will take the award home, fans can expect the 30-goal barrier to be broken and maybe even the long-standing record of 31.

Real Madrid see off Manchester United to win European Super Cup,"Real Madrid eased to a 2-1 victory over Manchester United to win the Super Cup. (Source: AP) Real Madrid eased to a 2-1 victory over Manchester United to win the Super Cup. (Source: AP)

Real Madrid beat Manchester United 2-1 to lift the European Super Cup for the fourth time on Tuesday as they became the first team to retain the trophy since AC Milan in 1990.

Brazilian midfielder Casemiro struck the opening goal with a left-foot strike midway through the first half while Spain international Isco consolidated Real’s advantage with a slick piece of skill and finish in the 52nd minute.

United’s 75 million pounds ($97.40 million) striker Romelu Lukaku got his first competitive goal for his new club to reduce the deficit in the 62nd with a simple finish on the rebound after earlier wasting a similar opportunity.

That sparked a brief period of pressure from Jose Mourinho’s side and they could have drawn level when Marcus Rashford burst through but he was denied by a save from Keylor Navas, ensuring Real won their fifth international trophy under Zinedine Zidane.

"Dahi handi: Delay in setting rules, GST could dampen sponsors’ largesse","The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena put up a Dahi Handi on “inflation” in Dadar on Thursday to express its disappointment over rising prices of vegetables and pulses. Vegetables, including tomatoes and potatoes, dangled from the rope supporting the Handi, which was broken by Govindas.

Delay in finalising rules for Dahi Handi festivities could impact the performance of groups participating in human pyramid contests, the mandals have complained. Also, with little time left to co-ordinate with sponsors and participants, the celebrations that are to be organised on August 15 could be somewhat low-key this time.

On Monday, the Bombay High Court refused to pass any order related to age and height restrictions for formation of human pyramids during the Dahi Handi festival. Members of the Dahi Handi Co-ordination Committee claim that the delay has left many mandals without enough time to practise.

“Many mandals actually waited for the decision before commencing practice. A few have started rigorous practise after the order came. The effects of this could be seen on the final day of the festival,” said Kamlesh Bhoir, a member of the Dahi Handi Co-ordination Committee.

The state government is likely to call a meeting this week to discuss if any limit is to be imposed on the number of tiers in the human pyramids.

“There should be no competition between the mandals while forming the tiers. Each mandal must perform as they have practised. Apart from that, we have also asked for safety measures to be implemented by each mandal, including jackets and helmets for the Govindas,” said Bala Padelkar, who is also associated with the committee. The committee has introduced an insurance of Rs 10 lakh for every mandal and an additional Rs 1 lakh for each mandal to cover medical charges.

“The delay in the process also did not leave us with enough time to plan our marketing or sponsorship process. Many sponsors were dissuaded from funding the teams due to the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their companies. The dip in business due to GST further led to sponsors drifting away. This has forced many organisers to put in their own money to fund the requirements of Govindas, including t-shirts and other logistics,” Bhoir added.

Bhoir believes that it may also impact the number of participating mandals.

From an average of 900 mandals in the festival, only 700 are expected participate this time.

Top Donald Trump aides clashing over direction of US foreign policy,"US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP) US President Donald Trump. (Source: AP)

A long-simmering dispute between two top White House aides has boiled into a public battle over the direction of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy. A cadre of conservative groups is pushing for the ouster of Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. Those groups and a website tied to Trump adviser Steve Bannon have targeted McMaster as insufficiently supportive of Israel and insufficiently tough toward Iran.

The dispute reflects the tensions at the heart of Trump’s foreign policy coalition. McMaster is one of several powerful generals in Trump’s orbit who hail from the Republican foreign policy establishment.

But Trump is equally sympathetic to the views of firebrands like Bannon as they try to push the party in a new, isolationist direction embodied by his “America First” doctrine.

Teacher recruitment latest point of contention as Manish Sisodia writes to Lieutenant Governor,"Delhi L-G Anil Baijal and Education Minister Manish Sisodia Delhi L-G Anil Baijal and Education Minister Manish Sisodia

Hinting at another flashpoint between the Delhi government and the Lieutenant Governor, Education Minister Manish Sisodia has written to L-G Anil Baijal asking him to put on hold the recruitment process of teachers advertised by Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB).

Sisodia stated that the advertisement does not mention what weightage will be given to the 17,000 guest teachers, who are working in Delhi government schools, during the recruitment process. The advertisement only mentions the age relaxation for the number of years these teachers have taught in the schools.

Meanwhile, the DSSSB stated in the High Court that recruitment of 14,820 teachers for Directorate of Education (DoE) and MCD schools was advertised on August 7. “The policy of giving age relaxation and weightage to guest teachers was passed by the Cabinet in 2015. However, in May 2016, only the policy of age relaxation was approved by the then L-G Najeeb Jung, decision for weightage was not approved on the basis of the advice of the additional Solicitor General based on Uma Devi judgment. Since then, however, the legal position on this issue has changed,” Sisodia wrote in the letter.

He said that the Supreme Court has clarified and stated that the Uma Devi judgment does not prelude the policy of weightage. Citing the judgment dated August 2016 and November 2016, he said the policy of giving weightage was upheld to contractual employees when permanent vacancies were advertised.

He said multiple instructions to the Chief Secretary and the DoE, asking to put the recruitment process on hold, have not been followed. “It is a source of great surprise to me that such an advertisement has been issued, given the repeated instructions. The only explanation is that after Delhi High Court judgment that stated ‘services come under the L-G’, these officers have not followed any instructions from minister-in-charge on any service-related matters that come within the purview of elected government,” said the letter.

Stating that education comes under the purview of the elected government, Sisodia has asked the process to be put on hold till the DoE formulates a policy for giving weightage to guest teachers. He has also warned that removal of trained and experienced guest teachers will have an adverse impact on government schools and create a situation of chaos and crisis.

Regularisation of guest teachers was one of the promises by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in their manifesto. The guest teachers have, on several occasions, protested against the delay in fulfilment of the promise.

(Mohd Rasfan/Pool Photo via AP)

The US, Australian and Japanese foreign ministers on Monday called for a halt on land reclamation and military actions in the South China Sea and compliance with an arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s vast claims to the disputed waters. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Japan’s new top diplomat, Taro Kono, also called on their Southeast Asian counterparts to rapidly negotiate a legally binding maritime code with China aimed at preventing an escalation of conflicts in one of the world’s busiest waterways.

In a joint statement, the three expressed serious concerns over the long-seething sea disputes and “voiced their strong opposition to coercive unilateral actions that could alter the status quo and increase tensions.”

They urged rival claimant states in the South China Sea “to refrain from land reclamation, construction of outposts, militarization of disputed features, and undertaking unilateral actions that cause permanent physical change to the marine environment in areas pending delimitation.”

The contending states should clarify their claims peacefully in accordance with a 1982 maritime treaty and international law, according to the three, who met on the sidelines of annual meetings of Asia-Pacific foreign ministers in Manila, including those from China and Russia.

Their remarks, which are aimed at taming aggression in the disputed waters, are considerably stronger than a joint statement of concern issued by their counterparts in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation bloc whose economies depend heavily on China. Their stance contrasts with that of China, which opposes what it calls meddling by the United States and other Western governments in the Asian disputes.

Beijing wants the disputes to be resolved through one-on-one negotiations.

China’s territorial disputes in the strategic and potentially oil- and gas-rich waterway with Taiwan and ASEAN member states Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam intensified after Beijing built islands in the disputed waters in recent years and reportedly started to install a missile defense system on them, alarming rival claimant states as well as the US and other Western governments.

Neymar is expected to see another Paris Saint Germain game from the stands as his debut could be further delayed. According to reports, the French football authorities have still not received clearance from Spanish club Barcelona for his world record 222m euro (£200m) move.

NBA preparing to approve “rest rule”,"The specifics of the rules and the consequences remain unknown at this point, however. (Source: AP) The specifics of the rules and the consequences remain unknown at this point, however. (Source: AP)

Fans get upset when a healthy superstar sits out a game for a day of rest, and the NBA apparently plans to do something about it this season.

In September, the NBA owners are expected to approve rules designed to discourage teams from benching healthy players for regular-season games, USA Today reported on Thursday.

The rules will be in effect at the start of the 2017-18 season, and teams will be penalized for not abiding by them.

The specifics of the rules and the consequences remain unknown at this point, however. Enforcing any rules regarding the resting of a healthy player may be difficult to do, starting with the problem of determining whether the player is actually healthy.

Earlier this week, the league office announced scheduling improvements designed to provide more rest for players. Teams will no longer play four games in five nights, and the number of back-to-back games has been reduced. It will require the regular season schedule to start a week earlier.

Commissioner Adam Silver suggested changes might be in store during at April news conference. “There is an expectation among partners that teams are going to act in appropriate ways, (and) find, as I said, that right balance between resting on one hand and obligations to fans and partners on the other,” Silver said in April, according to USA Today.

“There is a recognition from teams that on one hand a certain amount of resting is just inevitable and appropriate to keep the players healthy, but that they shouldn’t be resting multiple starters on the same night.

“And, incidentally, wherever possible, they should rest at home. Because there, while I feel for the home fans, just as much as the away fans, the away fans may only get a chance to see that team once. And of course, the home team home fans can see that team many times.”

More than 40 installations are to light up London in one of the biggest ever light shows, Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Thursday.

Streets, buildings and public spaces will be illuminated during the Lumiere London festival which is expected to attract millions of visitors to the British capital next January.

The event takes place between January 18 and 21 in what Khan says will be a chance for people across the world to see London in a new light.

More than 40 British and international artists will transform London and offer new perspectives on the capital’s iconic architecture, streets and landmarks.

Building on the phenomenal success of Lumiere London 2016, festival destinations will include King’s Cross, London’s West End, including Carnaby, Regent Street, Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, Mayfair, Piccadilly, St James’s, Fitzrovia and Westminster.

Works will be exhibited on both sides of the River Thames, with Covent Garden, Victoria, South Bank and Waterloo added as new destinations for 2018.

Mayor Khan said: “Lumiere London 2018 will be bigger, brighter and bolder than ever before, with even more areas of the city involved and even more people expected to visit this incredible festival.

“Lumiere London 2018 shows that London is open to people from across the world and open to creativity and ideas, and open for business. There’s no better way to banish the January blues — so get ready to take to the streets and marvel at a dazzling array of incredible artwork and installations.”

Lumiere London in 2016 attracted more than 1.3 million visitors to London at a time when the city is usually quiet following the Christmas break.

Australia finds crashed US military aircraft MV-22 Osprey,"A supplied image obtained from the US Defence Force on August 6, 2017 shows search efforts for three US Marines missing after their MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft crashed into the sea off Australia’s northeast coast. (Source: Reuters) A supplied image obtained from the US Defence Force on August 6, 2017 shows search efforts for three US Marines missing after their MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft crashed into the sea off Australia’s northeast coast. (Source: Reuters)

A US military aircraft that crashed off the Australian coast has been found, authorities said today, with divers preparing to try and locate three missing marines. The MV-22 Osprey – a hybrid helicopter-turboprop with a chequered safety record – went down today off Shoalwater Bay in Queensland state.

Twenty-three personnel were quickly saved, but three marines remained missing despite an air and sea search. The Royal Australian Navy survey ship HMAS Melville joined the search overnight and soon found the wreckage. “Shortly after commencing survey operations in the area, the submerged aircraft was located,” Defence Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.

A navy diving team has since headed to the Melville via landing craft and was to conduct “remotely operated underwater vehicle operations” today evening. Yesterday the US Marine Corps said recovery and salvage operations could take months to complete, while the cause of the crash was being investigated.

The MV-22, which is half-helicopter half-turboprop, has two engines positioned on fixed wingtips that allow it to land and take off vertically. It can travel much faster than a helicopter.

The Japan-based aircraft was in the region as part of the Australian-US joint military exercise Talisman Sabre. Following the incident, Japan’s defence minister asked Washington to temporarily stop flying them in his country.

A squadron of Ospreys is based at the Marines’ Futenma base on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. There have been a series of deadly incidents, mostly in the United States, involving the aircraft. In April 2000 19 Marines were killed in an MV-22 crash in the US.

Pehredaar Piya Ki team on petition against the show: It’s unnecessary criticism,"Pehredaar Piya Ki brings to the audience a never-seen-before story of a nine-year-old boy getting married to an 18-year-old girl. Pehredaar Piya Ki brings to the audience a never-seen-before story of a nine-year-old boy getting married to an 18-year-old girl.

Pehredaar Piya Ki is back in news. The show brings to the audience a never-seen-before story of a nine-year-old boy getting married to an 18-year-old girl. The marriage is not for love nor any compromise, but only because the girl has promised the boy’s dying father to be his lifelong pehredaar (protector). The recent episodes that highlighted the suhaag raat and how the young kid enjoys filling his wife’s forehead with sindoor has raised many eyebrows. The cringe-worthy scenes have caused a public outcry and recently a petition has been filed against Pehredaar Kiya Ki demanding a ban on the show. Unmoved by the developments, the team of the show still believes that people should give the show time before judging.

The petition that describes the show as obnoxious and perverted has been filed by a woman named Mansi Jain. Addressed to the I & B Minister Smriti Irani, it states, “Pehredar piya ki. A 10-year-old impressionable little kid(“piyaa”) caressing and stalking a lady who’s more than double his age and filling sindoor in her “maang” is being telecasted at prime time 8:30pm on Sony. (Family time) It is to be devoured by the entire Nation. Imagine the kind of influence it will steadily and perpetually infuse in the viewers mindset. We want a ban on the serial. We do not want our kids to be influenced by such TV serials. Join us in signing the petition to ban this serial (sic).” It has already received 48,465 supporters and is just short of a thousand before it reaches Smriti’s office.

The show has been facing backlash ever since the promo hit the tube. And now with the two embarking on a new journey, things seemed to have gone overboard. The team of Pehredaar Piya Ki though is unmoved by the act as they believe that their show is not what people are assuming it to be.

A source close to the show told indianexpress.com, “It is such a futile attempt by people. The show is nowhere promoting child marriage nor it’s showing anything objectionable. The suhaag raat sequence that people have been bashing had the lead Diya (Tejasswi) actually standing up against the ritual. She also mentioned that the marriage is for a cause and not to enjoy the marital pleasures. When we are giving out such strong messages why do people need to file petitions? It’s an unnecessary criticism and completely unjustified.”

When we reached out to the lead actor Tejasswi Prakash, who plays Diya, she refused to talk about it stating, “I have no clue about the petition and can’t comment on it.”

The young lead Afaan Khan’s dad Jameel also tried to evade our queries stating, “I am in a meeting now. Let me call you soon.”

Suyyash Rai, another actor from Pehredaar Piya Ki, has always been vocal about his support for the show. He told us, “How much time these people have to start such petition. Tell me did we show them having sex that there’s such a hullabaloo over the suhaag raat sequence. And there is no honeymoon sequence. It’s all imagined by these critics to pull our show down. The producers have been in the industry for a long time and do know their job well. It is not just an entertaining show but it is also helping so many people earn their living. People are only targeting us because it’s a different show. I can only say that don’t watch the show if you don’t like it, but don’t put so many people’s hard work down. We are not here to preach but only present a fictitious entertaining story.”

As of now, the production house and the channel are refraining from talking about the developments stating that they don’t want to give it undue importance.

Sumeet Mittal, the producer of the show, in an earlier interview with indianexpress.com had mentioned about the criticism that followed post the promos of the show. “I completely enjoyed and cherished the backlash. This has never happened with us and it was a first-time experience. The audience is yet to know the real concept and storyline and they are bound to judge you,” said Sumeet. He had also assured that the show is not promoting any social evils. “First and foremost, it is a fiction show. It is a story of a girl, who has been given the job to protect this royal prince from the impending threat. To be with him 24X7, she decides to marry her. She is a pehredar (protector) and the bond that they share is a very pure one.”

Apart from the aam janta, popular actor Karan Wahi had also shared his disgust regarding the show through a Facebook post. Telling the makers to not sell stupidity in the name of content he had written, “Dear producer and channel .. i understand we cant make shows like how i met ur mother and friends, and honestly i dont expect us to also ,but for the love of god and for the reason we all got in this industry plz dont sell me stupidity in the name of content whch gives trp because honestly noone is watching this.”

Pehredaar Piya Ki stars Tejasswi Prakash and Afaan Khan as Diya and Ratan. The show airs on Sony Entertainment Television.

English Premier League 2017-18: What to expect from promoted teams this season,"Here’s what is expected from the promoted teams in EPL. Here’s what is expected from the promoted teams in EPL.

Huddersfield Town, who defeated Reading in a penalty shoot-out to get promotion to EPL, will make a return to the big stage after 45 years. As David Wagner will become only the second American manager to take charge of an English club in EPL, the pressure will be on him to do better than former Swansea City manager Bob Bradley, who was literally booed off by home fans.

In 19 months, Wagner has shifted the fortunes of the club, giving faith to the fans in his abilities. He saved Huddersfield from relegation in Championship in 2015-16 and a year later, his side went on to defeat Reading and Sheffield Wednesday in play-offs to book a trip to the big league.

Now for Huddersfield, it is all about survival. The side broke its club transfer record twice this season to sign Australian midfielder Aaron Mooy from Manchester City for reported £8 million and Montpellier’s Steve Mounie for £12m, along with a quality defender in Mathias Jorgensen from FC Copenhagen.

Under Wagner, who earlier worked as an assistant to Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund, the side may offer a surprising touch. But the manager’s future remains in question for offers might be on the way from other potentially bigger clubs. Wagner has signed a contract till 2019 but if the club does not perform well, they might not be able to retain the American. The best result for Huddersfield will be to avoid relegation this season.

Brighton: Joining Huddersfield will be Brighton, who almost saw them losing their football league status after being relegated from fourth-tier in 1996-97 season. Brighton will return to Premier League after 34 years. Even though manager Chris Hughton’s side celebrated a historic rise this year, losing the Championship title to Newcastle United on the last day would have hurt the morale.

For Hughton, who had earlier managed Newcastle United and Norwich City in EPL, challenges at top level may prove tougher. The side’s summer market has looked promising, with the club grabbing headlines for signing PSV midfielder Davy Propper for a club record breaking fee of £10 million.

Other than Propper, the Seagulls have invested in some young talent which includes Chelsea’s Izzy Brown, who will Join Brighton on loan. While the 20-year old winger appears to be a future star, Brighton’s newly bought goalkeeper from Valencia, Mathew Ryan, has all the experience of playing against Spanish giants. But his weak performance against Atletico Madrid in a friendly, in which he dropped a routine save from a Nicolas Gaitan shot, puts a question mark on him.

The side may suffer when attacking with their star striker 33-year old Glen Murray. He scored majority of goals last season but has slowed down with age. Hughton has retained majority of former squad and has not really invested in strikers, which may hurt his campaign.

For Brighton, the name of the game should be survival. The side won most of their games at home last season at Championship, and look to do the same. They may be able to save their position in Premiere League this way, just like Burnley did last season.

Newcastle United: When Newcastle United sacked manager Steve Mclaren in March 2016, the job was handed over to ousted Real Madrid manager Rafael Benitez. The first challenge for the Champions League winning manager was to save his side from relegation. Unfortunately, it was a too-little-too-late for Magpies and their side ended up being relegated.

But after a year-long hiatus, a pumped-up Newcastle, that lifted the Championship Trophy, is keen to perform at the highest level. In Benitez, the fans have found a figure in which they could unite behind, while players have found a manger they could trust. The Spanish manager, in a recent interview, stated he is committed to the club and the fans but also hinted his frustration over the club’s inability to get some of their summer transfer targets.

The fans will hope former Crystal Palace striker Dwight Gayle, who last year scored 23-goals in 32 Champions games for Newcastle, can re-establish himself in the Premier League. He is among the key players for the Magpies along with Aleksander Mitrovic and Ayoze Perez. The club recently signed Chelsea’s loaned midfielder Christian Atsu on a permanent deal, and he will play an important role along with Jonjo Shelvey this season.

The club should look to challenge the established middle order of the table this season, with Benitez at the helm. But lack of promising summer business and challenging oppositions could shatter their hopes. Newcastle should not give out too many points in the first half of the season, and challenge struggling lower order teams such as Swansea, Crystal Palace and even Leicester City. The side needs to regain their confidence and put the middle-order on notice. If one person can do it, it’s Rafa Benitez.

"MHA advises states, UTs against use of plastic flags","Wide publicity for not using plastic flags should be made with advertisements in electronic and print media, said the advisory. (Representational photo) Wide publicity for not using plastic flags should be made with advertisements in electronic and print media, said the advisory. (Representational photo)

Ahead of the Independence Day, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has advised states, Union Territories and central ministries against use of national flags made of plastic. The MHA’s advisory has also reiterated that anyone who burns, mutilates, tramples or disfigures the national flag can face imprisonment of up to three years.

Stating that the national flag represents aspirations of the people of the country and should occupy a position of honour, the MHA advisory has said a perceptible lack of awareness is often noticed among people as well as organisations and agencies of the government in regard to laws, practices and conventions that apply to display of the national flag.

The advisory has said it has been brought to MHA’s notice that during important events, flags made of plastic are being used in place of paper flags and added that plastic flags are not biodegradable and ensuring their disposal commensurate with dignity of the flag is a practical problem.

As per Section 2 of The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, “whoever in any public place or in any other place within public view burns, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise shows disrespect to or brings into contempt (whether by words, either spoken or written, or by acts) the Indian National Flag or any part thereof, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both”.

The advisory said that on important national, cultural and sports events, only paper flags must be used and these must not be left on the ground after the event. Such flags are to be disposed of consistent with dignity of the flag, it said. Wide publicity for not using plastic flags should be made with advertisements in electronic and print media, said the advisory.

"Golmaal Again: Rohit Shetty, Ajay Devgn and Parineeti Chopra among others reach Hyderabad for some ‘Golmaal’","The ensemble cast of Rohit Shetty directorial Golmaal Again including Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Parineeti Chopra, Arshad Warsi, Tusshar Kapoor, Kunal Khemu and Shreyas Talpade reached the 'city of pearls' Hyderabad to shoot for the title track of the film. Just like they did 'Golmaal Golmaal' amidst a big setup and a huge crowd dancing along with them in the last three films of the Golmaal series, this one too has been shot in a humongous setup with thousand dancers supporting the lead cast of the movie. Choreographed by Ganesh Acharya, the song has been crooned by Brijesh Shandilya who created waves by lending his voice to Tanu Weds Manu Returns song Banno.

Known for creating larger than life title tracks for his films, it looks like filmmaker Rohit Shetty would not disappoint with this one too. To make the song a chartbuster, Rohit has done everything from getting ace choreographer Ganesh Acharya on board to making the song colourful with the help of tons of confetti and a carnival setup.

Ajay Devgn who has been a prankster on the sets of Golmaal Again seems to have had great fun while filming the song. We have got our hands on the photos from the shoot location. Though we cannot comment on the audio of the song, going by the pictures, it appears to be a visual treat for sure.

The fun cast of Golmaal Again in one frame is making it difficult for us to wait until Diwali when this crazy gang of people will make movie buffs roll on the floor with laughter.

Bhoomi actor Sanjay Dutt visited the sets of Golmaal Again and his visit has left many wondering if the Munnabhai MBBS actor has a special appearance in the comedy film.

The other star who raised eyebrows with his surprise visit on the sets of Rohit Shetty's film was Bollywood's live wire Ranveer Singh. He stayed with the cast of the film for some time and discussed his favourite genre comedy with them."
US sending dozens more marines to Afghanistan: Report,"US soldiers Kandahar province, southern Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters) US soldiers Kandahar province, southern Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters)

The US is sending dozens more Marines to Afghanistan to beef up internal security in the war-torn country’s Helmand province, according to a media report. The US Central Command has agreed to send an additional marines of less than 100, who would join the existing more than 300 marines assigned to Task Force Southwest, the NBC news reported. The officials said this deployment is not tied to the Trump administration’s long-awaited new South Asia strategy, but instead fulfills a request from the commander on the ground, Marine Brig Gen Roger Turner. It was approved by Gen Joseph Votel at Central Command.

The report, which was based on unnamed sources, was not confirmed by the Pentagon. “The repositioning and movement of forces in the CENTCOM (area of responsibility), to include presently deployed Marines, happen at the discretion of the CENTCOM Commander,” a spokesperson for Marine Corps Forces Central Command said. “At this time there are no plans to deploy CONUS based Marines into Afghanistan,” the spokesman said using the acronym for Continental United States.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on human rights: ‘Don’t go there’,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte met Monday with America’s top diplomat, where he voiced solidarity with the U.S. amid global concerns over North Korea’s nuclear program and angrily dismissed media questions about human rights abuses by his government. Duterte and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met in Manila at a regional Asia gathering. It was the highest-level interaction to date between a member of President Donald Trump’s administration and Duterte, accused by human rights groups of flagrant abuses in his bloody war against illegal drugs.

If the two leaders discussed those or other U.S. concerns about Duterte’s government, they didn’t do so in public. Instead, the two focused on the alliance between the two countries and on the North Korea issue as reporters were allowed in briefly for the start of their meeting. Entering an ornate, wood-paneled hall in the Philippine leader’s palace, Tillerson was introduced to members of Duterte’s Cabinet, shaking hands with each. Duterte welcomed the American and said he said he knew the U.S. was concerned about Pyongyang’s missile program.

“You come at a time when I think the world is not so good, especially in the Korean Peninsula,” Duterte said. Earlier, as they shook hands, the two ignored a shouted question about whether they’d discuss human rights. And at a news conference after their meeting, Duterte bristled but didn’t answer directly when asked whether human rights had come up. “Human rights, son of a bitch,” Duterte said, arguing he shouldn’t be questioned about alleged violations given the challenges he’s facing. “Policemen and soldiers have died on me. The war now in Marawi, what caused it but drugs? So human rights, don’t go there.”

But ahead of the meeting, Duterte’s presidential spokesman, Ernesto Abella, said the topic would indeed come up, along with other pressing matters such as global terrorism threats, economic cooperation and security in Marawi, the city that has been under siege by pro-Islamic State group militants for more than two months. “We also welcome the opportunity to address concerns such as human rights if and when raised,” Abella said in a statement. “We have always included this issue in our discussions and engagements with foreign governments, particularly Western democracies.”

The U.S., too, said ahead of the meeting that human rights would be among the topics on the agenda. Human rights groups have questioned the Trump administration’s willingness to engage with Duterte. But Tillerson argued there’s no contradiction presented by the U.S. decision to help his country fight the militants, whose insurgency in the Philippines has stoked global fears about the Islamic State group exporting violence into Southeast Asia and beyond.

Nearly 700 people have died in the intense fighting, including 528 militants and 122 soldiers and policemen, since hundreds of black flag waving gunmen stormed into buildings and homes in the business district and outlying communities of mosque-studded Marawi, a center of Islamic faith in the southern third of the predominantly Roman Catholic nation. “I see no conflict — no conflict at all in our helping them with that situation and our views of the human rights concerns we have with respect to how they carry out their counter narcotics activities,” Tillerson told reporters before the meeting. He added that it appeared the Philippines was “beginning to get that situation under control.”

To that end, Tillerson said the U.S. has been providing the Philippines with surveillance capabilities, training, information and aircraft to help it fight the militants. He said the equipment includes a few Cessna aircraft and a few drones. “The real challenge is going to come with once they have the fighting brought to an end how to deal with the conditions on the ground to ensure it does not re-emerge.”

"FIFA U-17 World Cup tickets sales have slowed down in Guwahati, says Javier Ceppi","Ceppi said teams like Chile were capable of beating their senior clubs. (Source: File) Ceppi said teams like Chile were capable of beating their senior clubs. (Source: File)

With the FIFA U-17 World Cup slated to begin on October 6, and India’s very first FIFA event at home, tournament director Javier Ceppi confirmed that there has been an unexpected decline in the third phase of ticket sales in Guwahati. Ceppi also added that the ticket sales in Guwahati is currently lagging behind Kolkata and Kochi. “Ticket sales in Guwahati were extremely strong in Phase I and Phase II but have unexpectedly declined currently,” Ceppi said.

France, Japan, Honduras and New Caledonia will be playing their Group E matches in Guwahati while a Group F match between Mexico and Chile is also scheduled to be played at the Indira Gandhi Athletics Stadium, which has a capacity of 23,850.

“It may seem to people that not too attractive teams are here, but let me tell you France has Amine Gouiri who was the top scorer of UEFA U-17 Championship with eight goals, he already plays in Olympique Lyonnais (Lyon) for their senior team.”

“Takefusa Kubo plays for Japan — he was the star of Barcelona youth system and is the youngest scorer in the J- League. We saw him last year in the AFC U-16 Championships, and he is an absolute phenomenon. He is bound to be the best Asian player ever. Such is the quality of the players coming in Guwahati for the games,” Ceppi added.

Chile club presidents believe that their U-17 squad is capable of beating their senior clubs in the country.

“I have spoken to the club presidents of Chile football clubs, who have produced the likes of Arturo Vidal, Alexis Sanchez, Claudio Bravo, Gary Medel and they were confident that their U-17 team is capable of beating the senior clubs in Chile. Mexico, as we all know, has an excellent reputation in the tournament and are a force to be reckoned with,” said Ceppi.

With the playoffs (pre-quarters, quarters and a semifinals) scheduled to be played in Guwahati, the tournament organisers are not worried about filling the stadium.

“Football is a religion in Guwahati and other parts of the North-East India, and hence, we are not very worried about filling the stadium. The internet penetration in the city is good and we don’t see the online sale of tickets as a concern; however, fans just need a reminder for the best live football they are about to witness,” said Ceppi.

New Zealand’s contracted players likely to remain unavailable for World XI series in Pakistan: NZC,"New Zealand’s 21 centrally contracted players will not be able to play because they have ‘international commitments’ to adhere to. (Source: Reuters) New Zealand’s 21 centrally contracted players will not be able to play because they have ‘international commitments’ to adhere to. (Source: Reuters)

As efforts to bring international cricket back to Pakistan take significant steps there is a major setback with reports of New Zealand cricket stating that none of the contracted will feature in the proposed upcoming World XI side touring Pakistan for a three match T20 series. It is scheduled to be held in September.

New Zealand Cricket’s chief executive David White has stated that New Zealand’s 21 centrally contracted players will not be able to play because they have ‘international commitments’ to adhere to.

“For the contracted players it’s highly likely they will be unavailable [for Pakistan] due to other international commitments, that I can’t say any more about at this stage,” White said.

“It’s reality. We can’t announce it yet but there’s a fairly strong possibility we’ll have international commitments over that period that would preclude the players participating.”

This effectively means that non-contracted players such as Luke Ronchi and Brendon McCullum can participate.

“For the non-contracted players there’s ongoing security advice from the ICC, and I know the Players’ Association has sought independent security advice as well,” White said. “They’ll be guided by that advice and make a decision and they would have to assume the risk of going [to Pakistan].”

Heath Mills, New Zealand Players’ Association’s chief, added that the risk assessment report is still being worked out. “I know that they (organisers) plan to speak to some New Zealand players and (Ronchi) was one of them,” Mills said. “We’ve advised them all that FICA are currently working through getting a risk assessment completed and we’ll be sending it out to to the guys so they can make up their minds if they decide they want to go, as to whether the risk is worth it.”

"Deported from Saudi, ‘AQIS suspect’ Syed Mohammad Zishan Ali in custody","Al-Qaeda terrorist Syed Mohammad Zishan Ali has been arrested at the IGI airport in Delhi at the PHQ police on Thursday. Express Photo By Amit Mehra 10 August 2017 Al-Qaeda terrorist Syed Mohammad Zishan Ali has been arrested at the IGI airport in Delhi at the PHQ police on Thursday. Express Photo By Amit Mehra 10 August 2017

An Al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) suspect, who was arrested by Delhi Police on Wednesday after being deported from Saudi Arabia for visa violations, was remanded in 14-day police custody on Thursday. The police told Additional Sessions Judge Siddhartha Sharma that the suspect, Syed Zishan Ali, was an active member of the AQIS. They said that Ali needed to be interrogated to ascertain the location of his brother Syed Mohammad Arshiyan and brother-in-law Sabeel Ahmed, who is the brother of alleged Glasgow airport attack mastermind Kafil Ahmed. The Delhi Police Special Cell sought Ali’s custody “to identify the logistics/finance aid to his terrorist outfit from India and abroad and confront the evidences collected so far”.

The Special Cell had claimed to have busted the AQIS module with the arrests of five persons in 2015. They reportedly disclosed the involvement of 12 others, including Ali. A total of 17 people were chargesheeted under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, but only six persons including Ali have been arrested so far. According to the Special Cell, the accused were planning an “untoward terrorist incident” in Delhi and NCR. Sources said Ali was allegedly in charge of recruitment of youths from India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries.

The police said that Ali’s name came up after the arrest of Mohammad Asif on December 14, 2015. Asif is allegedly a founding member of AQIS and in charge of the recruitment, motivation and training wing. His interrogation helped identify several members of the terror outfit and led to four more arrests, including that of Abdur Rehman, who the police chargesheet claims “delivered jihadi speeches” in Jamshedpur and visited Pakistan and met Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.

Ali’s brother Arshiyan is also alleged to have links with international terror outfits. He was last spotted in Saudi Arabia. The AQIS module case is listed for prosecution arguments on September 4.

The 16-year-old girl atop the three-layer human pyramid appears a bit nervous as she takes the coconut, but soon, with all her might, she breaks the Handi. Joy erupts from the girls who formed the pyramid and music and dance ensues. The human pyramid was made up of visually impaired girls.

This is the first time that the girls at the National Association for the Blind (NAB) hostel in Andheri (W) aged 16 to 20 are participating in the Dahi Handi, days before the city celebrates Janmashtami. The girls come from various places across the state, and some live in the NAB hostel where the event took place.

Jyotsna Garde, superintendent of the NAB girls’ hostel said, “The girls expressed their interest in participating in Dahi Handi after which we decided to host the event for them. We will continue this celebration every year.”

Their trainer, 30-year-old Ponnalagar Devendra, trains these girls at a ground in Matunga. Visually impaired himself, he says he trained very hard to become a professional and had been performing during the festival at Nav Maharashtra Mitra Mandal in Sion.

He said, “I was always passionate about the festival. After talking to my friends, I decided to start training other visually impaired boys, and we participated in 100 competitions with no one getting injured.” He says, “I decided to train these girls as well, to prove that gender or disability does not reduce our goals.”

Heena, 16, who studies at Ruia College, says that she decided to train because she loved the festival and was happy to train in a place close to her college. When asked if she would do it again next year, she said, “Of course, there is no doubt about that.”

Swapna Barman says completed event despite developing back pain,"Swapna Barman won the heptathlon gold in Asian Championships but finished 26th at World Championships. (Source: Reuters) Swapna Barman won the heptathlon gold in Asian Championships but finished 26th at World Championships. (Source: Reuters)

Indian athlete Swapna Barman, who finished 26th in women’s heptathlon at the World Championships, has claimed that she was on the verge of pulling out of the competition owing to a recurring back pain. Barman said that the back pain, which she first had in late 2014 after taking part in the Incheon Asian Games, returned to trouble her after she ran the first event – 100m hurdles – on Saturday.

She, however, continued with the remaining six events to finish 26th — just a place above the bottom — with a total of 5431 points.

The seven heptathlon events were spread over two days and ended on Sunday.

“I had this back pain after the 2014 Asian Games and the whole of 2015 and 2016, I could not do much training and competition. I began proper training in February 2017 only and then I won the Asian Championships in Bhubaneswar to qualify for the World Championships,” Barman told PTI.

“The back pain returned and after running the 100m hurdles here (on Saturday), I was feeling real pain. I called up my coach at home and told him I want to pull out of competitions.

“He told me to continue somehow. He said it will be a waste of an opportunity if I pulled out and people will not talk about me very kindly. He said if I can continue somehow I should do that. So I continued and completed the remaining six events,” said the 20-year-old from West Bengal.

Barman won the heptathlon gold in the Asian Championships last month with an aggregate of 5942 points, but in the World Championships, nothing went right for her as her performance in all the seven events dipped.

Her best event was the high jump and in Bhubaneswar, she did even better than the individual gold winner. She cleared an height of 1.86m in Bhubaneswar while the individual gold winner (Nadiya Dusanova of Uzbekistan) could only clear 1.84m.

“Yeah, high jump is my strongest event. I did 1.86m in Bhubanswar but here I could not lift myself due to the back pain and could clear only 1.71m. That is a huge 15cm difference and I lost nearly 200 points in high jump,” she said.

“Had I competed without this back pain I would have done my personal best and could have touched nearly 6000 aggregate points and I would have been really happy,” she added.

In shot put, Barman cleared a distance of 10,81m, ran 200m race in 26.45 secs, did a 5.53m in long jump, threw the javelin to a distance of 43.49m and then clocked 2 minute 20.17 seconds in 800m race. Each of her results in seven events was worse than her performance in the Asian Athletics.

Asked if she had back pain during the Asian Championships, Barman said, “I sometimes felt slight pain but I did not give much thought to it as it (pain) was bothering me and I was competing in home conditions.”

Barman, who has a peculiar six toes in each of her foot, said that her realistic target now would be to win a gold in the 2018 Asian Games.

“I will consult a doctor after returning home. I think I need a long rest. I am not taking part in the National Open Championships (in September). I hope to take part in the 2018 Commonwealth Games but my target will be to win a gold in the 2018 Asian Games,” she said.

Barman’s selection in the Indian squad was also a matter of debate as 5942 was not that big a score when it came to the level of World Championships. The athlete who aggregated 6001 in the World Championships, took the 21st place.

But Barman cleared the air about her participation in the National Inter-State Championships in Guntur last month, which the AFI had made it mandatory for selection in the World Championships.

“Yes, I took part in Guntur. The federation officials said I will have to take pert in at least two events (out of seven). I took part in long jump and 100m hurdles and I did reasonably well in the two events.”

North Korea has produced nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles: report,"North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un

North Korea has produced a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, a major development sure to further inflame tensions.

The Post cited parts of an analysis conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency that says the intelligence community thinks North Korea has “nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery” — including in intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The Post said the assessment’s broad conclusions were verified by two US officials familiar with the analysis. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not known if North Korea has successfully tested the smaller warhead design, the Post said, though North Korea last year claimed to have done so.

The progress means North Korea is further along the path to having a deployable nuclear missile than has previously been acknowledged. The Post also reported that another intelligence assessment estimated that North Korea now has up to 60 nuclear weapons, more than previously thought.

North Korea has alarmed the international community by the pace and progress of its missile development program, and in July leader Kim Jong-Un conducted two tests of an ICBM — the first time he had demonstrated ICBM capability.

The first of these trials, which Kim described as a gift to “American bastards,” showed the rocket had the potential range to hit Alaska. The second rocket test last week flew even longer, with some experts even suggesting that New York could be in range. North Korea vowed yesterday that tough new UN sanctions would not stop it from developing its nuclear arsenal, rejecting talks and angrily threatening retaliation against the United States.

Over 200 children killed in Yemen war in 2017: UNICEF,"UNICEF put the death toll of children from the war at 1,546, and other 2,450 injured (Reuters Photo) UNICEF put the death toll of children from the war at 1,546, and other 2,450 injured (Reuters Photo)

A top United Nations official in Yemen said on Monday that a total of 201 children have been killed in the Yemeni ongoing civil war since the beginning of 2017. “In 2017, 201 children have been killed in Yemen: 152 boys and 49 girls,” UNICEF resident representative in Yemen Meritxell Relano said in her twitter account on Monday, Xinhua reported.

Relano’s remarks came three days after an airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition hit a family’s home in Mahdha area in the Yemeni northern province of Saada, killing six children and three women. Commenting on Friday’s airstrike, Relano condemned the attack but did not accuse any party behind it.

Relano also said that “377 boys have been recruited and used in the conflict since the start of 2017. We know there are many more…unfortunately.” Relano did not provide further details about which cities the children were recruited from nor parties behind the recruitment.

According to UN agencies, more than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed during more than two years of war in Yemen that also displaced over 3 million. In March 2017, UNICEF put the death toll of children from the war at 1,546, and other 2,450 injured. The country has also been hit by a deadly cholera outbreak and is on the edge of famine.

The war started in March 2015, after Saudi-led coalition intervened in the Yemeni conflict by launching a large-scale air campaign to back internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who invaded the capital Sanaa militarily and seized most of the northern Yemeni provinces.

PGA Tour not interested in taking a long break from golf,"Picture for representational purposes. (Source: Reuters) Picture for representational purposes. (Source: Reuters)

Even as the PGA Tour aims to end its FedEx Cup around Labor Day, that doesn’t mean the end of golf for the year.

Golf is the one sport where the length of the offseason is determined by the players, who can take off as much time as they want. Dustin Johnson played two times over three months at the end of last year and plans to do the same. Phil Mickelson once took four months off after the FedEx Cup ended.

PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan is still working on the schedule for 2018-19 now that The Players Championship is going back to March and the PGA Championship is moving to May. But he made it clear that golf isn’t about to take a hiatus.

“If there’s a hard stop, I can see where that’s a benefit,” Monahan said. “We’re also not the only tour out there. And if you create openings in your schedule, those openings will be filled, and players will have opportunities elsewhere. Our job is to maximize playing and financial opportunities and create the platform for the players. That’s what has gotten us here.”

Jimmy Walker is among those who would love a big break, and he most likely will take one at this end of this year.

“I think an offseason does sound nice,” Walker said. “A couple months off would be great where you could just go home and relax and let your body heal and be with your kids and your family. … But anymore, it’s just run-and-gun all the time.”

Rory McIlroy said a break from golf would help build anticipation, much like the NFL. Fat chance of that happening. After winning the FedEx Cup last year, he played twice more in China and Dubai as a European Tour member.

This is not a surprise to Monahan, who said he has heard from a few players about a long break. This is nothing new. Monahan was quick to point out that top players compete in about 26 tournaments out of 52 weeks.

He also said players don’t want to fall too far behind in the FedEx Cup by sitting out the fall. Or they can take time off, like Jordan Spieth. A year ago, he took two months off after the Ryder Cup, won the Australian Open on a working vacation, played in the Bahamas and had another month off.

PGA GIFT: All the past PGA champions at Quail Hollow might have stars in their eyes.

While it doesn’t get as much attention as the Champions Dinner at the Masters, the reigning PGA champion also hosts past winners for a Tuesday night dinner. The difference is that wives are invited, and while the host _ Jimmy Walker _ is in charge of the menu, he also presents the past champions a gift.

Walker, whose hobby is astrophotography, gave each winner a telescope that allows images to be loaded onto their phones. He showed an example of one he took the other day of the moon.

As for the menu?

“We’re doing a really good meat-and-cheese and olive plate, and then lump crab and shrimp cocktail, and then a really nice steak,” Walker said. “Real steakhouse theme. French fries. Really good, spicy mac-and-cheese, Caesar salad, and I think there’s another salad if you don’t want that.”

LAND BUY: Augusta National now appears to at least have the property to expand the par-5 13th hole.

Augusta radio host Austin Rhodes shared a letter he obtained from the president of Augusta Country Club informing members that its board has approved a “purchase of property at our northwest boundary.” That would be the eighth and ninth holes of Augusta Country Club, which runs along the back of the 12th green and 13th tee box at adjacent Augusta National.

That gives the home of the Masters plenty of room to expand the tee on the 13th hole, which was last expanded 25 yards (to 510 yards) in 2002. Players now can take it over the trees down the left. Bubba Watson hit a big fade when he won in 2014 and had sand wedge into the par 5.

Golfweek magazine first reported negotiations over the land purchase leading into the 2016 Masters, and club chairman Billy Payne conceded that the 13th was one hole under consideration for change.

“We think there are multiple options where we could increase the difficulty of the hole and restore the shot values, only one of which deals with extending the length,” Payne said last year.

Meanwhile, the letter said Augusta Country Club would have new holes built to replace Nos. 8 and 9 at no cost.

RARE COMPANY: Rory McIlroy can join an elite list with a victory at Quail Hollow in the PGA Championship.

Only four players have won a major and a PGA Tour event on the same course. That starts with Tiger Woods, who did it on two different courses. Both majors were also in the same year as the tour event he won _ Pebble Beach in 2000 (AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and U.S. Open) and Torrey Pines (Buick Invitational and U.S. Open).

Ben Hogan also won the Los Angeles Open and the U.S. Open in the same year (1948) at Riviera.

Jack Nicklaus won the 1975 PGA Championship at Firestone, and he won the World Series of Golf at Firestone a year later. Walter Hagen won the 1925 PGA Championship at Olympia Fields, and then he won the Western Open at Olympia Fields two years later.

McIlroy won in 2010 and 2015 at Quail Hollow, which did not host a PGA Tour event this year.

BROTHERLY LOVE: Dustin Johnson put his younger brother, Austin, on the bag when they were in Australia in 2013 and they’ve been together for eight victories, including a sweep of the World Golf Championships and the U.S. Open.

The value is in the relationship, though Johnson said after four years, little brother has learned the trade.

“He’s my best friend,” he said. “Having my brother there, we spend a lot of time with our caddie, so it’s someone you enjoy being around.”

Johnson still does the heavy lifting, even though he’ll ask Austin to read greens on occasion. But he kept it all in perspective.

“The days that I’m having to rely on him, it’s not a good day and things aren’t going right,” he said. “But I do have him there if I need him, which is good to know.”

DIVOTS: Jason Kokrak won the Long Drive Competition at the PGA Championship with a drive of 321 yards. Tyrrell Hatton (316 yards) was next, followed by Dustin Johnson (315 yards). … This is the third time the PGA Championship has been held in North Carolina. Lee Trevino won at Tanglewood in 1974, while Denny Shute won at Pinehurst in 1936 when the PGA was played in November. … Bernhard Langer turned down his spot in the field as the Senior PGA champion because of his schedule. He went from the Senior British Open to the 3M Championship in Minnesota, and after this week he has the Dick’s Sporting Goods Open followed by his title defense in the Boeing Classic. … David Toms, the 2001 champion, also chose not to play because of a scheduling conflict.

STAT OF THE WEEK: Jason Day has shot in the 60s his last eight rounds, and 12 out of the last 13 rounds, at the PGA Championship.

FINAL WORD: “He’s got that knack. I call it resilience. I don’t know if there’s a better word to describe what it is that he has. But he has got this resilience where he gets himself in positions in tournaments where you don’t think he can come back from, and he does.” _ Rory McIlroy on Jordan Spieth.

"Mumbai redevelopment project: Tenants left in the lurch, High Court intervenes","Mhada had issued a commencement certificate for a ground-plus-10-storey building in 2010. (File photo) Mhada had issued a commencement certificate for a ground-plus-10-storey building in 2010. (File photo)

The Bombay High Court on Thursday asked the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) how it expected tenants of a redevelopment project to survive without basic facilities, with the developer having stopped payment of rent to them for over two years now. A division bench headed by Justice Anoop Mohta was hearing a matter filed by one Sameer Patil, tenant of the building Samarth Krupa, seeking directions to the builder to pay him rent arrears of over Rs 8.24 lakh.

The developer who had taken up redevelopment of a building in Dadar had stopped paying rent to the residents of the building for their transit accommodation. Around 73 tenants, including 16 shop owners of the building, had agreed to the redevelopment.

Mhada had issued a commencement certificate for a ground-plus-10-storey building in 2010.

The court asked Mhada if it could acquire a building in such a case and was informed that if 70 per cent of the tenants came forward they would do so. “In fact, we have already written to the state government to acquire this building,” said the counsel appearing for Mhada.

The petitioner’s lawyer,however, contested this stating that 80 per cent of the tenants had already given the required undertaking to Mhada. “The petitioners are stating that the developer is not making payments or providing them with facilities. What steps is Mhada taking in this matter?” asked the court.

It has asked the authority to file an affidavit before the next date of hearing on August 22.

The court has also issued notice on why a bailable warrant should not be issued against the developer in the matter.

US links Mexico football captain Marquez to drug cartel,"Mexican football star Rafael Marquez Alvarez, center, arrives to give a press conference to deny accusations of ties to drug trafficking, at Atlas Football Club in Guadalajara, Mexico, Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2017. (AP Photo) Mexican football star Rafael Marquez Alvarez, center, arrives to give a press conference to deny accusations of ties to drug trafficking, at Atlas Football Club in Guadalajara, Mexico, Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2017. (AP Photo)

The US Treasury has accused Rafael Marquez, captain of Mexico’s national football team and a former FC Barcelona player, of being a “front person” for a major drug trafficking organization. Marquez, who has captained his team a record four times in the World Cup, was one of 22 people and 43 entities the US Treasury placed on a sanctions list in relation to a Guadalajara-based drug trafficking group controlled by businessman Raul Flores Hernandez.

The Treasury yesterday said Marquez has a “longstanding relationship” with Flores, has acted as a “front person” for him and held assets on his drug cartel’s behalf.

It said Flores, who was indicted in Washington, DC and California in March on charges of cocaine trafficking, flew under the radar for years by operating in strategic alliances with the heads of the more notorious Sinaloa cartel and another, the Jalisco New Generation cartel.

“Raul Flores Hernandez has operated for decades because of his longstanding relationships with other drug cartels and his use of financial front persons to mask his investments of illegal drug proceeds,” said John Smith, head of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control which implements sanctions.

Also named on the blacklist yesterday under Washington’s “Kingpin Act” were Flores and members of his family, business associates, and Latin Grammy-nominated singer Julion Alvarez.

The sanctions freeze any assets, such as bank accounts and property, that a blacklisted person holds in a US jurisdiction, and bans any US individuals or companies from doing business with them.

Mexican authorities meanwhile took actions yesterday to seize assets linked to the group inside the country. US authorities said Flores controls a casino, restaurants, bars, a shipping company and a music production company, mostly based in Jalisco state.

The US announcement rocked the Mexican football world where Marquez, popularly known as Rafa, is a legend at 38 after making his debut for the national team in February 1997 and then leading the team in the last four World Cups.

He was a young star for the Atlas club before moving to AC Monaco in 1999. Four years later he signed with FC Barcelona, becoming the first Mexican player to win a Champions League final with the team’s victory over Arsenal in 2006. The defender spent another four injury-marred years with the team before being released in 2010.

After that he spent two years with the Red Bulls of US Major League Soccer, and then joined Mexico’s Club Leon, and most recently played for Atlas again.

Still potent, he scored the winning goal at the 89th minute in a 2-1 World Cup qualifier victory over the United States last November.

Mexico’s football federation had no comment on the US accusations. But the Mexican Justice Ministry said late Wednesday that Marquez had voluntarily reported to the authorities.

The US statement gave no details on his alleged actions on behalf of Flores. But also blacklisted were Mauricio Heredia Horner, the chief executive of Marquez’s charity foundation, according to its Facebook page. In addition, a mariachi singer, Marco Fregoso, was also on the sanctions list as someone who had acted on behalf of Marquez for the Flores organization. Singer Alvarez, a star of the popular norteoo style of music, said in a televised statement that there was nothing to the reports.

“Nothing has happened. I just have to check where the accusations have come from. I dedicate myself to music. Thank God I don’t have to do the kind of thing they have accused me of,” he said. He added that he was “great friends” with Marquez. “Would you believe that he needs to do such things?” he said.

Venezuelans watch the military for signs of fraying loyalty,"An anti-government demonstrator wearing a Russian military hat and his face covered with a Venezuelan flag protests the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, Sunday, Aug. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Wil Riera) An anti-government demonstrator wearing a Russian military hat and his face covered with a Venezuelan flag protests the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, Sunday, Aug. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Wil Riera)

As Venezuela’s political crisis spins further out of control, many are looking to the military to see if it’s once-unflinching loyalty to the socialist revolution might be fraying. On Sunday morning, Venezuelans awoke to news that a small group of armed men tried to take over a major military base in the central city of Valencia after a long-mutinous national guard captain appeared in a video calling for rebellion.

The government said what it described as a “terrorist attack” led mostly by civilians dressed in fatigues and deserted officers, not active troops, was quickly put down and seven people were arrested. It wasn’t clear how much support existed for the so-called “Operation David,” but dozens of civilians startled by the sound of gunfire poured into the streets singing Venezuela’s national anthem to back the rebels.

Many people wonder whether the tension-filled incident could foreshadow a bigger uprising to come from a military with a long history of rebellion and whose troops — like many Venezuelans — are increasingly caught up in the nation’s economic and political crisis. Analysts say that such a scenario is unlikely for now.

While signs of disgruntlement are growing as security forces come under a barrage of rocks and Molotov cocktails during almost-daily anti-Maduro protests, soldiers also fear persecution under an opposition government. In addition, they face risks that any plans for a secret uprising would be found out.

“They feel trapped,” said former army Gen. Hebert Garcia Plaza, a former Maduro minister. Since seeking exile in Washington in 2015 following accusations of corruption by Maduro, he has emerged as a sought-after filter of information for journalists, the opposition and, increasingly he says, distraught soldiers. “There’s lots of unease, but they can’t provoke a political change without a clear horizon of what comes after Maduro,” Garcia Plaza said.

Venezuela’s military accumulated unmatched power and privilege in the past two decades of socialist rule, and Maduro has been increasingly relying on the armed forces as his own grip on power weakens. Last week, with the support of top generals, he plowed forward with a plan to seat an all-powerful assembly mandated with rewriting the constitution. Political opponents and dozens of foreign governments consider it an illegitimate power grab that will strip Venezuela of its last vestiges of democracy.

The opposition is urging the military to switch loyalties and pressure Maduro to cede to its demands, including freeing hundreds of political prisoners and setting a timetable for presidential elections. But many in the military, especially higher-ranking officers, have already hitched their fate to the revolution.

Following a 2002 coup, then-President Hugo Chavez, himself a former tank commander, carried out a deep purge of the military and promoted loyal officers to top positions in the government.

Maduro has expanded the military’s political power even further, giving them control of key sectors of the economy, such as food importation. He also rewarded soldiers with pay raises and bonuses that are the envy of civilians struggling amid triple-digit inflation and widespread shortages.

Even before the ballots were counted in the July 30 election for the constitutional assembly, Defense Minister Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez went in front of the cameras accompanied by the top military brass to celebrate the results as a defeat for imperialism.

Despite the outward loyalty, some cracks began to appear even before Sunday’s attack. At least 106 members of the armed forces, some of them junior officers, have been jailed for alleged crimes such as rebellion and treason since protests began in April, according to the lists provided by an army official on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. There also have been a few high-profile defections from lower-ranked soldiers that have become social media sensations.

One is Giomar Flores, a low-ranking naval intelligence officer who in June released a video calling for the armed forces to uphold the constitution. Before fleeing to Colombia, where the video was recorded, he was assigned to policing food lines in Falcon state, a job that in theory afforded access to hard-to-find staples but which ended up turning him against the institution he loved. “I decided my future was worth more than a bag of food,” the 25-year-old Flores said in an interview with The Associated Press from Bogota.

He said the top military command was corrupted by the government and divisions within the institution more apparent than ever. “The armed forces today are like a snake, whose head is the top command that sadly is subordinated to the regime,” Flores said. “If you cut off the head, you’ll find us the troops.”

But a full-grown rebellion such as the one led by then-Lt. Col. Chavez in 1992 faces enormous obstacles, not the least of which is a dedicated counterespionage effort by Maduro. “It’s very hard to create critical mass without being found out,” said Ivan Briscoe, head Latin American analyst for the International Crisis Group. “In an era of instant digital communications, authorities can be alerted to the risk of destabilization very quickly.”

Far from resolving Venezuela’s problems, a coup would trigger a full-blown international crisis and likely split the military, leading to even higher levels of violence approaching a civil war, Briscoe said. Opposition leaders, wary of awakening ghosts in a region that has turned its back on a century of military takeovers, are instead calling for behind-the-scenes pressure and restraint on using force against protesters.

A failure of the socialist system also could expose many senior officers to prosecution for human rights abuses and corruption. Several have already been targeted by US sanctions, including the head of the army and national guard.

The opposition has gone to great lengths to say it will avoid a witch hunt if it gains power. But many in the military are unconvinced that any promises from the traditionally fragmented opposition can be taken seriously, given the huge challenges it would face governing, Garcia Plaza said. “Many would rather trust the devil they know then the one they don’t,” he said.

Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 5 stills: Will Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen unite against the Night King?,"HBO has unveiled stills from the fifth episode of season 7 that show some breathtaking scenes of Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow reuniting in Dragonstone to glimpses of Cersei brooding over her loss. The next episode titled Eastwatch is one of the most-anticipated ones, especially after the last episode ended on a cliff-hanger with Jaime's fate yet to be decided. The fourth episode The Spoils of War was also one of the most-watched episodes in the history of the series and with the Mother of Dragons' victory against the Lannisters army, it was definitely worth the wait. Let's have a look on what the next one has in store for us. (Source: Photo by HBO)

Daenerys Targaryen is back at Dragonstone and it looks like she is engaged in an intense conversation with King of the North Jon Snow. They are probably discussing how Daenerys will only fight by his side if he bends the knee. (Source: Photo by HBO)

The last episode saw Tyrion rooting for Daenerys from the sidelines while Drogon destroyed the army bearing his family name. Here we have a still of him rummaging through the battlefield and he doesn't seem happy at all. (Source: Photo by HBO)

With no signs of Jaime and Bronn in the pictures, here we have Daenerys and Tyrion sharing an intense look at something. They will also need to deal with the Lannister prisoners, the actual Spoils of War. We have already seen Daenerys announce in the preview that whoever does not bend the knee will die in Dragonstone, guess we will have to wait to see what happens. (Source: Photo by HBO)

In the preview, Varys asks Tyrion, ""We need to find a way to make her listen."" Wondering what they could be referring to here? Our guess is Daenerys is still bent on making Jon bend the knee and Tyrion and Varys realising the imminent danger from the White Walkers army, support Jon's claim. (Source: Photo by HBO)

Cersei aka Lena Headey is brooding with a glass of wine in her bedroom. She has most likely gotten the bad news about her destroyed army and brother-lover Jaime, whose fate is still undecided. But one good thing is that most of the gold from the war has been shipped to King's Landing and can be returned to the Iron Bank. (Source: Photo by HBO)

Samwell Tarly and Gilly are back on the scene going through some more papers. In a way, Sam was the one who made the historic meeting between Danny and Jon happen, with his revelation that dragonglass is buried under a mountain in Dragonstone. (Source: Photo by HBO)"
Esha Gupta is the queen of sass: 10 edgy looks of the Baadshaho actor that we love,"Esha Gupta is one beauty who has always managed to give us style inspiration. We believe, her casual style which has a lot of boho and grunge influence is worth following and so are her red carpet looks with a really edgy touch to it. At present, the actor is busy with the promotions of her upcoming film Baadshaho, co-starring Ajay Devgn and Ileana D'Cruz, and she is doing it in style. Ahead of the release of the thriller, let's take a look at her style quotient.

We can't forget the time when Esha Gupta picked up a dangerously high-slit gown by Nikhil Thampi at IIFA 2016. Without an iota of doubt we can say that the dress suited her very well, but the slit which almost reached her waist, could have ruled against the actress. Nevertheless, Gupta carried the outfit with grace. We like it! (Photo: Varinder Chawla)

Esha Gupta was seen in a crop top and fitted pants from H&M and a gorgeous jacket by Drama Queen. With sleek, straight middle-parted hair, she finished out the look with minimialistic make-up and heels from Dune London. We can all learn a few tricks from her on how to look like a million bucks. (Source: Instagram/Esha Gupta)

Esha Gupta in this caged crop top, leather pants and a beautiful sequinned bomber from Asos looks really hot. We just couldn’t stop but appreciate how well she styled these separate pieces, just like a rocker babe. A Louboutin sling was her choice of accessory. (Source: Instagram/Esha Gupta)

We spotted Esha Gupta head-to-toe in Zara and it was so smooth that she just earned herself the tag ‘Queen of street style’. The mini dress with lace detailing was pretty in itself but pairing it up with knee-high booties and a white comfy shrug to amp up the look was just too clever. Talk about looking like a bomb while being comfortable at the same time. (Source: Instagram/Esha Gupta)

Esha Gupta in these separates by Shivan and Narresh looks amazing! The actor wore the military inspired bralet and the gold pleated skirt to a car launch event. An unusual combination but she pulled it off well. Vintage earrings from Viange, a pair of black Jimmy Choo heels, lovely curls and a berry lip shade added oomph to her look.

For her flight to London, Esha Gupta took off-duty look to the next level. The actor was spotted in a bling electric blue T-shirt style dress. White sneakers, a light tan backpack and rose gold reflective sunnies from Ray Ban rounded out the look. We think she looks amazing. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Esha Gupta was spotted in a beautiful bright red trench dress by Lavish Alice. Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra paired it with a pair of really smart heels from Michael Kors and a bag from Christian Louboutin. Her make-up was right on point with light smokey eyes and marsala lips. Now, this is a tricky combination and usually it's advisable to go with a lighter lip shade when you go for smokey eyes but it’s Esha Gupta we are talking about. She can pull off anything!

Esha Gupta looked like a dream in a beige outfit at an award show. She opted for a pair of cigarette pants and coupled it with a pearl embroidered jacket — both by designer Gaurav Gupta. To complete her evening look, the Rustom actress chose shiny heels and diamond danglers from Gehna jewellers. And with nude lips and soft curls, she looked ethereal in her elegant sartorial choice. All in all, if you have an evening party or wedding to attend this summer, here’s a perfect inspiration. Simple yet gorgeous — after all nothing like donning a pastel outfit in the heat, right?

Najam Sethi elected new PCB chairman,"Najam Sethi has been elected as the new PCB Chairman. (Source: AP) Najam Sethi has been elected as the new PCB Chairman. (Source: AP)

Najam Sethi has been unanimously elected as the Pakistan Cricket Board’s Chairman for the next three years by the PCB’s new Board of Governors (BoG) on Wednesday. The development has taken place a week after the Islamabad High Court admitted for hearing a petition challenging his nomination to the Board of Governors of Pakistan Cricket Board.

No other member of the BoG filed nomination papers for the post as all the 10-members voted for Sethi. He will now replace Shaharyar Khan, whose three-year tenure at the post ended on Sunday. Sethi was expected to become the new chairman as he was nominated on the PCB’s BoG last month by former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif.

According to reports, Sethi enjoyed the backing of former cricketers who insisted that Sethi was the best choice for the post as he had also served as the head of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) chairman.

“I support him all the way and the main reason is PSL. Many people before him discussed the idea of PSL but no one was able to materialise the plans. Sethi not only made is possible, but organised two successful editions of Pakistan’s top class T20 league and also the final of the second edition in Lahore,” the Express Tribune quoted Akram as saying.

“Four years are enough [to understand any system] and now he knows which person to use for what job. He is fully aware of all the staff and management, which makes him the best candidate,” said Wasim.

Other players behind Sethi include former Pakistan skipper Rashid Latif who said, “Sethi is the best candidate for the chairmanship of PCB and he will win. He made the PSL a big success and he will do the same with PCB. He has been trying to invite international teams to Pakistan and he will succeed in that too. He has also been working on youngsters. The team is on the top, the captain is on the top, PSL is on the top and now he will take PCB on to the top.”

Conseslus Kipruto continues Kenya’s steeplechase domination,"Conseslus Kipruto won the gold medal in Rio Olympics. (Source: Reuters) Conseslus Kipruto won the gold medal in Rio Olympics. (Source: Reuters)

Kenya’s Conseslus Kipruto continued his country’s dominance of the 3,000 metres steeplechase with a courageous and confident victory at the World Championships on Tuesday, just weeks after recovering from an ankle injury.

A silver medallist in Beijing two years ago and Olympic champion in Rio last year, Kipruto kicked on to take the lead with less than 300 metres left and was celebrating well before crossing the finish line in a time of 8 minutes 14.12 seconds.

The east African nation has now won 12 out of the 15 editions of the race in World Championships history.

“I’m happy to be world champion. Last year I became Olympic champion and this year to be world champion was my hope,” Kipruto told reporters.

“I used my plans well and last night for morale I told myself: ‘I am Olympic champion and that others must break me’. There are others who are strong but I used my own plans. I knew if the race was around 8:10 that I was going to win.”

There was no clean sweep as there was in Beijing, however, as Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco stayed with the leading group throughout to clinch silver – his first major medal.

The 21-year-old, at his first World Championships, was in tears after the race.

“That was a bit of a surprise. I thought I would maybe get a medal next time, so this is great,” he said.

Kipruto, 22 years old, also won silver in his first World Championships in 2013. However, this time he made sure it was third time lucky and came down the final straight pointing to the crowd and stretching out his arms in celebration.

It was a surprising sight, given Kipruto suffered an ankle injury at the national trials in June and only resumed full training last month.

A Kenyan win did not look certain for much of the race. Evan Jager came to London as favourite following his Olympic silver medal last year and Kipruto’s injury.

The American led the field round and looked to be on course for victory until he was overtaken by the Kenyan.

Jager held on to take bronze in 8:15.53 and become the first American to win a world championship medal in the steeplechase.

“I thought I was running really smoothly for gold. I ran it the way I thought would give me the best opportunity at winning, by taking it out,” Jager said.

“I’m really happy to be on the podium, for sure, but I’m also disappointed because I had pretty high hopes of coming in here and winning gold, especially with the injury Conseslus picked up. I thought it gave me a great chance to win gold.”

Bakersfield man charged after threats made to blow up 2 Indiana schools,"Representational Image Representational Image

A Bakersfield, California man was charged with making online threats to blow up two Indiana high schools and extorting underage girls for sexually explicit photos and video, federal authorities said. Buster Hernandez, 26, was being held in California Monday, but was expected to be sent to Indiana to face charges filed Friday of sexual exploitation of a child and threats to use an explosive device.

Hernandez is believed to have used the online moniker “Brian Kil” to contact random individuals typically minors through private messages and threatening to send sexually explicit images to their friends and families if they failed to send him more of the images, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. “Brian Kil” is believed to have had victims in at least 10 federal districts and has been the subject of an investigation since December 2015.

A Plainfield, Indiana girl was threatened via Facebook in December 2015 after she refused to send sexually explicit photos of herself over the internet. The threats prompted the Dec. 17, 2015, closings of Plainfield and Danville high schools and a shopping center. A person using the name “Brian Kil” referring to Plainfield wrote to the girl: “I want to leave a trail of death and fire,” the complaint said.

“I will simply WALK RIGHT IN UNDETECTED TOMORROW,” the person continued. “Once in, I will wait a few classes before I start my assault. I’m coming for you. I will slaughter your entire class and save you for last.”

Taunts and threats also were directed toward police. “The police are useless,” the person wrote. “I’ll add a dozen dead police to my tally … tomorrow will be a (expletive) bloodbath at Plainfield High.” Earlier that week, threatening emails were sent to other school districts across the country. Schools in Los Angeles were closed for a day.

Tim Horty, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Indianapolis told The Associated Press in an email Monday that he didn’t know if Hernandez was a suspect in those cases. Josh Minkler, U.S. Attorney in Indianapolis, told reporters Monday that the person known as Brian Kil in his own words “wanted to be the worst cyber terrorist that ever lived.” “The evidence shows he was well on his way to achieving that goal,” Minkler said.

The complaint against Hernandez also says an underage Michigan girl was threatened if she didn’t send sexually explicit images and videos. She no longer is a minor. A second Indiana girl was asked to attend a Jan. 19, 2016, community forum at Plainfield High School and relay what was discussed back to him.

The affidavit also says the person going by the name “Brian Kill” attempted to cover his cyber tracks by using computer software designed to make communications over the internet anonymous. On Feb. 4, 2016, “Brian Kill” posted “it would take a miracle to catch me” to Facebook accounts. But authorities, in June, tracked the communications to a computer at the Bakersfield home of Hernandez’ girlfriend.

Computer equipment and removable data storage devices, such as thumb drives, were seized from the home, Minkler said. Hernandez shares the home with his girlfriend Kimberly Francis and her grandmother, Audrey Francis.

“My God! I’m so disappointed,” Francis told The Associated Press Monday in a telephone interview. “He’s taken care of me and I’m 87 years old. When I took my fall about a year ago he took care of me.” Audrey Francis said her granddaughter is “in tears,” adding “I don’t believe it happened and she can’t believe it happened.”

Former union minister M Venkaiah Naidu will take oath as the 13th Vice-President of India on Friday in New Delhi. Naidu, 68, will be administered the oath of office by President Ram Nath Kovind at a function at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was elected to the post after he defeated Opposition vice-presidential candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi in the Vice-presidential polls which were held on August 8.

“I am very humbled. I am also thankful to the Prime Minister and all party leaders for their support. I will seek to utilise the vice-presidential institution to strengthen the hands of the president and secondly uphold the dignity of the Upper House,” Naidu said after his victory.

On the eve of his swearing-in ceremony, Naidu challenged the views expressed by his predecessor Hamid Ansari who claimed that the Muslims in India were experiencing “a sense of uneasiness and insecurity.”

“Compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due,” Naidu told media. He also asserted that India was the most tolerant and secular country in the world. “Indian ethos is of mutual respect for each other. People try to use minority issues for political purposes,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Targetting Ansari without naming him, Naidu also said: “India is the most tolerant country…Unfortunately, some people are trying to blow it out of proportion and trying to defame India, raising it to national forum.”

Vice-presidential elections this year witnessed highest number of votes polled (771) for the post. A source told The Indian Express the highest votes ever cast in a vice-presidential election before this was 759, when BJP veteran Shekhawat was elected as the 11th vice-president in 2002. Bagging 67 per cent of the total votes polled, Naidu’s victory margin of 272 is also reported to be the highest in the last three decades.

When women are branded as witches and brutalised,"The suffering of these women branded as witches is more than just about their brutal deaths, sometimes from lynching; their lives are a relentless story of violence, abuse and terror. (Representational image) The suffering of these women branded as witches is more than just about their brutal deaths, sometimes from lynching; their lives are a relentless story of violence, abuse and terror. (Representational image)

There is no denying the fact that we have entered a particularly aggressive, militarized and masculine phase of Indian polity and society. A dominant feature of these times is that women appear to be disappearing from and written out of public spaces and cultural narratives. This is more evident in towns and villages far away from the metros, where women are at the receiving end of violence. These parts of India remain unaffected by the displays of ‘national’ outrage and cacophonous media debates on mob violence or lynchings.

The UN-declared International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples on August 9 is an opportune time to reflect on one of the most common forms of violence experienced by tribal or adivasi women in India – witch-hunting, where women are accused of possessing occult powers to harm others. A combination of superstitious beliefs, religious practices and patriarchal norms unleashes lifelong suffering on women accused of witchcraft, in many cases resulting in their murders and lynchings.

Witchcraft, in the urban imagination, is part of myths and stories and foreign folklore. Many of us were regaled by stories of Baba Yaga in Russian folktales and the witch in the German fairy-tale of Hansel and Gretel. We learnt about the European witch-hunt of the Middle Ages through history textbooks which recounted the fact of women being charged with apostasy and heresy and consequently burnt at the stake for sorcery.

Sadly, in many parts of India, witchcraft is neither a thing of the past nor a part of entertaining stories from abroad. In fact, witchcraft-related deaths are reported every third day, with the majority of the victims being women. The situation appears grave across the North Indian heartland, from Bihar and Jharkhand to Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, from Rajasthan in the west to Assam in the east.

The suffering of these women branded as witches is more than just about their brutal deaths, sometimes from lynching; their lives are a relentless story of violence, abuse and terror. Not to take away from the horrific mob lynchings of Muslims recently, but the fact remains that we are hardly as outraged over the torture, rape and murders of tribal, rural women in the name of witch-hunting. These stories are mostly passed over; the accused goes unpunished.

Despite anti-witchcraft acts legislated in most states, witch-hunting continues with impunity. Jharkhand has the dubious distinction of being the leader among states with the most witch-hunting death cases. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, from 2008 to 2013, Jharkhand saw 220 witch-hunting related murders of women. As per police records, 98 deaths and 1,857 incidents of witch-hunt have occurred from 2014 to 2016 in Jharkhand alone. August 7served as the painful reminder of the first anniversary of the horrifying deaths of five Oraon women in a village near Ranchi, all of whom were tortured and hacked to death last year, after being branded as witches.

Bihar is no different. Childhood memories of my village in Madhubani district include being witness to conversations about who in the village possessed occult or supernatural powers. In hushed tones, a grand aunt (an elderly widowed woman) was declared a witch; we were advised to stay away from her evil powers. Thankfully, no physical harm came to her as she died a natural death, but her isolation and social ostracism was complete.

From 2015 -2017, more than 250 women were subjected to witch-hunting in Bihar. In March 2017, Ramavati Devi, a Dalit woman from Purnea was burnt alive by her neighbours who suspected her of practicing witchcraft. Early this week, Phool Kumari Devi’s mutilated body was recovered from the railway track in Bhagalpur on August 7. She was kidnapped from her home by assailants armed with weapons who blamed her for practicing witchcraft. It is suspected that she was raped and then murdered. Justice in most of these cases is a far cry.

Not a single day goes by without local reports or some form of public acknowledgement of violence against women in the name of witch-hunting. The roots of this violence are not only in the specific religious or cultural beliefs and superstitions but also in the cold calculations of patriarchal mindsets, in the connivance to deprive women of land and property, to take revenge where women refuse sexual advances and to punish women for petty disputes. Poor health care facilities in rural areas and lack of sustained awareness programmes, implementation of laws and informed government intervention exacerbate the problem.

The complexity of this issue and its punitive dimensions can be found in the blurring of boundaries between protector and perpetrator. Like other mob lynching cases it is difficult to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

For the survivors of this violence, the scars run deep as the perpetrators are often members of their own family, neighbourhood and community.

In Jharkhand for example, witch-hunting is practised by adivasi men against adivasi women but the identity politics of adivasi vs non-adivasi makes it difficult to acknowledge patriarchal violence within the adivasi community. Adivasi women lynched for witch-hunting by their own kith and kin hardly evoke outrage among human rights activists as they supposedly confuse the separation of perpetrators from victims. The absence of a strong feminist movement on this issue adds to the complexity of the crime.

The real resistance is being offered by women themselves, as among the witch-hunted are those who dare to challenge patriarchal norms and superstition. Poonam Toppo, an activist in Ranchi, whose grandmother was stigmatized as a witch and subjected to abuse and violence, has been fighting this practice with her small team of social workers. Anytime a woman is blamed for causing physical illness of another, Toppo and her team provide medical treatment for the patient and then raise awareness about false witchcraft allegations. These efforts are localized, socially sensitive and thus, effective.

Meanwhile, Ramavati Devi, Phool Kumari Devi, Eitwariya, Jesinth, Kalki, Titri and Madni Khalkho and others like them await justice in death; their lives cut short by the familiar banality of gendered violence through witch-hunting. As we remember the other struggles of adivasi people, we must recognize that witch-hunting is very real and that, in fact, it is treated as “business as usual” by adivasi, Dalit and other women in many parts of India.

South Africa’s no-confidence vote on President Jacob Zuma fails,"Members of parliament prepare to vote for or against the motion of no confidence against South African president, Jacob Zuma in the South African parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, Tuesday, Aug. 8, 2017.

(Rodger Bosch/Pool Photo via AP)

South African President Jacob Zuma again survived a no-confidence vote in parliament Tuesday in the most serious attempt yet to unseat him after months of growing anger over alleged corruption and a sinking economy. Zuma had survived six previous attempts to dislodge him in parliament, but this was the first to be held by secret ballot after parliamentary speaker Baleka Mbete on Monday made the surprise decision to allow it.

Opposition parties hoped it would encourage disgruntled legislators with the ruling African National Congress party to vote against Zuma, who has faced numerous allegations of graft while South Africa’s economy has fallen into recession.

Instead, ANC members in the chamber began singing shortly before the vote results were announced and soon broke out in cheers, while party supporters gathered outside started dancing. “We reiterate that we will never endorse or vote in favor of any motion that seeks to cripple our country,” the ANC said in a statement issued immediately after the results were announced.

The head of the main opposition Democratic Alliance party, Mmusi Maimane, had urged lawmakers before the vote to take their country back. “This is a historic day. Indeed, since the dawn of our democracy the stakes have never been higher,” he said. Widespread frustration over Zuma has hurt the ANC, the former liberation movement that has led South Africa since the end of white minority rule and the first all-race elections in 1994. On Tuesday, former President Thabo Mbeki said ANC lawmakers must ask themselves if they have confidence in Zuma, according to a video posted by a Nairobi-based journalist on Twitter.

“Those MPs must recall that they are the representatives of the people, and must therefore represent the people in terms of what they do this afternoon,” Mbeki told reporters.

The ANC holds a majority of the 400 parliament seats, and the party had repeatedly said its members would not support the opposition-led attempt to unseat the president. The party has 249 parliamentary seats, five of which are currently vacant, said a party spokeswoman, Nonceba Mhlauli. The no-confidence motion needed 201 votes to succeed.

The draft of the motion submitted by the Democratic Alliance accused Zuma of “derelict leadership” and said the president has “lost all sense of rationality and sound judgment,” harming the country’s economy and its poorest citizens. Demonstrations both for and against Zuma, who has led South Africa since 2009, took place in front of the parliament building in Cape Town before the much-anticipated vote.

“As you can see, thousands of people have reached the end of their tether in terms of what is happening in our beautiful country, our beautiful, diverse country that we should enjoy but we can’t enjoy because millions of our people are without jobs,” said one protester, Johnnie Jacobs.

“We have got to get rid of this man before he destroys everything that we have all worked so hard for,” said another protester, Anne Shirley.

While Zuma’s term continues until elections in 2019, there have been calls from within the ANC for him to quit earlier and allow the party to shore up support before the vote. The ruling party is expected to replace Zuma as ANC president at a meeting in December. The reputation of Zuma, who spent a decade in prison for his anti-apartheid activities and has been popular among some South Africans for his personal warmth and populist policies, has been tarnished by allegations of impropriety.

Last year, the Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that Zuma “failed to uphold” the constitution by not paying back some of the $20 million-plus in state money used to upgrade his rural home. Zuma’s ties to the Gupta family, immigrant businessmen accused of trying to manipulate government leaders and state companies for financial gain, also have stirred public anger.

The president’s firing of widely respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in a Cabinet reshuffle in March led two agencies, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, to lower South Africa’s credit rating to below investment grade, or junk status.

The 20-year-old France international is seen as a potential successor to Neymar at Barcelona, after the Brazilian’s record 222-million euro ($260 million) move to Paris St Germain earlier this month.

German media have reported that Dembele could join Barca for more than 100 million euros.

“Dembele was not at training today,” Bosz told reporters. “We tried reaching him and hopefully nothing bad has happened.”

Anavila Misra to focus on black as part of sustainable show at Lakme Fashion Week,"Designer Anavila Misra. (Source: File Photo) Designer Anavila Misra. (Source: File Photo)

Designer Anavila Misra is set to showcase a sustainable line focussed on black as a theme at Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Winter, Festive 2017. The fashion week celebrates day two as Sustainable Fashion and Indian Textile Day every season and this time Anavila is going to close the day with her line called Blur on August 17.

“Known for understated designs in subtle colours, Anavila makes a bold move with the focus on black for the very first time. The unmatched intrigue of black, a colour that invokes fierce emotions of strength, power and often manifests the unknown and mysterious, intensifies the reactions to it,” said the designer. “In the design and fashion realm, black represents a unique form and probably is the only colour or the lack of it, that connects to the universe like no other. It continues to exude a sense of crisp formality,” she added.

Talking about how sustainability has got a new meaning amongst youth, she told IANS, “I certainly feel the youth today is more conscious about their surroundings. With education, communication and exposure the impending need to care for the earth has become viral. Be it fashion, food or lifestyle, the youth is making better choices everyday.” The five day fashion week is scheduled to take place at St Regis in Mumbai.

Second Nature,"Indira Gandhi with a tiger cub, Teen Murti House, 1956-57. (Courtesy: Simon & Schuster) Indira Gandhi with a tiger cub, Teen Murti House, 1956-57. (Courtesy: Simon & Schuster)

Title: Indira Gandhi: A Life in Nature

Author: Jairam Ramesh

Publisher: Simon & Schuster

Pages: 437

Price: Rs 799

We think of Indira Gandhi’s years in the wilderness as the period in the Opposition, 1977-1980, but setting apart the figure of speech, Jairam Ramesh’s book reminds us that she had a very real, lifelong relationship with the wild, which informed the ecological policies established under her rule. Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, whom he plied with books on natural history and wildlife (apart from those famous letters), were perhaps the only Indian prime ministers who could tell a blue-fronted redstart from a red-vented bulbul. And if the father is remembered for promoting big dams and heavy industry, the daughter was alive to the environmental cost of development. In the Sixties and Seventies, she framed these concerns precisely as we do now, 50 years later.

A vocal member of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS, which publishes the books of Salim Ali, who was a mentor to Gandhi), she was also a founding member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society. Her tenure as prime minister coincided with the rise of the global environmental movement (by way of reference, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring appeared in 1962, and Gandhi took office four years later), and the founding principles of India’s conservation movement were set under her rule. With a wealth of detail culled from the archives, Ramesh establishes that she was the right person in the right place at the right time. Her personal interest in conservation steered India’s green policy, created institutions like the Indian Forest Service (constituted in 1966, the year she became PM) and ensured the environmental security of havens like Chilka Lake and the Keoladeo Ghana Bird Sanctuary in Bharatpur.

Ramesh begs to differ with Ramachandra Guha, who had attributed Indira Gandhi’s interest in birds to the American pacifist and ornithologist Horace Alexander, Mahatma Gandhi’s friend and founder of the Delhi Birdwatching Society, who had done fieldwork in what is now Nagaland with Sidney Dillon Ripley (who would later win acclaim as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution). Ramesh traces Gandhi’s ornithological interests back to 1942, when she was an inmate at Naini Central Prison, Allahabad.

In 1941, Salim Ali had met Nehru in Dehra Dun, where he was jailed, and gave him an autographed copy of his new work, The Book of Indian Birds. Decades later, Gandhi alluded to the influence of the classic and Stanley Henry Prater’s Book of Indian Animals in her speech at the BNHS’s centenary celebrations, adding, “But I did not know much about birds until the high walls of Naini prison shut us off from them and for the first time, I paid attention to bird songs. I noted the sounds and later on after my release, my father sent me Dr Salim Ali’s book and I was able to identify the birds.”

Gandhi’s approach to conservation was graduated. In 1958, before she became PM, she wrote an article in the Sunday Statesman about a trip to Manali, urging against reckless modernisation. She suggested that the Kullu valley could be reserved for trekkers and nature lovers, while city slickers should go to pukka hill stations like Simla and Mussoorie.

She seems to have rejected the government versus activist model which now polarises the issue. Apart from naturalists, she was sympathetic to grassroots activists like Sundarlal Bahuguna. In 1981, she sent him a taped public statement backing his padayatra from Kashmir to Kohima, warning of the dangers of denuding the hills.

Quite often, in acting on an environmental issue, Gandhi was guided by the reports and appeals of foreign agencies, activists and researchers, who are now regarded with instinctive suspicion by the government. Indeed, when Western researchers found it impossible to get visas for geopolitical reasons, the norms were relaxed for environmental and conservation projects.

Project Tiger was proposed by the British conservationist Guy Mountfort’s World Wildlife Fund. He understood that it would not fly without the PM’s backing, and sought an audience. He was pleasantly surprised to find a task force constituted the very next morning, and a meeting scheduled within 48 hours.

According to Ramesh’s research, Ashok Khosla, the physicist behind the concept of sustainable development, joined the fledgeling Department of Science and Technology on the recommendation of his professor at Harvard, the celebrated Roger Revelle. He standardised the environmental impact assessment of projects, nurtured NGOs and established Development Alternatives.

After the debacle of 1977, two of Gandhi’s last communications before demitting office concerned the environment. One was to the petroleum minister, concerning oil prospecting in the Sunderbans and warning of the damage that a spill would cause to Project Tiger. The other reminded the chief minister of Assam, who proposed to clear forests and institute the monoculture of commercially profitable species, of the implications for water management and climate change across borders.

While the Indian conservation movement is the sum total of the work of thousands of people, from maharajas who put down the hunting rifle in favour of the camera, to farmers and foresters who saw the implications of environmental damage at first hand, Jairam Ramesh suggests that it was accelerated and given intelligent direction by Indira Gandhi. She was guided by a direct, immediate connection with the outdoors, which she shared with her father. She had travelled widely in the wild and at home in Teen Murti House, she had helped maintain Nehru’s menagerie, which at one time included three tiger cubs and Sanjay Gandhi’s baby crocodile (do all headstrong leaders encounter crocodiles in their impressionable years?).

The family’s travel preferences, recounted by Jagat Mehta, illustrate their love for the outdoors. In 1958, father and daughter, aged 67 and 41, led a diplomatic mission to Bhutan via Tibet, trekking 105 km in five days from the Nathu La pass to Paro, at altitudes of around 15,000 feet. If contemporary leaders who attribute all the ills of India to the Nehru-Gandhis attempted such feats in their international travels, it would improve their figures, their temper and their world view.

Served with Love is a typical, I-hate-you-at-first-sight-then fall-in-endless-love story. Set in the kitchen of a plush hotel, the story involves Pakhi, an able sous chef and Abhimanyu Dev, another equally able chief chef — but he’s also a hard taskmaster and the owner of the hotel chain. He’s dated a lot of supermodels but has never committed to anyone. And Pakhi has put her life on hold for her three-year-old orphaned niece.Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway.

Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway. Over ‘vegetable angaara’, ‘home-made rasmalai’ and a recipe of hot chocolate laced with chilli. Kisses are stolen between hospital visits for an ailing grandfather and Abhimanyu caring for Pakhi’s orphaned niece. There’s a dash of jealousy in the form of a psychotic ex-fiance of Pakhi. But it’s never clear what the two protagonists really like in each other except her “ample” assets, and his “ponytail”.

Plot and character development in this book are competitively cringe-making, and it’s difficult to decide which is the winner. It’s easy to see who isn’t — the reader. Read this if only you wish to expand your knowledge of fancy desserts and how a five-star kitchen functions.

China hopes for ‘concrete cooperation’ at BRICS summit,"Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP Photo) Chinese President Xi Jinping (AP Photo)

Notwithstanding the India-China tension over the Doklam standoff, Beijing is upbeat about the next month’s BRICS summit to be held in the Chinese city of Xiamen, expecting “concrete cooperation” among the five emerging economies.

“I think this year’s summit in Xiamen will produce more practical and concrete cooperation, and improve trust and confidence among BRICS,” Shen Yi, director of the centre for BRICS studies at Fudan University was quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency in a commentary on the upcoming summit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend the summit of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) being hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

There is no word yet here whether the two leaders would be meeting on the sidelines of the summit as the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops continues at the Doklam area of the Sikkim Sector, making it the longest stalemate between the two militaries in recent years.

India and China have been locked in a prolonged standoff in the area in the Sikkim sector since June 16 after Chinese troops began constructing a road near the Bhutan trijunction.

Bhutan has protested to China, saying the area belonged to it and accused Beijing of violating agreements that aim to maintain the status quo until the boundary dispute is resolved.

India says the Chinese action to construct the road was unilateral and changes the status quo. It fears the road would allow China to cut off India’s access to its northeastern states.

The summit will discuss the organisation’s role in global governance, a faltering economic recovery and setbacks in globalisation, the Xinhua commentary said.

“BRICS: stronger partnership for a brighter future” will bring together the leaders of all the five countries, it said.

The “gold bricks countries” — a Chinese translation of BRICS — represent emerging markets and are the voice of the world’s developing countries, it said, without referring to the current round of India-China tensions over Doklam.

The Xinhua commentary also highlighted Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s assertions in the past about BRICS Plus under which China says the five-member bloc should expand cooperation with developing countries.

Last year, India which hosted a summit in Goa invited leaders of BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic) in which Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal are members.

China is yet to release its list of guests to meet on the sidelines of the BRICS summit.

China does not want to limit future cooperation to the five nations. In March, Foreign Affairs Minister Wang said that China would explore expansion modalities for “BRICS Plus” and build a wider partnership through dialogue with developing countries and international organisations, the commentary said.

“BRICS plus” will provide opportunities for other economies and inject impetus into economic globalisation, it quoted the chief economist of the Eurasian Development Bank Yaroslav Lissovolik as saying.

“The proposals of Minister of Foreign Affairs of China Wang Yi regarding the expansion of the BRICS partnership zone are not only timely in the light of China’s presidency of BRICS, but they are also aimed at giving new impetus to integration processes in the complicated conditions of protectionism’s spread in the world economy,” Lissovolik said.

Observers say that BRICS is consensus based organisation and consent of the five required for its expansion.

Strong economic growth means BRICS are now key players in the world economy and in global governance, the Xinhua commentary said.

Together, the five countries accounted for 23 per cent of the 2016 global economy, almost double their share in 2006. The five have been the source of more than half of global growth in the past ten years.

“BRICS cooperation has not only helped the countries themselves, but enhanced the right to speak on global issues for all developing countries,” said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies.

As the holder of the BRICS presidency this year, China is hosting the series of meetings which usually precedes the leaders’ summit.

Earlier this week, trade ministers met in Shanghai and agreed to unite against protectionism and to do all they can to ensure the survival of the multilateral trade system.

In late July, a BRICS security meeting was held in Beijing, with discussions on global governance, anti-terrorism, the internet, energy, national security and development.

In June, finance ministers and central bank governors agreed to strengthen cooperation in several fiscal and financial areas, including the BRICS New Development Bank and regulatory collaboration.

With the progress of the past ten years and a more inclusive attitude, BRICS are prepared not only for the Xiamen summit, but for another golden decade to come, the commentary said.

"Neymar transfer could cost even more than Allianz arena, says Karl-Heinz Rummenigge","FC Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has called for the for the governing bodies of the football to step in and discuss the transfer. (Source: AP) FC Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has called for the for the governing bodies of the football to step in and discuss the transfer. (Source: AP)

Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has claimed that his side would never spend an exorbitant 222 million euros that Paris St Germain paid for Neymar this month and would invest in a new stadium with the same amount of money. Rummenigge also called for more rationality so that the transfer market does not blow out of proportions.

While speaking to Sport Bild magazine Rummenigge said, “During the Neymar transfer I asked myself the question what would be more important: Neymar or the Allianz Arena,” and added, “I have to say clearly that I prefer having the Allianz Arena which is also more important. We as Bayern Munich must have a different philosophy”. “Overall the Neymar transfer could cost even more than the arena.”

“We do not want to do this and we cannot do this (spending like PSG). And that is fine. That is also seen as the right way by the public and our fans,” Rummenigge further added.

Calling for the governing bodies of the football to step in Rummenigge said, “FIFA, UEFA, the ECA, leagues and the players union FIFpro should discuss this,” and went to state “I think we should all sit at the table, that would be my proposal. We could find more rational rules for football as a whole. Otherwise, the public will not understand it anymore, fans will lose their connection.”

Indian-American transgender girl files discrimination suit against school,"Parents Priya Shah and Jaspret Brar have sued Heritage Oak Private Education in California and its parent company, alleging that the school refused to call daughter Nikki Brar by her name. (Representational Image) Parents Priya Shah and Jaspret Brar have sued Heritage Oak Private Education in California and its parent company, alleging that the school refused to call daughter Nikki Brar by her name. (Representational Image)

An eight-year-old Indian-origin transgender girl and her family have sued a US school for allegedly forcing her to wear a boy’s uniform and refusing to call her by her chosen name, media reports said. Parents Priya Shah and Jaspret Brar have sued Heritage Oak Private Education in California and its parent company, alleging that the school refused to call daughter Nikki Brar by her name, Los Angeles Times reported.

The lawsuit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that Heritage Oak Private Education in Yorba Linda would not let Nicole, who goes by Nikki, dress as she chose, use the bathroom of her choice and go by female pronouns.

The lawsuit alleges that the school violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a California law which outlaws discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation, the report said. “When adults at a school think that they can dictate the name that a child goes by and demand she wear a boy’s uniform when she knows she’s a girl, that’s wrong. And that’s what happened at Heritage Oak,” Mark Rosenbaum, the lead attorney for the Shah Brar family, said in a news release from the law firm Public Counsel.

“As a society, we can’t accept such discrimination from any quarter – least of all from a school seeking to deny the identity of one of its students,” Rosenbaum said. The suit is noteworthy because it is “the first (transgender rights) case to use a state anti-discrimination law as one of the grounds for relief,” said Rosenbaum.

“In light of the Trump administration’s inaction on taking a stand against discrimination against trans individuals… this is a terribly important case,” he said. The suit also claims that the school barred teachers from protecting her from bullying and harassment.

The lawsuit alleged that Nikki experienced social isolation. The girls would not play with her because she had to dress like a boy, and she found the boys’ games too rough. Boys would bully the youngster, calling her “a loser”, it said.

Nikki left the school in February 2017. “We believed it was extremely important to respond… to decide when and how to inform and educate our entire elementary school community… about the mid-year change of gender identity expression of a young child… Unfortunately, these accommodations were rejected and the parents withdrew their child,” according to a statement by The school’s parent group Nobel Learning Communities.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has been rolling back Obama-era protections for transgender students. In February, the administration rescinded federal guidelines instructing schools to allow students to use the bathroom corresponding with their gender identities. Last month, the Department of Education told its lawyers they could feel free to dismiss complaints related to bathroom access.

Inside Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Mystery: Left handed Lasith Malinga,"Chamidhu is considered a left-handed version of Lasith Malinga. Chamidhu is considered a left-handed version of Lasith Malinga.

The practice nets at the Max Cricket Academy are a veil of green mesh, one intertwined with the other, shrouding them from the world outside, as if a highly mysterious project is brewing. The only un-webbed stretch is the bowlers’ runway, where a cluster of young men is restlessly scattered around the two nets while some are sitting on the roller sipping Gatorade.

It’s difficult to differentiate between pacers and spinners, for the nets look so closely bunched from the side that you feel the bowlers will collide into each other in their run-up. Just then, Chamidhu, lithe and swift, glides in rhythmically, before with a last-second blur of arms, legs and back contortions, he slings the ball with his left arm at an absurdly low angle to the ground. The thump of his left foot into the turf is so heavy that you wonder if he has ankles of rubber. It takes some getting used to — even his club coaches found it difficult to comprehend — to lay it down to an unorthodox action than an optical illusion.

His friends call him “slinga”. In Sri Lanka, just one man goes by that name — Lasith Malinga. Now, a more original counterfeit of Malinga, sans his permed curls and maybe a couple of inches taller, bursts in. As he approaches the creases, his upper body arches back, bends almost like an arc, then with a twisty jerk of the body flings the ball in, the right arm fully horizontal to the ground, like the big needles of a clock when it touches 12’o clock.

He is Nuwan Thushara, widely talked about as the next Malinga and who turned a few heads in last year’s U-19 World Cup. But like Chamidhu, he’s a scattershot, tends to be a little erratic. It is an action that invites inaccuracy, unless you’ve mastered it like Malinga.

At the adjoining nets, Avindu Theekshana is twirling the ball in his fingers, ready to strum in. He grips the ball like a seam bowler in the tip of his fingers, runs in quickly and bowls at a quickish pace, then without wrapping his fingers over the ball, just flicks it with the index finger, like a mirror reflection of Ajantha Mendis. Even the index finger of his non-bowling hand, his right hand, points skywards like Mendis during the delivery stride. Not yet out of college, several big Colombo clubs are queuing up for the signature of the boy from Galle.

Around them is a retinue of coaches, incessantly barking out instructions or mumbling something in their ears, as well as carefully enshrouding them from the outsider’s gaze. Both the coaches and players divulge little about what’s happening there or even engage in a casual chat with strangers or are willing to identify themselves. You pick the familiar faces, like former Sri Lankan pacer Nuwan Zoysa, or spin bowling coach Ajith Ekanayage, or international discards or fringe players like Seekkuge Prasanna or Suraj Randiv, he of the Virender Sehwag no-ball fame, or young off-spinner with an unorthodox action, Akila Dananjaya.

So treasured they seem to be that shooting videos by outsiders is prohibited. Even the camera is viewed with a touch of suspicion — as if they want the mystery to remain well within green meshes of the academy nets, far removed from the prying (spying too) eyes of the outsider.

Thank god, they are far away from the snooping IPL scouts too, for mystery is a quotient so valued by them, a reason even little-known chinaman bowlers like Shivil Kaushik are gleefully lapped up by franchises shelling out eye-catching sums. But here, the coaches clearly seem to keep them away from probing eyes.

The session fits straight into the grand Sri Lankan romance of mystique twirlers and slingers, each out-marvelling the other with their oeuvre of fancy tricks. Then there are some who weren’t in the camp like the ambidextrous spinner Kamindu Mendis. If you think Muttiah Muralitharan and Malinga were just aberrations, the trainees of the cricket academy convince you that it’s a rule rather than an exception.

* * *

It’s the “freakishness” of the country’s talent that tugged a chord in Simon Willis’ heart. It’s ironic, in a sense, that the breeding centre of these mystery men in Sri Lanka is helmed by an Englishman. For English coaches, stereotypically fastidious, get caught up in technique — that there is either a right way or a wrong way, with no shades of grey.

But for Willis, a former Kent wicketkeeper-batsman, the country’s unorthodoxy enamoured him. “What I liked about the country was the sheer variety and uniqueness of the talent here, what you call freaks. It’s their strength, and I’m here to maximise their strengths,” he says.

His philosophy is simple. “If the methods are safe and effective, there’s no reason to meddle with those. It’s dangerous for coaches to dive in and make the changes just because it’s unusual or it’s in the coaching manual. It’s the charm and identity of this place, and they should be groomed like they’re, unless of course there are other bigger issues involved like the risk of injuries,” Willis says.

Asking a bowler to change his action is dealt delicately at the academy, he says: “You need to understand the character of the player and get into his mind before you tell him to bowl differently. The most important part is the mental aspect and you’ve to be very patient and supportive, also put him in different conditions.”

But he emphasised that drastic action-tweaks don’t happen at the academy. “We just try to focus on finer points and work within the framework of their action, give them exposure to different conditions at a young age. That’s why our developmental squads have toured a lot of places like South Africa, Australia and England,” Willis points out.

He though, insists, Sri Lankan cricket should be patient for tangible results. “It would take five to 10 years, before the system starts producing the desired results,” he says. He echoes their chief selectors’ plea, rather than observation, that transitions don’t always happen overnight. “Look at India, they’re the number one side because they have a wonderful structure and it took several years for them to achieve the results,” he says. Whether the cricket-watching Sri Lankans have the patience remains to be seen.

* * *

“Look at Graeme Swann, he got all the wickets without a doosra,” he says, twirling his fingers. Willis is referring to the off-spinners’ predilection with the variations, as a result of which they tend to flex their elbow beyond the prescribed limit (15 degree). “They say you can’t bowl the doosra without flexing the elbow by more than 15 degrees. What I’m saying is why do they need to bowl the doosra, they can bowl the arm ball or the slider,” he says.

Several of the mystery bowlers they have produced have been reported for suspect actions. Like off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake, long touted as Muralitharan’s heir, or his tribesman Tharindu Kaushal, who the selectors at one point believed to be better than Ranganna Herath, or medium pacer Shaminda Eranga. Even in the junior World Cups, several Sri Lankan spinners have been reported for suspect actions.

They’re all brought at the academy before their action is dissected threadbare and remedial measures suggested and implemented. It’s a strenuous process as you’re changing a bowler’s natural action, something which he has been doing since childhood. “They may not be the same afterwards,” Willis sighs.

Moreover, there’s hardly anybody who has remedied his action and found the same cutting edge. Also, there is the lurking tendency to relapse.

“The problem is when you try to bowl faster if you’re a fast bowler or if you’re spinner when you try the variations, there’s a tendency for the mistakes creeping in again. So as a bowler, you have to be mentally aware of the mistakes and find some confidence with this new action,” he says.

Willis points out the case of Eranga, who was reported for a suspect action in the second Test against England at Chester-le-Street in 2016. “But he worked really hard and was cleared by the ICC in June.

Now he’s bowling confidently,” he says. The same, though, hasn’t been the case with Kaushal and Senanayake, whose careers have tapered off.

The malaise, he feels, is wider and has to be rectified at the grassroots.

“You should look how and where the problem begins. It happens when you’re a kid bowling on a normal pitch. You may not be strong enough to land the ball at the other end. So you begin flexing your elbow. Then it slowly becomes a habit. So I always tell the junior coaches to keep an eye on the size of the pitch the young boys are bowling on,” Willis says.

* * *

It’s about 1 pm. The players are warming down. Zoysa and his fellow coaches are bantering around. A group of spinners is wishing Akila Dananjaya, who was picked for the limited-overs series. There is a genuine warmth and camaraderie among them. There are warm smiles all over and not a speck of mystery about them. That is until they get the ball in their hands. It wouldn’t be more ironic if an Englishman can shape the next generation of Sri Lanka’s mystery wave.

Reading the Left Right,"Storming the Gates of Heaven: The Maoist Movement in India Storming the Gates of Heaven: The Maoist Movement in India

Book name: Storming the Gates of Heaven: The Maoist Movement in India, A Critical Study 1972-2014

Author: Amit Bhattacharyya

Publisher: Setu Prakashani

Pages: 558

Price: 1200

Amit Bhattacharyya’s appendix lists the names of 439 women killed in the course of India’s Maoist movements. They have died at the hands of security forces and anti-Maoist vigilante groups supported by the ruling classes, like the Ranvir Sena of Bihar, which includes upper castes. They also use rape, a weapon that runs a knife through the heart of society. The politics of Ram and Rahim may kill more, but the Maoist movement has been more resilient in India than the mandir-masjid battle. Even the current ruling party in West Bengal had tied up with them at a subterranean level to liberate the people from the void of governance under the CPI(M). Trinamool Congress chairperson and chief minister Mamata Bannerjee found an accord with the CPI(Maoist) expedient, following the Arthashastra: “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’

That the unnatural coalition was only a means was inscribed in bold relief when the Americans recognised it first. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had visited Kolkata to congratulate the new chief minister, the communist slayer. But a few years later her nephew, a neophyte, described the “encounter” killing of a Maoist motormouth, Kishenji, as an extrajudicial killing.

Prof Amit Bhattacharyya, a historian at Jadavpur University, had the honour of being named in a public meeting by Mamata Banerjee as one who abetted Maoism. He survived to tell this tale. His book’s biggest failure is a conflation of Naxalism — named after the Naxalbari movement of 1967 — with the much larger footprint of the Maoist movement that refuses to die down. The politics of the Indian communist movement is not linear like in China, where nationalism had created the biggest popular mobilisation, led jointly by Mao Zhedong and his Red Army, along with nationalist forces inspired by Sun Yat Sen’s ideology of a China free from Japanese and British imperialism. Led by ‘Generalissimo’ Chiang Kai-shek, the nationalist forces turned their guns on the Red Army. The massacre of Jiangxi forced the Red Army into the strategic withdrawal called the Long March, and finally Chiang’s forces were routed in a civil war in 1949.

Besides, this chronicle begins in 1972, marked by the death in judicial custody of Charu Mazumdar, a former zonal committee member of the CPI(M) in north Bengal who walked out of the party in 1969 to form the CPI (Marxist-Leninist). It held its first party congress in 1970, rather dramatically disguised as a wedding event. His party had attracted largely the urban youth of what Suniti Kumar Ghosh — sort of an ideologue of the party — identified as the ‘upper, middle and lower’ bourgeoisie. Ghosh himself had remained controversial within the ranks of the fractious CPI(ML).

Mao had sent even the youth of Zhongnanhai — the large compound across Tienanmen Square where the high functionaries of the Communist Party of China (CPC) live — to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. President Xi Jinping is one of those ‘sent down’ youths. Mazumdar’s youth cadres had aunts and uncles in the West. After selective jail terms they all got a second shot in life once they emigrated. Except those who had what was commonly called the Fourth Tribunal cases, most of them were released in 1977-78 in a general amnesty declared by Chaudhury Charan Singh, then Union Home Minister.

The Tudus and Murmus, tribal sons of the soil, are rather different. They have somewhat taken over the Maoist movement after the first flush of Operation Greenhunt, which decimated the Andhra-based leadership of the CPI(Maoist). Barring Comrade ‘Ganapathy’, general secretary of the newly reconstituted party, the tribal leaders and their cadres are putting up a stiff resistance to the extent that prime minister Manmohan Singh identified them as “the single biggest threat to the nation”.

This resistance at Vedanta’s Niyamgiri and at sites of planned nuclear plants amidst rural, populated regions, constitute a people’s movement often organised by the Maoists. This could be the seed of a ‘new left’ movement that would not need a Bhattacharyya or a Kobad Gandhi to lionise, but would address objective realities through peaceful civil disobedience. Increasingly, they will ask political power what development is, and for whom it is. Tough questions, those.

Surround space: Parul Sharma’s debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma’s photographs One of Parul Sharma’s photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the “asymmetry of everydayness”. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma’s sojourns in the last couple of years — Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi — but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. “I don’t like to put anything in a box. I don’t want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,” says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. “It has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,” says Sharma.

US says two Cuban diplomats expelled after ‘incidents’ in Havana,"State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert speaks during a briefing at the State Department in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2017. (AP Photo) State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert speaks during a briefing at the State Department in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2017. (AP Photo)

The United States said it had expelled two Washington-based Cuban diplomats in May after unspecified “incidents” caused physical symptoms in Americans serving at the U.S. Embassy in Havana that an unnamed official said included hearing loss. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Wednesday the exact nature of the incidents was unclear, but the Americans serving in Cuba returned to the United States for non life-threatening “medical reasons.” The United States first learned of the issues at the embassy in late 2016, she said.

“We don’t have any definitive answers about the source or the cause of what we consider to be incidents,” Nauert said. “It’s caused a variety of physical symptoms in these American citizens who work for the U.S. government. We take those incidents very seriously, and there is an investigation currently under way.”

As a result, the United States on May 23 asked two Cuban officials in Washington to leave the country and they have done so, Nauert said.

“What this requires is providing medical examinations to these people,” Nauert said. “Initially, when they’d started reporting what I will just call symptoms, it took time to figure out what it was, and this is still ongoing. So we’re monitoring it.”

A U.S. government official said several colleagues at the U.S. embassy in Havana were evacuated back to the United States for hearing problems and other symptoms over the past six months. Some subsequently got hearing aids, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Washington and Havana re-established diplomatic relations in 2015 after more than five decades of hostilities, re-opening embassies in each other’s capitals and establishing a new chapter of engagement between the former Cold War foes.

President Donald Trump rolled back part of his predecessor Barack Obama’s policy toward Cuba, but has left in place many of the changes, including the re-opened U.S. Embassy in Havana.

7 kinds of outdoor furniture you can invest in during monsoon,"Brass stools give a regal appearance to any home or garden. (Source: File Photo) Brass stools give a regal appearance to any home or garden. (Source: File Photo)

During the rainy season, sitting outside and soaking in the pleasant weather has a different charm altogether. Invest in hanging chair, teak wood carved swings and wicker furniture for enjoying the experience, suggest experts.

Surabhi Mittal, founder at Revived by Surabhi, and Sunil Gupta, founder and Director at ExportersIndia.com, have listed a few options:

* Outdoor hanging chair: Choose a durable material such as cast metal. Alternatively, it may fit in the balcony with a rope swing bed which can be adorned with lovely cushions and seating.

* Garden table and chair or stool set: A garden table and chair set can be an excellent addition to the furniture collection this monsoon. Purchase one in light plastic or black metal. One made entirely of wood is best avoided as it can deteriorate significantly due to high moisture content and dampness in the air.

* Brass stools: Brass stools give a regal appearance to any home or garden.

"Women empowerment, one knot at a time!","The women also have an exclusive range dedicated to their creativity, called Artisan Originals. The women also have an exclusive range dedicated to their creativity, called Artisan Originals.

Shanti Bai is having an ephiphany. She has just finished inviting us all for her daughter’s wedding when I tell her I’m single. “If I had known that was possible, I would never have married,” she says. “Well, you’ll be free once your daughter’s married,” I tell her hopefully. She has four more children, she informs. And there’s nothing more to say.

We are having this conversation at the school, set up as a community initiative by Jaipur Rugs in Manpura Macheri village, about 40km from Jaipur, where she and the team of women that works under her learn to read and write. They decide to entertain us, as one mimics a teacher who taught them for a while and how she asks her husband to help with chores in the morning so she gets time to apply makeup. “I tell him I have to go out and bring back money for the house, so he should help with the kids,” she declares.

Shanti Bai has done well for herself. A victim of an abusive marriage, she now heads a team of women who work on the looms that she has set up in her home. A goat is tethered nearby, while a bangle-seller stops by to sell trinkets. As the women take a break and start picking earrings and bangles, it’s obvious how empowered they feel. One of them has dropped in even though it’s her free day, and is using sketch pens to create patterns on a card, which may accompany a rug to a customer, for that personal touch. As they squat at the loom, tying knots in the threads, one can’t help but notice their flat abs. Our not so flat abs haven’t gone unnoticed either, as one ‘Bunkar Sakhi’, promoted as a surveyor, shares fitness tips. Smartly dressed with a men’s shirt over her sari, she tells us how just a few years ago, she stayed behind a veil or “ghoongat”, too shy to engage in conversation. “I even understand a few words of English now,” she remarks. With her newfound confidence, she now visits several looms in the village, taking stock of the work and correcting any errors she finds in the knotting.

Jaipur Rugs, along with brands such as Hands and Cocoon, accounts for 35 per cent of global exports from India to the hand-knotted rugs industry. Working directly with weavers, the company has on its rolls 40,000 artisans spread across five states in India with an average production of approximately 60,000 square feet per month of hand-knotted rugs.

The initiative has empowered the women in more ways than one. Mentored by the chief designer Kavita Chaudhary, the youngest daughter of owner Nand Kishore Chaudhary, the women also have an exclusive range dedicated to their creativity, called Artisan Originals. Sajana Devi, a cancer survivor, believed each knot represented her disease as she created a floral tapestry, inspired by the gardens of the hospitals she visited for treatment, titled ‘Sona-Bagicha’. A young Bugali, who started weaving to support her family, titled her rug ‘Meri Duniya’, with a pattern at the bottom capturing the trunk in which she stores her jewellery. In another rug, titled ‘Mera Lehariya’, Bugali took inspiration from the popular Shakkarpara snack, creating stripes surrounded by flowers and leaves. Designer Kavita Chaudhary’s collection ‘Unstring’, too, was awarded as Best Modern Collection 2017 at the Carpet Design Awards, held at Domotex in Hannover, Germany.

With entrepreneurship reaching the doorsteps of these women, they can work their own hours, even feeding a baby as they work or singing folk songs as they knot the rows that result in beautiful rugs. But more than anything, it’s the financial independence that gives them a spring in their steps!

"Haryana: Women helpline gets over 28,000 calls from Jan-June, only 598 cases filed","The helpline received 28,299 calls from January to June this year with complaints ranging from domestic violence, eve teasing, stalking and molestation. (Representational) The helpline received 28,299 calls from January to June this year with complaints ranging from domestic violence, eve teasing, stalking and molestation. (Representational)

THE Haryana Police receive over 150 calls a day from women reporting a crime against them or otherwise in distress on the 1091 helpline, but only a few lead to cases being registered. So far, the state police have registered fewer than 600 cases till June on the basis of these complaints, and depend more on “counselling” to resolve the complaint. On Tuesday, Virender Kundu, father of the stalking and attempt to kidnap victim, Varnika, told The Indian Express that incomplaints such as these, the police are not “mentally prepared to immediately lodge an FIR”, and said it was only after he indicated that he wanted a case registered did the police start taking the next steps.

Although the incident involving his daughter and Haryana BJP Chief Subhash Barala’s son took place in Chandigarh, remarks by a senior Haryana police officer explaining the low number of cases registered on complaints received over the helpline appeared to vindicate Kundu’s views, that registering a case is not the first reflex for police. “Following Operation Durga and Youth Against Sexual Offense drive in April, the helpline has shown signs of being accessed more and more by women in distress,” Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) OP Singh said. He added, “It’s not as much (about) arresting, it is more about counselling in police stations in the presence of parents”. Singh said Mahila police stations were providing “counselling” in “hundreds” of cases.

The ADGP claimed that in many cases, women themselves ask for a police presence to “deter” the person against whom they are complaining from harassing and also do not want to register a case. “Very few women ask for a case to be registered,” said Singh. Other police officials attributed this to the lack of confidence among women in pursuing their complaint to a logical end.

“There are women who call the helpline, but don’t want to get cases lodged due to fear. Either they require counselling or just want police intervention to check the accused at an early stage. But when it comes to getting a case registered, some of them refuse flatly. Then, in about 20 to 30 per cent cases, the claims turn out to be false, so we need to verify a lot before lodging an FIR,” said a DSP-rank officer.

The helpline received 28,299 calls from January to June this year with complaints ranging from domestic violence, eve teasing, stalking and molestation. But the police registered cases only in 2.11 per cent of the complaints. A total of 598 ‘crime against women’ cases were lodged at various police stations in the state and 622 people arrested under these cases. May recorded the highest number calls -6,364.

June recorded 6,090 calls, on the basis of which 200 cases were registered leading to the arrest of 208 people. In April, there were 77 calls to complain about stalking, 229 in May and 192 in June. As many as 135 complaints of molestation came in April, 178 in May, and 129 in June. The number of calls of domestic violence in all the 22 districts have been in the thousands: 1756 in April; 2281 in May; 2280 in June. Haryana Police has directed all district SPs to designate a police officer as 1091 in-charge, who will maintain a 1091 Register.

“After the calls are received, they are recorded in 1091 Register by the operator. The operator then calls up the complainant and gives her contact number, unit of the police officer handling her matter. A DSP level officer from Women Police Station calls up the complainant and checks out her satisfaction within 24 hours and a case is registered if found credible,” the ADGP added. But Inspector Sunita, who is the in-charge of Mahila police station in Panchkula, said, “Women themselves withdraw their complaints..in case of young girls..parents don’t let them come forward..” However, Geeta Bhukkal, MLA from Jhajjar, cited a different reason for less cases being filed. She blamed policewomen at lower levels for not taking such crimes seriously, adding that police also wants to keep the crime rate low.

“The staff at women police stations is inadequate. Moreover, they take the distress calls really lightly..,” she said. In its crime against women campaign, Haryana Police had identified as many as 118 spots across Haryana which were vulnerable to “eve-teasing”. The women police personnel have also beengoing to various schools and colleges to carry out awareness drives.

New Saint grills French friends on life in the Premier League,"Mario Lemina joined Saints from Juventus in a 17 million-euro five-year deal. (Source: Reuters) Mario Lemina joined Saints from Juventus in a 17 million-euro five-year deal. (Source: Reuters)

Mario Lemina, Southampton’s record signing, has been grilling his French friends about life in the Premier League in a bid to hit the ground running.

The Gabon midfielder joined Saints from Juventus on Tuesday in a 17 million-euro five-year deal.

“I have a lot of friends from France who are here and they have explained to me what it’s like to play in the Premier League,” the 23-year-old said.

“It is a different league, and I hope that I adapt quickly to it because I know that it is a league where everything goes quickly. I know that the team will help me lots to get used to it.”

Lemina, who won the Serie A title and the Italian Cup twice with Juventus and featured in last season’s Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid, says he wants to reach Europe with the Saints.

“The aims this year are the same as they were last season,” he told the club’s website.

“We want to finish high up the table, whether that be sixth, seventh or eight place, and why not challenge for the Europa League. I’ve seen that the club is very ambitious and we want to stay on this upward path.”

Lemina is the club’s second signing in the transfer window after Polish centre half Jan Bednarek joined from Lech Poznan.

His arrival is a boost for supporters after Dutch defensive kingpin Virgil van Dijk earlier this week handed in a transfer request.

Bednarek says Mauricio Pellegrino’s team are not talking about Van Dijk and are only focused on making a positive start against Swansea at St Mary’s on Saturday.

“It’s Virgil’s own situation,” the 21-year-old centre-back told the Southampton newspaper the Daily Echo.

“This is his own problem, and we have to be separated from this, because we have an important game and for the team that’s the only important thing. We don’t think about this and don’t talk about it.”

Van Dijk was banished to train alone by manager Pellegrino after asking to leave, and subsequently handed in a transfer request to try to force a move.

Indian doctor arrested for groping sleeping teen on UA flight,"The girl’s family has filed a complaint against United Airlines for neglecting to detain Krishnappa after the alleged assault, the report said (AP Photo) The girl’s family has filed a complaint against United Airlines for neglecting to detain Krishnappa after the alleged assault, the report said (AP Photo)

A 28-year-old Indian doctor has been arrested for allegedly groping a minor girl who was sitting next to him on a New Jersey-bound United Airlines flight, according to media reports. The 16-year-old girl, who was travelling alone on July 23, was asleep on the flight, when a stranger’s hand on her thigh awakened her, the Washington Post reported.

The man, identified as Vijakumar Krishnappa, sitting next to her quickly removed his hand, according to a federal court complaint, and the teenager went back to sleep. Then, she woke up again — and this time, the man was groping her, the complaint says. She reported the incident to the airline crew and was allowed to move seats.

Once the flight from Seattle landed at Newark Liberty International Airport, the girl, from Washington state, called her parents. While she did, the accused left the airport, said Johnny McCray, an attorney for the girl’s family. The girl’s family has filed a complaint against United Airlines for neglecting to detain Krishnappa after the alleged assault, the report said.

The FBI was called to handle the investigation. It used the flight manifest to track down Krishnappa, a doctor from India. The girl identified him from a photo array, ABC reported. Krishnappa was charged in the federal court in Newark, a day after the incident, according to court records filed by the FBI charging him with criminal sexual contact.

Court records show he was arrested and charged with knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor female, the report said. He has been released on bond, placed on electronic monitoring, and ordered to not have any contact with minors while the criminal case is pending, according to court records.

The doctor’s court-appointed attorney, John Yauch, told the Post that his client “adamantly denies the charges and deserves to be considered an innocent man.”Krishnappa is studying medicine in the United States through a months-long fellowship that allows for doctors from foreign countries to learn from experts in the US, the daily said.

A spokesman from the Federal Aviation Administration told the daily that the airlines typically notify law enforcement about incidents before landing. “The safety and security of our customers is our top priority. We take these allegations seriously and continue to work closely with the proper authorities as part of their review,” a spokesperson for United Airlines said in a statement.

Three killed in Mexico Cabos beach shootout,"More than 230 people have been murdered in Los Cabos alone so far this year. (Representational image) More than 230 people have been murdered in Los Cabos alone so far this year. (Representational image)

Three men were shot dead on a busy beach in Mexico’s popular Los Cabos international tourist area where organised crime has surged in recent months. Prosecutors in Baja California Sur state said tourists sunning themselves on the beach and stunned locals were on hand when the deadly incident jolted Pamilla beach in San Jose del Cabo yesterday. “At the scene three men were found dead from bullet wounds,” prosecutors said in a statement. Two other people were wounded and taken to a local hospital.

Witnesses said tourists frantically started scrambling when shots rang out. “We heard the shots and just ran to get somewhere safe; it was automatic weapons fire,” said a tourist from Mexico City who would identify himself only as Jorge, fearing for his own safety.

Authorities evacuated the beach and started investigating with the Los Cabos Open tennis tournament under way in town. More than 230 people have been murdered in Los Cabos alone so far this year.

More than 186,000 people have been murdered and another 30,000 have gone missing in Mexico since 2006, when the government deployed the military to fight organised crime. Experts say the capture of the top drug cartel leaders has spawned numerous independent criminal groups that have moved beyond drug trafficking into robbery, kidnapping and extortion in areas they control.

Help my only child survive!,"Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org. Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org.

Every evening when Aadya watches children in the neighborhood play, my heart breaks. My daughter too was once an energetic presence rushing about. I know that Aadya longs to join them.

It started after Aadya’s second birthday. She got high fever and rashes all over. The local doctor called it skin allergy and prescribed medicines. The fever persisted, and we sought another medical opinion.

The diagnosis was devastating. B – Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia – a cancer that affects the immune system. Our only hope now lies in the contributions of caring strangers through ketto.org.

B – Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Big sounding medical terms that we knew nothing about, but by the look on the doctor’s face, clearly it was serious.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia affects, breaks down the body’s ability to fight diseases. The cancer starts in the bone marrow, where new blood cells grow. These cells grow very fast and the bone marrow’s capacity to make normal cells is reduced.

The doctor said Aadya needed treatment immediately, or else the cancer would spread. From March to December 2016, she was under the care of Dr. Shweta Bansal at the Sir H.N.Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre in Mumbai. Ten months is a long time for a grown person. To watch our only child suffer through so many blood tests and chemotherapy treatments was very painful and difficult.

After ten months, the treatment ended and we were full of hope that Aadya would begin to recover. Then just four months later, in April 2017, we got the terrible news that the leukemia had relapsed. Since then, Aadya has been visiting the hospital for chemotherapy and tests, every 15-30 days.

Today Aadya is three years old and it hurts us to see her childhood being taken away. She barely eats, feels tired and weak all the time, and gets bruised easily. Even the slightest exposure to infection can be dangerous so we mostly keep her at home. She has missed many days of school and plays indoors. Any exposure to dust is dangerous so we have to make sure that her clothes, food, and toys are kept dust-free at all times.

Aadya’s hope is a Bone Marrow Transplant, which costs a staggering Rs 25 lakh. We have started a fundraising page with ketto.org, counting on people’s sense of humanity to help us with this life-saving surgery.

So far we have spent Rs 15 lakh on Aadya’s chemotherapy treatments, medications, and hospital visits. I am a housewife and my husband earns Rs 25,000 working as a back office employee. We are completely dependent on his salary and had to raise the money for the treatment by taking loans, borrowing from family members and friends and through insurance. All that we have managed to raise until now has been used up in the treatment.

A Bone Marrow Transplant surgery will replace Aadya’s damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells, enabling her to lead a normal, healthy life. Her father is a matching and willing donor but we need to put together Rs 25 lakh in the next one month. We have no means of raising that kind of money.

For Aadya to survive, that operation has to be done in one month’s time. For over a year now, Aadya has been fighting a tough, long battle. Now there is hope that this operation will finally end her nightmare and lead to that one final miracle when we can take our baby home.

We have started a fundraising page with Ketto.org in Aadya’s name, in the hope that people will come forward and help us raise the funds for this surgery.

Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org.

Help us to bring Aadya home.

A federal climate report says the United States is already feeling the effects of climate change, with temperatures rising dramatically over the last four decades. That’s according to The New York Times, which acquired a draft copy of the report by scientists from 13 federal agencies. The report says extreme heat waves have become more common and extreme cold waves less common since the 1980s.

It says emissions of greenhouse gases will affect the degree to which global temperatures continue to rise a claim President Donald Trump and some members of his cabinet have disputed.

One scientist cited anonymously by the Times says he and other researchers are worried that the Trump administration, which must approve the report’s release, will suppress it.

"GST, surveillance post demonetisation to increase tax-GDP ratio, claims govt","The government has budgeted for over Rs 19.06 lakh crore from taxes in the current fiscal, a growth of about 15 per cent over the last fiscal. The government has budgeted for over Rs 19.06 lakh crore from taxes in the current fiscal, a growth of about 15 per cent over the last fiscal.

The implementation of GST and increased surveillance post demonetisation will help increase the tax-GDP ratio to 11.9 per cent by 2019-20, government said on Thursday. The gross tax-GDP ratio in 2017-18 is estimated to be around 11.3 per cent. In the Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement, tabled in the Lok Sabha, the finance ministry has projected that in the medium term tax revenues will show the growth anticipated during the presentation of the Budget.

“In other words it is felt that any shocks to tax collections due to the introduction of GST will be absorbed in the current financial year and hence the tax-GDP ratio will remain at the level of 2016-17,” it said.

The government has budgeted for over Rs 19.06 lakh crore from taxes in the current fiscal, a growth of about 15 per cent over the last fiscal. As per the statement, going forward “in the years 2018-19 and 2019-20 the gains from expansion of the tax base due to the introduction of GST and the increased surveillance post demonetisation will ensure that tax-GDP ratio will increase by 30 basis points”.

The tax-GDP ratios are projected to be 11.6 per cent in 2018-19 and 11.9 per cent in 2019-20 respectively, it said. Goods and Services Tax (GST) was rolled out from July 1 and it is estimated that the new indirect tax regime would add to revenues and boost GDP by about 2 per cent.

Besides, the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes have brought an additional over 1 crore people in the tax net. The tax department has launched operation clean money to detect people whose cash deposits post demonetisation does not match their tax profile.

Arkansas highway officials shut down westbound lanes of a cross country interstate for four hours so crews could pick up pizza. An 18 wheeler containing DiGiorno and Tombstone frozen pizzas scraped a bridge support and sliced open its trailer Wednesday, spilling them across Interstate 30 in front of the Arkansas Department of Transportation office.

Agency spokesman Danny Straessle said the bridge had only cosmetic damage. I-30 was closed for a time in both directions while crews picked up the DiGiorno and Tombstone brand pies. The highway, which goes around the south side of Little Rock, is part a major link that connects Dallas and points west to Memphis, Tennessee, and points north and east. There was no word on who missed out on pizza deliveries because of the accident.

Stage being set in AIADMK for merger of both factions in Tamil Nadu,"From left, Tamil Nadu CM E K Palaniswami, VK Sasikala, O pannerselvam and TTV Dinakaran. (File photo) From left, Tamil Nadu CM E K Palaniswami, VK Sasikala, O pannerselvam and TTV Dinakaran. (File photo)

Setting the stage for a possible merger of the two AIADMK factions, and the isolation of V K Sasikala’s family, the ruling group in Tamil Nadu led by Chief Minister E K Palaniswami Thursday said the appointment of T T V Dinakaran as the party’s deputy general secretary was “not acceptable”.

Challenging the decision by Sasikala to appoint her nephew Dinakaran to the post in February, hours before she was sent to a Bengaluru jail in a case of disproportionate assets, a resolution was signed by 27 office-bearers of the “EPS group”.

The move is being seen as a signal to the rebel group led by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, which had specified Dinakaran’s ouster as one of its main conditions for a merger.

Thursday’s resolution also stated that Dinakaran cannot hold any position in the party, according to its bylaws, since he had failed to maintain his primary membership for five years following his ouster by J Jayalalithaa, the party leader who died in December 2016.

Responding to the resolution, Dinakaran said, “Nobody can prevent me from discharging my duties. As party general secretary, Sasikala has all the powers to appoint or remove people from the party… The resolution was passed to prevent me from going on a statewide tour (from August 14). The ministers are afraid of it.”

Last week, Dinakaran returned to active politics and announced his decision to “strengthen” AIADMK by making 41 party appointments as deputy general secretary. The move came two months after he got bail in a case in which he was charged of trying to bribe Election Commission officials for the ownership of AIADMK’s “two-leaves” symbol in a bypoll necessitated by the death of Jayalalithaa.

On Thursday, Palaniswami cancelled the 41 appointments made by Dinakaran. The EPS group’s resolution did not, however, take any action against Sasikala, stating that her appointment was an “interim arrangement” made at a crucial juncture after Jayalalithaa’s death. Referring indirectly to her jail term, it said Sasikala could not function as general secretary due to “unfortunate” reasons.

Removing Sasikala and her family members from the party, and ordering a probe into Jayalalithaa’s death were the two key demands raised by the “OPS group”, which broke away to form a separate outfit, AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), in February.

“Without meeting the demands, there is no possibility for a merger,” said K P Munusamy, former minister and a leader in the OPS outfit.

Dinakaran’s camp, meanwhile, described the move by the Chief Minister’s group as “betrayal”. They also accused the ruling faction of playing into the hands of the BJP at the Centre.

Amid speculation that the BJP was “forcing” the merger to take control of the state government, Dinakaran aide and party organising secretary Nanjil Sampath said, “The resolution against Dinakaran was passed to please the Centre… If there is a crisis, he will choose the party first, not the government.”

Ministers Dindigul C Sreenivasan and K A Sengottaiyan were among those who did not sign the resolution.

In the evening, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam left for Delhi where they are expected to meet top BJP leaders besides attending other official functions.

If Dinakaran were to mobilise support — 37 MLAs were said to be backing him — it would endanger the Palaniswami government.

The Opposition DMK is watching the developments closely and may demand a special Assembly session to move a no-confidence motion or, as party sources said, may take some “extraordinary” decision to prove that the government has no majority.

“We will come to a decision after August 20 (six months since the last floor test on February 22). We will take extraordinary steps, unlike last time, to make sure that the state has a functioning government,” a DMK source said.

DMK leader M Subramaniam, a close aide of M K Stalin, told The Indian Express that the party did not want to topple this government. “But how long will they survive? This is not a stable government. Right now, the party has no plans to move a no-confidence motion. But the government is already dead, we are sure they will fully perish soon,” he said.

“If EPS revolts against Dinakaran one more time, then the government will fall,” said an MLA who met Dinakaran. “Today’s resolution did not even use the word expulsion. They want to convince BJP that they have taken some action against Dinakaran. Anyway, this is not going to help the party or the government,” the MLA said.

“Officially, EPS has 123 MLAs, just five more than the minimum number 118. But 37 support Dinakaran. Even if OPS and EPS camps merge, Palaniswami gets only 10 more MLAs,” the MLA said.

BJP national secretary H Raja said he did not wish to comment on claims that his party was trying to stabilise the situation. “All I can tell you is that we will do all that we can to end family politics (referring to Sasikala), which is detrimental to Tamil Nadu or any state,” he said.

"Govindan Lakshmanan out, but meets his idol Mo Farah","G Lakshmanan clocked a personal best of 13.35.69s in the heats. G Lakshmanan clocked a personal best of 13.35.69s in the heats.

G Lakshmanan arrived in London with two wishes to fulfill: meeting 5,000 and 10,000m World Champion Mo Farah, and eclipsing India’s 25-year-old 5k record. Despite clocking his personal best, Lakshmanan finished way off the national mark, but in the process got to run against Farah.

Lakshmanan, in the same heat as the Briton, managed to cross the finish line with a decent timing of 13:35.69s (previous personal best 13:36.62s) on Wednesday but it was not enough to take him through to the final. He finished 15th in his heat and 31st overall. Only the top five from each heats advanced automatically.

Incessant rain and chilly London weather did not help Lakshmanan’s cause. “Before the race could start my feet became numb due to the chill,” he said with a tone of disappointment.

But running alongside Farah, who finished second the heat with 13:30.18s on the clock, was more than enough consolation for the 27-year-old who trains under long – and middle distance coach Surender Singh. “We were sitting next to each other before the heats. But I did not want to disturb him and disrupt his focus. But right after the race I shook hands with him and wished him well for the final,” Lakshmanan said.

This was the stiffest challenge the Tamil Nadu athlete has faced in his career so far. At the Asian Championships in Bhubaneswar, his timing of 14.54.48s had earned him the gold by a distance and also a ticket to the Worlds. In his last competition before the London event, the Inter-State championship in Guntur, he clocked 14:07.76 and finished almost 13 seconds ahead of the silver medallist.

“Only after I qualified through the Asian Championships did I started thinking about running against such world-class runners. This really has been the toughest race I have ever run. I knew I had to catch up in the last lap, but I did not have enough steam left in me,” Lakshmanan said.

Now he will continue his pursuit of Bahadur Prasad’s national record (13:29.70s) set when he was just two. “ It is going to take a lot of effort. It’s not easy to add speed but I am going to get that record for sure.”

Mass deportation of Chinese from Fiji in fraud crackdown,"Representational Image Representational Image

Fiji has deported 77 Chinese nationals accused of running a phone and online scam targeting victims in mainland China, the latest in a series of overseas crackdowns orchestrated by Beijing. The mass arrest and expulsion was part of a month-long operation involving both Fijian and Chinese law enforcement agencies, and echoes similar joint operations carried out in Indonesia and Cambodia last week.

Cyber criminals targeting victims in China have increasingly exploited technological advances to operate from abroad in a bid to evade authorities. The Fiji-based ring is suspected of involvement in more than 50 telecom and online fraud cases, and cost victims in China more than six million yuan (US$892,000), Fijian police said Tuesday, without giving precise details of the scams.

“These 77 Chinese nationals have been sent back to China from Fiji on August 4, 2017,” the Fiji police and Chinese embassy in Suva said in a joint statement. The accused were flown to Changchun in northeast China’s Jilin Province.

China’s official Xinhua news agency said the scam came to light after one of the victims was swindled out of 1.3 million yuan and committed suicide, triggering a large-scale investigation. The probe exposed an illegal online gambling and lottery gang involving more than 200 suspects based in China, Indonesia and Fiji who had illegally taken nearly 100 million yuan.

A team of Chinese police were sent to Fiji four weeks ago and on July 18 they arrested the 77 suspects and confiscated equipment, including mobile phones, computers and bank cards. Another 83 people were arrested in China.

Beijing has become increasingly assertive in extraditing overseas fraud suspects. Last week, Indonesia deported 143 people, including 22 Taiwanese, to China over fraud cases, days after police said they had busted a sprawling US$450 million cyber fraud ring targeting wealthy businessmen and politicians in China.

The deportations drew a strong protest from Taiwan, which said the Taiwanese suspects should have been returned to the island. Taiwan’s representative office in Suva said it had been assured by Fiji police that the 77 deported from the South Pacific nation were all nationals of the People’s Republic of China. Also last week, Cambodia arrested more than 200 Chinese men and women suspected of running an online scam that persuaded victims to send nude photographs and then extorted them for cash, after a tip-off from Chinese authorities.

"Supreme Court refuses to quash NEET 2017, directs CBSE for common question papers in all languages in 2018","NEET 2017: Aspirants with their admit cards before a National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in Bhopal NEET 2017: Aspirants with their admit cards before a National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in Bhopal

The Supreme Court today observed that there should be a common question paper for the medical examination – NEET. Hearing a plea filed by a student over the difficulty level of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test, the apex court ruled that CBSE, conducting body, has to file an affidavit informing what mechanism they will opt for conducting the exam from next year.

A petition was filed last month by a group of students alleging that the difficulty level of question paper in eight vernacular languages is higher in comparison to English and Hindi. The petitioners contended the all-India ranking was given in the NEET exam which postulates that every candidate should get the identical question paper.

CBSE had already rejected that there were any variations in the question papers in a previous hearing.

The Supreme Court has also sought the data of candidates who cracked the entrance exam in vernacular language. The annexure, submitted by the CBSE today, states that in NEET 2017, 100152 aspirants appeared in the exam in the vernacular languages, of which 30817 have qualified. However, only one candidate has managed to score above 600 marks (out of 720) while under 501-600 marks category, 84 students have qualified. Read | NEET 2017 controversies, click here

CBSE compared the data with 2013’s exam when 21778 medical aspirants appeared in vernacular languages of which only 1 student scored marks under 501-600 while none could register above 601 marks.

NEET 2017 was held on May 7 and candidates appeared in Gujarati, Tamil and Bengali language complained over the difficulty level. Out of 11.35 lakh aspirants, nearly 6.11 lakh candidates have passed the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) 2017.

Dead whale found on bow of cruise ship entering Alaska port,"The Ketchikan Daily News reported the whale was about 20 feet long. The ship, with a capacity of 2,600 passengers and a crew of 1,150, was starting its third day of a 10-day round-trip cruise that originated in San Francisco. (Representational Image) The Ketchikan Daily News reported the whale was about 20 feet long. The ship, with a capacity of 2,600 passengers and a crew of 1,150, was starting its third day of a 10-day round-trip cruise that originated in San Francisco. (Representational Image)

A cruise ship reached an Alaska port with a surprise on its bow: the carcass of a humpback whale. The Grand Princess, a 949-foot (290-meter) ship in the Princess Cruises fleet, on Wednesday morning pulled into Ketchikan with the marine mammal lodged on its submerged, bulbous bow, a device designed to avoid wave-making.

Princess spokesman Brian O’Connor said the company was surprised and saddened to discover the whale. “It is unknown how or when this happened as the ship felt no impact,” he said in a statement. “It is also unknown, at this time, whether the whale was alive or already deceased before becoming lodged on the bow.”

Navigators, O’Connor said, spotted no whales near the ship as it sailed overnight toward Ketchikan, which is near the southern tip of the Alaska Panhandle just north of British Columbia. Photos indicated that the whale might be a juvenile. The Ketchikan Daily News reported the whale was about 20 feet long. The ship, with a capacity of 2,600 passengers and a crew of 1,150, was starting its third day of a 10-day round-trip cruise that originated in San Francisco. The Grand Princess was expected to leave Ketchikan later Wednesday.

The cruise line has a comprehensive whale avoidance program, O’Connor said. Ship crews have guidelines on how to operate after spotting whales and alter courses and reduce speed to avoid them. Ships must not approach within 100 yards (91 meters) of humpback whales and must limit observation time to 30 minutes, O’Connor said. Vessels near humpback whales are required to proceed at a “slow, safe speed” of 10 knots or below, he said.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is investigating the incident. Three distinct populations of humpbacks swim in Alaska waters, said Julie Speegle, NOAA Fisheries spokeswoman. The Western North Pacific population remains endangered. The Mexico population is listed as threatened and the Hawaii population is no longer listed. Whales from the three populations overlap in feeding grounds, Speegle said.

A necropsy was planned to determine the cause of death. Steve Corporon, Ketchikan director of ports and harbors, said a tugboat towed the whale 8 miles (13 kilometers) to Blank Inlet on Gravina Island for the procedure. It’s the second time in two years that a whale has been carried on the bow of a cruise ship into an Alaska port.

An endangered fin whale was spotted on the bulbous bow of Holland America’s Zaandam in May 2016 as it prepared to dock in Seward.

Army reservist Sam Kendricks wins pole vault gold at worlds,"United States’ Sam Kendricks makes an attempt in the men’s pole vault final during the World Athletics Championships (Source: AP) United States’ Sam Kendricks makes an attempt in the men’s pole vault final during the World Athletics Championships (Source: AP)

Sam Kendricks will soon step on the podium as a gold medalist and hear the only song he knows by heart – “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

“The anthem is something near and dear,” said the Army reservist and pole vault world champion. “I don’t know how I’m going to react.”

Things are definitely looking up for him these days. In March, Kendricks was promoted to first lieutenant.

On Tuesday, he went from bronze at the Olympics to gold at the world championships.

Kendricks edged Piotr Lisek of Poland and 2012 London Games champion Renaud Lavillenie of France by being remarkably consistent. Kendricks doesn’t use as long of a pole, which means he must use military precision to eke the most out of his game.

“I was the best jumper I can be on a shorter pole than everyone else. Tonight, it handed me my victory,” said Kendricks, who cleared 5.95 meters to earn the win.

Asked why he uses such a shorter pole, he shrugged: “Takes me less time to get to the bar – less time to make errors.”

A funny thing happened on his victory lap _ he went too fast and got a stitch in his side. He had nothing left to prove. But clearly, he prides himself in giving maximum effort at any time he’s out there.

This, after all, is fun and games. Kendricks’ stay in London will reach its high point Wednesday, when he receives the gold medal and the Stars and Stripes are raised in the stadium. A stark contrast from home, where his unit has been loading ships in South Carolina. He was given time off so he could compete.

“I’m glad I have a medal to show them,” said Kendricks, who trains in Mississippi and is coached by his father. “Being an officer is being on call when one of your soldiers needs you, and staying up to date with my personal fitness, and to be ready when my unit calls me.”

After his lap was complete, Kendricks carefully folded up the American flag and draped it over his shoulder, covering up the smaller flag on his jacket.

“Sometimes, the bigger flag is nicer,” he laughed.

Kendricks gave his flag from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics to his twin brother. This one is going to his girlfriend.

It was meticulously earned, too. Kendricks used a marker to jot down on his arm the takeoff points he wanted to hit during his run up to the pit. It worked, and he joins Brad Walker (Osaka, 2007) as the only American men to win a world pole vault title.

“We often considered ourselves the masters of the 1 percent,” Kendricks said. “How can an athlete like me, who’s not necessarily at the top of the world in anything, numbers-wise, how can I be at the top of the world in the pole vault?

“I can get a little bit better in everything, be a little more exact than I was the day before.”

He had to sweat it out, though, as Lavillenie raised the bar to 6.01 meters to go for the win.

“You have one champion and two other medalists,” said Lavillenie, who’s been dealing with injuries, “so that’s why I wanted to keep putting pressure on Sam to try 6.01.”

After the competition, Kendricks shared a moment with Lavillenie.

“I know no one is more dangerous than Renaud at this time in history,” Kendricks explained. “I said, ‘Good job, brother. We’ll have a good one next time. Now, let’s go get dinner.”’

"Anushka Sharma, Shilpa Shetty, Bhumi Pednekar: Who wore the cold shoulder dress better?","From L to R: Bhumi Pednekar, Shilpa Shetty and Anushka Sharma. (Source: Instagram/psbhumi, afashionistasdiaries, alliaalrufai) From L to R: Bhumi Pednekar, Shilpa Shetty and Anushka Sharma. (Source: Instagram/psbhumi, afashionistasdiaries, alliaalrufai)

It’s not just us, looks like fashion enthusiasts across the country are crushing on cold shoulder outfits. The trend which caught up with the Bollywood brigade earlier this year, is still going strong with regular sightings of the beauties taking the style in a cool new direction. We have a few favourites but the list is growing with each passing day. We will get to that later, but first let’s see how well Anushka Sharma, Shilpa Shetty and Bhumi Pednekar who were recently spotted embracing the trend wore it.

Anushka Sharma picked up a beautiful blue dress with mustard prints along the neckline, bodice, and hemline, from Ritu Kumar while promoting her upcoming film Jab Harry Met Sejal.

We would love to add this boho maxi dress to our wardrobe as it’s a lovely medley of styles and cuts – look at the high neckline and cold shoulder details, it’s just beautiful. She styled it well with a pair of tan heels from Aquazzura, gold hoops from Urban Outfitters, fresh face make-up and a crown braid hairdo.

Meanwhile, Shilpa Shetty was seen attending a party in a black cold shoulder and ruffle detail dress from &Other Stories. We love the gold heart prints and the beautiful fall of the outfit.

Her choice of accessories – gold Tribute heels from Yves Saint Laurent and a black Alexander McQueen clutch – added a nice touch to her look. She did good for herself.

However, Bhumi Pednekar’s styling did not impress us much. The green and black leopard print pleated hem dress from Michael Kors is pretty but we did not like the way she wore it with a broad belt.

We think she should have gone for a sleek one, probably in black and gold. The Toilet: Ek Prem Katha actor could have done better.

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

Poor rate of Basmati reduces cultivating area to half,"In 2014, the area under Basmati was 8.61 lakh hectares before it went down to 7.63 lakh hectares in 2015 and then again to 4.96 lakh hectares in 2016. In 2014, the area under Basmati was 8.61 lakh hectares before it went down to 7.63 lakh hectares in 2015 and then again to 4.96 lakh hectares in 2016.

THE POOR rate of Basmati (fine quality aromatic rice) which Punjab farmers have been getting for the past few years has resulted in reduced acreage and, in the past four years, the area of cultivation has decreased to nearly half under the crop. Scientists say that due to decrease in Basmati cultivation, the area under paddy rice (Parimal varieties) has increased automatically which is bad news for Punjab where 102 out of 141 agricultural blocks have already gone dry. This year, 29.26 lakh hectares were dedicated to rice cultivation in the state out of which close to 24.75 lakh hectares is under paddy (Parimal varieties) and nearly 4.5 lakh hectares under Basmati. Though Basmati is considered to be a major alternative to diverting area from paddy, the area is decreasing under it.

In 2014, the area under Basmati was 8.61 lakh hectares before it went down to 7.63 lakh hectares in 2015 and then again to 4.96 lakh hectares in 2016. “We could not go for Basmati due to downfall in the rates of the crop in the last three to four seasons as Basmati, which fetched around Rs 4,000-5,000 per quintal in 2013, the rate of the crop went down to Rs 2,000-3,000 per quintal in 2014, Rs 1,100-1,800 in 2015 and Rs 1,800-2,300 in 2016,” said Jugraj Singh, a Basmati grower of Madaran village in Jalandhar.

Though the rate of Basmati went up to around Rs 3,600 per quintal this April, farmers had already sold their crop by then and only traders reaped the benefit, said Satnam Singh, another farmer of Kapur village.

“Out of 29.26 lakh hectares area under rice cultivation, around 25 lakh hectares are under paddy rice which would be a big blow to our ground water as for growing one kilo paddy, we need at least 4,500 litres of water while half of the water is required to grow Basmati crop which is short duration and is sown in full rainy season requiring less groundwater,” said Block AgriculturalDevelopment Officer, Amrik Singh.

G S Mangat, senior rice breeder at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, said when the area under paddy is not decreasing, they are inventing short duration paddy varieties now so that groundwater could be saved as the new PR-126 variety of paddy takes around 123 days against the previous rice varieties which took 155-160 days. Punjab Agriculture Department Director J S Bains said due to poor rates of the cash crop in the past, farmers now do not want to take any risk and go for assured crops like paddy instead. More area under paddy is a cause of concern for underground water but farmers do need a secure market, he added.

Farmers said the government should fix the minimum support price (MSP) for Basmati so that they can also benefit from the fluctuation. They said currently there was no MSP and the rates are fluctuating but small farmers cannot hold the crop for long by waiting for rates to improve. Punjab needs to bring down its rice cultivation to nearly 17-18 lakh hectares against 29-30 lakh hectares at present, said experts.

"SIT nabs assistant inspector in Nagpur, 4th arrest in dummy candidate racket","Superintendent of Police Shankar Kengar, who is heading the SIT, said, “As per primary information, Parve is suspected to have appeared as a dummy for at least 15 candidates. Superintendent of Police Shankar Kengar, who is heading the SIT, said, “As per primary information, Parve is suspected to have appeared as a dummy for at least 15 candidates.

IN yet another startling development in the investigation into the statewide dummy candidate racket, a police officer has been arrested for acting as a ‘dummy’ — pretending to be the candidate — in several recruitment exams for government jobs. The arrested accused, Assistant Inspector Somnath Parve, is originally from Latur and is posted with Nagpur Police. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is probing the racket, had earlier arrested the alleged ringleader of the racket, Prabodh Rathod, a suspended government employee from Nanded who had appeared as a dummy for at least 10 candidates. The SIT had then arrested a Document Examiner of the CID and a police constable from the Economic Offences Wing of Nanded Police in connection with the racket. The SIT was formed in April after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis intervened in the matter.

Superintendent of Police Shankar Kengar, who is heading the SIT, said, “As per primary information, Parve is suspected to have appeared as a dummy for at least 15 candidates. He is part of the main group… and has been in close contact with Rathod since the beginning. He has been remanded to police custody for nine days.” A police officer said members of the racket used to decide which one of them would appear as the ‘dummy’ based on the looks, height and body type of the original candidate.

The SIT has been entrusted with the task of investigating 50 cases registered across Maharashtra, including 10 in Pune. As per the primary estimate by investigators, the number of cases in which dummy candidates are suspected to have appeared instead of the actual candidates — in the last two years — is over 400. Now, several recruitments in departments such as Police, Social Welfare, Government Secretariat, Agriculture and Women and Child Development are under the SIT’s scanner.

The racket had been revealed when Yogesh Jadhav, a 27-year-old political science graduate, had unearthed several cases of impersonation by filing Right to Information (RTI) applications, which led to a statewide probe by the CID SIT. Jadhav had started digging into the cases after he found that several youths had sold or mortgaged their ancestral property to pay a middleman, in order to get selected for a government job.

Donald Trump administration defends travel ban in US Supreme Court brief,"Trump said the order was necessary to review vetting procedures to help protect the country from terrorist attacks. Trump said the order was necessary to review vetting procedures to help protect the country from terrorist attacks.

President Donald Trump’s administration reiterated arguments defending its temporary travel ban in a filing with the US Supreme Court on Thursday, repeatedly citing the executive’s broad powers to exclude foreigners from the United States. The travel ban barring refugees and people from six Muslim-majority nations was signed as an executive order in March, after an earlier version had to be scrapped in the face of legal challenges.

Two federal appeals courts blocked the revised order from taking effect until the US Supreme Court ruled in June it could move forward on a limited basis. The nation’s highest court has agreed to hear oral arguments about the lawfulness of the ban on October 10, and the brief laid out the legal position the government plans to make.

The state of Hawaii and refugee organizations challenging the executive order claim it is discriminatory against Muslims, citing statements Trump made on the campaign trail calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” However, the government, hammering against a broad ruling by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked the ban, said campaign statements made by the president when he was a private citizen should not be taken into account.

The brief said it was a mistake to probe the president’s motives in decisions about national security, which would amount to inappropriate “judicial psychoanalysis” of the president. Trump said the order was necessary to review vetting procedures to help protect the country from terrorist attacks.

The Department of Justice argued the case would “invite impermissible intrusion on privileged internal Executive Branch deliberations” and that the plaintiffs in the case were calling for “up to 30 depositions of White House staff and Cabinet-level officials.” The government repeated its stance that Congress has granted the president wide authority to limit refugee admissions and bar the entry of any foreigner or group of foreigners if it would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”

The Supreme Court ruled parts of the revised March executive order could go into effect on June 29, finding that anyone from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with a “bona fide relationship” to a US citizen or entity could not be barred. However, the government excluded grandparents and other family members from the definition of who would be allowed in, leading to another round of legal sparring.

Eventually the Supreme Court said that, while litigation continues over enforcement of the ban in lower courts, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and siblings-in-law of people from the six countries would be let in but that refugees with relationships with US resettlement agencies would not.

Attorney Neal Katyal, who is representing Hawaii in its challenge to the ban, said in an email on Thursday: “We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case in October.”

"Rex Tillerson says US, Russia can settle problems, ease tension","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday he believes Washington and Russia can find a way to ease tension, saying it wouldn’t be useful to cut ties over the single issue of suspected Russian meddling in the U.S. election.

Tillerson said Russia had also expressed some willingness to resume talks about the crisis in Ukraine, where a 2015 ceasefire between Kiev’s forces and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country is regularly violated. “We should find places we can work together… In places we have differences we’re going to have to continue to find ways to address those,” Tillerson told reporters.

Tillerson met his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on the sidelines of an international gathering in Manila on Sunday, where he also asked about Moscow’s retaliation to new U.S. sanctions against Russia.

The meeting was their first since President Donald Trump reluctantly signed into law the sanctions that Russia said amounted to a full-scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties.

Lavrov on Sunday said he believed his U.S. colleagues were ready to continue dialogue with Moscow on complex issues despite tensions. Tillerson said he discussed Russia’s suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Lavrov to “help them understand how serious this incident had been and how seriously it damaged the relationship” between the two nations.

But Tillerson said that should not irreversibly damage ties. “The fact that we want to work with them on areas that are of serious national security interest to us, and at the same time having this extraordinary issue of mistrust that divides us, that is just what we in the diplomatic part of our relationship are required to do,” Tillerson said.

The United States sent its special representative on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to NATO, to Ukraine last month to assess the situation in the former Soviet republic.

Washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to improved relations between Russia and the United States.

“We appointed a special envoy to engage with Russia but also coordinating with all parties. This is full visibility to all parties. We are not trying to cut some kind of deal on the side,” Tillerson said.

She’s funny that way: How did Aditi Mittal become India’s most popular female stand-up comic?,"She’s got to say what she’s got to say: Mittal in Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say on Netflix. She’s got to say what she’s got to say: Mittal in Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say on Netflix.

There’s a technique to the slap,” says Aditi Mittal, turning in her chair so that she can demonstrate the physics of an on-screen slap. It’s almost like a magic trick, sound and action must be in sync, but most importantly, it’s got to look real. “I know these things because I got slapped by a cop once on CID,” she says, flipping her colourful hair back in slo-mo. Was it the all-knowing ACP Pradhyuman? “No, it was a female cop. I played one half of the college basketball team captains, Jinny and Johnny, who were accused of murdering Natasha, by electrocuting her on a basketball hoop, when she went in for the final slam dunk,” says Mittal, her fake smugness wiped off by a series of helpless chuckles.

Dressed in a vibrant multicoloured striped dress, Mittal, 31, is gearing up for a long day of press interviews at the Four Seasons hotel in Worli, Mumbai. In about two weeks, her hour-long comedy special, Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say, will debut on Netflix, making her the first Indian comedienne, and the second Indian comic after Vir Das’s Abroad Understanding, to have their own show on the international online streaming platform. Mittal is brimming with excitement, but is quick to interject when any talk of “making it big” comes up in the conversation. “I think my breakthrough will come when I’ll be able to be consistent — when I’m able to produce a second, third or fourth show, and demonstrate growth in it. I’m a product of being in the right place, at the right time, and working in a certain direction, in a certain way. I don’t ever want to feel like I’ve arrived. I’ve seen this happen to people where they stop growing because they think the smell of their farts is delicious,” she says.

Mittal is keeping it real, but it’s only because comedy wasn’t even on the radar of things she wanted to do. Seven years ago, the girl from Mahim had dreamt of performing for an audience — just not a live one.

If things had gone according to plan, Mittal, arguably India’s most recognisable female comic, would have liked to have wrapped herself in a blingy sari, apply frosted lipstick and a triangle-shaped sindoor on her forehead. Night after night, her face would have appeared on our TV screens at dinner time, not once but in three quick close-ups — zoom, zoom, zoom! In 2009, Mittal, then 25, had just returned to India after graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, USA, with degrees in Mass Communication and Theatre; and she promptly joined thousands of other aspiring actors in the merry-go-round that is the audition cycle in Mumbai.

“I used to wake up at 8 am, apply makeup, reach the first audition at 10, and stand in line for two-three hours to get a chance to be ‘the chick at the back of the bike’ for a battery advertisement. Or, for a soap that wanted to promote ‘natural beauty’. I’d sit there for six hours and then they’d pick three people who were six feet tall with perfect skin,” says Mittal, who auditioned everywhere she could for 18 months and only got a part in CID because her mother was the executive producer of the show.

The months after graduating from Fairleigh had been difficult. “I got a job after I graduated but thanks to the recession, I lost it quickly as well. I returned to Bombay and wasn’t getting any work in showbiz. That’s when comedy happened to me,” says Mittal. It was no incredible discovery, though, she’d always known she had a sense of humour, obviously inherited from her grandmother and mother. “I’ve been raised in a half Punjabi-half Sindhi home where the women were outspoken and sharp. I’m the younger child, I hear that’s a symptom too. I went to a girls’ boarding school in Pune, and we did cool things like start a band called the Cool Cats, even though we were awful. So, the ‘funny female’ is my narrative, and has always been,” she says.

Back in 2010, the comedy scene in Delhi and Mumbai was nascent, with only a handful of organisers such as the Bombay Elektrik Projekt (BEP), comedian and actor Vir Das, and the Cheese Monkey Mafia promoting new talent. “It was a very different time. There were no regular open mics, so I started with screenings of Def Comedy Jam (an American stand-up comedy series) to give people an idea of what stand-up was about,” says Sudeip Nair, founder, BEP. Nair later started The Hive and now runs The Cuckoo Club, a performing space in Bandra, and a popular open mic venue.

To combat the dreariness of auditioning for roles she’d never be cast in, Mittal began to frequent open mic events. “The first set I ever did was for Vir Das’s ‘Hamateur Nights’ in 2010. I cracked jokes about how Punjabi my father is. I was terrible, but I’m grateful to places like BEP because they offered a consistent platform. I kept working on my material and going back every other week to perform,” says Mittal. She joined fellow comics like Rohan Joshi, Tanmay Bhatt, Varun Thakur, Sahil Bulla, Sapan Verma and improv artiste Kaneez Surka who cut their teeth at open mic events, before taking their craft to Twitter, YouTube, and live shows.

“When I started doing comedy, I had elevated ideas about what it was all about — truth, and that comics must not misuse their power, be cruel and hurt those who are disenfranchised,” says Mittal, putting on a quasi-British accent for effect. She shakes her head and says, “But I see it happening in comedy all the time. So, I wanted to talk about things that are disturbing to me.”

If, to quote American humourist Mary Hirsch, “humour is a rubber sword — it allows you to make a point without drawing blood”, then does it matter who wields it? As Mittal and her fellow comediennes would find out, it sure does. “The Indian audience is not always prepared to hear from women. For example, they’ll need no encouragement to laugh about sex, but there’s a double standard involved when a woman cracks the joke,” says Neeti Palta, a Delhi-based comedienne who isn’t afraid to joke about how female foeticide has made standing in a women’s only line easier. “What sets Aditi apart is that she’s such a performer, she’s impossible to ignore. Confidence gets respected on stage, and Aditi has loads of it,” she says.

A funny woman is a dangerous thing — more dangerous than a woman who speaks her mind — because laughing with her somehow makes one complicit in the wrongs she’s taking a jab at. From Sarah Silverman to Ali Wong to Amy Schumer in the US, to Mittal, Palta, and Radhika Vaz (one of the first women to do stand-up in the subcontinent) in India, female comics spare no one — not even themselves. “One of the early sets I used to do was about how fat I am, and how there is no euphemism for fat girls, as opposed to fat boys who get called ‘teddy bear’. Sometimes, people don’t even allude to his size and just say that he’s got a ‘heart of gold’. They don’t say that for women, do they?” says Mittal. In her live shows, while she may begin with low-hanging fruits such as community differences and the battle of the sexes, Mittal’s jokes include segments on musical eve teasing on the streets, sanitary pads, gender discrimination in the advertising industry, products such as vaginal tightening creams.

Sometimes, Mittal uses comedy to highlight sombre issues as well. The transition is well-executed and the original joke remains undiluted by the serious turn it has taken.

In Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say, she combines the best of her work over the past few years in an hour-long feature. “I’d been in talks with Netflix for a year and in December, the deal came through. I’ve compiled a bunch of old jokes and pepped them up in the show. That was the best part of Netflix: they didn’t make demands on me. I have slaved my ass off for so long and I didn’t want to have to do things just to prove that I can do this,” says Mittal.

Stand-up is storytelling live, and on stage, Mittal is funny, charming, energetic and bold. She jumps from topic to topic, and is one of the few women to display a natural ability for physical comedy. Not all her jokes have a punchline — Mittal often uses her face to make a comical expression, signalling the end of a joke — but the take-home is almost always the subtext: in a man’s world, if a woman must work twice as hard for everything, the only way she can survive is by laughing twice as louder.

Her themes are not unique to Mittal; most comediennes in India take on the patriarchy, exposing the inherent sexism and misogyny in Indian culture. In a conversation with Daniel Fernandes on his comedy podcast You Started It, Mittal says, “I’m more often a ‘bitch’ when I’m being sarcastic, than a fellow dude comic who gets ‘Arre, kya joke maara, kya insightful, incisive’…Hello, where’s my ‘insightful, incisive’?”

Sometimes, Mittal uses comedy to highlight sombre issues as well. In one of her recent sets, she talks about bra shopping in India — an embarrassing experience that almost always involves a man called Chhotu scientifically measuring cup sizes with a single look; or going to a high-end store to buy a brand called Enchanté, which, as Mittal says, “is pronounced three thousand rupees”. Towards the end, she talks about breast cancer awareness — the transition is well-executed and effortless, and the original joke remains undiluted by the serious turn the conversation has taken.

Mittal has previously spoken about how, given the skewed ratio of male comics to female comics, a brotherhood has emerged in the Indian stand-up landscape, leaving women comics to work in spaces that don’t necessarily invest in them. “After seven years of performing consistently and making a living off it, I don’t care. It’s only in the last year or so, I’ve been able to make some money from comedy and pay rent, bills and have savings. Doing comedy or the Netflix show is not a ‘eff you’ to anybody — I’m just living my life,” says Mittal.

It is a stormy night, but all the seats at the Independence Brewing Company in Andheri West are taken. On the day Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say premieres on Netflix, Mittal performs a trial run of Global Village Idiot, a brand new show written for her debut performance at the 2017 Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. She will be on stage for 26 nights in August, before heading to London for a few shows in October.

Armed with a red binder, Mittal cautions the audience that this is a work in progress and they’re free to leave when they want. “I wrote ‘Trial’ for a reason, this set is for the goras, okay,” she says. There’s an easy vibe in the room, as Mittal begins. Some of the jokes work, others don’t quite hit the spot; Mittal quickly makes notes in her binder. The whole event acts as a group effort between the comedienne and her audience to make sure our desi girl puts her best foot forward at the Fringe.

Sadly, it won’t be possible for Dr Mrs Lutchuke to make the trip to Blighty —Mittal’s alter-ego of a slightly hunchbacked, middle-aged “psychologist-sexologist-fekulogist” who offers sex education is far too Indian for the West. “Lutchuke is a combination of my first Marathi teacher and my best friend’s grandmother. By giving her an accent and dressing her up in a sari, I can create a distance between myself and the character,” says Mittal, who wanted to joke about sex but was very uncomfortable when she started out. “There are older women everywhere who command more respect and have more authority. So, I was very drawn to playing an older woman,” says Mittal. Lutchuke’s side-splitting advice include telling men not to stress about the direction their penis points at because “it has to go into one place only”; or how being touched by a man does not make another man gay because “beta, if you touch the biryani, do you become the biryani?”

“Somebody recently asked me why I’m talking about ‘bold’ things. Comedy is a potent weapon, so shouldn’t we be using it to talk about potent things as well?” says Mittal. So, is there any subject that is untouchable for a comic? “I don’t think so,” says Mittal. What about rape jokes, since they are a known taboo in comedy? “You have to examine a joke in the context that it is cracked, because 90 per cent of the joke is context. When you talk about people who talk about what women should wear in order to avoid rape, or somebody saying that chowmein is an aphrodisiac, then you’re punching up. At the end of the day, it is still a rape joke, but who is the target now?” says Mittal.

The early reviews of her Netflix show have been trickling in as we chat. Some of the responses praise her “flair for self-deprecating humour”; others rue the lack of new material. “If the reviewers have seen my shows before, that’s fine. This is my first Netflix show and I put the best of my material out there, that was my aim. I’m not averse to criticism. I want to entertain people, but comedy has represented too many wonderful things to me for the criticism to constantly matter. I don’t care so much about having the last laugh, you know? I just want to start a conversation,” she says.

"North Korea poses grave and growing threat: Donald Trump, Moon Jae-In","US President Donald Trump with South Korean President Moon Jae. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) US President Donald Trump with South Korean President Moon Jae. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)

US President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-In today agreed that North Korea poses a “grave and growing direct threat” to most of the world as the two leaders in a telephone call welcomed the new sanctions imposed on Pyongyang by the UNSC. The phone call comes a day after the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to increase sanctions on North Korea for its continued intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing and violations of UN resolutions.

They discussed North Korea’s July 28 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the White House said. “The two leaders affirmed that North Korea poses a grave and growing direct threat to the United States, South Korea, and Japan, as well as to most countries around the world,” the White House said in a statement. Trump and Moon welcomed the new United Nations Security Council resolution that targets North Korea’s primary exports, including coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood. The sanctions also target other revenue streams, such as banks and joint ventures with foreign companies.

“President Trump and President Moon welcomed the new United Nations Security Council resolution that unanimously passed 15-0. The leaders committed to fully implement all relevant resolutions and to urge the international community to do so as well,” the White House added. After the phone call, Trump reiterated on Twitter that he is “very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.”

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met his South Korean counterpart Kang Kyung-wha in Manila yesterday, the State Department said. The US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said that it is time for Pyongyang to realise that the US is “not playing anymore”. “It is time for North Korea to realise, we are not playing anymore,” Haley told Fox News in an interview.

The UN Security Council sanctions sends a strong message in this regard, she said. “A third of their trade exports have been hit, and we basically gave them a kick in the gut with a billion dollars of sanctions that they are going to begin to feel right away,” Haley said.

H-1B visa restriction may affect US IT production: Report,"The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. (Representational image) The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. (Representational image)

The restrictions on H-1B visa programme will lead to the Information Technology (IT) sector in the US lose its competitive edge in the market. A top American think-tank said that US IT sector will find it difficult to attract open talents from India and America, PTI reported.

The Center for Global Development (CGD) in a report titled ‘The IT Boom and Other Unintended Consequences of Chasing the American Dream’ said that H-1B visa is advantageous for both India and the US. Gaurav Khanna, fellow at the CGD and co-author of the research paper, said, “It is really important to make sure that the I-T sectors from both countries are allowed to attract the right kind of people, because they really allow for innovation and growth in both the countries.”

The report gives a detailed description of how the H-1B visa programme affects the economies of the both the US and India. Khanna told PTI, “Both the economies have really benefited from the H-1B programme.” He also warned that the IT companies might look for other options and move to Canada if the H-1B clampdown will happen. He said, “What our paper is really trying to stress, is that on average the US is better off because of the H-1B programme. So clamping down on the H-1B programme will basically not allow the US IT sector to attract the open talent from places like India. The US might then lose its competitive edge in IT production.”

He added, “If you think about what happens in India, you know the prospect of migrating to the US and earning such a high wage …it seemed they really encouraged certain students and workers to acquire skills that would be valued by the H-1B programme.”

The research report examines the relationship between migration and the outsourcing of IT production to India since the early 2000s and says that because of the H-1B programme, US workers are on average better off by about $431 million or $1,345 per additional migrant in 2010. It also includes crucial mechanisms like innovation by businesses, trade with other countries, and the choices made by students and workers to become computer scientists, a PTI report said.

The research also helped to know that the overall productivity is benefitted due to better technology, as a by-product of this immigration of tech workers. Khanna said, “The average worker in each country is better off because of immigration, and US native workers have made big gains because of the H-1B visa programme. Yes, there may be things that can be done to blunt distributional impacts that affect a subset of workers, but overall, this policy has been a net-positive for the US economy and workers.”

“Together, the brain-gain to India under the H-1B programme outweighs any brain-drain,” the report said. Khanna said that the increase in IT sector productivity allowed India to eventually go ahead of the US in software export because of the additional knowledge and skills that the workers learned in US before the expiry of the visas.

The H-1B visa is an employment-based and non-immigrant visa category for temporary workers. It permits US companies to temporarily recruit foreign workers. Indian IT giants like TCS, Infosys and Wipro are among the major beneficiaries of this programme.

Just right for kids: Life’s Like That,"Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls

Book name: Good Night Stories For Rebel Girls

Author: Elena Favilli & Francesca Cavallo

Publisher: Particular Books

Pages: 212

Price: Rs 799

Appropriate for: 8+

A game of How to Spot Gender Stereotyping in Everyday Life was never considered an essential sport for young people, possibly because there’s little hope of redemption in a world that likes its little women colour-coded and organised in various shades of docility, thank you very much. An initial $1 million Kickstarter campaign encouraged authors Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo to counter stereotyping with this delightful anti-princess book of modern fairy tales that tells its young readers to “Dream bigger, aim higher fight harder. And, when in doubt, remember, you are right.”

Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls puts together the inspiring stories of 100 women who went against the grain to lead the lives they wanted. From mathematician Ada Lovelace to the partially-sighted Cuban ballerina Alicia Alonso, from tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams to warrior queen Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi, there is an interesting and representative mix of ethnicities, nationalities and eras from which these women are chosen. The production quality is excellent as is the extremely well-curated collection of illustrations, sourced from artists across the world.

There are a couple of minor gripes — the perseverance of PV Sindhu or Dipa Karmakar make for as fascinating a story as that of Rani Lakshmi Bai when it comes to India, and, leaving out JK Rowling from the pantheon seems a bit of a travesty. But these are fairy tales that need to be added to, to be debated over and to be treasured because it tells its readers — boys and girls both, hurrah — that to choose your own happily ever after, all you need is yourself.

Book name: Looking for the Rainbow: My Years with Daddy

Author: Ruskin Bond

Publisher: Puffin Books

Pages: 110

Price: Rs 250

Appropriate for: 8+

“When we are small, we need someone to hold our hand in the dark,” writes Ruskin Bond, flaneur to generations of Indian readers, in this slim memoir, a tribute to his father, Aubrey Bond, an officer in the Codes and Ciphers section of the Royal Air Force in the early 1940s. In the time following the separation of his parents, the young Bond is sent off to Delhi to be with his father. Freed from the tyranny of boarding school, it is a summer of many firsts for the young boy. Delhi, far from the urban sprawl that it is today, was a place of wonder for the boy from the hills. Over cinema, books, music, long walks and lots of tea with condensed milk, he would come to share a bond of deep trust and affection with his father, make friends and learn lessons of a lifetime.

But, unknown to him, this is also to be a period of brief reprieve for Bond. The world outside is changing faster than an eight-year-old’s imagination — World War II is nearing its bitter end and the struggle for Independence intensifying in India. Soon, he will return to boarding school in Simla and his father posted to Calcutta. And then, one fine day, in the middle of a marathon, he will be summoned by his teacher to be given the news that will break his young heart: his father was no more.

Paired with Mihir Joglekar’s endearing illustrations, this poignant memoir, Bond’s first for children, looks back at the most treasured relationship of his life with disarming candour, customary wit and a complete absence of bitterness.

Book name: Boo! When My Sister Died

Author: Richa Jha & Gautam Benegal

Publisher: Pickle Yolk Books

Pages: 40

Price: Rs 450

Appropriate for: 5+

If death is bewildering for grown-ups, how can children face up to it? Learning to deal with loss is never easy, but children’s literature in particular, rarely deals with the inevitability of death or coming to terms with grief. Over the last few years, however, a bunch of thoughtful picture books such as Oliver Jeffers’s The Heart and the Bottle and Rebecca Cobb’s Missing Mommy have explored the void created by the death of a loved one. Indian picture books, however, have rarely ventured into this zone, barring a few stray forays like My Grandfather Aajoba by Taruja Parande.

In the years since Richa Jha launched her independent publishing house Pickle Yolk Books, she has put together a small but well-curated list of books dealing with diversity, differences and now, death. Her new book is the story of Noorie, who has lost her sister Zoya, but finds herself unprepared for the overwhelming void it opens up in her life. She watches over her mother and her pet, Bruno, scared that they would leave her, too, frequents their favourite haunts where Zoya’s presence still lingers in the air. But, most of all, she is overcome by anger at her sister’s disappearance; at the overtures of Zoya’s best friend Dhara to draw her out, and, at her mother’s insistence that Zoya would always be a part of their lives.

Gautam Benegal’s evocative illustrations are the highlight of this beautiful volume. He captures Zoya’s disorientation and the messy nature of grief with great subtlety, aided in no small part by Jha’s economy of words and quiet understanding of the hollowness that loss engenders.

Book name: This Truck Has Got to be Special

Author: Anjum Rana

Publisher: Tara Books

Pages: 56

Price: Rs 550

Appropriate for: 13+

When Chinar Gul, a Pakistani truck driver from the Swat Valley, finally acquires the truck that he has driven for the last five years, he takes it to his friend, truck artist Zarrar in Taxila, for a makeover. As Zarrar gets to work, Gul, who drives along the scenic mountain roads of the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush, looks back at his humble beginnings as a cleaner and the many journeys he has undertaken since that have shaped him as an individual.

Gul’s reminiscences take the reader on trips along the Grand Trunk Road “that runs all the way from Karachi in the south to Kabul in the north-west”, stopping by the Kabul and Indus rivers for a spot of fishing or a quick shuteye at the dhabas around the bends. He travels along the “Roof of the World”, the Pakistan-China road that leads from Kashgar in China’s Xinjiang to Abbottabad in Pakistan, infamous as the last hideout of Osama bin Laden. Pakistani writer and truck art entrepreneur Rana’s narrative is tightly focused on the landscape and the lives of those who ply along these routes. But alongside, she also offers an exposition on South Asia’s rich history of truck art that combines calligraphy, painting and metal work to give the lumbering vehicles a colourful, distinctive look.

As is the nature of Tara publications, this collaboration between Rana, truck artists Hakeem Nawaz and Amer Khan and Indian illustrator Sameer Kulavoor offers a syncretic work that is both a celebration of and a tribute to the rich imagination and craftsmanship that contribute to the vibrancy of truck art.

Book name: Eighteen Tides and a Tiger

Author: Anjana Basu

Publisher: TERI

Pages: 140

Price: Rs 250

Appropriate for: 12+

Kolkata-based author Anjana Basu’s third novel in her Jim Corbett series takes a young adult Rohan to the Sunderbans on his first internship with the forest department. It’s a forest unlike anything Rohan has ever seen, familiar as he is with those in the Kumaon region, the land of “dry-footed” tigers. Out here in the Gangetic delta, amphibious tigers climb trees, the evil spirit of Dakhin Rai lures unsuspecting villagers to maneaters and the spirit of Bonbibi, benevolent deity and protector of the tigers, looms large over the mangrove forests. Rohan’s visit is not short of adventures, particularly when he finds himself stranded ashore after a foolhardy stroll in the forest. There are also tigers aplenty, rescue missions, and, a mysterious little girl who appears in times of distress.

One of the reasons why such books are important is because they serve as handy introductions to our unique ecosystems and give an insight into the need to maintain environmental balance. Tiger conservation, in particular, has received overwhelming publicity and support. Perhaps, if the same could be extended to other environmental causes, there would be a less foolhardy generation who will treat their environment with the respect it deserves.

Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg says sexual harassers should lose their jobs,"In her interview, Sandberg states that it makes her happy when people who indulge in harassment at the workplace get due punishment (Image Source: Bloomberg) In her interview, Sandberg states that it makes her happy when people who indulge in harassment at the workplace get due punishment (Image Source: Bloomberg)

Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said no one should have to go to work fearing sexual harassment, and one way to eliminate that fear is for companies to have a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior.

“I think it’s great when people lose their jobs when it happens, because I think that is what will get people to not do it in the future,” Sandberg said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “And I think this is a leadership challenge. As a leader of a company, there needs to be no tolerance for it.”

Sandberg, one of the technology industry’s highest-profile female executives, spoke out as Silicon Valley grapples with an increasing number of harassment scandals — leading to the firings of venture capitalists and executives at Uber and other companies. “It’s abominable that it still exists in this day and age,” Sandberg said — though she added that it doesn’t mean the companies involved are beyond saving. Uber, which came under fire for a culture that some say failed to punish discrimination and harassment, is currently searching for a new chief executive officer after its board ousted co-founder Travis Kalanick. While Sandberg doesn’t want the top job at the ride-hailing company, she had advice for whoever takes it.

“People respond to what’s tolerated and what’s encouraged,” she said. “And I think a great leader can change the culture of I think almost any company in almost any situation. You put in new policies, you have new procedures, your language is different; I’m always optimistic.” Sandberg, who built up Facebook’s advertising business, is also known as an advocate for women in the workplace after writing her bestselling 2013 book, “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.” Uber has been searching for someone like Sandberg, who can bring the company out of its “bro” culture while building an influential and successful business.

Sandberg spoke before a controversy over women in tech emerged at Google, her former employer. A software engineer posted a memo that decried the search giant’s efforts to diversify its workforce, saying that biological differences between men and women are partially responsible for the dearth of women in tech roles. The memo set off a heated debate both internally and outside the company that led Google to fire the author on Monday.

Earlier that day, as the debate over the memo unfolded, Sandberg did respond to the issue with a post on Facebook that read, “Inequality in tech isn’t due to gender differences. It’s due to cultural stereotypes that persist. We all need to do more.”

"Donald Trump looks to loyal voters as support slips, agenda stalls","US President Donald Trump (AP Photo) US President Donald Trump (AP Photo)

After six months of infighting, investigations and legislative failures, President Donald Trump is trying to combat new signs of weakness in his Republican base and re-energize his staunchest supporters. White House officials have been urging the president to refocus on immigration and other issues that resonate with the conservatives, evangelicals and working-class whites who propelled him to the Oval Office. The president has ramped up his media-bashing via Twitter, long a successful tactic for Trump, and staged rallies hoping to marshal his base to his defense.

The effort underscores Trump’s shaky political positioning not yet seven months into his presidency. Trump has remained deeply unpopular among Democrats, and there are signs that his support among Republicans may be softening. His advisers are aware that a serious slip in support among his core voters could jeopardize hopes for a major, early legislative accomplishment and would certainly increase Republicans’ worries about his re-election prospects.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway acknowledged the concerns Sunday on ABC, saying the president’s approval rating “among Republicans and conservatives and Trump voters is down slightly.”

“It needs to go up,” she said. In a Monday morning tweet, Trump dismissed his adviser’s statement. “The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before,” he wrote on Twitter. He later insisted that his support “will never change!”

But polling doesn’t support Trump’s claim. A recent Quinnipiac University survey showed the president’s approval dipping into negative territory among whites without college degrees _ a key group of supporters for the president. The percentage of Republicans who strongly approve of his performance also fell, with just over half of Republicans saying they strongly approved of Trump. That’s down from the two-thirds of Republicans who strongly approved of the president’s performance in June.

Just one-third of all Americans approved of his job performance, a new low in the poll.

The president’s struggles already have prompted public speculation about his political future. The White House pushed back angrily Sunday against a New York Times report about Republicans preparing for 2020 presidential race that may not include Trump. The report described Vice President Mike Pence as laying groundwork in case Trump does not run. Pence called the report “disgraceful.”

The chatter has been fueled by Trump’s unsuccessful attempt to shepherd health care legislation through Congress, the drip-drip of revelations about his associates’ ties to Russia and the churn of turnover and turmoil at the White House. The president’s advisers have tried to drown out the bad news by focusing on his agenda.

“They are telling him just enact your program,” Conway said of the president’s base. “Don’t worry about a Congress that isn’t supporting legislation to get big ticket items done. And don’t worry about all the distractions and diversions and discouragement that others, who are trying to throw logs in your path, are throwing your way.”

In a televised event at the White House last week, the president endorsed legislation that would dramatically reduce legal immigration to the United States. The bill is unlikely to ever become law, but that mattered little to Trump’s advisers. Their barometer for success was the reaction from conservatives like commentator Ann Coulter, who called the White House’s embrace of the controversial legislation “the best moment of the Trump presidency since the inauguration.”

Immigration is expected to continue being a focus for Trump in the coming weeks, including a push for the border wall. Officials also are weighing a more public role for White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, a favorite of Trump backers whose hard-line immigration policies irritate some congressional Republicans.

The appointment of White House chief of staff John Kelly also fits in to that effort. While Kelly was brought in primarily to bring much-needed discipline to the West Wing, officials note that he, too, is viewed favorably by some Trump loyalists for his early execution of the administration’s immigration policy as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Kelly’s appointment was particularly welcomed by senior strategist Steve Bannon, who has taken on the task of ensuring Trump doesn’t drift from the promises he made to his base during the campaign.

Several White House officials and Trump advisers insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the ways the administration is moving to shore up support for the president.

Like Trump’s embrace of the legislation curtailing legal immigration, some of what the president has to offer his core supporters is more show than substance. In late July, Trump announced on Twitter that he was banning transgender people serving in the military a policy shift sought by social conservatives despite the fact that the Pentagon had no plans in place to enact the change. The policy is now being crafted.

Alice Stewart, a conservative who worked for the presidential campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, said Trump is right to make overtures toward his coalition of loyal supporters, even if some of his moves are incomplete.

“I think people realize half a loaf is better than none,” Stewart said.

Mitch Harper, a former GOP state legislator and Republican activist in Indiana, said Trump will get credit from conservatives even for partial measures simply because he is “articulating things that they have not heard anyone articulate in a long time.”

And what about the results? Harper said Trump supporters “are willing to wait.”

Indeed, even some of Trump’s advisers still marvel at the loyalty of the president’s supporters. For now, conservatives are pinning the blame on Washington’s failure to get health care done not on Trump, but on the handful of Republican senators who blocked legislation aimed at overhauling “Obamacare.”

“I think on health care the president is viewed as someone who did everything they could,” said Matt Schlapp, who heads the American Conservative Union.

Alexis Sanchez to miss Arsenal’s Premier League start,"Alexis Sanchez has been linked with Barcelona and PSG. (Source: Reuters) Alexis Sanchez has been linked with Barcelona and PSG. (Source: Reuters)

Alexis Sanchez will miss at least the first two games of the Premier League season with Arsenal with the Chilean yet to fully recover from injury plaguing him rather than the heavy amount of rumours that have linked him out of the Emirates. His future at the club has been under question with the player himself not clearing the air on his status at Arsenal. He has been linked with Spanish club Barcelona and French club Paris Saint-Germain who are looking to bolster their lines following the arrival of Neymar.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had said on Wednesday that Sanchez sustained an abdominal strain on Sunday – hours before Arsenal’s penalty shoot out win over Chelsea in the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium – and will be out for “two weeks or one more week.”

Sanchez’s future has been linked outside of the Emirates following Arsenal’s failure to finish inside the top-four of Premier League thus failing to qualify for the UEFA Champions League. Wenger, meanwhile, has strictly maintained that Sanchez is not for sale. The Frenchman didn’t clarify whether any bids had come in for Sanchez. “I can’t tell you that at the moment,” he said. “I just think we are not open – what I said to you many times – to any offers, anyway.”

Sanchez hasn’t played since featuring, for Chile, in the Confederations Cup final in Russia where they went on to lose to Germany. Due to a lengthy season, he was allowed longer time to recover and extended holiday break. His initial return to training was delayed by three days, with the club saying he was ill, and now he is injured.

Wenger said he wouldn’t have played the season opener, against Leicester City at home, even if he was fit. “We have all the other players prepared in pre-season and they are all ready,” said Wenger.

This valuable collection explores the complexities, future directions and reasons for the ‘weak record in human development’ of the world’s third largest higher education system. The introduction sets the ball rolling through an excellent historical as well as contemporary account. Particularly notable is the focus on quality, access, financing and internationalisation.

Apoorvanand Jha’s fascinating and personalised account of higher education in Bihar might be understood as a heart-rending marsiya (lament): there is fervour, sacrifice, effort and, inevitably, tragedy. The chapter points to the significance of social and political contexts — caste, destructive student politics, etc — that make or unmake institutions. His story is also one of the social death of provincial towns. Sachi Hatikenaka’s contribution addresses the quality problem through exploring the case for multidisciplinary research universities. Rigorous research capacity should be at the heart of developing institutions that are able to engage with the real problems of India. However, it remains to be seen whether our decision makers are willing to accept the advice that this doesn’t simply mean producing more PhDs and there ought to be a focus upon creating ‘elite’ institutions that serve as exemplars.

It is the ‘elite’ stigma of vocationalisation that engages Manish Sabharwal and Srinivasan Kannan. They suggest that a genuine interest in human welfare should mean a well-designed and adequately-resourced vocationalised university system. The degraded system we currently have has proved ineffective as a tool for social mobility for the majority. Greater emphasis on vocational skills and qualifications, they argue, holds significant potential to address the needs of some of the most marginalised sections of the population, such as workers in the unorganised sector.

Useful education for the marginalised also concerns the chapter by Megha Agarwal on the state’s focus on skills development schemes. An effective skills development training system, Agarwal rightly argues, holds significant potential to shift many from the vast informal sector to formal one. The chapter focuses on government initiatives and provides a comprehensive account of the various kinds of scheme and organisations involved in the skills endeavour. Tellingly, the word ‘quality’ finds recurring mention. I counted at least 16 instances.

Jeemol Unni and Sudipa Sarkar explore the ‘demand’ side of educational qualifications, that is, the view from the employers’ side. The authors map India’s occupational landscape and suggest that the demand for those with higher education qualifications has increased in many occupations (the service sector, for example). The article makes an implicit case for higher education of the kind that employers demand. But, how to ensure that students gain access to the best quality higher education in an era of declining state funding for state institutions? KP Krishnan’s contribution suggests that student loans schemes overseen by the state — hence ensuring adequate attention to issues of access and equity — ought to be explored. This will involve a shift from financing institutions to financing students.

In their nuanced reading of legal cases involving higher education over the past six decades, Devesh Kapur and Madhav Khosla’s chapter dwells upon the key aspects and changes that characterise the sector. These include internal governance, changing roles of state and central governments, commercialisation, ideas of ‘profiteering’ and judges’ moral commentaries on private institutions. Importantly, they suggest that poorly thought-out legal judgements have added to the woes of the sector. External governance also concerns Pankaj Chandra’s contribution on relationships between the university and the state. He puts forward specific reasons for the inadequacy of the existing governance mechanisms within universities as well as suggestions for re-designing relations between academia and the state for delivering better outcomes. In many ways, this collection marks a departure on the topic in as much as it engages with the issue of making higher education accountable to the needs of the majority, and, offers concrete suggestions for repairing a broken system. I suspect that many of the perspectives will not be popular with those concerned with the existing public university system. Notwithstanding that, that creature certainly requires serious scrutiny.

Jaipur Pink Panthers hold off Puneri Paltan for first win of the season,"Pink Panthers were saved only by the fact that the clock stops ticking after the 40th minute. Pink Panthers were saved only by the fact that the clock stops ticking after the 40th minute.

“Our coach makes all the strategies,” said Jaipur Pink Panthers captain Manjeet Chillar with a beaming Balwan Singh sitting beside him, “He has been a great player for the country and has also been associated with the national team for a long time now. Whatever he says, we follow.” On Thursday, those strategies came to fruition for the Pink Panthers. They took a stranglehold on their match against Puneri Paltan, unbeaten till then this season, and never let go. It was their first win of the season and the score was 28-30. Chillar, was a tour de force in the team’s defence, managing seven tackle points out of his total of nine.

But the Pink Panthers were saved only by the fact that the clock stops ticking after the 40th minute. For Puneri Paltan were on their way back in the latter stages of the second half. The first stage of this attempted comeback was almost single handedly championed by Sandeep Narwal. He managed a Super Raid in the 10th minute of the second half and then takes a point in his next to bring Jaipur on the brink of an all out.

But Jaipur held their own, Manjeet Chillar led a depleted defence to take as many points as possible and soon, they were ahead by seven points. On the other end, Deepak Niwas Hooda and Rajesh Mondal, who were the architects of their win against Bengaluru Bulls last week, were unable to make an impact. Hooda was forthcoming about it. “I do take responsibility for this loss,” he said in the post match press conference, “Their defence was good today, but I also made a lot of mistakes today.”

The second comeback came in the next, and the last, five minutes of the match. This time, though, it was more of a team effort with Rohit Kumar Choudary managing successful raids and the defence acting up. Soon, they reduced the seven point gap to three and in the last seconds of the match, Sandeep Narwal went in to raid. He had both his hands outstretched. Two raiders remained in the Jaipur half and both kept their distance. He still managed a point, but it was not enough. The final whistle blared and Puneti Paltan remained two points behind, agonisingly close to becoming the only team other than Patna Pirates to have won their first three matches this season.

"Gujarat: Nitin Patel finished second and now, a ‘cold war’ brews","State Minister Nitin Patel. (File Photo) State Minister Nitin Patel. (File Photo)

For the Gujarat BJP, appointing a deputy chief minister was unprecedented. But ,the manner in which Nitin Patel got the post last August, spoke a great deal about the machinations that go on in the BJP. His announcement as Rupani’s deputy came in the wake of “almost confirmed” news that he will succeed Anandiben Patel as chief minister. Nitin Patel, 61-year-old leader of Mehsana, had also started giving interviews to news channels which began flashing news about the “impending announcement” as he began accepting congratulations from anchors and reporters alike. It seemed politically logical too — the Patidars were angry with the BJP government over quota demand and the police action they faced. This, however, didn’t happen. BJP president Amit Shah prevailed over other senior leaders at a meeting in Gandhinagar, and Rupani was given the top job.

The news surprised all. Rupani was a first time MLA unlike Nitin Patel who had served in various BJP governments since 1995.

One year down the line, sources say, a “cold war” is still brewing between the CM and his deputy. The sources give accounts of Cabinet meetings where the “differences” between the two leaders frequently surface. And, on most occasions Rupani manages to ignore it.

“Yes, a cold war is definitely there between the two. And many a times, even government officers face the brunt of it,” says a source close to the functioning of the offices of the CM and the Deputy CM.

Indicating the strained relationship between the top two in the government, an official said, “Take the recent floods in Banaskantha and Patan districts for example. The CM has taken a lead in relief and rehabilitation of the affected areas. Nitinbhai has remained almost aloof from the relief operations.” The latest issue of the state government’s fortnightly magazine — Gujarat, which was devoted to the flood — is full of pictures of the chief minister, whereas the presence of the Deputy CM is almost negligible.

“The Deputy CM did not participate much, so how can there be his pictures in it (the magazine),” said a government functionary.

Even as Rupani was camping along with his 10 ministers in the flood-affected areas for five days, Patel was also not handling the day-to-day government in Gandhinagar in CM’s absence. When reached, Nitin Patel dismissed talks of his differences with the chief minister or the brewing cold war between them.

“I have been in public life for the last 30 years. I do not pay heed to such bogus talks,” he said, dismissing claims that he did not visit the rain-affected areas. “I visited Radhanpur and Kankrej. As far as photographs (in Gujarat magazine) are concerned, I do not go to such places to get photographed…I had the responsibility of coordinating the entire state. While Banaskantha and Patan received heavy rain, so did places like Kalol. But, due to the intense gravity of flood situation in Banaskantha and Patan, they (Kalol and other places) got eclipsed… I was also actively involved in finalising the relief package,” said Patel.

Sara Errani insists she is not a cheat after two month doping ban,"Sara Errani’s ban will end on Oct. 2, precluding her from playing in the U.S. Open. (Source: AP) Sara Errani’s ban will end on Oct. 2, precluding her from playing in the U.S. Open. (Source: AP)

Former French Open finalist Sara Errani struggled to hold back the tears on Wednesday as she insisted she is not a cheat after being handed a two-month doping ban.

The International Tennis Federation announced the suspension on Monday after Errani tested positive for the banned substance letrozole in a test taken in February.

At a news conference, Errani continued to blame food contamination from her mother’s breast cancer medication.

“The sentence speaks clearly: I was found guilty of the involuntary ingestion of a substance which does not have a doping effect on a female,” said Errani, who reiterated several times that letrozole is not a performance-enhancing drug.

“I don’t know exactly how it could have happened that a pharmaceutical pill taken by my mother ended up in the food, but it’s the only plausible option, because we have eliminated all the others.”

The 30-year-old Errani was informed of the results of the test on April 28 but decided to continue playing tennis in the hope she could avoid a ban.

“It is up to the athlete whether to continue playing or to suspend themselves,” she said. “I decided to continue because I knew and I know that I had done nothing wrong.

“I hoped for and I worked toward being found not guilty, unfortunately the test on my hair that I presented wasn’t accepted because of a legal technicality … I have always been a champion of clean sport, and I remain convinced that anyone who voluntarily dopes should be banned for life.”

An adjudication panel ruled that Errani’s fault was “at the lower end of the scale,” but that she should still be banned for two months from Aug. 3.

Errani’s ban will end on Oct. 2, precluding her from playing in the U.S. Open.

“I hope this time will give me even more motivation,” Errani said. “I hope to use this time to recover from the stress and these awful experiences … I will train my hardest, as I have always done, to try to return stronger than before.”

The Italian broke down in tears as she added: “It’s a difficult situation for my family but we have managed to be even more united so I’m proud of them.”

Errani has also been retroactively disqualified from tournaments from Feb. 16 through June 7. Her only notable performance in that period was a semifinal in Rabat, Morocco, in May, plus a second-round loss at Roland Garros.

She announced she would appeal against the removal of her points earned during that period.

Errani repeatedly and heatedly criticized the media for reporting falsehoods, adding: “You played with the life and sentiments of other people: of me, my mother, my family … that makes me very angry.”

Errani reached the 2012 French Open final, losing to Maria Sharapova, and has completed a career grand slam in women’s doubles with Roberta Vinci.

The 98th-ranked Errani has won nine singles titles and 25 doubles titles in her WTA career. She reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 5 in 2013.

She also helped Italy to three Fed Cup titles.

"Veteran artist Haroon Khimani, 81, to showcase his latest work in Mumbai","Haroon Khimani’s paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation. Haroon Khimani’s paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation.

Haroon Khimani might be an octogenarian but it has not lessened his love for art. The 81-year-old — who always seeks to discover the beauty of nature, mostly in collapsed structures and disasters, be it natural or man-made — will soon showcase his latest contemporary retrospective visual arts exhibition titled ‘Descent’ in Mumbai. His paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation, steeped into potential energy of rebuilding.

“There is an ethical side to nature which borders between ‘being’ and ‘nothingness’. That inspires me the most. For the artist, it is a chance to step inside their own creations, to appear in a visual story and establish an interaction. Creating a super sensual existence on the canvass is an intense personal experience. In my paintings you will see nature acts as a backdrop that determines human fate. Everything is in a flux. Ultimately the desperate elements form a whole and add to the tempo of narrative,” Khimani said in a statement.

The veteran artist, has earlier stated on his website, “Beauty has a new definition for me. My paintings look like landscapes but there is unusual magnitude of structural juxtaposition, depth, recession and space created by colours perceived through black and white tones. We all are habituated to see beauty in limited terms but in disorganised and chaotic nature new beauty forms are created by self-destruction of the existing structures. Nature does this wonderfully but it depends upon our outlook to see the beauty in it. In fact, at such junctures we are emotionally driven to sympathy towards sufferers and dislocated mass, which leads us to see the pathetic and helpless part of it rather than the aesthetic value.”

Dance Like a Man,"A scene from Netua A scene from Netua

In the village of Buxar in Bihar, where theatre director Dilip Gupta grew up, a wedding or a social celebration almost always included a dance by a woman who was actually a man. “The tradition was called launda naach or the netua naach. As children, we were fascinated by these normal-looking boys who would go into a room and emerge from it looking like women. We would peep from cracks in doors and open windows as he dressed up,” says Gupta. Earlier this month, the theatre director enlivened the story of these men who performed as women dancers in a play, titled Netua.

Who would watch a play about folk dancers from Bihar in the heart of Delhi? More than Shri Ram Centre in Mandi House could accommodate. Long after the curtain rose and the doors shut, the crowd kept growing outside the hall. The enterprising among them tried to look for secret entrances — up the steps that lead to the Green Room — or called “people inside”. Neither scheme worked. Netua was house full, with standing room near the walls and in the balcony taken. The air-conditioning barely managed to keep up.

Dilip Gupta Dilip Gupta

The play begins with a netua performer, called Jhamna, refusing to let his son join the profession. His reason forms the body of the script, and allows actor Raunak Khan to get under the skin of a dancer, who clings to his art even as people around him, especially a zamindar, become incapable of seeing him as a man. The exploitation — sexual and social — of the zamindar increases but Jhamna holds his ground until a terrible incident forces him to cast away his coloured skirt. The dances are energetic and the music evocative of the heartland but Netua suffers from uneven acting and tacky light design. Performers maintained the momentum of the play, and kept the audience applauding.

Gupta knows the terrain in which the play is set, and recreates the raw and rough. Netua also demonstrates the immersion of an artist into his character. Gupta’s past plays have included Urf Chocolate Friends, about migration, and Bathan, about caste politics and naxalite problems, among others. In Netua, a Saraswati Puja scene depicts a bhajan performed to the tune of a yesteryear Bollywood hit. A native of the region would recognise how folk music is increasingly being juxtaposed with film tunes.

Google memo writer James Damore faces tough legal road challenging firing,"The 10-page memo by James Damore argued that the lack of representation of women in leadership roles in the tech industry was due to biological differences rather than discrimination (Representational Image) The 10-page memo by James Damore argued that the lack of representation of women in leadership roles in the tech industry was due to biological differences rather than discrimination (Representational Image)

The Google software engineer fired for writing an internal memo critical of diversity hiring policies at the company faces an uphill battle legally challenging his termination, but he could succeed in prolonging the controversy, potentially driving the tech firm to settle, legal experts said on Tuesday. James Damore told Reuters in an email on Monday that he had been fired by Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, for “perpetuating gender stereotypes” in his 10-page memo, which asserted Google had “a left bias” hostile to conservative viewpoints and argued that the lack of representation of women in leadership roles in the tech industry was due to biological differences rather than discrimination.

Damore said in the email he was exploring his legal options. Neither Damore nor Mountain View, California-based Google responded to a request for comment for this article. Damore’s memo and his firing have quickly become flashpoints in the culture wars with right-leaning writers and websites embracing Damore’s stand against “political correctness” and those on the left decrying his “sexist” arguments. Employment lawyers mostly said Damore’s potential legal case over his firing was weak though, with some noting Google would have faced potential lawsuits if it had not acted against him.

“If an employer is met with someone making statements that unabashedly stereotype based on gender and the employer doesn’t respond, the employer may be sued by others who say that discriminatory conduct creates a harassing atmosphere,” said Philadelphia-based labor lawyer Jonathan Segal of Duane Morris. Discrimination lawsuits might not directly target a Google decision not to fire Damore but could cite it as evidence of a “hostile work environment,” said Segal.

William Gould, a Stanford law professor and former National Labor Relations Board chairman, said Google had a strong argument its firing of Damore was justified on the grounds that his memo raised questions about whether he could fairly assess the work of female colleagues.

Gould said Damore would have a tough time arguing his firing violated his right to free speech. Private employers can largely fire workers for any reason. Some states including California have laws protecting political speech by employees but that protection would probably not apply to an internal memo focused on Google’s own policies, Gould said. In his email to Reuters on Monday, Damore suggested Google may have retaliated against him for filing a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board shortly before he was fired. The complaint claimed Google management was trying to silence his views. But several employment lawyers said this claim would likely fail because his memo would not be considered a “concerted activity” among Google employees protected by the National Labor Relations Act, just griping by Damore alone.

Michael Willemin, a plaintiff’s lawyer with employment firm Wigdor, also said Damore would have a hard time bringing a retaliation claim based on the idea that his memo constituted a complaint about discrimination against men. Willemin noted the memo contained no specific accusation of unlawful conduct.Damore may not need to prevail in a legal proceeding to win, however. Though his memo received widespread criticism for its perceived sexism, it also drew a great deal of support, especially from the political right.

Such voices would likely increase during a legal case, and Jeffrey Hirsch, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said the controversy could lead Google to settle any legal action brought by Damore. “My guess is Google would rather not have people talking about this,” he said. But Hirsch also said it was possible a quick settlement was less Damore’s goal than publicity for his point of view.

“It takes a certain personality to stick your neck out like that – to write a memo and send it to the workforce,” said Hirsch. “That same type of person might also embrace the martyr role.”

WATCH: Real Madrid celebrate with the Super Cup trophy in dressing room,"Real Madrid’s Marcelo holds aloft the trophy as they celebrate winning the super cup final. (Source: Reuters) Real Madrid’s Marcelo holds aloft the trophy as they celebrate winning the super cup final. (Source: Reuters)

Goals from Casemiro and Isco helped Real Madrid retain their UEFA Super Cup trophy on Tuesday against Europa League champions Manchester United. Madrid beat the Premier League side 2-1 in the Republic of Macedonia.

The players were thrilled to win their first trophy of the season, despite a lackluster pre-season. In the absence of their star striker Cristiano Ronaldo, the pre-season began with a defeat to United. It was then followed by another dangerous defeat to Manchester City where they lost 4-1 to Pep Guardiola’s men.

If that was not enough for Zinedine Zidane, his men again went down to Spanish rivals Barcelona in a thrilling El Clasico that finished with 3-2.

Los Blancos celebrated in the dressing room as Marcelo is seen opening a champagne bottle as the players pose with the latest trophy in their kitty.

Romelu Lukaku also scored in his proper debut match but it was not enough for United to win. While Real Madrid had won the Champions League trophy, Jose Mourinho’s side got the better of Ajax in the final of Europa League.

Madrid finished the last season at the top of the Spanish league with 93 points, three points ahead of trailing rivals Barcelona. Under French manager Zinedine Zidane, they also retained their Champions League trophy.

Real Madrid will now play El Clasico on Sunday while United begin their Premier League season against West Ham on Saturday.

"Ashton Agar could certainly end up batting in the top six, says Steve Smith","Steve Smith has claimed that Aston Agar could feature in the batting line-up during the upcoming tour to Bangladesh. Steve Smith has claimed that Aston Agar could feature in the batting line-up during the upcoming tour to Bangladesh.

Australian captain Steev Smith has stated that promising player Ashton agar could feature in the Aussie Test batting line-up in the upcoming tour to Bangladesh. He even went on to say that Agar could find a spot among the top six batsmen.

It may be recalled here that Agar holds the record for the highest Test score by a number 11 batsman when he hit 98 he scored on debut.

While speaking to cricket.com.au, Smith said, “I think he could certainly end up in the top six, I think he’s got that ability,” Smith told cricket.com.au.

“Right now I’m not sure, he’s probably playing mainly as a spinner who can bat a bit, somewhere like where I started probably. “But I think he’s certainly got the capability to bat in the top six at some point.” and added, “He’s a different sort of batter; he’s got a very free-flowing and unique swing. “It looked like he has some really good plans against spin (in the nets on the recent tour of India) so he looks like he’ll be able to play a role with both bat and ball.”

“I think I would be able to if I was given that opportunity,” he said after he was picked in an extended Test squad for the New Year’s Test in January. “I would back myself to do that. “I see myself as an allrounder. I’ve been selected in this squad as a spinner but I think I’m capable with bat and ball.”, he further added.

Before the tour to Bangladesh, Australia will train in a camp in Darwin and Smith believes that it will play an important role to determine who plays in the first Test.

“That’s a good opportunity for a few guys to put their best foot forward,” he said. “The last Test series was in India and conditions will be similar (in Bangladesh). “The training camp in Darwin will be a good one for us … we’ll be able to look at a few guys and see how they’re going.”

Anil Kumble’s dues of Rs 97.50 lakhs cleared by BCCI,"Anil Kumble resigned as India’s coach ahead of the team’s tour of West Indies. (Source: AP) Anil Kumble resigned as India’s coach ahead of the team’s tour of West Indies. (Source: AP)

Anil Kumble’s association as coach of the Indian cricket team has been brought to an acrimonious end – if you count the final payments to him as any consideration. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) released two amounts of Rs. 48.75 lakhs as “Professional fees for the month of May 2017” and “Professional fees for the month of June 2017” August 7.

BCCI made the payments official and revealed the information as part of the board’s monthly exercise of publishing payments made above Rs 25 lakh.

Former India spinner and captain Kumble had controversially quit two days after the Champions Trophy final loss against Pakistan in London in June, calling his partnership with captain Virat Kohli “untenable”. There had been rumours doing the rounds prior to the official decision that the captain and coach weren’t on the same page as far as team selection was concerned or the team’s bonhomie inside the dressing room.

Ravi Shastri, whom Kumble had replaced, was reappointed as the coach following a lengthy, and somewhat controversial, selection process for the new coach. He has been appointed as the coach until the 2019 World Cup. Shastri beat the likes of Virender Sehwag and Tom Moody for the high-profile job.

Ishant Sharma, who is not part of the current Test squad touring Sri Lanka, was paid Rs. 1.03 crore by the BCCI under two separate sub-heads: Rs 26,60,968 as “Taxable portion of ICC & BCCI Test Ranking prize money” and Rs 76,59,766 as “Share of gross revenue 2015-16 Tournament played in outside India”. Funds were paid out to KL Rahul and Stuart Binny too under the “Taxable portion of ICC & BCCI Test Ranking prize money” head. While funds were released under the other head for Varun Aaron, Wriddhiman Saha and Binny.

The board paid Rs 45 lakh to each of the India women’s cricket team members following their final place finish at the ICC Women’s World Cup.

One time benefit payment of Rs 35 lakh each was released to former India cricketers including Vivek Razdan, Sarandeep Singh, Salil Ankola, Reetinder Sodhi, Yograj Singh and Robin Singh.

Sources suggest US preparing more sanctions against Venezuelan officials,"US President Donald Trump (AP Photo) US President Donald Trump (AP Photo)

The Trump administration is preparing sanctions against another group of Venezuelan officials linked to President Nicolas Maduro in response to his creation of a new legislative superbody in defiance of world condemnation, US officials said on Monday.

The new measures, to freeze the individuals’ US assets, ban them from travel to the United States and prohibit Americans from doing business with them, could be rolled out as early as this week, one of the administration officials told Reuters.

No final decisions have yet been made on the list of new targets, which is likely to include a significant number of names, or on the exact timing of the announcement, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Washington slapped sanctions on Maduro himself last week following similar action against 13 Venezuelan figures on July 26.

The next round is still expected to stop short of penalties against Venezuela’s vital oil sector, considered the toughest of possible sanctions, though such measures, US sources have said, remain under consideration. “We want to leave room to do more if Maduro’s actions continue, not do everything and everyone who remains all with one stroke,” said one of the officials involved in the White House deliberations.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News first reported the new sanctions plan. Preparations for further sanctions followed Friday’s inauguration of the new assembly, which is expected to rewrite the country’s constitution and give vast new powers to Maduro and his ruling Socialist Party.

The Trump administration has echoed the Venezuelan opposition’s view that the assembly is a bid by Maduro to cement dictatorship after months of deadly protests in the oil-rich, but economically ailing, South American country.

US officials announcing measures against Maduro last week for what the called abuse of power reiterated a threat of a strong economic response and warned that anyone serving in the new assembly could face US sanctions. The United States, the European Union and most of Venezuela’s neighbors condemned the election of the assembly as flawed.

MLA Ramesh Kadam seeks permission to use laptop in jail,"Kadam, an MLA from Solapur, submitted in the court that he was a representative of people and wanted access to a laptop to raise questions in the Assembly. (File – Express Photo by Narendra Vaskar) Kadam, an MLA from Solapur, submitted in the court that he was a representative of people and wanted access to a laptop to raise questions in the Assembly. (File – Express Photo by Narendra Vaskar)

MLA Ramesh Kadam on Thursday sought permission from the court to use a laptop in prison. Kadam, who is currently lodged in Byculla Jail for his alleged involvement in a corruption case, told the court that he wanted to participate in the ongoing legislative session by submitting questions online for the question hour and calling attention. The prosecution, however, objected to his plea claiming that the batteries of the laptop could explode and cause a blast in the prison.

While the session concludes on Friday, the application filed by Kadam a few weeks ago, came up in the court only on Thursday. Kadam, an MLA from Solapur, submitted in the court that he was a representative of people and wanted access to a laptop to raise questions in the Assembly. Kadam contended that in the age of digitisation, one can send questions online. “Under the Representation of the People Act, I should be allowed to do that by being allowed access to a laptop in jail,” Kadam argued. He said he would only access the laptop during “non-bandi” hours in the prison and return it to the jail authorities. He further said the jail officials can monitor his usage.

Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan objected to the application stating that since laptops have lithium batteries there is a possibility of it causing an explosion. Chavan submitted that according to the provisions of the Maharashtra jail manual, 1963, anything that could cause hurt or assist a prison in assault or escape, is prohibited in jail. “The battery can explode or it can be caused to explode. It can also be used for physical assault. The Assembly session is also practically over,” Chavan told the court.

Kadam, however, contended that electronic items like television sets are allowed in prison and there is no instance of an explosion caused by them. He also argued on a few more applications, including one seeking permission to meet Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Kadam said he was ready to pay for the police security team. He told the court that he wanted to meet the CM to discuss issues like electricity, water and roads in his constituency as well as the alleged custodial death of Byculla prison inmate Manjula Shetye.

Another application filed by Kadam was to seek evaluation of all his properties attached in the case. In March, the state Criminal Investigation Department had been allowed by the court to attach movable and immovable properties belonging to Kadam worth over Rs 135 crore. Kadam submitted that while the CID claimed that the properties were worth Rs 135 crore, their value was much higher.

“Different investigating agencies have arrived at various value of the properties. I seek for the court to appoint an evaluator so that an exact amount can be reached,” Kadam said. Chavan objected to the plea stating that a previous order by the court had said liability cannot be fixed at the trial stage.

The court has reserved the orders till next week.

Kadam was arrested in 2015 with the CID claiming that he misappropriated funds of Lokshahir Annabhau Sathe Magasvargiya Vikas Mahamandal, which he headed as the chairman.

Suicide bomber kills four Pakistani soldiers in troubled northwest,"The Pakistani military said an officer and three soldiers were killed in the attack, which drew immediate condemnation from Abbasi. “Each drop of blood of our heroes is a testament to the fact that we all are united as a nation to cleanse our beloved motherland from terrorist elements,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. The Pakistani military said an officer and three soldiers were killed in the attack, which drew immediate condemnation from Abbasi. “Each drop of blood of our heroes is a testament to the fact that we all are united as a nation to cleanse our beloved motherland from terrorist elements,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement.

A suicide bomber killed four Pakistani soldiers in an attack in the troubled northwest near the border with Afghanistan, the army said on Wednesday, at least the second major attack since Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi came to power a week ago. Pakistan began a military offensive against fighters affiliated with the Islamic State group along the northern part of the border last month, saying the region was fast becoming a safe haven for multiple terrorist organizations.

An army patrol was conducting a search operation in Upper Dir on Tuesday night, near the Malakand region where the Pakistani Taliban had controlled large swaths of territory until a military operation in 2009. ?”The military officials received information about the presence of terrorists in the area,” the military said in a statement. They were conducting a search operation “when one of the terrorists blew himself up”.

The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a message sent to the media. “Our fighters attacked them when they were on the way and killed a major and other soldiers,” said TTP spokesman Mohammad Khurassani. The Pakistani military said an officer and three soldiers were killed in the attack, which drew immediate condemnation from Abbasi. “Each drop of blood of our heroes is a testament to the fact that we all are united as a nation to cleanse our beloved motherland from terrorist elements,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement.

A security official who asked not to be identified told Reuters that security forces were drawn into a gun battle with two militants when one of the men blew himself up. “This area is infamous for its record of terrorist activities,” the official said. Abbasi took office last week after previous premier Nawaz Sharif was disqualified by the Supreme Court over undeclared assets, a ruling Sharif has decried as politically motivated but opposition leaders say was a victory for the rule of law.

At least 22 people were wounded in a bombing in the restive eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday, a government official said, although there was no claim of responsibility for that attack.

"Philippe Coutinho will not be sold, says Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp","Philippe Coutinho joined Liverpool from Inter Milan for 8.5 million pounds ( million) in 2013. (Source: Reuters) Philippe Coutinho joined Liverpool from Inter Milan for 8.5 million pounds ( million) in 2013. (Source: Reuters)

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said midfielder Philippe Coutinho would not be sold at any price, as British media reported the club had rejected a second bid worth 100 million euros ($117 million) from Barcelona.

Barcelona had already been rebuffed last month in an 80 million euro bid for the 25-year-old, who joined Liverpool from Inter Milan for 8.5 million pounds ($11 million) in 2013.

The 24-time Spanish league champions increased the offer to 85 million euros plus 15 million in add-ons but Liverpool have rejected the second bid, maintaining their stance that the player is not for sale, according to the reports.

“Liverpool is not a club that has to sell players. That is set in stone. So what they offer in the end doesn’t matter,” Sky Germany quoted Klopp as saying.

“From a financial standpoint, there is no price limit to let him go. No price at which we are ready to give in. Our goal is to have the best possible team. So we want to keep our guys and add new ones. That is our plan.”

The Merseyside club’s position on the Brazil international, who was a key player in Klopp’s squad last campaign, is boosted by Coutinho’s signing of a new five-year contract last season.

Media reports indicate that Barcelona are targeting Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele as replacements for Brazil forward Neymar, who joined Paris St Germain last week for a world record transfer fee of 222 million euros.

While Spanish media have suggested that a deal for Coutinho’s move to Barcelona was close to completion, British media say Liverpool have not and will not make any plans to discuss the player’s future with the Catalan club.

‘Make in India aimed at making India global manufacturing hub’,"Noting that there is considerable synergy between the Indian states those in the US midwest, Bhushan said this could be effectively utilised to boost the manufacturing sectors in both countries. Noting that there is considerable synergy between the Indian states those in the US midwest, Bhushan said this could be effectively utilised to boost the manufacturing sectors in both countries.

The ambitious ‘Make in India’ scheme of the Modi government is aimed at making the country a global manufacturing hub and transforming its economy, an Indian diplomat in the US has said. ‘Make in India’ is one of the flagship programmes of the Government of India which is aimed at transforming the Indian economy towards making it a “global manufacturing hub”, India’s Consul General in Chicago Neeta Bhushan said in her address to a business community from the mid-west region recently, a media release said yesterday.

In her key note address at an event organised in partnership with US India Chamber of Commerce Midwest, Bhushan said that there are at least 30 key economic sectors which international companies can consider setting up manufacturing bases in India. Noting that there is considerable synergy between the Indian states those in the US midwest, Bhushan said this could be effectively utilised to boost the manufacturing sectors in both countries. She highlighted about the benefits of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime and how it has subsumed 17 taxes and over 23 cesses in India.

“The GST is aimed at integrating the tax structure throughout India. The government has taken a series of reforms to improve the ease of doing business,” she said. In her address, she also talked about other flagship programs of the Indian government such as ‘Skill India’ and ‘Digital India’. Ajit Pant, president of the US-India Chamber of Commerce Midwest, discussed the ‘Make in India’ initiative and the vast business opportunities that this program presents for the overseas investors at the event.

Lisa Victoria Waller, vice president of BDG International, discussed the GST reforms in details and informed the participants about the impact of the new tax regime on foreign companies functioning in India and how they can benefit from it in the long run.

UK PM Theresa May’s spokesman: We do not recognise reported 40 billion euro Brexit bill,"FILE PHOTO: June 23, 2017 British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file) FILE PHOTO: June 23, 2017 British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file)

Britain does not recognise media reports that the government is willing to pay 40 billion euros ($47.21 billion) to exit the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Monday. The so-called “exit bill” is one of the first issues on the Brexit negotiating agenda, and also one of the most contentious. The EU has floated a figure of 60 billion euros, while Britain has not indicated how much it would be prepared to pay.

The Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain would be willing to pay up to 40 billion euros, citing three unnamed sources familiar with Britain’s negotiating strategy. “In terms of this figure, I don’t recognise it,” May’s spokesman told reporters.

“The prime minister made clear in the letter triggering Article 50 (the EU exit process) that the UK and the EU need to discuss a fair settlement of both our rights and obligations as an EU member state.” Britain has less than two years to negotiate the terms of its exit from the EU – an unprecedented untangling of more than 40 years of legal, economic and political ties. Early rounds of talks have made little progress, with the EU’s negotiating team demanding more clarity from Britain on what it wants.

When asked whether Britain and the EU were expecting to come up with a firm figure for the exit bill at this stage in the talks, or a less precise agreement covering the rules which would be used to calculate it, the spokesman said: “I’m not getting into a running commentary on the negotiations or the precise structure of them.”

He repeated that answer when asked whether the 40 billion euro figure was lower than the government was willing to accept, or whether the government had actually calculated an amount it was prepared to pay. The bill is expected to be made up of money Britain has already committed to the multi-year EU budget, ongoing financial risks it agreed during its membership to help cover, and a contribution to the pension scheme for EU officials.

The size of the bill will also heavily depend on the shape of Britain’s transitional agreement – a staggered exit process which could see the government paying into EU regulatory schemes while new domestic ones are established. Britain has yet to set out what kind of transitional deal it is seeking, making estimates of the final bill difficult to calculate.

As well as finding a deal that satisfies both an EU establishment keen to deter other members from trying leave, and the strained purse-strings of the British budget, May must also reach an amount her own political party is prepared to swallow. Some eurosceptics within her own party argue Britain should not have to pay anything at all, and any settlement perceived to be generous to Brussels could prompt revolt within the Conservative ranks.

After May lost her majority in a national election earlier this year, a rebellion of more than a dozen or so Conservatives would endanger her chances of getting the Brexit deal, and all the necessary supporting legislation, approved by parliament.

"It was a dream come true to be running with Mo Farah, says Govindan Lakshmanan","Govindan Lakshmanan has said that running the 5000m heat alongside Mo Farah was an “experience of a lifetime. (Source: Reuters) Govindan Lakshmanan has said that running the 5000m heat alongside Mo Farah was an “experience of a lifetime. (Source: Reuters)

Indian athlete Govindan Lakshmanan has revealed that running the 5000m heat alongside champion Mo Farah was an experience of a lifetime and it is something that he will never forget.

Lakshmanan, who clocked a personal best of 13 minute 35.69 seconds, spoke to PTI in an interview and said, “It was a dream come true to be running with Mo Farah. He is an inspiration for me. I feel very good. It is a lifetime experience to run with him. This is his last competition and he will not run again.” and said, “I was concentrating on my race, so I don’t know how he was running but I feel good to have run with him.”

Lakshmanan’s coach Surendra Singh also expressed happiness and said, “I told him this is a very good opportunity to break the national record here in London. Low temperature is actually good for long distance runners. There was Mo Farah, the Kenyans, Ethiopians and other runners, all world class. You can improve your timing only in this kind of situations when competition is strong. He missed out (here) but he will do it. I think he can break the national record next year in Australia (In CWG). The conditions will also be very good there in Australia.”

Speaking about the weather conditions Lakshmanan said, “The conditions were very good. The low temperature and my competitors including Mo Farah. You don’t get these kinds of top class competitors to run with. The rain was the only issue, the track was wet. But I came into the race with the target of breaking the national record” and added, “I did a lot of practice here in the past 10 days to break the national record. I tried but missed it by five seconds and I am disappointed. I will do next time. The last lap was a bit tight. I could not qualify for the final round but I would have been happy if I had broken the national record.”

Looking ahead, Lakshmanan stated that he was willing to work harder so that he can do well in the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Australia. “I want to do well in the Commonwealth Games in Australia, the competition will be good there. I want to run 13:28 there. My coach (Surendra Singh) said I can run 13 min 22 seconds. I want to improve my timing. This is my first World Championships, I will do better next time.”

Sikhs one of the top targets of hate crimes in US: Community leaders,"“Hate has no colour. Hate has no face. Yet we all saw hate five years ago,” Blahair Dulai, president of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin said. (Representational image) “Hate has no colour. Hate has no face. Yet we all saw hate five years ago,” Blahair Dulai, president of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin said. (Representational image)

Sikhs are one of the top targets of hate crimes and sectarian violence in the US, the community leaders have said as they remembered victims of the 2012 mass shooting by a white supremacist that claimed the lives of six Sikhs at a Gurdwara in the Wisconsin city. Several eminent Sikh-Americans from across the US, lawmakers, government officials and local leaders participated in prayers held on the weekend to mark the five-year anniversary of the mass shooting.

“We have made commendable efforts to secure our Gurdwara Sahib’s all across the country and taken many preventive measures. But Sikhs are still one of the top targets of hate crimes, sectarian violence, and bullying in American schools. In recent years, attacks have rather increased in manyfold,” said Gurinder Singh Khalsa, who heads the Sikhs Political Action Committee.

“Hate has no colour. Hate has no face. Yet we all saw hate five years ago,” Blahair Dulai, president of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, said, addressing the gathering. “When you come together and those hearts and minds connect, the presence of the divine is there and you don’t even have to say a word,” he added.

Among the speakers yesterday at the Gurdwara was retired Oak Creek Police officer Brian Murphy, who was shot fifteen times before the shooter was brought down. “When something is stolen from you, when the lives were stolen from everyone here, you can’t get that back,” Murphy said.

Remembering the victims, he said, “The voices of the people that were lost are still here. August 5, 2012 changed a lot of people’s lives, but remember the people that were here on August 4 and all the times before that.” On August 5, 2012, six Sikhs were killed and three more were wounded, along with the Oak Creek police officer, when the white supremacist armed with a gun attacked the Oak Creek Sikh Temple in Wisconsin.

On Saturday, the Gurdwara organised a six-mile run. The House Speaker, Paul Ryan, sent a two-minute video on the occasion. Vanita Gupta, former Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights were among prominent people to speak on the occasion.

Mothers supporting child’s negative emotions can impact their social adjustment: Study,"Mothers’ supportive reactions predicted fewer socio-emotional skills and more behaviour problems. (Source: File photo) Mothers’ supportive reactions predicted fewer socio-emotional skills and more behaviour problems. (Source: File photo)

Dear parents, you may have to stop favouring your child in every situation, as according to a study, mothers supporting their child’s negative emotions may impact their social adjustment and social interaction in school.

According to a study, mothers, who are more supportive of their children’s negative emotions, rate their children as being more socially skilled and these same children appear less socially adjusted when rated by teachers.

Specifically, mothers’ supportive reactions predicted fewer socio-emotional skills and more behaviour problems, according to children’s third-grade teachers.

These contrasting patterns suggest a potential downside to mothers’ supportiveness of children’s negative emotions for third-grade children’s social adjustment in school.

Co-author of the study Dr. Vanessa Castro said that it’s not clear, if the parents are causing these problems by hovering or providing too much support when less support is needed or if the parents are rightfully providing more support because their children are experiencing these social and emotional problems, or if the children are exhibiting very different emotional and social behaviors at home than they are at school.

The findings suggest that is may be helpful for parents to consider other strategies to guide their children to develop their own skills in emotion regulation and social interaction.

Benjamin Netanyahu aide says Israeli leader calm in face of charges,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: Reutres ) Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: Reutres )

A close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is relaxed and confident amid reports of the slew of corruptions charges against him. Sports and Culture Minister Miri Regev says on Sunday she has full confidence in the prime minister and denounced what she called a media campaign to topple him. Netanyahu himself did not address the latest developments at his weekly Cabinet meeting. Israeli police recently announced that they suspect Netanyahu of being involved in bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a pair of cases.

Netanyahu’s former chief of staff and longtime confidante has agreed to turn state witness and testify against his former mentor. This has raised speculation that Netanyahu could be indicted shortly.

Netanyahu has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and calls the accusations a witch hunt.

Malaysia protests over suspected militants deported from Turkey ahead of Southeast Games,"Malaysia has complained to Turkey for deporting several suspected militants to Kuala Lumpur without warning, a security official said on Tuesday, as police step up checks ahead of the Southeast Asian Games that start in the capital this month. The suspects, all foreigners, were deported from Turkey after being caught trying to enter Syria to join up with Islamic State, the security source told Reuters.

“Turkey should have followed international protocol, first by deporting them to their last port of embarkation and secondly by informing the country where deportees are sent to,” said the source who is aware of the discussions. The source did not want to identified as the discussions were private. It was not clear how many suspects were missing and when they entered Malaysia. But Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said last week that they were searching for at least 16 militants deported from Turkey.

According to police, the suspects were given an option by Turkish authorities to be deported to Malaysia rather than their last port of call. Many had chosen Malaysia due to its many visa-free agreements with other countries. The Turkish embassy in Kuala Lumpur did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The counter-terrorism police team conducted a six-hour raid around major roads in the Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, arresting more than 400 people, as it stepped up security for the Southeast Asia Games that begin on Aug 19.

Those arrested on Sunday were mostly undocumented migrants from various countries including Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Myanmar. “Our operations are focused on finding and taking action against foreigners with connections to terrorism, especially those linked to activities in Syria,” said Malaysian police counter-terrorism division chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay. “We are worried about these Syria-linked elements being in Malaysia.” A Pakistani national was also detained for possible links to security offences, after police found him with 40,000 ringgit ($9,340), 62 passports from various countries and a machine for forging Immigration Department stickers.

Mobile videos may help parents stick to infants’ sleep practices,"The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed. (Source: File Photo) The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed. (Source: File Photo)

A mobile programme of informational videos and messages may improve parents’ adherence to safe sleep practices for infants, new research has found. The researchers tested two different types of educational interventions. The first involved nurses teaching new parents about safe sleep practices for infants while still in the hospital. The the second intervention the mobile programme involved delivering information through e-mails, messages and videos.

Following recommended safe sleep practices can reduce the risk of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed; avoiding soft bedding that could strangle or suffocate infants; and using pacifiers, which has been shown to reduce SIDS risk.

“We’d been looking at the prevalence of safe sleep practices for a long time, and I had been getting really energised about doing a study that takes what we know about safe sleep prevalence and tests an intervention that might help improve the adherence to the ‘gold standard’ safe sleep practices,” said Eve Colson, Professor at Yale School of Medicine, Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US.

According to the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, mobile videos for educating new parents on safe infant sleep practices achieved rates of 92.5 per cent for back sleeping and 85.9 per cent for room-sharing without bed-sharing, two of the critical steps towards SUID reduction. These rates were much higher than those for the group who received only the in-hospital intervention on safe sleep practices.

In a clinical trial with 1,263 families, “mothers who received a mobile health intervention with regular text or email messages and videos reported statistically significantly higher rates of placing their infants supine to sleep compared with mothers who received control interventions”, the study said.

The Empire Gazes Back,"Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about.

In 1978, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published a seminal treatment of how the Western world and its scholarship viewed the Islamic world of the Middle East. His central argument was: knowledge is embedded in equations of power and all Western scholarship on nonwestern societies is tainted by its association with imperialism. Power therefore defined knowledge. The reception of ‘Orientalism’ is not surprising. The 1970s was an era when the west seemed to be rolling back. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan followed in 1979. The Shia revolution in Iran in the same year was as much an ideological and intellectual revolution against the West and the USA as a political revolution against the Shah. The spread of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere challenged then, as it does now, deeply engrained notions of what constituted progress in Western eyes. Said’s book Orientalism became a classic, as it remains to this day.

Academic critiques of Said were no less powerful. Substantial parts of the book delved into periods when the Islamic world was not subordinated to the West. So, perceptions of Islam as degenerate and backward did not develop as a consequence of Western conquest but, in fact, had predated it. Said’s argument about power and knowledge was much criticised on this ground. But even at that time, there was the view that the perfect match to study the relationship between imperial power and knowledge was to be found not so much in the middle east but in colonial India.

Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Arvind Sharma is a professor of comparative religion in Montreal. This is, in part, an assimilative work drawing on a wide range of studies in the past quarter-century, which have asked questions like those he raises: How did colonial scholarship evolve, and how did the process of studying colonial subjects and themes also transform the colonies in greater or lesser measure? This is a book refreshingly free of jargon — it’s a good point for the serious but general reader to start with to understand how much colonialism and imperialism permeated scholarship, and how very clearly the relationship between knowledge and power was understood by both sets of practitioners.

Sharma describes, as others have before him, how scholarship about India and Indians changed as the East India Company transformed itself from a trading enterprise to a political and then a colonial power. The initial fascination, even admiration, for India and things Indians, acquired through the 19th century gave way, especially after 1857, to deep biases arising from a sense of contempt. He also does well to remind us how intrinsic missionary activity was to the entire imperial project as critiques of Hinduism went hand in hand with efforts at conversion. Racism also permeated colonial scholarship to a greater extent than is generally conceded. I found one particular instance cited by Sharma striking. Annette Beveridge, wife of a British civil servant and scholar, was an accomplished Persian scholar in her own right. Her translation of Gulbadan Begum’s Humayun Namah in the late 19th century is a work of great sensitivity and charm, as a woman of the time sought to understand and contextualise the account of a Mughal princess in the 17th century. But Beveridge was also at the forefront of the agitation in India insisting that Indian judges not be allowed to try English or white people. Beveridge then wrote about the social ideas of Hindus as being “on the outer verge of civilisation” and that she had no hesitation in calling them “uncivilised a people which cares about stone idols, enjoys child marriage and secludes its women, and where at every point the fact of sex is present to the mind.” In brief, how could such people be allowed to try English men and women!

Nevertheless, this is not a book about the inequities of British rule in India (although there is some of that) but rather about how British scholarship was an exercise underwritten by power and at the same time directed at cementing a relationship of subjugation. Illustrating how such scholarship also transformed social realities in India is one of Sharma’s endeavors, as he takes us through themes of caste, race, religion, science, historical sense or lack of it, etc. If parts of this treatment would be familiar to scholars, there is also sufficient that is new and surprising enough to engage the general reader.

Sharma’s central thesis of power underwriting scholarship in colonial India is unexceptional. Nevertheless, his extension of Said’s Orientalism debate to India also raises other questions. Did Orientalism cease in 1947 with the end of political subjugation? Or does this approach continue, since in many ways the relationship between India and the West continues to have elements that are unequal. More problematic are the questions thrown up by Sharma’s suggestions that political domination is the key variable in determining perceptions. This explanation, however appealing, may also have limitations. What was characteristic about British scholarship of India in the colonial period was not just that the British ruled India. It was also the fact that the rulers came from a society and an age that had, since the Enlightenment, radically transformed ideas of knowledge and how it was to be collected, organised and disseminated. This gave to knowledge production in colonial India features not encountered in earlier and other situations of political domination.

The Ruler’s Gaze is a thought provoking and imaginative work that furthers the debate about how profoundly British colonialism affected India and Indians.

A scheduled meeting between the foreign ministers of China and Vietnam was cancelled on the sidelines of a regional gathering, Chinese embassy officials said, amid growing tension between the two countries over the South China Sea. Vietnam had held out for language that noted concern about island-building and criticised militarisation in South China Sea in the communique on Sunday from foreign ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China’s claims in the waterway, where more than $3 trillion in cargo pass every year. The Chinese embassy officials gave no reason for the cancellation of the meeting scheduled for Monday in Manila between China’s Wang Yi and Vietnam’s Pham Binh Minh.

A Chinese foreign ministry official said they had “already met”. Vietnam’s foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment. State media in Vietnam said the ministers had held a “pull aside” meeting and exchanged views. It showed pictures of them shaking hands.

Although the language in the ASEAN communique reflected that in previous years, some countries pursuing deeper business ties with Beijing, such as Cambodia and the Philippines, had argued for dropping it. Beijing is sensitive to even a veiled reference by ASEAN to its reclamation of seven reefs and its military installations in the South China Sea, which it claims in almost its entirety despite the competing claims of five other countries.

Tension has risen since June, when Vietnam infuriated China by drilling for oil and gas in an offshore block that Beijing disputes. The exploration was suspended after diplomatic protests from China. After the ASEAN meeting, China’s foreign minister had called out “some countries” who voiced concern over island reclamation.

Wang said that China had not carried out reclamation for two years. “At this time, if you ask who is carrying out reclamation, it is definitely not China – perhaps it is the country that brings up the issue that is doing it,” he added.

Satellite images have shown that Vietnam has carried out reclamation work in two sites in the disputed seas in recent years.

On Tuesday, the state-run China Daily cited unnamed sources as saying Vietnam had tried to hype up the reclamation issue in the communique, pointing out that Vietnam has accelerated its land reclamation in the South China Sea.

“Undoubtedly, what Vietnam has done is the trick of a thief crying ‘stop thief,'” the paper quoted one of the sources as saying. Australia, Japan and the United States on Monday urged Southeast Asia and China to ensure that a South China Sea code of conduct they have committed to draw up will be legally binding and said they strongly opposed “coercive unilateral actions”.

China has strongly opposed what it calls interference by countries outside the region in the South China Sea issue. Meeting Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono on the sidelines of a regional security forum in Manila on Monday, Wang urged Japan to respect the efforts of China and ASEAN countries and play a more constructive role for regional peace and stability.

“Don’t always make trouble behind the backs of other countries and provoke quarrels,” the ministry cited Wang as saying.

"Champion Asbel Kiprop leads Kenyan charge into 1,500 metres semifinal","Asbel Kiprop went all the way to the line just behind Elijah Manangoi, silver medallist two years ago. (Source: Reuters) Asbel Kiprop went all the way to the line just behind Elijah Manangoi, silver medallist two years ago. (Source: Reuters)

Four Kenyans with eyes on 1,500 metres medals – the three fastest men in the world this year and the one seeking a fourth successive title – all qualified from Thursday’s first-round heats, though not without a scare for one of them.

Triple defending champion Asbel Kiprop, aiming to match the four successive titles world record-holder Hicham El Guerrouj took from 1997-2003, showed that he is not about to hand over his title without a fight.

Kiprop went all the way to the line just behind Elijah Manangoi, silver medallist two years ago and the world leader this year with three minutes 28.80, in a mass finish to the first heat.

The two 21-year-old pretenders of the Kenyan team had contrasting nights as Timothy Cheruiyot went through strongly in second place in the third heat while Ronald Kwemoi snatched the sixth and last fast-loser slot.

Sadik Mikhou, who switched allegiance from Morocco to Bahrain last year, was an impressive winner of the second heat, where Dutchman Richard Douma fell 30 metres from the line when well-placed to qualify. After an appeal by the Dutch federation Douma was advanced to the semi-finals.

Luke Mathews of Australia led the last heat home and it was considerably the fastest of the three with the six automatic and five of the six fast losers all going through from it.

The home fans, getting ever-more desperate for someone to join 10,000m champion Mo Farah on the medal table, had something to cheer as Chris O’Hare and Jake Wightman – whose father Geoff commentated on the race as the stadium announcer – progressed.

American Matt Centrowitz, the Olympic champion and former world silver and bronze medallist who has struggled for form after an injury and illness-hit season, finished a distant last in his heat. The semi-finals take place on Friday with the final on Sunday, the last day of the championships.

Donald Trump appears to grant China banks sanctions reprieve after UN deal,"US President Donald Trump (AP Photo) US President Donald Trump (AP Photo)

The Trump administration appears to be granting Chinese banks dealing with North Korea a temporary reprieve from threatened U.S. sanctions to give Beijing time to show it is serious about enforcing new U.N. steps against Pyongyang, U.S. officials said. The White House has also held off on much-anticipated trade action against China after Beijing backed U.N. Security Council sanctions passed on Saturday, although it is unclear how long President Donald Trump will delay this given domestic pressures to make good on campaign promises to crack down on unfair trade practices.

Washington has made clear it is reluctant, for the moment, to take steps that would antagonize China when its cooperation is needed to tighten the screws on its ally and neighbor North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.

U.S. officials and U.N. diplomats say the threat of unilateral U.S. “secondary sanctions” against Chinese firms with North Korean ties and trade pressure from Washington helped persuade China to drop opposition to the new U.N. sanctions.

“It played an important role to get China on board,” one diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The 15 Security Council members voted unanimously on Saturday to impose the toughest U.N. sanctions yet on North Korea after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July. The measures are designed to choke off a third of North Korea’s $3 billion annual export revenue.

China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has pledged to enforce the new sanctions but some critics are skeptical given what is widely seen as Beijing’s lax policing of existing restrictions.

Adding to the sense of urgency, Trump warned on Tuesday Pyongyang “will be met with fire and fury” if it threatened the United States. Earlier Pyongyang said it was ready to give Washington a “severe lesson” with its strategic nuclear force in response to any U.S. military action.

WATCHING CLOSELY

U.S. officials said they would be watching China’s enforcement closely. The administration holds in reserve a list of Chinese banks and other firms the Treasury Department has been preparing to sanction for their alleged ties to North Korea’s military programs.

“Right now, our focus is on carrying out the existing sanctions and ensuring compliance with the new U.N. Security Council resolution,” a senior White House official told Reuters on Tuesday, adding there was “nothing imminent to announce” on secondary sanctions.

The Trump administration has also been preparing to launch a high-profile investigation of China for intellectual property violations. An announcement was initially planned for last Friday but was postponed, apparently after China softened its resistance to new U.N. sanctions, diplomats said.

U.S. officials said Washington’s patience with China would be limited, however, and it was important to show some progress on North Korea.

“This course of action cannot be sustained indefinitely,” one U.S. official said. “With his approval ratings falling even with his base, Trump is trapped between the realities of dealing with China and his campaign promises to get tough on trade.”

At the same time, U.S. officials acknowledge that even if the sanctions are properly enforced, there is no guarantee they will be any more effective than previous rounds, which have failed to halt steady progress in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.

According to a new U.S. intelligence assessment reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday, North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles, crossing a key threshold. But U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters there was still no reliable evidence that North Korea had fully mastered the process.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‘Two Centuries of Indian Print’ (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

“So far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,” Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

“We are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,” explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. “So over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,” he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

“We want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL’s collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,” Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

“The British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‘Advice for Railway Travellers’ which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can’t seea they are in libraries across the world.” added Gupta.

Nine inmates killed in Mexico prison riot,"The prison system in Tamaulipas, a state racked by the deadly violence of Mexico’s drug cartel wars, had already made bad headlines twice this year. (Representational Image) The prison system in Tamaulipas, a state racked by the deadly violence of Mexico’s drug cartel wars, had already made bad headlines twice this year. (Representational Image)

Nine inmates were killed as gang members stabbed and bludgeoned their rivals to death in a prison brawl in Mexico, authorities have said, the latest deadly violence in the country’s jails. The fight broke out yesterday at a prison in Reynosa, a city near the US border in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.

“Two groups of prisoners were involved in a clash, using weapons such as clubs, stones and shanks,” the state government said in a statement. “Nine inmates died and two were wounded.” The riot broke out on visitation day, and guards “focused their efforts on protecting (inmates’) families,” it said. State police were sent in to bring the brawl under control, firing shots in the air to break it up.

Mexico’s overcrowded prisons are plagued by riots, revenge killings and jailbreaks, and powerful gangs often hold de facto control inside. Last month, 28 inmates were hacked to death by their rivals at a prison in Acapulco, a resort town on Mexico’s Pacific coast.

The prison system in Tamaulipas, a state racked by the deadly violence of Mexico’s drug cartel wars, had already made bad headlines twice this year. In March, 29 inmates escaped through a tunnel from a prison in Ciudad Victoria. And in June, seven people were killed, including three police, when officers stormed the same prison to regain control from inmates who had been stockpiling guns.

Turkey detains Russian IS suspect ‘planning attack on US base’,"Turkish authorities have detained a Russian national suspected to be a member of the Islamic State (IS) group and accused of planning to attack a US base in southern Turkey.

(Source: Reuters/Representational)

Turkish authorities have detained a Russian national suspected to be a member of the Islamic State (IS) group and accused of planning to attack a US base in southern Turkey, a report said on Thursday. Dogan news agency said Renat Bakiev is accused of seeking to “stage a bomb attack aiming to bring down a US plane using a drone” at Incirlik airbase. He is suspected of carrying out reconnaissance work for the plot, the report said, without giving further details.

The United States uses Incirlik, in Adana province, as a key base for operations against the IS jihadist group in neighbouring Syria. Bakiev also carried out preparations for a plot to attack a centre of the Alevi religious minority – an offshoot of the Shia sect of Islam – in Adana city, Dogan said.

Bakiev was detained in Adana, it said. A court will rule on whether he should be remanded in custody. Turkey was hit in 2016 by a succession of attacks that left hundreds dead in the bloodiest year of terror strikes in its history. The attacks were blamed on IS jihadists who had taken swathes of territory in neighbouring Syria and Iraq as well as the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who have battled the Turkish state in an over three decade insurgency.

Thirty-nine people were killed, mainly foreigners in a gun attack by an jihadist gunman on an elite nightclub in Istanbul just 75 minutes into New Year’s Day in 2017. There has since been a lull in similar attacks, but tension and high security remain in big cities.

A local court Thursday sent Vikas Barala, son of Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala, and Vikas’s friend Ashish Kumar to police custody for two days. Both will again be produced in court on August 12. Vikas and Ashish are facing charges of stalking, wrongful restraint and abduction attempt on Haryana IAS officer V S Kundu’s daughter Varnika Kundu.

Amid tight security cover, both the accused were produced in the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM) Barjinder Pal Singh around 2 pm. A large number of police personnel were deployed inside and outside the district courts complex in Sector 43 in Chandigarh.

Public Prosecutor Ravinder Khatana sought two days’ police custody of both the accused on the grounds that the police need them for reconstructing the scene of crime. Khatana said police also require their custody for establishing motive behind the crime.

Objecting to the prosecution’s plea, defense counsel Surya Prakash Garg pleaded “not guilty” for both the accused. He contended that “neither any kidnapping nor any molestation or any other offence was committed”. The defense counsel added that it was “just a media trial”.

The defence counsel added that there was nothing to be recovered from the accused as no weapons were used in the crime and thus police custody was not required. However, the prosecution maintained that custody of the accused was required not only for reconstruction of the scene of crime but also to verify their previous track record and to check if they were involved in any other crime in the past.

In a late-night development, Vikas Barala and Ashish Kumar were taken from Sector 26 police station for the reconstruction of crime scene. The accused, accompanied by DSP Satish Kumar and inspector Devinder Singh, were taken to sector 7, then to Sector 26 and later to Chandigarh Housing Board light point. They were also taken to GMSH-16 for regular medical examination. DSP Satish refused to divulge more details.

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister resigns over alleged scandal,"Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake has put in his papers. (Source: AP) Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake has put in his papers. (Source: AP)

Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigned on Thursday over corruption allegations after being linked to a businessman under investigation for alleged irregularities at a government bond sale. Karunanayake, 54, told Parliament that he was resigning from the Cabinet to create a new political culture in Sri Lanka and ensure that opponents are not able to destabilise the government.

“I am resigning not with any guilt but with pride,” Karunanayake said and dismissed allegations of corruption. Last week, Karunanayake appeared before a presidential commission of inquiry in connection with the bond sale scandal in 2015.

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, a subsidiary of a company owned by the son-in-law of Sri Lanka’s then-central bank chief Arjuna Mahendran, bought more than half of the controversial bond issue on February 27, 2015, prompting charges of a conflict of interest.

Mahendran and his son-in-law, Arjun Aloysius, have denied any wrongdoing. Karunanayake is accused of taking on lease a luxury apartment in Colombo paid for by Aloysius of Perpetual Treasuries.

Karunanayake said his daughter had struck a deal with the apartment owner who was linked to the company under probe over bond sale.

Aloysius’ company had allegedly benefited by insider information on the two Central Bank bond issues in 2015 and 2016.

President Maithripala Sirisena, who came into power promising to end corruption, has been under pressure to act against Karunanayake.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Karunanayake’s resignation had created a new political culture. He said politicians in the past had never resigned when accused of corruption.

‘Venezuelan opposition leader Lopez returned to house arrest’,"Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez (AP Photo/File) Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez (AP Photo/File)

Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was returned to house arrest after being detained in military prison for four days, his wife Lilian Tintori said. “They just moved Leopoldo home,” Tintori wrote on Twitter. “We continue with more conviction and strength for peace and freedom in Venezuela!”

Lopez, 46, was already under house arrest when he was picked up by Venezuelan intelligence services overnight Monday, one day after a vote to choose a powerful constituent assembly tasked with rewriting the constitution. He was first arrested in 2014 and released to home detention last month.

Another high-profile dissident, Antonio Ledezma, 62, was released back to house arrest Friday after being hauled away the same day as Lopez. He had already been in home detention since 2015. Following their arrests the Venezuelan Supreme Court alleged that they had been planning to flee, either into hiding in Venezuela or abroad.

The arrests triggered stern international criticism, with US President Donald Trump saying the pair were “political prisoners being held illegally by the regime,” which he dubbed “the Maduro dictatorship.”

Also yesterday the new assembly loyal to the embattled Maduro fired the country’s attorney general, Luisa Ortega, one of the president’s most vociferous critics, sparking a firestorm of condemnation from the US and Latin American nations.

PCB chairman urges ‘patience’ for revival of international cricket in Pakistan,"Najam Sethi was on Wednesday elected as new PCB chairman. (Source: AP) Najam Sethi was on Wednesday elected as new PCB chairman. (Source: AP)

The newly appointed Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi said that they need to be patient about the revival of international cricket in Pakistan because the matter is related to security situation in the country. “We need to show patience because it is related to the security situation in the country,” said the newly appointed chairman.

Adding to this, Sethi even said that the proposed tour of World XI for three T20 matches can bring some more good news. “We hope to bring a World XI for a three-match Twenty20 series and the next two-three months will bring more good news,” said Sethi.

Moreover, the PCB has invited Sri Lanka to play in Pakistan and Sethi insisted that he would try to get a reply for the same from Sri Lankan board. “We have invited Sri Lanka to play a few matches after their series with us and I will try to get a reply on that invitation,” said Sethi.

Pakistan were discarded from hosting international matches after gunmen attacked Sri Lankan team bus during their tour in 2009 in Lahore. Pakistan though did get a chance to host a short bilateral series that featured Zimbabwe in 2015.

Apart from hosting Zimbabwe, the PCB managed Pakistan Super League 2017 final that featured a number of international cricketers. They have been playing their home matches in United Arab Emirates. Pakistan, who won the Champions Trophy 2017 in June, are now scheduled to face Sri Lanka in two Tests, three ODIs and two T20Is in September-October in UAE.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres — dominated by non-fiction — August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing — and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can’t wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 — but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

* The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told by Muhammad Umar Memon (Aleph)

Selected and translated by writer, editor and translator par excellence Muhammad Umar Memon, the 25 stories in this book represent the finest short fiction in Urdu literature. Every story in the anthology illustrates one or the other facet of the form in the Urdu literary tradition. But even more than for their formal technique and inventiveness, these stories have been included because of their power and impact on the reader. Despairing, violent, passionate, humorous, ironic and profound — the fiction in “The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told” will imprint itself indelibly on your mind.

* Politicshock by Meghnad Desai (Rupa)

In this perceptive account, Meghnad Desai, a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, opens up the debate beyond the West and looks at parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump as two outsiders who broke through the barriers to reach the top. He analyses Asia’s challenge to Western hegemony and asks if the conventional wisdom about the hegemony of free trade liberalism needs re-examination. He peers into the future to look at the greatest challenge facing the world today: Will the Liberal Order survive, collapse or mutate? Is the world at a cusp? Is history — the old saga of blood, sweat and tears — about to resume its course?

* The Epic City: The World on the Streets of Calcutta by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

A masterful and entirely fresh portrait of great hopes and dashed dreams from a major new literary voice. “Everything that could possibly be wrong with a city was wrong with Calcutta” — and yet, after completing his education in the US, Choudhury embodied his parents’ greatest fears by returning to the city they escaped for a better life. Sifting through the chaos and decay for the stories that are ignored by the papers, that don’t fall into any reporter’s beat, “The Epic City” is a soulful, insightful and meticulously researched account of everyday lives and an extraordinary portrait of a city which is a world unto itself.

* India: Priorities for the Future by Bimal Jalan (Penguin)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan’s formidable analysis of the last four decades of India’s economic journey illuminates the nation’s transition from a strictly regulated, slow-growth state enterprise to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Drawing on this vast experience, he compares two distinct periods — 1980-2000 and 2000-15 — to examine the core changes and their significance, and considers their lessons for the immediate future.

140-character exceptions,"External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj. (File) External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj. (File)

On July 27, as Nawaz Sharif’s prime ministership of Pakistan was unravelling, a young Pakistani woman who needed a medical visa tweeted her distress to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. She pleaded that she could not meet a new condition for Pakistanis to be eligible for a medical visa — a letter from the country’s foreign minister — because “my country has no government”. Swaraj tweeted to the Indian High Commissioner: “Gautam Bamabawale ji, inhen visa dey do”.

Issuing orders to the bureaucracy over Twitter may be the new normal, but issuing the medical visa selectively to some in this manner while denying it to others in equal or more distress does no credit to India’s credentials. Earlier in July, Swaraj made a similar exception, granting a 24-year-old young man from Rawalakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, a medical visa for treatment in New Delhi. Osama Ali had been diagnosed with a massive tumour on his liver. His father, a lawyer, had consulted a doctor at a private hospital in Delhi. The doctor had asked them to come to Delhi for treatment, which includes a liver transplant. But they had come up against the same problem: The young man and his family members could not get a medical visa in the normal course because of a new rule that the applicant needed a letter from Sartaj Aziz, then then de facto foreign minister of Pakistan.

After Ali’s case was published in this newspaper, Swaraj announced she was waiving the condition as he was a resident of PoK, territory that belonged to India. Predictably, there was plenty of applause from the galleries for her generosity, and much advice against showing kindness to “traitors”. The father of the young man said he was profusely thankful to the minister.

The medical visa has been one of India’s biggest instruments of soft power in the region, perhaps second only to Bollywood. Treatment at private Indian hospitals, at a fraction of the cost in Europe, America or South-east Asia, draws people here from other countries, especially from the neighbourhood, like a magnet.

Last month, Minister of State for Tourism & Culture Mahesh Sharma told the Rajya Sabha in a written response to a question that the number of foreign nationals arriving in India on medical/medical attendant visas was 1,84,298 in 2014; 2,33,918 in 2015; and 3,61,060 in 2016. Most of them are from South Asia, where none of the other countries have the tertiary healthcare services that India has, though some of them have better national health indices.

While Indian private hospitals have greatly profited from this inflow, India has basked in the reflected glory of the range of expertise Indian specialists provide to fee-paying patients, from treatment of cancers to cardiac diseases, obesity to knee replacements, even though the country itself lags terribly behind on many global health indices. Last year in September, after a deadly bomb blast in Kabul targeting the Hazara community killed 80 people, many survivors arrived for treatment in Delhi. According to a report in The Wire, 53 of the victims were treated at three private Delhi hospitals, with the Hazara expatriate community shouldering the bills for most, and the Indian government also chipping in.

With Pakistan, the medical visa has been a useful way for India to convey that it separates the people from the state. It enabled New Delhi to show itself as helpful and considerate toward Pakistanis even while its relationship with the state teetered between bad and ugly. It was also a way to flaunt to the Pakistani establishment that many of its citizens were voting with their feet for services their own country had failed to provide.

On any given day in Pakistan, there used to be at least six to eight persons applying for a medical visa at the Indian High Commission. The number of medical visas issued could easily run into a couple of thousands a year. The applications were usually dealt with expeditiously, and visas given in a couple of days if the applicant had all the documentation — an Indian doctor’s opinion, and a letter from the doctor saying s/he had accepted the applicant as a patient.

The new condition that the applicant must produce a letter from the foreign minister to the Indian High Commission was introduced in May. When the Indian High Commission began rejecting visas for medical applicants, the Pakistan Foreign Office summoned the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad, Gautam Bambawale, for an explanation.

Publicly, no reason has been given, though Swaraj has appeared to link it to Pakistan’s refusal to give a visit visa to the mother of Kulbhushan Jadhav, sentenced to death by a military court in Pakistan. In a series of tweets on July 10, Swaraj criticised Aziz’s failure to respond to her letter asking for a visa for Jadhav’s mother, though she too drew no direct connection between the two.

Introducing a new obstacle for people in medical distress trying to access healthcare is not just cruel, it makes no diplomatic sense.

But it certainly is of a pattern established over 70 years of India-Pakistan failure to normalise relations: When Indian and Pakistani leaders can’t find other ways to settle scores, they target the most vulnerable of each other’s nationals. It used to be prisoners, now it also includes people needing medical treatment. In truly feudal fashion, exceptions are made to the rule, which make individual actors in the system appear larger than life for their one-time generosity, or win them applause for scoring cheap political points.

“My son’s heart beats for Madam Sushma Swaraj”. Those words were spoken by the grateful parent of a four-month old. In truth, his gushing gratitude only highlighted how India has shut down this window for all the others who need it.

Civil suit is appropriate remedy regarding Gwal Pahari village in Gurgaon: Punjab HC,"The decision has come as a major relief for private parties in the PIL, who had contended that the case should be decided by a civil court and not High Court. The decision has come as a major relief for private parties in the PIL, who had contended that the case should be decided by a civil court and not High Court.

Stating that a civil suit is an appropriate remedy for all pending land disputes of Gwal Pahari village in Gurgaon, the Punjab and Haryana High Court Thursday said it would be improper for it to intervene in the case — where 120 civil suits are pending — at this stage. Instead, it asked the District and Sessions Judge, Gurgaon, to assign similar pending cases to a single court, preferably of a senior division civil judge.

The decision has come as a major relief for private parties in the PIL, who had contended that the case should be decided by a civil court and not High Court. The case had reached the court in April after a Gurgaon-based RTI activist, Harinder Dhingra, filed a PIL seeking a CBI probe in the controversial mutation of 464 acres of prime land in Gwal Pahari village.

The division bench of Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan passed separate orders on disputes related to Metro Valley Business Park Private Limited and ASF Buildwell Private Limited, which have ongoing SEZ projects in the village. Resuming the hearing of the PIL, the bench asked the civil court to decide the case of ASF Buildwell “expeditiously”. It also ordered a status quo with regard to the “construction, alienation, possession and change of land use” till the civil dispute is pending.

However, senior advocate M L Sarin, counsel for Metro Valley Business Park, challenged the maintainability of the PIL and argued that the petition is aimed at “scuttling” his client’s ongoing project. “The petitioner did not disclose to the court that 120 civil suits are pending. I want the petitioner to be prosecuted,” Sarin told the bench. The bench then asked the civil court to decide the land dispute of Metro Valley Business expeditiously, at most within a year.

Man’s Twitter thread on being haunted by a little boy’s ghost will send shivers down your spine,"Shivers down your spine! (Source: Adam Ellis) Shivers down your spine! (Source: Adam Ellis)

Have you heard the joke — ‘A child’s laughter is the most beautiful thing, unless you are on your own and there is no child around.’ Well, that could be a joke, but a man’s Twitter thread which is going viral won’t elicit any laughter from you. Adam Ellis tweeted about the paranormal activity going on in his house, and apparently it all started from the nightmares that he recurrently started having.

The author who has a book of funny comics coming out next year recounted how he started suffering from sleep paralysis and how a child with a ‘mishappened’ head started appearing in his dreams.

He drew a sketch of the boy who he kept seeing in his dreams and shared it on Twitter but he only got clarity when a little girl appeared in his dream. According to Ellis, she walked up to him in a library and asked him, “You’ve seen Dear David, haven’t you?. He’s dead. He only appears at midnight, and you can ask him two questions if you said ‘Dear David’ first. But never try to ask him a third question, or he’ll kill you,” she warned him.

The next time he saw the little boy in his dreams, he asked him how did he die. When the boy told him that there was an accident at the store, he further asked him what had happened, ‘Dear David’ replied that a shelf was pushed on his head and before Ellis could realise it, he had asked him a third question, “Who pushed the self?”

And then, the nightmare actually began. From his cats randomly turning up to stare at the door at midnight to movements near the peephole, Ellis is probably living the nightmares he has been seeing.

So, my apartment is currently being haunted by the ghost of a dead child and he’s trying to kill me. (thread) — ˗ˏˋ ᴀᴅᴀᴍ ᴇʟʟɪs ˊˎ˗‏ (@moby_dickhead) August 7, 2017

For a while he just stared at me, but then he got out of the chair and started shambling toward the bed. — ˗ˏˋ ᴀᴅᴀᴍ ᴇʟʟɪs ˊˎ˗‏ (@moby_dickhead) August 7, 2017

III MEF Marines, MC2 Sarah Villegas/Handout via REUTERS

An Australian Navy survey ship has located a U.S. military aircraft that crashed off the Australian northeast coast at the weekend, killing three Marines, Defence Minister Marise Payne said on Monday. The navy divers will conduct remotely operated underwater vehicle operations before considering sending down divers, Payne said in a statement. The U.S. Defense Department identified the three Marines as First Lieutenant Benjamin Cross, 26, of Oxford, Maine; Corporal Nathaniel Ordway, 21, of Sedgwick, Kansas; and Private First Class Ruben Velasco, 19, of Los Angeles.

Their MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft crashed while on regular operations on Saturday after taking off from the USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) amphibious assault ship, the Marines Corps said. The Marines have described the incident as a “mishap” and said it was under investigation. Twenty-three other personnel aboard the aircraft were rescued.

The Marine Corps said earlier it had shifted from a search-and-rescue effort to a recovery operation, which could last several months. “Royal Australian Navy survey ship Melville arrived in Shoalwater Bay overnight,” Payne said in the statement. “Shortly after commencing survey operations in the area, the submerged aircraft was located.”

2005 Hyderabad blast case: Court acquits all 10 accused,"A Special Investigation Team claimed that Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami (HUJI) of Bangladesh was involved in the blast. A Special Investigation Team claimed that Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami (HUJI) of Bangladesh was involved in the blast.

The Metropolitan Sessions Court at Nampally in Hyderabad on Thursday acquitted the 10 accused in the case of blast at the Hyderabad Commissioner’s Task Force office at Begumpet on October 12, 2005. The court observed that the prosecution could not prove the involvement of the 10 accused in the conspiracy to blow up the Task Force building.

A youth had entered the Task Force building at Begumpet without getting frisked after he told the security guard that he had an appointment with the DCP. However, another guard stopped him and was checking his bag when an explosion happened, killing two persons. A special investigation team of Central Crime Station later identified the youth as Daleen, a Bangladesh national affiliated to the Harkat-ul-Jihad-Islami group.

While the SIT ascertained that the youth carried an improvised explosive device in his backpack, the investigation could not establish whether he was a suicide bomber. The SIT had named at least 14 persons for involvement in the conspiracy.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas pledges to ramp up Gaza sanctions,"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Yuri Kochetkov/Pool photo via AP, File) Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Yuri Kochetkov/Pool photo via AP, File)

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has pledged to increase sanctions on the Gaza Strip, drawing a fresh attack from its Hamas rulers. Abbas, the leader of the internationally-recognised Palestinian government based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been seeking to weaken Islamists Hamas by cutting power supplies to crowded Gaza.

Saturday, he said he would continue with sanctions on the coastal strip, despite UN concerns that it amounts to collective punishment of its two million residents. “We will continue the gradual stopping of financial allocations to the Gaza Strip until Hamas commits to reconciliation” with the Abbas administration, the president said.

“Since the coup, we have paid a billion and a half dollars to the Gaza Strip,” Abbas said, referring to the 2007 overthrow of his Fatah movement by Hamas in Gaza. “We will not allow this to continue,” the WAFA official Palestinian news agency reported him as saying in Arabic.

“Either things will go as they are meant to be, or we will continue to reduce these funds,” he said, accusing Hamas of stealing some of the funds. The Islamist group responded late Saturday in a statement: “Attacking Hamas and threatening the people of Gaza with more sanctions is a blow to reconciliation efforts.”

It accused Abbas’s Palestinian Authority of working with Israel to isolate Gaza and bring suffering to its people. Both sides have previously committed to reconciliation, but repeated attempts have failed. The Palestinian Authority had been paying for some electricity to be delivered to Gaza since 2007, but in recent months has reduced the amount.

Gazans now receive only a couple of hours of electricity a day, delivered from the territory’s own power station and others in Israel and Egypt. The Palestinian Authority has also cut stipends to its former Gaza staff forced out of office by Hamas, in a move analysts see as seeking to sow discontent in the enclave.

Singapore Parliament Speaker Halimah Yacob to contest in presidential election,"Halimah Yacob (Source: Wikimedia Commons) Halimah Yacob (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Singapore’s Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob will contest for presidential election next month, becoming the first woman to run for the highest office.

Halimah, 62, will step down as speaker, a post she has held since 2013, and as an MP for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, The Straits Times reported. She will also resign from the People’s Action Party, where she is a member of the central executive committee.

Announcing her decision, Halimah, who had been in public service for 40 years, told residents and grassroots leaders that, “Taking part in the presidential election would allow me to continue with my service to the people of Singapore.”

The upcoming election is reserved for Malay candidates, following changes to the law last year to ensure the presidency reflects Singapore’s multiracial society. She will also resign from the ruling People’s Action Party, where she is a member of the central executive committee.

“It was a tough decision to make,” Halimah, with her 62-year old husband Mohammed Abdullah Alhabshee alongside her, told reporters. She has been the speaker since 2013 and participated as Malay community leader in the 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2015 general elections.

This year’s presidential election will be held in September. Applications opened on Jun 1 and will close five days after the writ of election is issued sometime this month.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee’s book on India’s coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it — from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore’s grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal’s foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi’s nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam’s last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‘Coal on Sale’, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation — the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‘coal on sale’ to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee’s next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‘Notes from an Auditor’. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai’s tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail — including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India’s energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‘un-put-down-able’ book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen’s Money and Power, any of David Halberstam’s works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie’s books or TN Ninan’s Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that’s the pity.
