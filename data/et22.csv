GOD’S OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura’s alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.“Monkeys.They are chashma chor — spectacle stealing thieves,” he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:“You can’t blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.” We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna’s chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone — holy men, devotees and tourists — entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city’s Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister’s offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings — temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys — starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka’s resignation on August 18 — need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I’ve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India’s boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect — one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal’s remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn’t end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company’s board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company’s website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn’t, as you didn’t in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here’s my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys’ share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn’t end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka’s pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal’s task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don’t I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren’t needed.

Omkar

Sri Lanka coach Pothas distances himself from Chandimal non-selection,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Sri Lanka coach Pothas distances himself from Chandimal non-selection

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 02:11 PM

Sri Lanka suffered a nine-wicket defeat in the series opener © AFP

Sri Lanka's interim coach Nic Pothas distanced himself from the controversial non-selection of middle-order batsman Dinesh Chandimal for the ongoing five-match ODI series against India after his team suffered a humiliating nine-wicket defeat with more than 21 overs to spare on Sunday.

Chandimal, Sri Lanka's best ODI batsman in the last two years and the Test captain, was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe as well. However, he was expected to return for the series against India at his customary number four position.

Instead Sri Lanka's selection panel, headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya, has given Chandimal's position to ODI captain Upul Tharanga while drafting in Chamara Kapugedera to number six, who will complete 100 ODIs in the second game against India at Pallekele, and has only eight half-centuries.

Pothas attended the post-match media briefing and ducked the question relating to Chandimal when he said it was a question that the selectors had to answer. The Chandimal question has been hotly debated in Colombo with several former captains, including Arjuna Ranatunga, Jayasuriya's mentor, questioning his snubbing.

Already whitewashed in the Test series, there was no change of fortunes for the Sri Lankans in coloured clothing as Shikhar Dhawan (132 not out) and captain Virat Kohli (82 not out) added an unfinished 197 runs for the second wicket to guide India to a comprehensive win.

Earlier Sri Lanka had collapsed dramatically after a good start having been asked to bat first. They were 150 for two half way through the innings and then lost eight wickets for 66 runs to be shot out for 216 runs.

Jayasuriya's selection panel has been criticised for lack of consistency and lack of patience. In the last two years, the selectors have used more than 50 players in ODIs, a move that was criticized by Pothas.

""If it was up to me and we had control over what we did, then we could probably give you a timeline (as to when the team will start winning). It's a question you probably need to ask a few other people as well. For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months.

""You'd see massive improvements. These are seriously gifted players. You give them a little bit of time - you give them a little bit of love, a little bit of care, and build up that confidence, you'll see results quick,"" Pothas added.

Sri Lanka were no match to the Indians, who are fielding a second-string attack having rested all their key bowlers. Sri Lanka were completely outplayed in all three departments.

""It swings between hurt and embarrassment. Emotionally you get angry. You get frustrated. Am I angry with the players? Absolutely not. The players work as hard as anyone can ask of them. They've been superb. Support staff have been out of this world. Brilliant.

""They work endless hours with planning and helping the boys. You can't fault anyone within that changing room. Yes, we didn't play our best cricket today. That's pretty obvious. You do get angry. To say ""too many cooks"" is probably accurate.""

"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don’t want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don’t interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that’s the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors’ well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."

"Essar Group: Essar Group says non-compete clause with Rosneft only for 3 years, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: The Russian oil giant Rosneft , which today completed a $12.9 billion takeover of Essar Oil along with a consortium of investors, said the transaction involves a non-compete clause that prevents Essar Group from re-entering oil refining and retailing forever, a claim strongly refuted by the Ruias.Earlier in the day, while addressing the media, Essar Oil's new non-executive director, Jonathan Kollek , said, ""They (Essar Oil) cannot build a refinery, they cannot build petrol stations. There is a non-compete, forever.""However, in the evening, Essar Group, in a statement, denied the longevity of the non-compete clause and said the clause is for three years only.""The non-compete clause is only for a limited period of three years, after which this clause is no more applicable,"" Essar spokesperson clarified.The Ruais will continue to run their refinery in Britain, wherein they have 9 million tonnes of facility at Stanlow and also their coal bed methane blocks in the country.Kollek said that Rosneft will pay a royalty to Essar Group for using the brand name of Essar Oil at the over 3,500 petrol pumps, which are also part of the deal.However, the new management, which includes appointees from the new owners --Russian oil major OAO Rosneft, and a consortium of Russian private equity fund UCP and Swiss commodity company Trafigura -- did not divulge the fees paid.""That (fee) is part of the commercial terms.

That is part of the overall valuation,"" Tony Fountain, the newly-appointed chairman of Essar Oil, told reporters earlier in the day.He said only commercial considerations were the sole driving factor behind the $12.9 billion acquisition of Essar Oil.""The core of the deal the way it ended up is based on commercial valuation...they (new owners) are looking to make commercial returns, they want this to be commercially successful,"" Fountain said.The $12.9 billion deal, the largest FDI inflow into the country as also the largest investment out of Russia, was announced first by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladmir Putin during the annual BRICS Summit in Goa last October and got concluded today.Fountain today said Ruias will continue to hold 1 per cent in Essar Oil even after the deal, through a 2 per cent holding in the consortia of Trafigura and UCP.""I don't want to speak about their intention of how long they intend to hold that, but we are certainly assuming that they will be with us with that investment,"" he said.Fountain said the new owners' intention is to run the company with highest standards of corporate governance followed all over the world.The company said it feels the Essar brand is ""very strong"" and will be retaining the same at the petrol pumps. It will also be continuing with an ongoing plan to ramp up the number of fuel stations to 6,000 from the present 3,500 in the ""near term"".The company has part-paid a few loans and will take $5 billion of loans into its book, including $4 billion in term loans and working capital facilities of $1 billion.When asked about the over $2.4 billion owed to Iranian companies for crude sourcing, Fountain said it is a part of the overall deal consideration of $12.9 billion but is not included in the $5 billion debt that it is taking.The liability will be extinguished soon, he added.He said Essar Oil will honour every contract on products and crude side, replying to a question whether it will continue to source crude from Iran and Venezuela as per earlier agreements or go for Russian crude.It can be noted that in 2015 Essar Oil had entered into one-year contract with Rosneft to purchase crude form them. Russia has the largest crude reserves in the world and Rosneft is the largest publicly traded oil and gas company in the world in terms of production as well as reserves.Fountain, however, was quick to add that for new contracts, maximising the returns will be the only priority.EOL today announced the name of Trafigura's chief financial officer B Anand as the new chief executive, replacing Lalit Gupta, who will continue to be associated with the company as a senior advisor.Fountain said the new board has asked the management to come up with an asset development plan which may include strategies on inorganic growth and also verticals to be entered into like engineering, procurement and construction.When asked about state-run LIC continuing to have a representation on the board (its executive director R Sudarsan is on the board), Fountain said once LIC is paid their dues, the board representation will be cancelled.On the fate of the minority shareholders, who will continue to hold over 1.7 per cent of the company, he said a plan will be drawn in to understand what to do with this lot."

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"Hope for the best, but expect less","I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine. -Bruce Lee

A friend’s status update on a social media site: ‘Who hurt you? My own expectations.’

Yes, we all have expectations in our lives: what we want out of life and who we want to become. I believe one of the keys to happiness lies within the management of your expectations of people and circumstances. If you do not have expectations, you can never be disappointed. Often we tend to believe that the way we treat others will be the way we are treated in return. But, unfortunately, this does not always happen.

The biggest disappointments in our lives are often the result of misplaced expectations. This is especially true when it comes to our relationships and interactions with others. You need to make sure you enter into relationship with someone who has as big of a heart as you do. If you do not, you may feel as if you are being taken advantage of. You need to find people who appreciate what you do for them and who will reciprocate those actions.

There are two ways to be happy: improve your reality or lower your expectations. Having realistic expectations will allow you to accept the flaws each person has. We need to learn how to take responsibility for our own lives and our own decisions before we can expect others to do the same.

One of the biggest challenges we face in life is learning to accept people for who they truly are. Once you realize that your expectations cannot change people, the better off you will be. Give without expectation, accept without reservation, and love with hesitation. Unrealistic expectations most often do lead to disappointment. Too many people are obsessed with finding the perfect career or the perfect spouse, and as a result become increasingly frustrated when this does not happen in reality.

Expectation is the root of all heartache. Try to remain confident while maintaining positive aspirations; just remember not to make the aspirations so high that they are impractical or unreachable.

Acceptance is an amazing trait that needs to be actively worked toward. When things do not work out the way we had planned, it is much more beneficial to realize that is how life works rather than becoming frustrated at the situation. Have hope rather than expectations and you will tend not to be as disappointed.

People rarely behave exactly the way you want them to. Hope for the best, but expect less. And remember, the magnitude of your happiness will be directly proportional to your thoughts and how you choose to think about things. Even if a situation or relationship doesn’t work out at all, it’s still worth it, if it made you feel something new, taught you something afresh."

"Piyush Goyal: Centre rejigs PPA, takes the wind out of state power discom bullies, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The Centre has taken a stern view of state distribution companies violating contracts by bullying solar and wind power developers to cut prices, which bankers say will discourage lenders and investors.The minister for power, coal, renewable energy and mines, Piyush Goyal , has expressed concern at the development and has opposed violation of contracts that have already been signed. Goyal is spearheading India’s massive expansion of renewable energy capacity, which has made India a world leader in growth of wind and solar generation.“The government view is very clear that the legal framework has to be respected.All PPAs, whatever the legal terms are, they will be respected. But if a PPA has a mutual negotiation clause, and somebody is willing to do it, then what can be done?” he told ET.Fierce competition in solar and wind power auctions along with falling prices of equipment have helped tariffs tumble to record lows, making older projects look very costly. This has prompted many state discoms to ask project developers to sell electricity at the lowest available rate even if the contract for a particular plant was signed when costs were much higher.A government official said the Centre was considering sending an advisory to states, cautioning them about the adverse implications of their efforts to arm-twist companies to cut rates. The Indian Banks Association has also written to the power and finance ministries saying that the action by states was threatening the viability of projects, which in turn would make their loans risky.States where project developers are being pressured to cut tariffs include Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, UP and Jharkhand. Government officials said that renewable energy projects are a key part of India’s efforts to meet its climate commitments and to reduce the use of polluting fossil fuels, and the effort to promote clean energy has the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At a recent meeting with the wind developers and state nodal agencies for renewable energy, newly appointed secretary of the renewable energy ministry, Anand Kumar, expressed great surprise at the deluge of complaints from developers. Most of them related to state discoms trying to go back on their commitments on wind energy.He promised to do something about the matter and also told them to keep filing petitions before the appropriate forums. Subsequently, there has been a meeting of state regulators with MNRE officials at which issues raised by developers were discussed with them. Thereafter MNRE has also been in touch with the power secretaries of different states pointing out the problems that have arisen and urging them to get their discoms to behave and honour commitments.Kumar also wants power purchase agreements to be honoured unless there is an issue of irregularity or corruption."

Return To Summit: Rafael Nadal claws his way back to No.1,"In what can only be described as a Herculean effort, Spanish tennis ace Rafael Nadal has returned to the World No.1 ranking beginning his fourth stint at the pinnacle of the men’s game. Rafa’s return to the top nine years after he first made it there is also unprecedented. This after he had to cut short his season last year due to a wrist injury. Plus, before he started his 2017 season, there were doubts about his return to top form. Some so-called experts speculated that Rafa’s battered and bruised body – thanks to his aggressive style of play – was finally giving up on him. They even opined that the game had gone beyond him with a new crop of exciting players such as Dominic Thiem, Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic finally making their mark.

How wrong were they! After incorporating Carlos Moya into his coaching team, Rafa roared into the 2017 season. Not only did he reach the final of the Australian Open – going down to his great rival Roger Federer in another riveting encounter – but he also tore up the clay court season – as Federer had predicted – completing an unprecedented decima (10 titles) each at the Roland Garros, Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open.

At 31, few will argue that Rafa hasn’t achieved enough. With 15 Grand Slam titles under his belt, Rafa has already etched his name into the annals of tennis history. True, he might no longer be the indomitable force he was in 2008 or 2010. But what Rafa has shown – and younger tennis players need to learn – in the last few years is his incredible ability to adapt his game to what his body can deliver. In this context, Rafa has made his game sharper, taking more risks and chasing down fewer balls on the defence. He has continuously worked on his serve, getting it to eke out that little extra.

Making such adjustments requires a player to constantly assess both his abilities as well as those of his opponents. And it is this desire to improve continuously that sets Rafa apart from the rest. In fact, Rafa today regains the No.1 spot not because he is head and shoulders above the other players on court. He is back at the summit because he is a tireless worker who is unfazed by the injuries and challenges that come his way. In that sense, this ascent of Rafa’s is typical of those matches where he slowly grinds his opponents to dust. Rafa is a warrior who never gives up. He finds a way to win even when the chips are down. And he can be No.1 even when he is not playing in God mode. That’s what is really scary for Rafa’s opponents. May Rafa continue to enthral us for years to come. Vamos Rafa!"
Facebook Is Working On AR Glasses That Will Beam Pictures And Videos Straight To Your Eyes!,"Last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off renders of augmented reality glasses the company was working on, though he didn’t reveal much else. Now, we know a few more details thanks to a patent filed by Oculus’ advanced research division.

The application, obtained by Business Insider, is for a “waveguide display with two-dimensional scanner that may augment views of a physical, real-world environment with computer-generated elements.”

Basically, a wave-guide system uses light to project images directly into a user’s eyes. It’s similar to Microsoft’s own AR headset, the HoloLens, as well as Magic Leap’s own secret mixed reality device. Indeed, Business Insider even points out that one of the patent application’s authors, Pasi Saarikko, originally worked on HoloLens before joining Oculus.

Aside from broadcasting images and videos on top of the real world view, the device can also play audio from connected headphones or speakers. The application also indicates Facebook wants the device to look more like regular glasses than other chunky headsets currently in development.

At the F8 developer conference last year, Zuckerberg said that one of the goals was to put Facebook right in people’s faces, should they choose it. Whether the company can develop components small enough to actually make a device of that size is another matter entirely."

"UP government slashes medical education budget by 50%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LUCKNOW: As the death of 23 children in a single day in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) grabs national headlines, a sharp cut by the Aditya Nath Yogi government in the budgetary allocation for medical education this year is raising questions. That's because this is the head under which the BRDMC, like other state-run colleges, receives funds.The budgetary allocation for 14 such medical colleges and their associated teaching hospitals has been pared to less than half from Rs 2,344 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,148 crore for 2017-18. The allocation for BRDMC followed the pattern, plunging from Rs 15.9 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 7.8 crore for 2017-18. More specifically, its allocation for machines/equipment was slashed from Rs 3 crore to just Rs 75 lakh.The budgetary allocation fell across all medical colleges. For example, the medical colleges in Kanpur and Allahabad saw their allocations come down from Rs 15.9 crore each to Rs 3.3 crore and Rs 4.2 crore, respectively."
"salary hike: Standoff between Coal India management, unions over salary hikes, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","KOLKATA: Coal India management has said it cannot afford the extent of salary hike its unions are asking because its fund position would not permit. Unions, however, are not ready to accept this, creating a standoff with the management at the last three-day meeting which ended inconclusively on Saturday. Coal India will now make a fresh assessment of its fund position to see if it can raise its offer and has scheduled another meeting on August 24.Unions are not ready to accept Coal India’s inadequate financial position reasoning because they feel excessive dividend payment and fund transfer to the government under the buyback scheme has depleted its fund leaving less than adequate money for workmen salary hike.While unions had initially demanded a 50% hike this time, they later bought it down to 21% but Coal India management says it can afford a 15% hike since its funds position would not permit more.“We have been asking for an additional Rs 5,600 crore on account of salaries of workmen but the Coal India management want to offer about Rs 4,500 crore. However, we will not accept anything below 21%,” said BK Rai representing coal workers on behalf of BMS at Coal India.“Workmen salaries accounts for as much as 52% of cost of production of one tone of coal,” said a senior Coal India executive.SQ Zama, general secretary of Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation under INTUC, said: “Due to wrong government policies, excessive payment to government through dividend and buyback scheme, the company’s net worth has halved from its level of 2012-13. Higher dividend, the buyback scheme, lack of scientific assessment and proper planning towards factual demandsupply of coal and power has caused damage to the financial strength of the company.”The monopoly has been making provisions for a salary hike since June 2016. According to officials they have been making a provision of Rs 700 crore each quarter that totals Rs 2,800 per year.In 2016-17, Coal India spent around Rs 33,000 crore on account of salaries of its employees. Out of this as much as Rs 28,000 crore was spent on account of salaries for some 3 lakh workmen. Rest were for officers.Every five years, all central workmen unions negotiate with the management for a salary hike through a series of meetings.Validity of the last pay hike expired on June 312016. Following this four unions at Coal India submitted their demand which is about 50% higher than the present pay structure. In 2011, unions placed their demands separately with the Coal India management."
Jinder Mahal Is Still King Of The Ring As He Successfully Defends His WWE Title At SummerSlam,"Jinder Mahal defended his WWE Championship for the third time defeating Shinsuke Nakamura at WWE pay-per-view SummerSlam 2017 at the Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York on Sunday. Mahal thus extended his title reign to 91 days.

Youtube

Nakamura was the odds on favourite to win, and Mahal's win is somewhat of an upset considering the match was a quite a short on for a title match. It sure seemed a rushed ending as Nakamura, who was on the offensive early on, had to deal with the Singh Brother - Sunil and Samir - on the outside and that allowed Mahal to take advantage and hit his finisher, The Khallas, on Nakamura to retain the title.

Battle over quit India: Modi boisterously appropriates what Congress believes to be its family heirloom,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been thinking on his feet, as it were, on the issue of hitching his party to the bandwagon of freedom struggle. He is celebrating, with all the fervour that he can muster, the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement of 1942, the 70th anniversary of India’s independence, and he is planning grand celebrations for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 and the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022.

It has become clear by now that Modi believes hugely in atmospherics. The main opposition party, Congress, feels left out and more than a little peeved by the PM’s boisterous appropriation of the freedom struggle, which the grand old party of India believes to be its family heirloom.

Congress leaders have always been contemptuous of the Hindu right-wing and they have forever taunted their ideological adversaries for having never taken part in the freedom struggle. Of course, the charge is unfair in historical terms. There were many who did not believe in the politics of agitation popularised by Mahatma Gandhi from 1920 onwards which placed the Congress party in the lead position, but who had been looking at other ways of gaining independence from British suzerainty.

The Muslim League was never part of the agitational approach of Gandhi’s Congress, and neither were many other sections like the Zamindars, the Unionist Party in Punjab, the Justice Party in the Madras presidency and the Krishak Samaj Party in Bengal. One of the prominent leaders who did not accept Gandhi’s extra-constitutional approach was BR Ambedkar.

So, if the case is to be argued as to whether people who did not court prison and raise anti-British slogans did not fight for freedom from the British, then it would be an argument that would be difficult to sustain. There were different political groups and each dealt with the British keeping in mind what they believed to be their own interests. There is little doubt that Congress had a broader viewpoint than all the others put together. It claimed to speak for the whole country, for all the groups and all the regions. The others contested the Congress claim to be representing all.

This was specially so in the case of Muslim League. The Hindu right-wingers were indeed in a quandary because they could not say that Congress did not represent the Hindu majority. As a matter of fact, the League dubbed the Congress as the party of the Hindus. There was no room in the arena for other Hindu sectional interests. Hindu Mahasabha leaders like MR Jayakar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya continued to exert influence in Congress. In a way, communal Hindu elements found a voice within Congress. Nehru and others were aware of this and greatly resented their presence.

Modi has turned the argument over whether one participated in the freedom struggle on its head by asserting that present day India ruled by BJP derives inspiration from the 1942 Quit India Movement to transform India. In contrast, all that Congress president Sonia Gandhi could bring herself to say was that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had moved the Quit India resolution on August 9, 1942. Sonia was clutching a twig of history, while Modi took upon himself the burden of carrying the spirit of Quit India Movement, at least by way of rhetoric, to transform India of today.

Congress has now been reduced to a party which clings to memories of the past, invoking its heroism of long ago to seek solace in its bleak present and infuriated by the Modi strategy of appropriating the heritage of the freedom movement for BJP with much panache. It can be said that Modi’s words and gestures sound hollow because he does not really believe in the Gandhian morality of loving the adversary. And most importantly, he is not able to come to terms with Gandhi’s proclaimed political heir, Nehru.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no hesitation in looking up to the Nehruvian legacy because Vajpayee had greater self-confidence than Modi does. The prime minister’s belligerence in what he says and what he does not say betrays a brittle sense of his own self. But he is moving in the right direction by acknowledging loudly and clearly events like the Quit India Movement which was essentially a Congress ploy.

It can be seen in retrospect that the Quit India Movement was a historical blunder because the Muslim League and others became stronger between 1942 and 1945. Many Congress leaders, including Nehru, were not comfortable with Gandhi’s decision. Though it was a tactical blunder, Gandhi was right in going ahead with it because all the Congress leaders were imprisoned, and when they came out of prison at the end of the war, they were burnished heroes who had paid the price for refusing to go with the British war effort.

But no Congress leader of the day ever showed any resentment towards the bureaucracy, towards the Indian armed forces who participated in World War II, nor with the industrialists and many others from different walks of life who were not in the Quit India Movement. Congress in 1945 carried everyone else with it. Modi seems to be trying to appropriate the legacy of the freedom struggle with barely a nod towards Congress. Congress’s anger is palpable."
"Kolkata hospitals say they can't lower rates, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representative image.

KOLKATA: Private hospitals in Kolkata have made it clear to the West Bengal Health Regulatory Commission that they won’t be able to sustain operations by lowering their existing charges. Asked to explain why their rates were higher than the Swasthya Sathi rates, prescribed by the state government to provide treatment at reasonable charges to the underprivileged, hospitals have pointed out that their operational expenses and technological investment costs were too high to be matched with the suggested rates without compromising with the quality of service. Hospitals were asked to respond to the commission by August 15.While each hospital has sent its response individually to the commission, several had got together last week for an informal discussion among themselves. “Our cost explanation is accompanied by a covering letter which makes it clear that charges are consistent with the operational expenses and technological input costs which are necessary for high quality healthcare and satisfactory clinical outcomes. We have to spend on upgrading our instruments and machinery which is a huge cost. Our running expenses, too, can’t be lowered any further,” said R Ventkatesh, zonal director – east, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences ( RTIICS ).The RTIICS letter also seeks further 'advice from the health commission’ and has sought a further meeting with the commission. “Since everything can’t be explained in a letter, we are expecting an interaction that would help us take the discussion forward. In that meeting, we plan to have our own experts to present our case,” added Venkatesh. Belle Vue Clinic, too, has pleaded its inability to revise charges. The hospital has re-sent an earlier letter to the commission, in which it had mentioned that the existing charges can’t be scaled down. “We have not explained our existing rates, but mentioned that they can’t be revised,” said P Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue."
"IIT Madras turbine may generate power from ocean waves, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","CHENNAI: A team of 25 faculty members and students from the ocean engineering department in Indian Institute of Technology Madras have begun testing a prototype of a turbine they have developed which converts wave energy into electricity. The ‘impulse’ turbine works with a unidirectional rotor powered by a generator. The system will be tested in oceans by the end of the year.Associate professor Abdus Samad said the turbine prototype was selected from close to 30 different designs with different number of blades in the rotor. All the designs were tested through computer simulations and the design parameters of the turbine was optimized through numerical modelling. The power output for all the turbine designs was calculated before one simple commercially viable design was chosen to be developed into a prototype.Unlike wind turbines that generate electricity from wind energy with three blades, the impulse turbine rotors will have more than 20 blades. “We have tested the turbine for a three-minute duration and the data is being analysed,” he said. “We have chosen a simple design that has just one moving element so the system is more reliable and lasts longer.”Scientists said the turbine works on a ‘oscillating water column theory’ where the system has a water column that acts like a piston moving up and down as the waves hit forcing air out and back into the chamber. This airflow is then converted into energy.Wave energy has potential to produce 40 GW to supply to the Indian grids, approximately 13% of the total production capacity in India, the team said. Another advantage is that the energy density per square meter of wave energy is 5 and 10 times more than the wind and solar energy, respectively.Samad said their challenge is to create a design with high efficiency in the midst of extreme weather conditions like tsunami. “There is so far no wave energy convertor that has been commercialized anywhere in the world. There are more than 1000 patents in the world including in Japan and Europe for wave energy convertors but only a few have been tested,” he said."
The Congress’s idea of India exposed,"Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.

In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen’s Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.

Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?

India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.

For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.

It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.

Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan’s ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.

For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.

Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?"
DU's Zero Cut-Off For Ph.D. Admissions For SC/ST Students Is Driving Everyone Up The Wall!,"So, for Ph.D. Mathematics, the qualifying marks is a big, round zero?!

"Amid The Triple Talaq Debate In India, A Saudi Man Divorces Wife For 'Walking Ahead'","The Supreme Court has, in a majority decision, ruled that Triple Talaq is unconstitutional and asked the government to form a new law. However, this wisdom is yet to reach other parts of the world. Although Saudi Arabia does not allow instant talaq like India, a man has divorced his wife for walking ahead of him despite repeated warnings, a media report said.

BBC/Representational Image

The man, who was not identified, gave his wife repeated warnings to keep a step behind him, but she kept walking ahead of him after which, he divorced her, The Gulf News quoted the Saudi daily Al Watan as saying.

In another case, a Saudi man divorced his wife after she forgot to put the sheep head -- ""the most important part of the dinner"" -- on the main dish presented by her husband as he hosted his friends for dinner, the report said.

Representational Image

The woman said that after the guests left, her angry husband accused her of embarrassing him by forgetting to present the most important part of the dinner to his guests.

In another case, a husband divorced his wife during their honeymoon for wearing foot bangles.

Humood Al Shimmari, an official who conducts marriages, said that there has been a spurt in divorce cases in the last two years.

Arab News/Representational Image

He said that while there are many reasons including evolving views towards traditions and social norms, modern technology was the key culprit.

Lateefa Hamid, a social consultant in Saudi Arabia, said: ""Families should educate their young men and women and encourage them to engage in psychological, social and religious awareness and education programmes that will protect future spouses from family problems"".

Alastair Cook's match-winning 243 against Windies in the Pink Ball Test has helped him close the gap on fifth-ranked Virat Kohli in the latest ICC Test rankings for batsmen.

This is the fourth time in his career that the left-hander has amassed a 200 plus score, which helped him jump six spots to sixth place - the best ranking he has achieved since he reached number five in March 2013.

The England opener was instrumental in bailing his side out of trouble from 39 for 2 in the first innings. He also shared a 248-run stand for the third wicket with captain Joe Root, who himself gained 14 points after recording his 13th Test hundred to retain his second place behind Australia's Steven Smith.

Although there was no change in the top 20 among the bowlers, James Anderson and Stuart Broad picked up 15 and six points to narrow the gap on the first-ranked Ravindra Jadeja and sixth placed Kagiso Rabada respectively.

31-year-old Broad, who bagged five wickets in the game, surpassed Ian Botham's tally of 383 wickets to become England's second highest wicket-taker in Tests.

"Watchman's 15-YO Son Returns Lost Diamonds Worth Rs 40 Lakh, Gets Cash Reward Of Rs 41,000","A watchman's 15-year-old son, who found a packet containing 700-carat diamonds worth Rs 40 lakh while playing cricket at diamond street of Mahidhapura here on August 15, returned it to its rightful owner when he came searching for it.

TOI

Vishal Upadhyay, a Class XI student residing at Mahidhapura's Jadakhadi, was rewarded with a cash prize of Rs 30,000 by Mansukh Savaliya, owner of the diamonds, and Rs 11,000 by Surat Diamond Association (SDA) president Babu Gujarati for his honesty on Saturday.

""I am so indebted to the young boy for returning my diamond packet. It would have been a big loss, had I not found the packet. I would have to sell my house to repay my creditors. The boy saved me and my family,"" Mansukh said, adding that he narrowed down his area of search after going through CCTV footage.

Vishal found the packet containing diamonds while playing cricket at the diamond street with his friends.His friend hit the ball in the parking area on the roadside and Vishal chased it. When he was looking for the ball in the parking area, he laid his hands on the diamond packet tucked beneath a two-wheeler.

CNN/Representational Image

""I returned home and kept the packet safely without informing my parents. I thought I would find the rightful owner and return the packet to him. On the third day, the packet owner came looking for the packet. I heard the conversation and immediately followed him. I told him that the packet was with me,"" said Vishal, whose mother stitches clothes and elder brother works in an accountant's office. ""I remember losing a Rs 50 note in the street given by my mother. That day I could not eat. I kept on thinking about the pain and agony through which the person who lost the diamond packet may be going through,"" said Vishal, who lives with five family members in a tiny tin-shed room.

Asked what he will do with the Rs 41,000 reward, he said, ""I will use the money for my studies. I want to make it big one day. I want to give a quality life to my mother and father."" Vishal's father Phulchand Upadhyay is employed as a watchman on a monthly wage of Rs 8,000 in a building housing diamond offices in Mahidhpura.

"Android 8.0 Oreo Is Here, With Awesome Features Never Before Seen On Google's Mobile OS!","The latest version of Android is finally out in the wild, and it’s called Android Oreo, as most people guessed. Google, for some reason, made the decision to reveal the new OS’ name and launch details at an event in New York City, coinciding with the eclipse last night.

Google has traditionally named its major Android releases after sweet treats, starting with Android 1.5 ‘Cupcake’. Android 4.4 ‘KitKat’’ was the only one so far to receive a brand-associated name, with the others being more generic, but Oreo is such a recognizable name for a sweet snack starting with ‘O’ that Google likely didn’t have any other choice with Android 8.0.

Android Oreo brings a number of new features to the OS, both convenience tools and aesthetic tweaks. For instance, Android O brings a new picture-in-picture feature, so you can multitask with two apps at once using floating windows. There are also notification dots on apps, like those you put on your home screen, that light up to show you there’s something new. Just tap these to take a look and act immediately.

The new version also claims to be a safer app platform, with Google Play Protect built in. The OS has also been tweaked to reduce battery consumption from apps running in the background. And for those of you used to talking in anything other than words, the blob emoji is now dead. Android Oreo now has redesigned emoji taking their place, as well as 60 new versions available.

Of course, you won’t actually be able to experience Android Oreo just yet. The company has officially pushed the OS out of public beta testing and onto its Android Open Source Project, meaning Google devices like the Pixel, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C will receive over-the-air updates soon.

Those already enrolled in the beta program will receive the version today. For everyone else, Google says it’s working with partners like Essential, HMD (Nokia), Huawei, HTC, Kyocera, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp and Sony, and they’re all scheduled to launch or upgrade devices to Android 8.0 Oreo by the end of the year.

Learn from Khatauli – the habits of ‘jugaad’ and ‘chalta hai’ are incompatible with rail safety,"Prima facie it appears that the train derailment at Khatauli on Saturday, mangling up the Utkal Express, could have been avoided, if the prescribed mandatory operating procedure had been observed.

Preliminary enquiries suggest that after detecting a crack in a ‘glued joint’ the engineering staff asked for a 20 minute ‘block’ for repairs, yet the repair work was taken up without authority – in gross violation of the safety protocol.

Indian Railways’ general and subsidiary rules lay down that, in case of emergency, repairs to the track may be carried out after taking mandatory precautions such as exhibiting ‘Stop’ signals. Further, a senior engineering official must first bring the train to a stop and advise the train driver through a written memo about the need to stop the train, and simultaneously arrange to send a message to the station master and obtain his written confirmation. This essential drill was not followed and elementary safety norms were violated.

Pending a detailed probe by the commissioner of railway safety, in a rather unprecedented move, a central government secretary level technocrat – member of the railway board in charge of the engineering department – has been summarily sent on leave, along with the two top jurisdictional officers – the general manager of the northern railway zone and the divisional railway manager of the Delhi division. In addition, the zonal chief track engineer has been moved out on transfer, while the senior divisional engineer, among other junior engineering officials, has been suspended.

Much as the swift and stern action by government underlines its stated ‘zero tolerance for unsafe rail operations’, the fact remains that most political dispensations have followed warped priorities with respect to the nation’s lifeline, leaving it battered and bruised.

Elsewhere in the world, today technology enables fatality-free rail travel. Japan’s Shinkansen ‘bullet’ trains have been operating without fatality for over 50 years. These technologies demand a modern mindset, appropriate management structure, and skilled workforce. With more than 85% of its train accidents ascribed to ‘human failure’, IR has also been constantly investing in newer technologies, mechanisation of maintenance, upgradation of track structure, including higher capacity long welded rails, their ultrasonic testing, on-track and digital machines, and electronic monitoring of track geometry.

With highly expensive and sophisticated equipment steadily ploughed into IR, along with myriad technological aids increasingly made available for maintenance, the extent of assets failures that still occur is unacceptable. IR’s assets failures, jeopardising safety, show a disturbing trend: rail track fractures and weld failures increased from 3,237 in 2015-16 to 3,546 in 2016-17; diesel and electric locomotives failures remained at about the level of 4,500 in the year, and detachment of passenger coaches from trains run in excess of 810; failures of overhead electric wires increased from 378 in 2015-16 to 447 in 2016-17; signalling equipment failures were of the order of 1,30,200 in 2016-17.

While the enquiry commissioned by IR will establish the cause of Saturday’s accident, safety is itself symptomatic of operational efficiency and discipline, to be viewed as integral to all operations. The glaring fault lines of the Khatauli accident expose IR’s silo-based set-up, where departmental compartmentalisation loses sight of the overall organisational goals including safety.

The Anil Kakodkar led rail safety committee report echoed the prevalent public perception of IR’s creeping infirmities: “Centralised, top heavy and hierarchical along departmental lines.” It also emphasised the status quo ante to be restored for senior general management posts, to be manned only by those well versed in train operation, much like the senior command posts in the defence establishment are filled mostly by the fighting arms.

Still the non-implementation bug bites, not IR alone; and selective amnesia has been government’s forte. It is definitely time for change, for a new way of thinking in the rail industry, to enable IR to regain primacy in the country’s transport domain, to become the economy’s engine of growth. There should be no place for an attitude of just ‘jugaad’, or, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed, of ‘chalta hai’."

Gayle, Samuels return to Windies squad for England ODIs

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 07:10 PM

Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels have been included in the 15-member Windies squad for the five-match One-Day International series in England, Cricket West Indies announced on Monday (August 21). Jerome Taylor too returns to ODI fold after more than a year.

Sunil Ambris, the uncapped right-handed opener from Guyana, was also included in the side while other notable omissions from the squad were Dwayne Bravo, Darren Bravo and Carlos Brathwaite.

Courtney Browne, the chairman of selection panel, though confirmed Dwayne was considered for selection but isn't fully fit yet. ""With regards to the selection of the ODI squad, the panel welcomes back Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who will both add value to our batting and help with the nurturing of the young batsmen in the team,"" he said.

""Both Sunil Narine and Darren Bravo have declined to be considered for ODIs in England. Narine has however confirmed his desire to play 50-over cricket again but has asked to play in our Regional Super50 before he is considered and Darren said he was not available for selection. Dwayne Bravo said he is still not 100% fit, but is looking at a possible return to international cricket next year.""

Ambris was part of the Windies squad that took on India at home for the last three ODIs but he didn't get a game. He has played 35 first-class games and has 1622 runs at an average of 28.96. His List A record though is much better as he averages 51.71 after 20 games and has scored 724 runs.

Gayle last played an ODI in the World Cup 2015 quarterfinal clash against New Zealand while Samuels's last outing for the national side came in October last year against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi.

Brathwaite continues to be left out of the side despite being the Twenty20 International captain. Kieran Powell, Jonathan Carter and Roston Chase too have been axed from the side. Dwayne Bravo has been playing for the Trinbago Knight Riders, having returned from a long hamstring injury lay-off that he picked up during the last edition of Big Bash League.

Darren Bravo, who ruled himself out of contention, is however eligible for selection after offering an apology to the board after his outrage on Twitter.

After the three-Test series, Windies play a one-off T20I before travelling to Manchester for the first ODI on September 19. The remaining four ODIs will be played in Nottingham, Bristol, London and Southampton on September 21, 24 27 and 29 respectively.

They will also take on Ireland in Stormont on September 13 in a one-off ODI before the limited-overs series in England.

Windies are looking to boost their chances of earning a direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup after having slipped to the ninth position in the ODI rankings. However, they will be forced to play the qualification tournament if Sri Lanka win at least two matches in their five-match series at home against India. Sri Lanka have 88 points while Windies have 78. Two wins for Sri Lanka will take them to 90 points, putting it beyond Windies's reach no matter how the ODI series in England pans out.

Squad: Sunil Ambris, Devendra Bishoo, Miguel Cummins, Chris Gayle, Jason Holder (captain), Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Evin Lewis, Jason Mohammed (Vice Captain), Ashley Nurse, Rovman Powell, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor and Kesrick Williams.

Playing county helps to grow as a cricketer: Pujara

Prasad RS • Last updated on Tue, 22 Aug, 2017, 05:45 AM

""I had played in Sri Lanka during the 2015 series and that gave me a lot of confidence"" - Pujara © Getty

Cheteshwar Pujara was one of the standout performers at the recently-concluded Test series in Sri Lanka - scoring 309 runs in three games which included two centuries. In a chat with TOI, the 29-year-old spoke on what makes the Indian team an all-conquering unit, the importance of county cricket and more. Excerpts:

How would you sum up the recently-concluded Test series in Lanka?

Going into the Test series, I wanted to continue batting the way I have in the last one-and-half years. I was well-prepared for it, since I went to play county cricket (for Nottinghamshire) ahead of the series. Also, I had played in Sri Lanka during the 2015 series and that gave me a lot of confidence.

How did the county stint in Nottinghamshire shape your game?

Playing county cricket is about being in that environment and batting on those wickets which seam and have a bit of bounce. It's all about getting the experience and nothing related to your technique. Once you reach a certain point (in your career), your technique is very much decided and all you need to do is fine-tune it.

Ashwin too will play county cricket for Worcestershire. How much of help would that be when India tour England next year?

If you start playing county cricket, you start having an idea about how to perform in those conditions. I believe county cricket helps you grow as a cricketer. I feel if you want to play Test cricket and aim to do well in different venues, county cricket is the way to go. I will soon be heading back to play a few more games for my county .

With 2019 World Cup to be held in England, should the ODI specialists too try out county cricket next season?

Not just looking at the 2019 World Cup, but to develop as a cricketer, it is important to have county experience. Whether it is ODI or Tests, whenever there is an opportunity, cricketers should certainly play county matches.

What makes this Indian Test team such a winning unit?

I think each member of the side has contributed to its success. If you look at our batting, each one has stood up and made themselves counted. At times when the top-order succeeds, we end up getting a total of around 400 on board. However, when the lower-middle order scores runs, that's where we start to score in excess of 600. The difference between 400 and 600 is just huge. When you score 600, the opposition will always be under pressure even if they bat well to reach that total. Also, this Indian team's bench strength is quite strong. Whoever has come into the XI has gone on to make a contribution. Players such as Kuldeep Yadav, Jayant Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Karun Nair and even Abhinav Mukund have all performed when given opportunities. Even our fast bowers Umesh and Shami have been bowling well.

What does coach Shastri bring to the table?

Ravi bhai is someone who gives players enough freedom and at the same time knows what is needed for the players to be in the best possible shape ahead of any game. He makes players feel welcome and players understand their roles in the side.

Have you had a chat with the coach on areas you can improve in order to be playing in all formats of the game?

I haven't had any discussion yet, but I will definitely have a chat with him. Personally, I am very confident that I can play in all formats. I have been working hard on my game, and in times to come, the results will follow.

Triple talaq: Removing gender injustice would only strengthen minority rights in India,"Triple talaq has been quashed by the Supreme Court. A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‘pampered minorities’ in their place.

Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.

At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.

For Muslim Women

To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.

Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world’s earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.

The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.

The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.

The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.

The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel’s statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.

Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole

Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.

Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.

When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.

In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.

And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.

The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.

Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all."

Soha Ali Khan Posted A Baby Bump Pic & As Expected Filthy Minds Started Trolling Her In No Time,"Embrace your baby bump. Don’t hide it. Embrace the life inside it. But apparently, the filthy minds don’t get it, and neither do they let people live in peace.

Time and again, people have been making constant attempts in telling people to love themselves, be comfortable in their own skin. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, after all. But still, there are some people who think that women should hide in shame for all the absurd reasons.

That is one of the reasons why pregnant women lived their life miserably through years and would hide inside their homes for their baby bumps attracted a lot of eyeballs and made them feel uncomfortable.

But several celebrities took charge of the situation and flaunted their baby bumps like queens urging women to embrace and feel proud about the new phase of life, which is simply beautiful.

But some filthy minds couldn’t accept it. They went ahead to pass crass comments on these women.

"essar-rosneft deal: Mega Essar-Rosneft deal cheers lenders, boosts company, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Shashi and Ravi Ruia promoted Essar Group has concluded its biggest monetisation exercise by selling flagship Essar Oil to Russia’s energy giant Rosneft and partners Trafigura and UCP Investment Group, providing relief to lenders.The transaction has been in the making for over two years and ET was the first to report the negotiations in March 2015. The deal was signed in October last year in the presence of PM Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the BRICS Summit but faced delays as Essar’s lenders had reservations and India’s intelligence agencies raised red flags.“We have completed our monetisation and deleveraging programme, which is the largest undertaken by any corporate in recent years. With the completion of our capex programme, we now look forward to a period of growth in our wider portfolio of existing businesses like steel, coal bed methane, oil and gas exploration, ports and infrastructure,” said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Capital.The conglomerate has been grappling with debt after an $18-billion spending spree to build power and steel plants and an oil refinery over the past 10 years.The group has been struggling to maintain sales and profitability amid commodity price volatility and slowing demand. While Essar Group has a non-compete agreement with the new owners of Essar Oil, the group will not exit the energy sector and will focus on its coal bed methane business.The deal will help Essar Group halve its debt to Rs 70,400 crore ($11 billion). This includes repayment of Rs 32,000 crore ($5 billion) to the main lenders of the group’s offshore holding company, Essar Global Holdings, now renamed Essar Global Fund. They include Russian lender VTB, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.Another Rs 34,400 crore ($5.4 billion) of debt at the level of operating companies, namely, Essar Oil India, Vadinar Oil Terminal and Vadinar Power Company, will get transferred to the new EOL (the company formed post the Rosneft investment) and would cease to be Essar Group exposure for banks. Essar executives said they have already paid Rs 4,000 crore ($600 million) to various other lenders at the operating companies.These include Life Insurance Corporation, which has been paid in full, some other insurers and local lenders such as IDBI Bank, which wanted all dues to be cleared before approving the transaction.LIC also gets a seat in the 12-member board of the new company. The acquirers and Essar Group have also finalised the payment details for Essar Oil’s $2-billion dues owed to Iranian oil companies for crude sourcing.Both parties said the amount has been factored into the valuation.Share prices of ICICI, Axis, Yes and IDBI Bank gained up to 2.5% intraday on Monday before ending the day in the red. “This transaction reduces banks’ exposure to Essar Group by about 50%,” ICICI Bank MD Chanda Koch har said after the announcement.Axis and ICICI — which together have a $1.6-billion exposure — will continue to hold a part of the debt. Part of their exposure is being transferred to the operating port and terminal entities that are part of the mega transaction. Essar Oil will pay an “additional amount” to the shareholders who tendered shares when the company delisted in June 2014.The Securities and Exchange Board of India had asked the company to compensate these shareholders if the valuation of the Rosneft deal was higher than the delisting price. Essar Group declined to comment on the per share difference between the 2014 price and the current valuation."
"ONGC to hire investment banker for HPCL acquisition, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will hire investment bankers to assist it in acquiring government's 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).

The investment or merchant banker to be hired will be separate from the one the government is hiring to manage its disinvestment, a senior official said here.

The board of ONGC yesterday gave 'in principle approval' for acquisition of the government stake in HPCL, which at today trading price is worth about Rs 34,800 crore.

He said a six-member Committee of Directors has been constituted to examine various aspects of the acquisition and to provide its recommendations to the board.

The panel includes Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf and Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan as also independent directors K M Padmanabhan, Sumit Bose and Vivek Mallya.

Director (Technology & Field Services) Shashi Shanker, who has been selected to succeed Sarraf as the chairman of ONGC at the end of September, will also be part of the panel.

The official said the acquisition will be done as per the Sebi takeover code. The price would be most likely be six month average of HPCL scrip on the day of the decision.

The government last month had approved sale of its 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL to India's largest oil producer ONGC.

Prior to the merger, HPCL is likely to take over Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to bring all the refining assets of ONGC under one unit. ONGC currently owns 71.63 per cent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 per cent stake in it.

The official said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership is not changing.

The deal will be completed within a year, he said.

HPCL will become a subsidiary of ONGC and will remain a listed company post the acquisition, the source said, adding the board of the refining and marketing company will continue to remain separate.

The government has also constituted a committee -- headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and road minister Nitin Gadkari to work out the modalities of the sale.

Jaitley had, in his Budget for 2017-18, talked about creating an integrated oil behemoth. After that oil companies were asked to give their options.

ONGC had evaluated options of acquiring either HPCL or BPCL -- the two downstream oil refining and fuel marketing companies.

It found the nation's second-biggest fuel retailer BPCL too expensive and conveyed its choice to the parent oil ministry.

Sources said the transaction is likely to be completed within this fiscal year.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries."

"A replacement for 66A is needed, but not in this form","The home ministry’s reported move to use provisions from the Indian Penal Code to plug the vacuum created by the quashing of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act may create a fresh set of problems. Recall that the Supreme Court had quashed 66A which criminalized the sending of offensive messages over a communication device noting that it had become a political instrument of coercion and intimidation. So the thumb rule for replacing 66A is to frame provisions that do not threaten free speech or individual liberty. But according to the news report cited above, the Centre is planning to use Section 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and Section 505 (Statements conducive to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code in place of 66A. This is a dose of strong, and hence attractive, but wrong, medicine for a pervasive ailment.

Even when viewed benignly, it is only a piecemeal fix. Section 66A had criminalized any communication which was grossly offensive, or has menacing character; or any information which is known to be false, but is communicated for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, or ill-will. The words used to frame this immensely useful provision vitiated its character. Proviso like “grossly offensive”, “annoyance” and “inconvenience” lend themselves to subjective actions which require an independent application of mind by police officers. However, this did not happen and the police and lower judiciary proved incapable of such autonomy and acted errantly or maliciously under political pressure.

But 66A, despite its problems, offered complainants a specific provision to complain about cyber harassment, bullying and stalking. In contrast, both 153A and 505 are offences related to maintenance of public order. Of course, the police and courts have the option of booking offenders under related provisions of the Indian Penal Code like Section 499 (criminal defamation), 506 (criminal intimidation), 292A (Printing, etc, of grossly indecent material), 507(criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and 509 (word,gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). But with the Internet becoming an integral part of our lives having provisions under a specialized law like the IT Act, instead of the more generic IPC which is often used to deal with crimes in the physical world may be better. The best argument for this is the digital nature of evidence collection and perpetration of the crime. Rather than amending the IPC which should remain a generic law, the IT Act could be a better placeholder to define the various crimes and the punishments that must be awarded.

Second and more important, the home ministry’s move to invoke 153A and 505 endangers free speech. Both are non-bailable provisions. It must be recalled that 66A was a bailable provision and yet the police made life hell for those it arrested by denying them bail and forcing them to go to courts. A lot of posts on social media are critical of religions, religious groups, caste, linguistic and ethnic groups, political and religious leaders, etc. These may not have any incitement to violence. Yet they can fall foul of 153A and 505. This is dangerous to free speech. In his reasoned judgment quashing 66A, Justice Rohington Nariman offered three axioms: discussion, advocacy, and incitement, to understand when free speech protected by Article 19(1)(a) is breached and the restrictions to free speech delineated under Article 19(2) kick in. “Mere discussion or even advocacy of a particular cause howsoever unpopular is at the heart of Article 19(1)(a). It is only when such discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement that Article 19(2) kicks in,” Justice Nariman wrote.

We do not need a replacement for Section 66A that is more draconian. A law is badly needed for individuals who are at the receiving end of offensive and hateful messages. Many journalists, especially women, have been facing vicious attacks from social media trolls. 66A FIRs were often lodged by complainants with only a remote connection to the offence. These buysbodies were not necessarily the targets, but were mere supporters of the intended target. It was not Mamata Banerjee who complained about the cartoonist or the Jadavpur University professor who created/circulated cartoons lampooning her. It was not the Thackerays who complained against Renu Srinivasan or Shaheen Dhadha for their post criticizing the shutdown of Mumbai after Bal Thackeray died. Perhaps, 66A should be revived with a smaller subset of offences which are then supplemented with iron-clad definitions in the Information Technology Act.

Here is my version of 66A: Any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device- (a) any information that is known to be false, but for the purpose of causing injury, criminal intimidation, and defamation, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine. This would restrict the scope for politicisation and deliberate misinterpretation and gives priority to personal crimes. I leave it to the Law and Justice Ministry to frame definitions for injury, criminal intimidation and defamation."
"In Case You Missed It, Here Are Some Of The Most Dramatic Pictures From The Solar Eclipse","The magnificent eclipse from yesterday has, for sure, left the entire world in awe. As the moon's shadow slowly took over areas that fall around Oregon and South Carolina, everyone began basking in the glorious eclipse, touted to be one of the harshest.

For over an hour and a half, everyone took a break from whatever they were doing and took it to the streets with their gears on. Millions got outside to watch this eclipse and even a million more witness it online, making it one of the most-watched in history.

"Chhattisgarh CM orders probe after three children die in Raipur hospital due to lack of oxygen supply, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Raipur: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Monday ordered a probe into the death of three children in Raipur's Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial Hospital due to lack of oxygen supply.

The three children died yesterday after an alleged drop in oxygen pressure to one of the wards.

Raman Singh has expressed regret on the death of children in the hospital and assured that those responsible for this tragic event will not be spared.

The Chief Minister has also directed the senior officers of the Health Department to investigate into this matter as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, the police have arrested the oxygen cylinder operator.

Subsequently, the hospital authorities, however, claimed that there was no shortage of oxygen supply.

Director, Health Services, R. Prasanna stated that, ""Yesterday there was a drop in oxygen pressure; there was no cut in the oxygen supply. Immediately, when there was a drop in pressure, information was given to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Medical Superintendent, who immediately intervened and sorted the issue. The death of children is due to illness whose information will be shared shortly.""

This incident comes days after the Gorakhpur's BRD hospital tragedy which claimed the life of more than 70 children, as it allegedly ran out of medical supplies because of unpaid bills, triggering anger across the country."
Supreme Court has done right to quash triple talaq,"The Supreme Court’s majority verdict declaring triple, or instant, talaq unconstitutional is an important, albeit limited, victory for Muslim women in India. It aligns India’s Muslim personal law, in this regard, with the law in most large Islamic nations that have already outlawed triple talaq, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. It opens the door for a serious engagement towards creating a civil legal code based on the principle of equality.

For women of Muslim faith in this country, the judgement marks a first important step. But there is still a long way to go. The judgement focused on a single issue, the triple instant talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, a frequent method of divorce among Sunni Muslims in India. It does not address issues like polygamy or nikah halala, or even the unilateral privileging of men in two other routes of divorce: talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan. Personal laws of other religious communities, Hindus and Christians, have gone through renditions to address some concerns relating to gender equality in matters of inheritance and polygamy. Despite the gains, gender equality does not permeate all aspects of civil law. The triple talaq judgement presents an opportunity to initiate a debate on putting in place a uniform civil code that brings equality — across faiths and gender. The government should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. In doing so, care must be taken to strengthen democracy, rather than weaken it.

If any attempt to modify personal laws is seen not through the prism of gender equality and inter-community parity, but from a perspective of imposing the majority’s will over minorities, that would vitiate democracy. This depends not just on the modifications proposed in personal law but on the overall developments in the polity. Political parties would do well to not stoke sectarian passions in the name of personal laws. Ridding laws and practices of patriarchal privilege is not easy, but essential to move towards a more wholesome democracy."

"Ruias shave off 67 per cent of Rs 1.05 trillion group debt with EOL sale, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: The Essar Group , one of the most indebted conglomerates in the country, has decided to pare as much as 67 per cent of its consolidated debt of Rs 1.05 trillion from the proceeds of the $12.9-billion sale of Essar Oil to Russian oil giant Rosneft , concluded today.The Ruias-promoted Essar Group, as of March 2017, had a long-term debt of Rs 1.05 trillion and a working capital loan of Rs 30,000 crore at the holding company and group companies level, taking the total burden to Rs 1.35 trillion.Essar Group director Prashant Ruia described the debt reduction of Rs 70,400 crore as the largest in the history of corporate India, and the $12.9 billion sale of EOL as the biggest FDI in the country to date.""With this deal we've completed our monetisation and deleveraging programme, which is the largest undertaken by any corporate in recent years in the country. We've substantially deleveraged our portfolio companies' balance sheets. With the completion of our capex programme of over Rs 1.2 trillion (Rs 1.2 lakh crore), we now look forward to a period of growth in our wider portfolio of businesses,"" Ruia said.Essar Group founder Shashi Ruia said this landmark transaction and the resultant debt reduction usher in a new phase of growth across the group portfolio.Significantly, this deleveraging will have no positive impact on the company's troubled steel venture which has gone to the National Company Law Tribunal for possible liquidation. Essar Steel with over Rs 44,000 crore debt had been in trouble after the RBI named it alongwith 11 other largest defaulters in June and asked banks to refer these companies to the NCLT.When asked about this, Ruia said, ""Essar Oil and Essar Steel are two separate legal entities and businesses and the law does not allow transfer of money from one account to the other.""Giving a break-up of the debt repay, an Essar official said, ""On closure of sale of Essar Oil to Rosneft and Trafigura-UCP consortium, Essar Energy will repay $5 billion to the lenders to repay at the holding company (Essar Holdings), $5.4 billion debt of Essar Oil, Vadinar Oil Terminal and Vadinar Power Company which has become non-Essar exposure (will be transferred to the new owners of EOL.)""Further, about $600 million or Rs 4,000 crore will be used to repay domestic lenders (primarily LIC -- Rs 800 crore -- and other insurance companies) at the operating company level (Essar Oil, Vadinar Oil Terminal and Vadinar Power), taking the group's overall debt exposure down by about $11 billion or Rs 70,400 crore.""Domestic lenders have an exposure of around Rs 35,000 crore to Essar Oil, but they will get only Rs 4,000 crore from the payback as ""they have elected to stay with the new owner"", Ruia said.Most of this $5 billion debt is from SBI IDIBI Bank and Yes Bank , while the total number of creditors is 19.A company official said of the $5 billion debt being transferred to Rosneft, around $4 billion are term loans and $1 billion working capital loans.But they'll get around Rs 4,000 crore paid back from over Rs 35,000 crore of loans to Essar Oil, as they have ""finally elected to stay with the new owner"", Ruia said.Officials also said a part of the proceeds that flow into the accounts of the Ruias, which analysts peg at $1.9 billion, will be part used to pay the premium that the promoter got through the sale to retail and other investors who tendered their shares at the open offer within 60 days from today as per Sebi guidelines.""Those shareholders who tendered their shares in the open offer will be paid back according to the margin from the deal as per Sebi's buyback regulations,"" Ruia said."
The real luxury in life is doing nothing,"It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that you’ll brush your teeth tomorrow morning. You don’t squander precious mental space evaluating whether or not brushing your teeth is worth the opportunity cost of let’s say, another five minutes of sleep. The same is true for showering, going to the bathroom, grooming your nails and facial hair. We clean our homes with a myriad of dust-sucking devices and chemical concoctions, or hire people to do so more thoroughly than we can. We even make sure to wash the car every so often.

As a people, we seem to be pretty vigilant about physical hygiene. We clean and cream our bodies, and take them out for a walk, much like we do for our dogs. We do so robotically, without wasting time in evaluating questions like, “Should I take out the trash today?” Even if we don’t do it today, you can bet it’ll be done before the week is out. Sadly, the same cannot be said for our mental hygiene. When was the last time you really cleaned the crevices of your mind?

And in this day and age, boy, do we have dirty minds. Between jobs, responsibilities at home, nights out, baby-talk and toddler tantrums, must-read blogs, email upkeep, spritely posts and timely tweets, we’ve stuffed our minds with more content than it can hold. Our minds run a marathon a minute. We swallow countless videos, movies and entire seasons of television shows with abandon, and these stimulating stories stick to our soft and once-supple consciousness. It’s a more-more-more world and our mind’s had enough. Simply put, we are mentally obese.

And then we wonder why we can’t still our minds and find some semblance of peace. We read self-help manuals, eat more organic greens and practise various forms of sweat-inducing yoga. We buy softer clothes, sniff scented candles, wear noise-canceling headphones and track our daily step count. We run away to exotic islands and true stillness evades us even under the palms.

The ubiquitous sentence we’ve all uttered, heard and repeated is — “I’m so tired”. We keep going like that poor Energizer bunny, but deep inside we feel kind of exhausted. Even the pursuit of higher echelons of fun becomes somewhat tiring by the time you’re thirty-five. And if not by then, by forty-five, for sure. “What’s the point?” we start to wonder.

And this is precisely where meditation saved me. Some people meditate with a mantra from a Master, some listen to meditation music, some watch their breath until they can override mental chatter, while others go for a nature walk. Even big-shot billionaires meditate with requisite meditation apps on TV these days.

The result is the same — in meditation, we do absolutely nothing for a few moments. We achieve nothing, we stop trying so damn hard. And unlike in sleep, we are restfully awake to witness the passage of time. We are completely present for ourselves — for doing absolutely nothing with ourselves — much like we make sure to be present to watch our children play soccer or perform in a school play.

In meditation, we become the witness. We become the one who watches patiently as time marches on, moving and twisting as it does. We don’t react or move an inch. We watch our thoughts go by like trains at a busy train station. We don’t hop on board. Like the statue of Buddha, we learn to embody peace and let go of past and future worries. We are the now. Like rock climbing, scuba diving, skiing, or even learning to read as children — learning to meditate takes some level of dedication and practice.

It’s a skill worth acquiring as soon as humanly possible. Even a momentary brush with wakeful nothingness — doing nothing, being nothing, wanting nothing, all while being there with the Self here and now — is a deep-clean steam shower for our mind. It refreshes us considerably and reminds us that there is more to life than chasing more."
"NTPC: NTPC seeks shareholder approval to raise Rs 15k cr via bonds, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: State-owned power giant NTPC has sought shareholders' approval to raise Rs 15,000 crore via non-convertible bonds on private placement basis domestically for capex, working capital and other corporate purposes.

The special resolution is listed on the agenda of the annual general meeting scheduled for September 20, NTPC said in a BSE filing today.

According to the statement, the company intends to raise Rs 15,000 crore through non-convertible debentures (bonds) up to Rs 15,000 crore in one or more tranches or series not exceeding 30, through private placement, in the domestic market for capital expenditure, working capital and other general requirements.

Besides, the shareholders would consider a proposal to confirm payment of interim dividend and declare final dividend for 2016-17.

The company has already paid an interim dividend of Rs 2.61 per share and has recommended a final one of Rs 2.17 for 2016-17, which is 143 per cent of the amount paid last year. The holding of the government in the power generator stands at 69.74 per cent.

Also on the agenda is a proposal to amend the Articles of Association with a view to inserting a provision for consolidation and reissuance of debt securities.

Looking beyond its conventional power generation business, the company is eyeing diversification in allied sectors such as setting up electric vehicle charging infrastructure, ancillary services and energy storage.

NTPC commissioned 3,845 mw and added 2,190 mw to its commercial capacity during 2016-17. The installed capacity of the group is 51,671 mw as on July 31, which has over 28,000 mw of capacity under construction.

NTPC achieved huge cost efficiency in 2016-17 through swapping and rationalisation of coal, appointment of an agency for third party coal sampling and reducing imported coal consumption by 85 per cent as against the previous year.

These measures saw per unit cost come down by nearly 40 paise in 2016-17 compared to 2014-15, leading to savings of more than Rs 8,000 crore to the state.

The company said the government has recently approved the SHAKTI policy that will further increase transparency in coal allocation and improve cost efficiency."
Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

"Knee surgery: After cardiac stents, government now caps knee implants price, cuts prices by up to 69%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: After coronary stents, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has wielded its powers of price control on knee implants — devices used to replace parts of the knee joints that are damaged. The difference this time is that the regulator has exercised its own emergency powers to do so, instead of waiting for the government to bring the devices under the National List of Essential Medicines as it did on stents.The drug pricing watchdog slashed the prices of total knee replacement systems and their individual components by as much as 69%, an NPPA notification issued on Wednesday evening showed.This decision is expected to lead to a saving of Rs 1,500 crore per year for the people of India, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar said. According to him, 1-1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures are done in India annually.Industry bodies representing manufacturers said they were reviewing the order and would take their suggestions to the regulator for its effective implementation.The price of total knee implants made of cobalt chromium has now been capped at Rs 54,720, down 65% from its average maximum retail price of Rs 1.58 lakh, data from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers showed. These are the most widely used complete knee implants, it said.Total knee implants made of special metals like titanium and oxidized zirconium can be priced at a maximum of Rs 76,600, or 69% lower than the original average MRP. High-flexibility implants have also seen a similar reduction in the maximum price to Rs 56,490. Revision implants, used in repeat procedures when the initial knee implant has failed, is capped 59% lower at Rs 1.14 lakh, down from an average of Rs 2.77 lakh.Special knee implants for cancer or tumours will follow the prices of revision knee implants, NPPA said.These prices are exclusive of goods and services tax, but take trade margins for manufacturers or importers, distributors and hospitals into account, NPPA said.The regulator's latest order specifically highlights the ceiling prices of each component used in a knee replacement procedure, such as femoral, tibial, insert and patellas. In most cases, the ceiling prices of these components have been set according to the materials used, but in the case of certain components, these have been fixed regardless of the materials used.NPPA's order comes around six months after it slashed the prices of coronary stents by up to 85%.Unlike stents, the government did not put knee implants on the essential medicines list. Usually, the Department of Pharmaceuticals notifies products for price control and NPPA caps the prices after the health ministry puts it on this list.Out of 1.5-2 crore patients who require arthroplasty interventions, only around a lakh are in a position to pay for the procedure every year, NPPA stated. Citing a World Health Organization bulletin from 2003, it said osteoarthritis could become the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. India is likely to be one of the leading countries of such immobilized citizens in terms of numbers.""As the public is aware, prices remain too high for devices across the board. We would like this to be the start for NPPA to systematically fix prices of all other devices on which data was collected in public interest,"" said Malini Aisola of patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN). ""The price reductions still need study and it will not be successful without a check on the hospital rates,"" she added.According to some knee implant manufacturers, the order has left a lot of issues unresolved without which the price cuts might not be possible. One of the companies that ET spoke to said a knee implant device has a number of components, and without fixing the prices of those components, it would be difficult to gauge the price cut.The Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD) is expected to meet the drug regulator asking for time in implementing these price cuts. The Medical Technology Association of India, another body that represents knee implant makers like Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew, said it is currently reviewing the order and will respond with suggestions to NPPA to ensure practicality of its decision.“Prices are reasonable and we are with the government. We believe this price cap will help every person of the country who needs implants,” stated Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD."

MS Dhoni & Harbhajan Singh Face Flak On The Internet Over Controversy Surrounding A Real Estate Group,"A sports personality becoming the face of a company is nothing new. Most companies try to cash in on the market by making a popular name their brand ambassador. But then, at times, this practice backfires. Especially for cricketers.

"Pradhan meets Odisha CM Patnaik to resolve Paradip refinery tax issue, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today met Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here and discussed an ongoing tax issue between Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the nation’s largest fuel retailer, and the state government over the latter withdrawing tax incentives provided for setting up the Paradip refinery project in 2004.“Discussion happened in positive environment and both sides displayed the willingness to come to a mutually benefitting and agreeable solution,” Pradhan said in a tweet following the meet.The Odisha government had in February this year sent a notice to IOC stating it is withdrawing the promised 11-year tax deferment on payment of sales tax on Paradip refinery products sold in the state.The state government had originally offered the tax incentives to IOC and its then partner Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) in December 1998 to invest in setting up a refinery in the state. These investments were withdrawn in February 2000, leading to the company shelving the project.The state later restored the incentives and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IOC in February 2004 for providing a set of eight sops. The state government had reportedly withdrawn the tax incentives in ""public interest"", citing 6-year delay in commissioning of the project that was larger in capacity than originally planned 9 million tonne plant.IOC, however, pointed out the February 2004 MoU clearly allowed change in design, capacity and configuration of the project and that the Odisha government was informed about the change in capacity and the delay in construction caused by cyclone, land acquisition and law and order problems, according to a report.As per the MoU, IOC was to commission the refinery in 2009, but actually did it in November 2015 and the state government allowed IOC to avail of construction-related sops totalling Rs 550 crore all through the six years.The foundation stone of the Paradip refinery was originally laid by the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 2000."

They leave no stone unturned when it comes to giving a shit for eating meat as if it's a crime and as if the animals knows they are being eaten.

Well hey vegetarians, in your face because plants know it too.

Leaf&wood

A new research shows that plants know when they're being eaten and they don't like it when you do that. According to o Modern Farmer, a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri claims that all the plants possess some sort of intelligence and know it when you're approaching them to put them in your mouth.

They even send out defence mechanisms to try to stop you from doing that. The study was carried out on thale cress, which is closely related to broccoli, kale, mustard greens, and other members of the family. They are commonly used for experiments because they have genome sequenced, and scientists are intimately familiar with how it works.

Researchers took audio recordings to understand vibrations a plant does when it's being eaten. They studied these vibration patterns, that released another shake like wind noise.

Modern Farmer claims ""the thale cress produces mustard oils that are mildly toxic when eaten and sends them throughout its leaves to try to keep the predators away.""

""Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,"" said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU.

""However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found that feeding vibrations signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars,"" he added.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

"FM Jaitely urges states to reduce VAT on petroleum products used for making goods, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today urged state governments to reduce Value Added Tax ( VAT ) on petroleum products used for making goods which attract Goods and Service Tax ( GST ), an official statement said. The move is aimed at easing tax burden on manufacturing sectors using petroleum products.The GST regime rolled out on 1 July excludes crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel while other products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha are included in GST. In the pre-GST regime, both petroleum products and final goods produced attracted VAT and hence input tax credit of petroleum products used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different states.However, in the post-GST regime, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products like natural gas, petrol and diesel used in manufacturing of the products attract VAT which leads to stranded taxes and cascading of taxes.“In view of this, in the pre GST regime certain States had lower rate of 5% VAT on Compressed Natural Gas used for manufacturing of goods. Some States also had lower rate of VAT on diesel being used for manufacturing sector. Thus the FM has requested other states also to explore the possibility of having lower VAT on petroleum products used for manufacturing items on which there is GST, so that there is minimum disruption in the costing of goods,” the statement said.At least one analyst told ETEnergyWorld VAT reduction on petroleum products used in manufacturing would reduce tax disadvantage currently suffered by City Gas Distribution (CGD) Companies as well as Piped Natural Gas (PNG) consumers along with the power, Ceramics, Glass, Chemicals, Pharma, Dairy, Steel and Engineering industry.“Currently CGD companies face a significant disadvantage when they sell PNG (Industrial and Commercial) as it continues to attract VAT on which input tax credit cannot be availed by its consumers who would be under GST. On the other hand, if they were to use liquid fuels such as Fuel Oil, Diesel, Naphtha, LPG, input tax credit is available because these products come under GST. If the states were to reduce VAT on PNG, that will reduce the tax disadvantage suffered by CGD companies and some of their consumers,” K Ravichandran, Senior Vice President at ICRA told ETEnergyWorld .He also added sectors such as ceramics, glass, chemicals, pharma, dairy, steel and engineering will be benefited as many of them use PNG. If the VAT were to be lower, under recoveries of companies operating in these sectors on taxes will be lower, which will improve their cost structure.Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the statistical arm of the oil ministry has projected the natural gas demand for the financial year 2017-2018 to be 494 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter Per Day (MMSCMD). Of which the power industry would require 225 MMSCMD followed by the fertilizer industry requiring 113 MMSCMD, city gas distribution 47 MMSCMD and Industrial requirement of 28 MMSCMD among others. Sanjiv Singh , Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the country’s largest fuel retailer, had recently said the firm is in talks with state governments for deferring levy of VAT on petrol, diesel, Aviation Turbine Fuel and crude oil to reduce the tax impact of these products as they are outside the ambit of GST."

"vaccine research: ICMR partners with IVI, invests Rs 3.20 crore for vaccine development in India, Health News, ET HealthWorld","IVI may also facilitate further global testing of vaccine candidates developed in Indian labs by linking developers here with global partners.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) has entered into an agreement to collaborate on vaccine research and development with international vaccine development organisation International Vaccine Institute (IVI). Through this partnership, India will commit $5,00,000 (Rs 3.20 crore) annually for a stake in IVI—an amount approved during a cabinet meeting in January.Under its latest Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), ICMR will be focussed on research and development of vaccines combatting various infectious diseases “This partnership will help us better address the vaccine needs of low- and middle-income groups in the country and ultimately contribute to protecting people from infectious diseases,” said Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.While the government and IVI have not narrowed down which diseases they will develop vaccines for, ICMR Director General Soumya Swaminathan said some disease areas that may be in focus are high-burden diseases.“Depending on the burden of disease, tuberculosis ( TB ) and malaria are both high priority areas. Apart from that, there are diseases with high morbidity like dengue and chikungunya,” Swaminathan told ET. “Influenza, where people are talking about a universal flu vaccine, is another potential area,” she added.India is on the World Health Organisation’s current list of 30 high TB burden countries and in 2015 recorded the highest TB-related deaths—around 60,000—among children under 15 years of age, according to a study published in the Lancet.The country also has a high burden of malaria, recording upwards of 10.90 lakh cases every year since 2014. As of June this year, India has already recorded 3.52 lakh cases, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program’s data.According to NVBDCP, in 2016, India recorded the highest number of cases of dengue (1.29 lakh) and chikungunya fever (64,057) in the last seven years.Under ICMR’s latest partnership, vaccine candidates developed in IVI labs could be brought to India and given to one of the companies here for further development, explained Swaminathan. IVI may also facilitate further global testing of vaccine candidates developed in Indian labs by linking developers here with global partners, she added.The partnership is further expected to help with capacity building for clinical trials within India as well, according to Swaminathan. The MoU is also expected to help support companies like Bharat Biotech, which has completed phase I clinical trials of its chikungunya vaccine and has expressed the need for support in conducting phase II and III trials for the candidate, according to her.India supplies 60% of the world's vaccines for vaccine-preventable diseases and contributes to 60-80% of the United Nation’s annual vaccine purchases, according to Jerome H Kim, Director General, IVI.“We look forward to having India’s representation on the IVI Board of Trustees, which will increase engagement with Indian academia and industry even further,” he said.IVI has partnered with Indian vaccine manufacturers, research institutes, government, and public health agencies on vaccine development, research, and training for over a decade, according to Kim.One such collaboration was with Shantha Biotechnics on the development of ‘Shanchol’, the world’s first low-cost oral cholera vaccine, which was licensed in India in 2009 and WHO-prequalified in 2011. IVI had collaborated with health authorities in Odisha to introduce this vaccine for the first time in India in 2011, according to a press statement."
"Black & Veatch wins EPC contract for India's first floating LNG project, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Engineering, Procurement and Manufacturing (EPC) firm Black & Veatch announced it has been awarded a contract by Swan Energy for constructing part of India’s first Floating Storage and Re-gasification Unit ( FSRU ) for liquefied natural gas (LNG) import at Jafrabad in Gujarat.

"surrogacy: Structured compensated surrogacy only way to curb exploitation, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: The 31-member Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare recently presented a report which highlighted the moralistic and unrealistic aspect of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016.The committee, headed by Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav debated on major gaps in the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill.The report began by stating the lack of regulation as the main cause of exploitation. Permitting women to provide reproductive labour for free to another person but preventing them from being paid for their reproductive labour is grossly unfair and arbitrary, the report said.Opposing the altruistic surrogacy model, Dr Rishma Pai, President, Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India ( FOGSI ), said, “All of us believed that altruistic surrogacy is not a practical solution as it expects a woman, whether she is a relative or otherwise, to go through the whole process for absolutely nothing. Everybody else involved is earning, so why should the surrogate not be compensated. We are very happy with the term “compensated surrogacy”. The surrogate should get the compensation of the effort and the whole hardship that she has gone through.” Dr Nandita Palshetkar , Medical Director, Bloom IVF Group, said, “I think it is fair enough to compensate the woman for the loss of work hours in those nine months. After all, everyone else involved in the process is getting something.”The parliamentary committee also recommended the inclusion of live-in couples, divorced women and widows in the ambit of persons who can avail surrogacy.“The surrogacy law has to be liberal and forward looking. The present time is very different and in today’s time live-in couples are a reality. The single parents, older women, divorced may want to have a child and to say that it is illegal just because you don’t have a marriage certificate is not fair. It is like taking away the women’s reproductive right. Compared to the number of live-in couples, those requiring surrogacy will be a miniscule number and in keeping with the modern day India we should include them and give them equal rights,” said Dr Pai.Commenting on the committee’s recommendation to reduce the waiting period from five years to one year of non-conception for the couples in order to be eligible for surrogacy, Dr Pai said, “There are a significant number of women who are born without a uterus; so, this lady knows from the first day that she cannot have a baby. Why would she wait for five years? This was reasoned with the government and they have been open enough to accept it. Today women getting married in their 30’s are very common and to wait for 5 years it would mean losing the egg number, its quality and quantity.”The committee has also recommended to the government to ensure medical insurance covers the surrogate not only during her pregnancy and delivery but also for the next six years. “The basic reason for making these recommendations is to ensure no one gets exploited in the process. It has been very clearly charted out. We are very happy to have standard compensation for the surrogates, it will all be very carefully and legally drawn out,” said Dr Pai.""The women are being exploited and that is why the Surrogacy Bill was brought for. The committee has recommended that the money should be paid directly into the bank account of the surrogate as it is going to make the process very transparent,"" added Dr Palshetkar.Social security insurance and maternity benefits are also part of the recommendations. However, the committee is not in favour of extending the option of commissioning surrogacy to foreign nationals. Though there was disagreement among the committee members on the Surrogacy Bill’s denial of eligibility to NRIs, PIOs and OCIs cardholders, who are of Indian origin.""The whole problem started because the foreigners used to come as it was cheaper. Out of the 10 percent that are infertile, only 1 percent of those infertile women require surrogacy. Banning the whole technology is not really a great thing as we are depriving people of our own country. So, if we ban foreigners I think that is fair enough and I agree with the government here,"" said Dr Palshetkar.Dr Pai added, “Let’s first look at the interest of our population in India and abroad and that itself is a large number to look after for providing the service.”The committee and experts agreed with having a more liberal view towards surrogacy keeping the modern day India in mind.“We feel that if fertility organisations and the government work together and listen to their ideas and to their consensus then I think the outcomes will be really balanced and appropriate for all concerned. We hope this will stay and be a part of the law. We are very happy the way it has shaped out,” Dr Rishma Pai concluded."
"NTPC: NTPC to secure 33 per cent of coal requirements from own mines by 2030, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: State-owned power generator NTPC Ltd plans to secure around a third of its coal requirement through its own captive coal blocks by 2030, the company said in its annual report. NTPC has been allotted 10 coal blocks with a peak production capacity of more than 100 Million Tons Per Annum (MTPA). With these, the company envisages being one of the largest captive coal mining companies in India.“The previous fiscal saw the flag off of your company’s first coal rake, from its mining operations at Pakri Barwadih . This coal is being used at Barh Thermal Station of NTPC, in Bihar. This is an important step in the direction of secured fuel supplies for your Company. The medium term target for mining will be able to cater to more than 10 percent of its present coal requirements,” Gurdeep Singh, Chairman & Managing Director, said to the company’s shareholders in the report.As per its long term corporate plan, NTPC has envisioned to reach a total installed capacity of 130 GW and annual generation of more than 600 billion units (BU) by 2032. “The capacity will have a diversified fuel mix comprising 65.4 percent coal, 4.6 percent gas, 1.5 percent nuclear and 28.5 percent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) including hydro. Therefore, by 2032, non-fossil fuel based generation capacity shall make up nearly 30percent of NTPC’s portfolio,” the report said.The company also plans to replace its old and inefficient units with technologically advanced, efficient and environmentally compliant units by 2032, in a phased manner. “NTPC would continue pursuing the power trading business in India as well as with the neighboring countries increasing its market share in the region through its wholly-owned subsidiary ‘NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd’,” the report said.NTPC is also planning to make a foray into e-mobility and battery storage, supported by Research & Development and collaboration with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and research institutes, the report stated. “Apart from this, NTPC is taking several initiatives to contain pollution in various forms. Two such projects your Company is experimenting with are waste-to-energy and biomass co-firing,” Singh said.As per the report, NTPC crossed the 50,000 MW mark in Installed capacity in the previous fiscal. The company commissioned 3,845 MW and added 2,190 MW to its commercial capacity during FY16-17. The installed capacity of NTPC Group is 51,671 MW as on 31 March, 2017."

"Biocon developing 10 biosimilars that collectively target global market opportunity of over $60 billion: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India’s biopharmaceutical company Biocon , which ranks among top three biosimilar global players for insulin , has multiple successes in its container since its inception. So far, Biocon has successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars from laboratory to market in India.“We will continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in our research and development,” said, Chairman & Managing Director,. In an email interview with ETHealthworld, the Biocon chief shared her in-depth insights on the challenges, achievements and growth prospects of the biopharma industry in India. Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion’s share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‘Start-Up India’ initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia’s first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‘lab to market’ in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‘first-in-class’ oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."
"EESL to sign MoU with Malaysian counterpart to replicate UJALA scheme in Malaysia, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Following the successful implementation of the Indian government’s Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) in UK, the Malaysian government has now evinced interest in replicating the scheme in Malaysia.The state of Melaka in Malaysia is set to partner with EESL with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Green Growth Asia (GGA) and EESL in the first week of September 2017 on the sidelines of the Urban Environmental Accords (UEA) at the Melaka Summit.“We were deeply encouraged by India’s UJALA story, which is being implemented by EESL.

In line with this, we have already commenced talks with the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee soon to assess their requirements.” Raj Kumar Rakhra, National Programme Manager (UJALA), EESL, said.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme, according to the ministry of power The scheme has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."
Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it’s a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there’s one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it’s Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India. Super-cool isn’t it? Watch the video to virtually experience this cool augmented reality battle with the chilly monsters!"
Donald Trump’s latest Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy: Not much South Asian comfort,"By Pinaki Bhattacharya

It was touted as the latest US strategy towards South Asia. And, we were told by US Secretary of Defence James Mattis, that the Camp David meeting last weekend was a culmination of many months of review of US policies for the Afghanistan quagmire. So, expectations were high in the four capitals of Kabul, Islamabad, New Delhi and Beijing.

But US President Donald J Trump let South Asia down. He talked about an increased US commitment to Afghanistan — more boots on the ground. There were no numbers mentioned of fresh troop deployment, for that is a potential minefield in hyper-ventilating Washington.

US House of Representative SpeakerPaul Ryan, who was briefed earlier about what to expect from Trump’s current trumpeteering, almost called it prescient that the US President has called the latest strategy to be not time-based but “based on condition” —which means, as Trump explained, “condition on the ground”.

Lessons on conflict resolution state that one needs to divine an acceptable‘ end state’ before one sets the conflict-machine chugging. But it seems that Republican presidencies have not learnt the studied moves of the Nixon-Kissinger team. Instead, they seem as expansive as the Reagan administration that was too busy defeating the Soviet Union, thus making itself hostage to the Chinese economic miracle.

Which meant Ronald Reagan’s successor, George H W Bush, losing his presidency to ‘It’s the economy, stupid!’ rhetoric of Bill Clinton. The burgeoning US public debt that Beijing continued to feed — as reflected in the trade surpluses — shows in the lack of ‘strategic autonomy’ that Washington had enjoyed since World War 2.

George W Bush tried his hand in unilateralism, but ended up going down in American history books as a creator of not one, but two Vietnam wars in Af-Pak and Iraq.

Trump’s speech was devoid of any substance that could stir up the Indian subcontinent’s own ‘studio empire-builders’ to reach for their TV microphones.

And what did Trump tell Pakistan that could make the tinpot generals of Rawalpindi quake in their boots? “In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: we must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.”

Boilerplate words those. Thus, shorn of the finesse of a leader like Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s generals would rather have Beijing continuing its indulgence and play mediator for them.

Trump’s speech does very little for the confidence level of New Delhi, which is watching each muscle of the latest actor on the stage of Indo-US relations. There will be a holding operation that would be launched in New Delhi in the wake of this speech.

Not much extra commitment of India’s foreign exchange dollars will flow that Trump was hopeful of steering to Afghanistan. Of course India wouldbe doing its ‘best’. But that ‘best’ would fall short of Trump’s expectations.

So, this speech was really about the domestic audience: not Trump’s own white- and blue-collar electoral base, but the Establishment, whose leading lights are now firmly in the Indiancamp.

This was evident in the penultimate days of the Barack Obama administration when former Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter got the ‘blank cheque’ of the Defence Authorisation Act passed by the US Congress. That may have evoked some fraught memories. But Pentagon can play around with it, military-industrial complex or no military-industrial complex."

Vijender Singh Is Optimistic – Predicts More Than One Medal For India At The World Championship,"Eight years ago, he scripted history by opening the country's account in amateur boxing's marquee event and Vijender Singh feels India might just go one better on that during the 19th World Championship, starting August 25 in Hamburg.

afp

The 31-year-old had fetched a bronze medal at the 15th World Championship in Milan, just over a year after becoming India's first Olympic medallist in boxing - a bronze-winner at the 2008 Beijing Games.

The nation has a bronze each to show for in the 2009, 2011 and 2015 World Championships -- the other two bronze- medallists, apart from Vijender, being Vikas Krishan (2011) and Shiva Thapa (2015).

afp

""It is a mature bunch of boxers. I have been in teams that had Shiva (Thapa), Vikas (Krishan) and Manoj (Kumar). So, I know some of them well. They have the ability to ensure that India ends up with more than one medal. If they compete to their full potential, I think there is a real chance of more than one medal,"" Vijender told PTI in an interview.

""They have competed at the highest level in the past and know what they should do. I cannot give any suggestions to them but I can just say, they need to be very focussed,"" he added.

afp

Both Vikas (75kg) and Shiva (60kg) are part of the eight-member team, which has already reached Hamburg after qualifying for the event through the Asian Championships earlier this year.

The others in the team are Amit Phangal (49kg), Kavinder Bisht (52kg), Gaurav Bidhuri (56kg), Manoj Kumar (69kg), Sumit Sangwan (91kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg).

A fair share of amateur history to his credit, Vijender turned professional in 2015 and has two titles to flaunt in an unbeaten run so far.

""That bronze medal I won in Milan was part of a beautiful phase in my career because it managed to silence some harsh critics, who felt that my medal in Beijing was a fluke. There were people who said that I was not training enough, within months of my medal in Beijing,"" Vijender said.

Vijender recalled how he sought solitude during both the Olympics and the World Championship.

""To me, focus has always meant shutting myself off before heading to a big tournament. I would just insulate myself from anything and everything that was going on outside the little space, which I would create for myself,"" he explained.

ap

""There will always be expectations and I am sure the guys who are competing this time, are well aware of that. But to me, the key lies in not allowing that to play on the mind. There has to be a single-minded focus on the ring, forget everything else, that's what I do,"" he said.

A former world No.1 in middleweight amateur rankings, Vijender refused to pick favourites but did single out Thapa for praise.

""He has progressed tremendously and seems to be a very sorted boxer. I have been impressed by his growth,"" said the Haryana star about the 24-year-old, who is the first Indian to claim three back-to-back Asian Championship medals.

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

We have made an appropriate provision as mandated by Reserve Bank of India and our gross NPA as proportion of our loan book is less than 2.6% and in net NPA it is sub 2%. Ours is a financial institution with a sole exposure to power sector which has the lowest NPAs among all the peers.Let me say categorically that we are grateful to the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We have carefully studied them and have taken note of those observations. It needs to be abundantly clarified that this is a joint report and pertains to our sister concern PFC. CAG has made pointed comments relating to REC and to PFC. In those observations that have been made, which have been erroneously in my view presented by some of the media outlets, says that we did not adhere to the RBI norms.

"P.D. Hinduja Hospital: Screening is not a viable tool for detecting cancer in India: Dr. Sachin Almel, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Consultant Medical Oncologist,, talks about the cancer scenario in India. Edited excerpts:Cancer is definitely becoming one of the major killers as far as the incidence and other things are concerned. But in India, it still remains second or third on the list as we have other diseases which are probably the major killers. Compared to the Western world, I think cancer still has not caught up as yet, though the incidence in our country is increasing.If you’re asking me about whether we have adequate facilities for the treatment, the answer is no, because majority of these so called good treatment facilities or treatment centers are restricted to only the urban cities or urban areas of our country. And you have to understand that majority of our population resides in small towns and villages where they probably are not able to avail these facilities. So as of today, I feel we still don’t have enough facilities to cater to this burden of cancer which is ever increasing.As far as India is concerned, compared to the Western population, yes, the cancer incidence is definitely increasing. It is not the same as it’s seen in the Western population, but we are catching up definitely. There is an important difference in the kind of cancers which are increasing in our country viz-a-viz the Western population. For example- in Western countries, breast cancer in women is supposedly the leading cancer. But if you consider our country, we still know that cancer of cervix is the leading cancer in women. If you take into account the urban cities, urban areas, there the breast cancer has over-taken cervix as the major cancer in women. Likewise, the highest number of men suffering from prostate cancer and the incidence is increasing in our country. The difference is that cancer of the prostate is not the leading cancer in our country. In our country, we still have cancers of the tongue, head and neck region which remain one of the major cancers in men.If you look at the urban centers, yes we have adequate facilities. All the people living in the cities are able to avail these facilities. I must also admit that the facilities which are offered in many of these centers are at par with what you get in any of the top hospitals in the Western world. But, the problem lies in the fact that majority of the population of India are based out of towns and villages and there, the facilities are definitely very inadequate. There are not many centers which cater to that group of patients, and therefore, if you look at it as a whole, the facilities in our country are not adequate as yet, but things are improving. Lot of these major NGO’s and major organizations like Tata Memorial Hospital, Gujarat Cancer Research Institutes have their outreach centers at various places which cater to these kind of populations which don’t have an easy access to medical facilities. The awareness regarding this disease has also increased. So that also adds to the fact that the incidence of cancer is increasing and more importantly diagnosing a cancer does not end the matter for us, we need to treat it and that’s where the challenge lies. We don’t have enough facilities to treat those cancers as yet.Screening has been a debatable issue all over the world. Few years back it was said that screening is mandatory. Then came a time when people started talking about whether it is really helping in bringing down the incidence, the cost-benefit ratio was talked about, the amount of money that you spend to screen a large population of patients and at the end of it you are diagnosing say only a minuscule number of cancers. Then it is not a viable option for many of the countries. If you apply that to our country I feel screening is not a good tool for our country, because the population that needs to be screened is huge, so there would be a lot of wastage of revenue and at the end of it, the number of cancers that may be diagnosed or may be caught, is not going to be enough to actually make a difference. Plus the other important thing is the screening strategies which have been the guidelines for screening all over the world. Screening has made a difference in diagnosing cases of breast cancer, like mamograph for breast cancer and pap smear for cervical cancer in women, and PSA with digital rectal examination and to some extend fecal occult blood. These are some of the tests which have been advocated or they have said that these are the ones which should be done if someone wants to adopt a screening programme. Whereas for various other cancers, there are not proper screening programmes available, and therefore also it is a big debate whether we as a country, a third world country, whether we should even think about this. More importantly, we would rather want to propagate the message that prevention of cancer would probably be a better idea, other than just screening the cancer. We need to increase the number of treatment centers and improve the facilities which could be made available to the common man.Hinduja was one of the pioneers which came up with a proper day care center for medical oncology and oncology as a sub-specialty many years back. In those days probably, cancer was considered to be a disease in which there were no patients who would survive and all patients used to succumb to the disease sooner or later. But things have changed over the last few years. Hinduja day care center was one of the first ones, dedicated only for those patients who were receiving chemotherapy in a very conducive kind of atmosphere. Hinduja took an initiative, we had a programme in which many of our nurses were sent abroad to get trained in a proper oncology day care center, medical oncology day care center abroad. We had a tie up with Mass General Hospital Massachusetts, General Hospital and Boston. Our hospital looks into developing this support group for the cancer patients. We have a good up and running support group and in fact, just recently we had a lymphedema care which was conducted by the support group and the occupational therapist attached to our hospital. Another initiative, which is an initiative all over the country is the Pinkathon, but in Bombay the Pinkathon which is done, Hinduja Hospital plays a major role in it and we encourage all our patients, the survivors, those who are undergoing treatment and everyone to be a part of the Pinkathon, and we were represented by lot many patients from our hospital. So that is another initiative which we are very proud of."

Rosneft and its partners restructured the board of the company, packing it with their representatives.

Rosneft bought 49.13 per cent in Essar Oil and a consortium of European trader Trafigura and Russian fund UCP a similar stake in the USD 12.9 billion deal. The remaining 1.74 per cent stake continues to be held by retail shareholders.

The deal would give Rosneft and its partners control of 20 million tonnes a year Vadinar oil refinery in Gujarat as also over 3,500 petrol pumps.

Gupta, who was CEO of Essar Oil for six years, resigned just as the deal was concluded on August 18, sources said.

A statement issued by Essar Oil under its new management did not mention Gupta's resignation but said he ""will remain with the company as a senior adviser to the Management Board to support future growth plans and bring his considerable experience in the sector.""

B Anand, who was chief financial officer of Trafigura India Pvt Ltd since 2012, would be the new CEO. Tony Fountain, and ex-Reliance Industries executive, would be the Chairman of Essar Oil Ltd as a nominee of UCP, the statement said.

On the 12-member board, Rosneft would have four nominee directors and UCP two, including Fountain. Trafigura would have two nominee directors (CEO is not part of the board).

Prashant S Ruia, who represented the promoter Ruia family, too exited the board of Essar Oil after the stake sale. So did Suresh Jain, Director (Finance).

The outgoing board had nine members, including Chairman Prashant S Ruia. It had three other executive directors in Gupta, Jain and Chakrapany Manoharan, Director (Refinery).

The new management has retained Manoharan. Independent directors Dilip J Thakkar and KN Venkatsubramanian have also been retained and so has nominee of LIC, R Sudarsan.

For what it’s worth, they did finish runners-up in the quadrennial event. And whatever plans the team management charted for that tournament worked — barring Pakistan in the final, of course.

Yet they have to redraw the plans for the 2019 ODI World Cup and the team management has identified the wobbly No 4 spot as the weakest link. And with two years remaining, now is a good time to start working on it. “KL Rahul will bat at No 4 in the ODI series against Sri Lanka. He is too good a player to be left out of the playing eleven at this time,” said coach MSK Prasad this past week.

Rahul has climbed the charts very quickly in the last year or so, and has gained immense confidence from the dressing room in his abilities across formats. As such there are two ways to look at Prasad’s comments.

One, the Indian team has decided upon its opening combination for the near future. Rohit Sharma is steadfast at one end, while Shikhar Dhawan — with three international hundreds (and another four half-centuries across formats) since June — has bought himself more time.

And it is the continued inclusion of Ajinkya Rahane that confirms Rahul’s future batting spot. The latter had missed out on the New Zealand series last October due to a hamstring injury, and scored only 24 runs in three matches as he opened against England early this year. He was then unfit for the 2017 IPL and missed the Champions Trophy, both due to a shoulder injury. This resulted in Rahane being chosen as the back-up opener for the Champions Trophy.

Prasad was clear that Rahane would not be a middle-order choice as Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were picked. When Rahane opened in the Caribbean (as Rohit was rested), the debate was sealed — he is no longer seen as a No 4 option. Second, Rahane came into the ODI side as an opener and it was the same line of thought — that he was too good a player to be left out — by then-skipper MS Dhoni that saw him shunted up and down the batting order over the years. The result has been an unstable No 4.

There is no denying that Rahul has climbed the charts with great efficiency, and whilst doing so, has shown a sense of adventurism in his game. When he burst onto the scene in 2014-15, he was seen as a compact opener for Test cricket. Over the next year or so, he added various dimensions — mostly attacking stroke play — to his game. The result was easy to see in the 2016 IPL — he scored 397 runs in 12 innings at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 146.49.

The point is that he scored those runs batting in the middle-order and complementing the likes of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Rahul was afforded the opportunity to make his ODI debut thereafter and he scored 100*, 33 and 63* in his first three ODIs (albeit in Zimbabwe).

That was nearly 15 months ago, and much has changed since, including Rahul’s own improved ability to score runs.

There is no doubt that he merits a run in the ODI format and yet this move leaves room for doubt. Rahul moving down to No 4 will only be a repeat of the Rahane experiment.

It gives rise to further questions. How long will they persist with Rahul in the middle order if he is not successful? And what does this mean for Manish Pandey, who has been waiting for a way back into the ODI eleven since autumn last year?

It’s a coin toss for now. Heads, they win and Rahul solves India’s long-standing problems at the No 4 spot. Tails, they go back to the drawing board. At the least they have two years to figure it out."

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad,"BREAKING RECORDS

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad

• Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:47 AM Rob Johnston in Birmingham

Broad admitted it was extra special to have moved passed Botham - one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. © Getty

Stuart Broad admitted that it was a special feeling to become England's second-highest Test wicket-taker on the final day of the first Test against Windies at Edgbaston. When Broad bowled Shane Dowrich in the evening session of the final day with a ball that nipped back sharply, he moved to 384 Test wickets, overtaking Sir Ian Botham in the list of England's highest Test wicket-takers. James Anderson, Broad's great friend and opening partner, leads the list with 492 Test wickets.

""It's a really special day,"" Broad said on Saturday (August 19). ""I felt really good in that little spell of bowling [on the final evening]. It was probably the best 40 minutes of bowling I've had this summer."" After a frustrating start to Windies' innings - he had two catches dropped on the second evening - Broad's rewards came quickly as he took the five wickets he needed to overtake Botham across two of the visitors' innings on the third day.

It was, Broad admitted, extra special to have moved passed Botham, one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. ""He's someone who has been a big influence on me, playing with my Dad, watching some of his performances against Australia,"" he said. ""He is a huge legend of English cricket but someone who has given back to this team. I was fortunate to get my first cap off him in 2007.

""In the past couple of years, he's spent more and more time in the changing room and guys really listen to him. He's someone who's passionate about English cricket and wants us to do well. I could tell he was genuinely proud and delighted that I've managed to go past him. That's testament to him,"" he added.

Broad has bowled well this summer without the rewards to show for it. He took just 11 wickets against South Africa but looked in good rhythm throughout that series and had not been unduly worried about his form. ""I feel like I've been threatening and creating chances,"" Broad said. ""If I save all my wickets for Australia I don't mind,"" he said.

On the third day in Birmingham, he picked up two wickets in the Windies' first innings and three in the second, bowling a full length at good pace. He took 3-17 in a seven-over spell in the final session which was somewhat reminiscent of some of the magical spells Broad has delivered during his Test career to date.

After dismissing Roston Chase and captain Jason Holder in successive balls, leaving him in joint second place with Botham, Broad could have gone passed the former all-rounder in style. The Edgbaston crowd willed him on but Broad's hat-trick ball was resolutely blocked by Kemar Roach although Dowrich was dismissed soon after.

Broad, who has played 107 Tests, is probably not given the credit he deserves for his exploits. His 384 wickets have come at the impressive average of 28.47 and he has taken 15 five-wicket hauls and two ten-fors. He will go down as one of England's finest-ever fast bowlers and it is perhaps his misfortune that his career has coincided with that of Anderson. Had it not, he may have got even more plaudits.

At 31, Broad will have plenty of opportunity to add to his haul. His injury record has been generally good and provided he stays fit and is managed well, achieving 500 Test wickets is by no means out of the question. ""I still feel like I've got quite a lot of cricket left in me,"" he said. ""I'm really enjoying being a part of this team at the moment. I'd certainly hope that my performances will keep improving so I'd be part of that 2019 Ashes. I'm not someone who looks too far ahead because I think it slows you down as a performer. You don't know if you'll have the luck with injuries.

""I play cricket for the competitive side of it. I love that feeling of being in a battle, that feeling with the new ball, getting an opening batsman out and they're desperate to

survive. That's the reason I play. I'll play as long as that drive is there. It's still within me now. As soon as that goes, I'll know that I'm gone.""

Broad is best known for the magic spells that have defined his career; his 8-15 against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2015, 6-17 against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2016, 5-37 against Australia at the Oval in 2009. Perhaps because of those standout performances, his consistency is often overlooked. Not since 2012 has he averaged more than 30 runs per wicket in a calendar year.

""My career has always been a little bit like that,"" Broad said. ""Pick up a two-fer, a two-fer and then get a six-fer out of nowhere."" Can he sense when he is on the cusp of one of those spells? ""I sort of can. I do feel light in my run-up. I make the batsmen play every ball. When I don't get it quite right, I get pushed in to fifth stump and get left. I really don't like being left, it feels like a waste of a run-up. I love batsmen playing forward defensives at me because if I get any sort of nibble, it brings both sides in.""

Broad will be a key player for England in this winter's Ashes, a series he thinks is going to be ""a belter"". Although, if England's management are considering resting him from one of the next two Tests against Windies to save him for Australia, they might have to think again. ""I will be politely suggesting that I will have sufficient rest in September and October to be available for the next two Tests against West Indies,"" he said.

"Draft rules against 'cut practice' recommend 5 years in jail for doctors, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The nine-member committee working on the legislation recently submitted the first draft to the state's medical education department. A final version is expected soon

MUMBAI: A preliminary draft of the proposed legislation against ""cut practice"" has recommended a jail term of five years and penalty of up to Rs 50,000 against doctors indulging in unethical means to exploit patients.The nine-member committee working on the legislation recently submitted the first draft to the state's medical education department. A final version is expected soon.Tentatively named the "" Prevention of Cut Practices in Healthcare Services Act, 2017"", the legislation is being framed to clamp down on unnecessary referral of patients by a doctor, hospital or a diagnostic centre. A doctor or medical institution will face an inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) if a complaint is lodged against them under section 3 of the law that defines the offences of ""cut practice"".The ACB is expected to check the veracity of the complaint and complete the investigation within three months. It can seek additional time of three months. A provision of fining bogus complainants has been made. After a probe, the ACB will file a complaint before the sessions court, which will try the case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Till the inquiry is complete, anyone trying to malign the reputation of the doctor or the healthcare service provider shall be liable to one month's jail (see box).The draft rules also call for simultaneous action from the respective medical council under which the doctor or the hospital is registered. ""If a medical professional or a hospital is found guilty, the council shall take cognizance of such offence and initiate an inquiry into the case within six months of the receipt of the FIR,"" it says. It should take appropriate legal action and may also suspend the guilty for at least three months.Former DGP Praveen Dixit , who is heading the nine-member committee, said the draft will take into account public opinion. ""Stakeholders can send their opinion to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), which will be considered and incorporated after discussions,"" he said. He added that veterinary doctors, occupational therapists and even dentists will come under the purview of the law. Interestingly, the rules are silent on alternative medicine practitioners, such as homeopaths.DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said a series of meetings has been lined up with medical experts. ""Several clauses may be added, refined. We are planning to get the final draft ready by November and sending it to the law and judiciary department. We want to table it in the winter session of the assembly,"" he said."

"Gorakhpur deaths: Gorakhpur tragedy: IMA gives clean chit to doctors over allegations of medical negligence, Health News, ET HealthWorld","AGRA: A fact finding committee of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to assess the reasons for the Gorakhpur hospital tragedy has given a clean chit to Dr Rajiv Mishra and Dr Kafeel Khan , as far as medical negligence is concerned but hasn't ruled out administrative lapses on their part.The committee has recommended that administrative inquiry and action could be initiated against the two doctors. The inquiry has also revealed that oxygen supply was interrupted for a short time on the night of August 10, as the supplier had failed to replenish stocks due to non-payment of his dues for the last 5-6 months. The report also reveals that the hospital was handling cases of patients needing oxygen supply more than its capacity.Talking to TOI, President of IMA, Dr KK Agarwal said that the report had been sent, along with recommendations to the UP government .He said that according to the fact finding report no evidence of medical negligence found against the then principal Dr RK Mishra and head of children’s encephalitis ward at the hospital, Dr Kafeel Khan, who was sacked by the government on Sunday.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) appointed a team of three members to inquire into the death of nearly 70 children at a hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur city. The report states that no alert was issued by the hospital administration regarding shortage of oxygen and treating doctors should have been alerted in advance about the shortage.The report also states that cleanliness of hospital and the wards was unsatisfactory, besides presence of dogs and rats in the premises. The report states that such standards are not acceptable.The report also points out that there are no facilities in Gorakhpur and nearby districts to manage encephalitis and ICUs in 10 districts of Purvanchal area are not functioning due to lack of staff and other resources.At least 30 children died in 48 hours at BRD Medical College on August 10 and 11. Many of the deaths were alleged to have been caused because of shortage of oxygen, a claim dismissed by the Uttar Pradesh government.IMA has suggested certain measures to avoid similar situation in the future. These include a state policy to airlift such critically ill patients in a timely manner to nearby best facilities, all payments for health care services of such cases should be made either in advance or in time, hospitals should have backup of one week supply of all essential drugs and oxygen.Also, patients who are denied treatment at government hospitals should be reimbursed for the cost of treatment in the private sector at predefined rates, need to make distinction between clinical medical and administrative negligence."

The move by the government has the potential to attract investors in the auction which has already received over 45 Expression of Interest (EoI) in more than a month, according to DGH website. However, a senior executive close to the auction process said the government has received around 75 EOIs since the auctions were made live on 1 July.The oil ministry is offering over 85 percent of the country’s 3.14 million square kilometres of hydrocarbon sedimentary area under the new bidding mechanism of OALP and a revamped exploration policy HELP. The new OALP bidding mechanism under HELP allows investors to bid for acreages throughout the year. The current auction under HELP follows the just-concluded Discovered Small Fields (DSF) bidding rounds under which 31 blocks were awarded to around two dozen mostly small-sized firms."
Daughters of India have a new hero and role model: Shayara Bano,"Today the Supreme Court of India found the practice of triple talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, violative of the fundamental right contained in Article 14 of the Constitution, which provides all persons equality before the law – prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, sex etc. It’s a momentous judgment in the life of our nation. We can be sure that its implications will unfold in many ways in the years and decades to come – likely empowering not just Muslim women, in fact not just women but also other subjects of discrimination, in their struggle for equality.

While there has long been mainstream consensus that triple talaq brutalizes women, it survived so far in the name of religion. In this it is only one of many practices like nikah halala, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, unequal guardianship rights, and unequal access to places of worship – where women continue to be subjected to discrimination in the name of religion and tradition. In this sense today’s victory is not the end of the fight but just the beginning.

For a brutalized woman the fight can seem daunting, the rewards uncertain, the journey uphill and sometimes backbreaking. The question she asks herself is, what difference can I make? But what a difference Shayara Bano has made. She was the first petitioner in the case that made history today. Fifteen years of marriage came to an abrupt end for her when in 2015 she was served a talaqnama via Speed Post. To underline, her husband ended the marriage unilaterally and instantaneously, with a letter in which talaq was written thrice. Unlike the millions of other women who have suffered similar injustice in silence, she went to court.

Petitioners Aafreen Rehman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri joined her. Lawyers like Indira Jaising and collectives like Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board stood like rock next to her. From all over India support poured in from Muslim and Hindu women alike. A solidarity grew where a woman had been abandoned, alone and browbeaten.

Shayara Bano calls pushing triple talaq into history’s dustbin “a milestone on the road to reforms”. It’s a pretty distinguished milestone. It guarantees her a place in tomorrow’s textbooks. She has emerged as a hero of modern India. Her story should now be told to all the daughters of India, to make them stronger and aware of their rights and ready to stand up for them.

As the Attorney General submitted to Supreme Court, “Gender justice [is] a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same half of the country’s citizenry would not be able to enjoy to the fullest – their rights, status and opportunities.”

Politicians are trying to hijack today’s victory. But it belongs to the women of India and to everyone who values the fundamental right to equality."

Why Sasikala may still hold the key to survival of Tamil Nadu government,"TV news headlines have been dominated by the AIADMK merger where a reunion took place between Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami (EPS) and his predecessor O Panneerselvam (OPS) in Chennai on Monday. Both sides have been locked in a bitter tussle after former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide VK Sasikala was convicted in a disproportionate assets case in February. Though the merger comes as a boost to EPS-OPS camp who is trying to oust Sasikala from the party, yet the key to state government’s survival could still lie with Sasikala’s nephew – TTV Dhinakaran.

Even as the merger was being played out live on TV, reports suggest that there were as many as 16 AIADMK MLAs present at Dhinakaran’s residence watching the proceedings. As many as 23 MLAs and four MPs were seen on a public platform with party leaders at a rally organised by AIADMK deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaran in Madurai last week. The latest development has put Dhinakaran in a position where he enjoys no power over the state government. But this may not be enough for EPS-OPS to stop Dhinakaran from bringing down the government.

AIADMK factions finally unite, Panneerselvam is deputy CM https://t.co/4sys6uUTk3 pic.twitter.com/wV8pXLGcqk — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 21, 2017

The current strength of the Tamil Nadu assembly is 232 after the death of two MLAs including Jayalalithaa. This would put the required number at 117 to defeat a no-confidence-motion brought by the opposition led by DMK. During the February confidence vote, EPS had the support of 122 MLAs while OPS is said to have the backing of another 10 MLAs. The figure of 132 could be misleading as this includes the 16 MLAs who were present at Dhinakaran’s house on Monday. The government would be one short of a majority if Dhinakaran and the opposition can hold on to their MLAs.

Steps will be taken to remove Sasikala from party: AIADMK MP https://t.co/kYzkDJAkc5 pic.twitter.com/YXW9rUUeMp — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 21, 2017

Such a scenario could result in another assembly election where DMK may have the advantage due to a disunited AIADMK. The current assembly still has almost four of its five year tenure left. The only hope for political stability for EPS-OPS combine is that their merger could help convince MLAs from Dhinakaran camp to jump ship and stave off an early election."

"Nuclear medical generators stuck at airports, PMO concerned, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: Reacting to a TOI report on the scarcity of nuclear generators affecting diagnosis at the country’s leading hospitals, the prime minister’s office asked doctors from AIIMS , New Delhi, on Monday to brief its officials about the issue. Over 90 technetium-99m generators, which could have helped perform nearly 10,000 life-saving scans, have been languishing at Mumbai and New Delhi international airports since August 6 and are close to expiry.TOI had reported the previous Saturday how the generators with a maximum shelf life of 14 days are stuck at airports because one of the major importers could not complete the paperwork for a new licence in time. As a result, thousands of scans to be carried out at nuclear medicine centres for cancer, heart, renal diseases had to be cancelled.Dr Chetan Patel, who heads the nuclear cardiology unit at AIIMS, said the PMO has promised to look into the matter and expedite the process of getting approvals. “Currently, we have cut down the volume of tests by 40%,” he said. The hospital has approached the government’s Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology for the key radioactive material but is yet to receive supply.Currently, in most of the 200-odd nuclear medicine centres in the country, scans have either been completely stopped or drastically reduced. “The crisis will worsen as we have been told there will be no supply in the coming weeks,” said Dr B R Mittal, head of nuclear medicine, PGIMER Chandigarh, which normally performs at least 100 scans every day. “We are forced to turn away patients,” he added.While the generators have been coming to the country since the past 30 years, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) imposed quality control last October, making it mandatory for importers to obtain fresh licences. However, an order asking the customs to restrict their import has disrupted the supply of generators since one of the importers is yet to get the registration certificate. Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh had previously told TOI that importers were given five to six extensions since last year to complete the formalities.A bigger hazard looming now is that of radiation exposure at the two key airports. Even if the generators become useless for medical consumption, they cannot be discarded like regular medical waste. Hospitals store them for two to three months before they become non-radioactive and are safe to be discarded. “Since airports don’t have any such facility, there is a risk of radiation exposure, even if minimal,” said Dr Anshu Sharma, president, Society of Nuclear Medicine (India). “The Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) has stringent regulations for discarding of radioactive materials. How will airports follow these regulations?” he said.Vishat Diagnostics, the largest importer of technetium-99m generators that supplies to 80% of the hospitals, said they won’t import generators till they get the registration certificate. Ajith Kumar from Vishat said, “We have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 15 lakh because of the government’s stance. We will not be importing any more generators till we have all the papers.”Meanwhile, patients have been badly hit. Patang Khandekar (65), who was asked to undergo a full-body scan, was turned back from a Marol hospital on Monday. “It is sad that we have wasted precious radioactive material that our nuclear reactors don’t manufacture,” said Dr G Mahapatra from SevenHills Hospital."
"In his first big foreign policy speech, President Trump slams Pakistan","In the most direct speech ever from a world leader, President Trump rebuked Pakistan for housing terror groups. On the 21st of August, 2017, speaking to the armed forces in Fort Myers, Virginia, President Trump spoke about his Afghanistan -South Asia strategy. He was candid, direct about how he had asked his cabinet to come up with a strategy on Afghanistan and then had made his decision.

“No nation building anymore,” he said, “we are killing terrorists.” And assured the forces that there would not be micromanagement from Washington and strategic decisions would be made on the ground. This time America would fight to win.

President Trump regretted that the war in Afghanistan was in its 17 years and the blood and treasure had been enormous but he said he owed it to the soldiers who had fought and died to finish what they had gone for—killing terrorists in their safe havens and not letting a vacuum develop as in Iraq and in Afghanistan by hastily withdrawing troops.

On the issue of Islamic terrorism, Trump, has not wavered once. He spoke about it candidly in Saudi Arabia; wanted to extreme vet immigrants coming from countries that were considered to be harbouring terrorists; and has nailed Afghanistan and Pakistan as countries that have 20 US designated foreign terrorist organizations. This has made the security threat from this region immense. Therefore, America would have to after the terrorists.

“For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens for agents of chaos, violence and terror,” he said and he was committed to stripping terrorists of their territory and cutting of their funding. Calling them thugs, criminals, predators and losers he declared that we will defeat them handily.

This could imply that US troops would no longer be constrained to chase the Haqqani network into safe havens in Pakistan and that even terror groups in Pakistan would come under the radar to be destroyed.

President Trump said that a pillar of the new strategy is how to change the approach to deal with Pakistan. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations; the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.”

It had much to lose by harbouring criminals, terrorists. He said that though Pakistan had been a partner in the past it had sheltered the same organizations “that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time, they are housing the terrorists that we are fighting!”.

“But that will have to change and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a county’s harbouring of militants and terrorists that target US servicemen. Time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace.”

President Trump said that another critical part of the strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India- “the world’s largest democracy and the key security and economic partner of the US.”

This will definitely send a strong signal to both Pakistan and China that the US is firmly behind India. No longer is Pakistan going to be able to hold a gun to America’s head and say, “we will implode if you don’t pay us,” or “ we are a victim of terror.”

China too, indirectly, has been put on notice. Perhaps, they will realize that they can’t side with Pakistan indefinitely on terror. Their huge stakes in CPEC could also be at stake.

President Trump also said that the NATO allies have contributed and will continue to contribute towards fighting terror.

He was firm that there would be no blank checks and Afghanistan would have to commit to share the burden, to reform and play its part in the effort to stabilize itself.

Since President Trump came to office, I have written about the times his administration has chided Pakistan and foretold that he would be good for India. He has not disappointed me yet."
"NPPA may lose absolute power to fix drug prices under new policy, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government proposes to revamp the country’s drug pricing regulator, allowing it to set prices of only essential medicines.The latest draft proposals suggest amendments to the drug pricing policy and inducting advisory body of experts in a move to strengthen the regulatory body, but at the same time may take away its absolute power to fix drug prices in public interest.Last year, Niti Aayog , the health ministry and the Department of Pharmaceuticals ( DoP ) were engaged in discussions to dissolve NPPA in its current form and reallocate it within the department. This proposal did not materialise.NPPA presently functions as an autonomous body that regulates prices of medicines under the National List of Essential Medicines and also monitors the prices of those that are not on the list. DoP’s latest draft pharma policy suggested that NPPA can cap prices of only those drugs included in the NLEM. The NPPA should lay down and enforce price ceilings of “selected medicines” and ensure that “adequate quantities” of the drugs are available.“National List of Essential Medicines will remain the basis of the medicines to be brought under price regulation… the Department of Pharmaceuticals will prepare the list of medicines for price regulation and transmit them to the NPPA for fixing the price ceilings,” according to the latest draft of the pharmaceuticals policy, a copy of which ET has seen.Appeals against NPPA’s decisions will lie with the government, while appeals against the government’s decisions will be decided by the judiciary.“On pricing, it seems to propose broad changes to the functions and processes of NPPA. The draft appears to impose greater oversight on NPPA such as review of all its decisions, which could mean greater say over NPPA’s ability to cap prices in public interest also,” said Malini Aisola, a member of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a civil society group. Some groups said the proposals would dilute the powers of NPPA.The draft may encourage profiteering if implemented as it proposes to weaken the powers of NPPA, Swadeshi Jagran Manch national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan told ET. The Manch is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It said the proposed provisions and amendments shift several important decisions to the Central government.The draft policy, circulated for stakeholder views, suggests amending the drug pricing policy and inducting an advisory body of experts to strengthen the regulatory body. It seeks to improve access to affordable medicines, reduce dependence on other countries including China for raw material, improve manufacturing quality and create an ecosystem to support innovative new drugs.One recommendation is to reorient the Drug (Prices Control) Order, 2013, which NPPA currently follows for its pricing decisions, to shift focus from price control to monitoring of drug prices, their availability and accessibility.The Department of Pharmaceuticals will be able to direct usage of emergency powers under Para 19 of the DPCO to regulate prices of patented medicines that are not under compulsory licensing.NPPA used powers under Para 19 on Wednesday to slash prices of knee implants by up to 69%, citing “extraordinary circumstances” as the devices were not on the list of essential medicines and hadn’t been notified for price control.“Language of DPCO should be made more definitive. There should not be much scope for different interpretations,” according to the draft.Apart from civil society, industry and government representatives, the draft proposes that NPPA’s advisory body for pricing should consist of doctors, pharmacists and other experts. While NPPA won’t have to accept the recommendations of this body, it will be required to assign reasons in writing for modifying or rejecting them.Civil society groups such as AIDAN said they are studying the draft. “While on the one hand the draft has some positive initiatives to improve access to affordable medicines, in some instances it seems to push towards deregulation,” said Aisola.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch wrote to Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar on Wednesday, alleging that the Department of Pharmaceuticals is “working against” the stated objectives of the Prime Minister and the chemicals and fertilizers ministry."
Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev’s kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, “You (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.” Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki’s eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki’s eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, “You have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them”. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.“So you take this son back,”he told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‘any of these sons can be the cause of great trouble’. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama’s job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God’s representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies — lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion — but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki’s womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna’s appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose — of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon’s founder, insisted — as all the great acharyas also insisted — that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified. If you engage in these activities, you will further pollute yourself.We want to overcome these enemies; we do not want to give them strength.Every time you give in to meaningless rituals, you are giving the enemies within your mind, greater strength and longevity, and they will overcome you. Ultimately, Krishna killed Kamsa. He appeared in this world, directly, in his original personal transcendental form,5,000 years ago through his wonderful pastimes which are revealed in the Srimad Bhagvatam and the Puranas, through his teachings of Bhagwad Gita, through his holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna,Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

Criminal negligence: Utkal Express derailment highlights deep rot in railways’ processes,"The derailment of Utkal Express in Khatauli, UP, that has claimed 23 lives, highlights yet again the abysmal state of railway safety. That the mishap occurred due to unofficial repair work on the track, without a proper time block for maintenance, exposes the culture of negligence that has seeped into the mass mover. No speed restriction warning was put at the maintenance spot just so delays wouldn’t reflect poorly on the performance report of the division and zone. This is far more dangerous than any infrastructure issue, as it represents a breakdown of basic systems and processes.

Suspensions and transfers may not be enough to send a strong message on accountability for the disaster; those found responsible should be tried for criminal negligence. A quick look at the statistics reveals a shocking state of affairs. The 2016-17 period saw more people die in derailments than in any of the last 17 years. And of the 586 rail accidents in the last five years, around 53% were due to derailments. Plus, the arrears of track renewal are constantly mounting leading to disproportionately high maintenance effort. It appears that maintenance simply can’t keep up with requirement, forcing short cuts that inevitably compromise safety.

Add to this the administrative structure of the railways that prevents proper safety oversight. The railway board is rule maker, operator and regulator at the same time. This prevents accountability from being fixed. The need of the hour is an independent and empowered regulator, outside the ambit of the railway ministry, to audit rail safety. In addition to existing safety issues, the railways also needs to be aware of non-conventional threats such as terrorism. The Kanpur train accident last November that led to the deaths of more than 140 people has been blamed on sabotage. Probes and committee reports on such cases need to be put out in the public domain and preventive measures taken.

The current NDA dispensation may be good at painting and selling big visions like that of bullet trains, but what the railways desperately needs is better implementation of routine procedures on the ground. Railway minister Suresh Prabhu did well to begin his innings by not giving into the populist tendency to announce new trains. However, his track record in turning the mass mover into an efficient and safe outfit has been below expectations so far."

"China to set new power transmission prices by end-Oct -NDRC, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","BEIJING: China said on Tuesday it will set new power transmission prices by the end of October, in its latest effort to liberalise the power market and promote trading of electricity across different regions.

Beijing has made a series of moves to open up the country's monopolised power market since late 2015, including launching a power trading scheme for eight provinces and reducing power distribution prices.

Power grid operators charge utilities transmission fees to transport electricity within a region as well as between regions.

The National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement it will announce transportation prices on the major West to East power grid by October and revisit prices every three years.

The aim of the move is to create a more level playing field for utilities across the world's No. 2 economy.

Under recent market reforms, utilities in western regions, such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, are now able to sell electricity on the east coast, but they complain transmission fees are too high, which makes them uncompetitive with local utilities.

"Government to ink MoU with private hospitals for Hridayam initiative, Health News, ET HealthWorld","KOCHI: With the government set to launch the congenital heart disease management programme Hridayam (for little hearts), the health department is in the process of inking MoU with three more private hospitals to empanel them for treating congenital heart problems.At the moment there are three government empanelled hospitals namely Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Government Medical College, Kottayam and the medical college in Kozhikode. In the private sector, only Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIMS ) was empanelled.Now, the government's assessment committee has inspected three private hospitals namely Aster Medcity , Kochi; Lisie Hospital, Kochi and Believers Church Medical College Hospital, Thiruvalla. The panel recommended that since these hospitals meet the technical requirement, government can sign MoUs with them so that patients will get free treatment at these institutions.""Three more private hospitals are being empanelled to reduce waiting time,"" said state mission director of National Health Mission (NHM) Keshvendra Kumar.Hridayam is a unique initiative by the state government to support children with congenital heart disease (CHD), which happens to be the 'largest treatable cause of death' among infants. Hridayam is a web-based solution that will care for children with CHD. The initiative will monitor the programme envisaged for the management of children with CHD, identify bottlenecks for implementing established protocols, and understand case status and response time.As per the plan, a beneficiary will have to register at Hridayam website and after the registration process is complete, the surgery dates fixed by the empanelled institutions would be provided to the child's parents.""Family members can choose the date and empanelled hospital they want to go ahead with the operation.

"There are many projects in India to sequence human genomes: Brenda J Andrews, Health News, ET HealthWorld",", Professor and Director,, Canada, talks to ETHealthworld about the growth of functional genomics and their collaboration with India. Edited excerpts:The difference between genomics and functional genomics is that “genomics” is the science of determining a genome sequence. We can determine genome sequences now in any organism in a very short period of time for little money. Functional genomics is the science of trying to understand the information and that requires us to manipulate it in some way to see what the consequences are of perturbing certain genes and certain sequences in the genome. There is no technology of doing that in all systems. Doing a focussed experiment is a major challenge which will require huge investments by labs around the world, to try to really understand what each gene in the human genome is doing and how the genomes work together to make the cells function the way they do. We need to understand how these genes basically are wired together in order to make a certain outcome. We are getting there in some of the projects that are ongoing in our centre which involve trying to perturb genes by themselves or in combination of trying to figure out what happens to the cells. I hope over the next few years a lot of current methods will be developed such as genome engineering methods that have come out in the last few years. Those can be further developed so that we can do functional genomics experiment much faster and interpret them better.The Donnelly Centre was established about 10 years ago with the idea of setting up centre for biology and the idea was to make rapid progress in functional genomics. Mainly we need to put scientists with different expertise together in the same place. We are at the University of Toronto, it has a great computer science department, a great chemistry department, big faculty of medicine but those people never use to talk to each other. So we thought to put them together in the same space and then new science will emerge. The building opened in 2006, our scientists in the building were from applied sciences in engineering, people that were experts in stem cell engineering, other people from the chemistry department and a lot of computer scientists cause you need a lot of computer scientists to interpret genome information. In the last 10 years we also requited new people into the building which filled the gaps in our expertise and now we have many ongoing projects that involve collaborations between at least 5-6 different scientists in the centre and their trainees. So we consider that our bigger success that is our project has started because of who we are and where we are together, in the same building and that probably wouldn’t have happened if we were scattered across other buildings.The partnering with India that is ongoing at the moment was set up largely by Sachdev Sidhu who is a professor in the Donnelly Centre. He was recruited to the centre from genetics in the United States where he developed platforms for doing a technical platform called Phage Display and this allowed him to engineer proteins. So these are the building blocks or protein that were encoded by the DNA to engineer proteins to do basically what he wanted them to do and the specialty is antibodies which are one of the largest growing drug sectors in the world. So they have setup this platform at the Donnelly centre and has been collaborating to try to think about how we might together make new antibodies that are largely oncology targets together.It is hard to predict because five years ago if you asked me how I see the future I would have been completely wrong. The reasons are two: DNA sequencing got a lot cheaper and we have got better methods for genome engineering. So the CRISPR Cas9 system can now be used to precisely engineer the human genome and that wasn’t available 5 years ago. It is hard to predict if you can’t even imagine what techniques might come so that makes it a challenging but also a very exciting time in biomedicine. I certainly think that we might have huge amounts of genome sequencing information. I know that there are many projects here in India to sequence human genomes. There are projects like that around the world and I think we will get way better in understanding it; our computational methods will get better so I think the flow of information 5 years from now will be much smoother and much valuable."

India's first chopper taxi service was announced earlier this month and Bengaluru is the city to have these operations commence by December 2017. Authorities at the Bengaluru International Airport Ltd. (BIAL) have tied up a deal with the Thumby Aviation, a Kerala based helicopter service to facilitate the heli-taxi service.

The service will shuttle the passengers from city to the airport on demand and at a price equivalent to that of taxis. For instance, a ride from Electronic City, Bengaluru to Kempegowda International Airport will take 15 minutes on average, a fraction of the 90-150 minutes it can take by road.

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
"Donald Trump rebuffs coal industry; CEO claims promise broken, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Washington: The Trump administration has rejected a coal industry push to win a rarely used emergency order protecting coal-fired power plants, a decision one executive said breaks a personal promise from President Donald Trump to take the extraordinary step to benefit the industry.

The Energy Department says it considered issuing the order sought by companies seeking relief for plants it says are overburdened by environmental regulations and market stresses. But the department ultimately ruled it was unnecessary, and the White House agreed, a spokeswoman said.

The decision is a rare example of friction between the beleaguered coal industry and the president who has vowed to save it.

It also highlights a pattern emerging as the Trump administration crafts policy: The president's bold declarations, both public and private, are not always carried through to implementation.

Trump committed to the measure in private conversations with executives from Murray Energy Corp. and FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. after public events in July and early August, according to letters to the White House from Murray Energy and its chief executive, Robert Murray.

In the letters, obtained by The Associated Press, Murray said failing to act would cause thousands of coal miners to be laid off and put the pensions of thousands more in jeopardy.

One of Murray's letters said Trump agreed and told Energy Secretary Rick Perry, ""I want this done"" in Murray's presence.

The White House declined to comment on Murray's assertion. A spokesman for Murray Energy, Gary Broadbent, also declined to comment on the letters.

Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said the agency was sympathetic to the coal industry's plight.

""We look at the facts of each issue and consider the authorities we have to address them, but with respect to this particular case at this particular time, the White House and the Department of Energy are in agreement that the evidence does not warrant the use of this emergency authority,"" Hynes said in a statement yesterday.

The aid Murray sought from Trump involves invoking a little-known section of the US Federal Power Act that allows the Energy Department to temporarily intervene when the nation's electricity supply is threatened by an emergency, such as war or natural disaster. Among other measures, it temporarily exempts power plants from obeying environmental laws.

In the past, the authority has been used sparingly, such as during the California energy crisis in 2000 and following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Obama administration never used it. The Trump administration has used it twice in seven months in narrow instances.

Murray's company is seeking a two-year moratorium on closures of coal-fired power plants, which would be an unprecedented federal intervention in the nation's energy markets. The company said invoking the provision under the Power Act was ""the only viable mechanism"" to protect the reliability of the nation's power supply.

Murray told the White House that his key customer, Ohio- based electricity company FirstEnergy Solutions, was at immediate risk of bankruptcy. Without FirstEnergy's plants burning his coal, Murray said his own company would be forced into ""immediate bankruptcy,"" triggering the layoffs of more than 6,500 miners. FirstEnergy acknowledged to the AP that bankruptcy of its power-generation business was a possibility.

Murray urged Trump to use the provision in the Federal Power Act to halt further coal plant closures by declaring an emergency in the electric power grid.

After a conversation with Trump at a July 25 political rally in Youngstown, Ohio, Murray wrote, the president told Perry three times, ""I want this done."" Trump also directed the emergency order be given during an Aug. 3 conversation in Huntington, West Virginia, he said.

""As stated, disastrous consequences for President Trump, our electric power grid reliability, and tens of thousands of coal miners will result if this is not immediately done,"" he wrote.

Murray's claims raise the possibility that Trump was warned against the move by his advisers, some of whom are known to be more cautious, or that he simply made assurances to Murray to avoid immediate confrontation.

The people who worked on the decision most directly were Perry, Michael Catanzaro, who works under National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn as the top White House energy adviser, and Perry's chief of staff, Brian McCormack, US officials told the AP.

They spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal policy considerations by name.

Murray and his company have been impassioned supporters of Trump, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaign and inauguration, hosting fundraisers and embracing him as the rescuer of the Appalachian coal industry.

The friendliness has been mutual: When Trump repealed an Obama administration regulation barring coal companies from dumping mine waste in streams, Murray and his sons were invited for the signing.

The Energy Department has already informed Murray it will not invoke the law, an official with knowledge of the decision told the AP.

Coal has become an increasingly unattractive fuel for US electricity companies, which have been retiring old boilers at a record pace. At least two dozen big coal-fired plants are scheduled to shut down in coming months as utilities transition to new steam turbines fueled by cleaner-burning natural gas made more abundant in recent years by new drilling technologies.

Trump, who rejects the consensus of scientists that burning fossil fuels is causing global warming, has made reversing the coal industry's decline a cornerstone of his administration's energy and environmental policies. Since taking office, he announced that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, and he has moved to block or delay Obama-era regulations seeking to limit carbon emissions.

Other coal executives have urged similar government intervention to save their businesses. In a speech last week, the CEO of Peabody Energy Corp, the nation's largest coal producer, also said a two-year moratorium on coal-plant closures was needed.

Perry has already twice invoked the Federal Power Act in narrow ways at the request of utilities seeking to keep old coal-burning plants online past their planned retirement dates. In both cases, the utilities were allowed to continue operations at plants amid concerns that shutting them down could lead to regional shortages in electricity."

"Global Warming News, Heat, Cooling, Climate Change, Ice Melting, Population Decline","Climate change to have devastating effect in Asia, claims new study Changes to the jet stream can bring on unprecedented rainfall and massive flooding. Floods in Pakistan in 2010, the worst ever, killed about 3,000 people and left millions homeless. While some areas are suffering extreme droughts, in Southeast Asia, the number of record-setting daily rainfall amounts doubled over the past three decades. Up to a quarter of Bangladesh is inundated in a normal year, and century-level flooding could put 60 per cent of the country under water, the report says. Storm surges from tropical cyclones, destructive winds and landslides are other risks from weather extremes.

Science says: Fast-melting Arctic sign of bad global warming One of the coldest places on Earth is so hot it's melting. Glaciers, sea ice and a massive ice sheet in the Arctic are thawing from toasty air above and warm water below. The northern polar region is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet and that's setting off alarm bells.

"Varian Medical Systems: Today we need to build trust that comes through transparency and credibility in engagement with patients: Ashok Kakkar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Co-chair, FICCI Health Services Community andManaging Director,, Mumbai, talks about the highlight of FICCI HEAL Conference 2017 and shares his views on the recent healthcare amendments. Edited excerpts:If you look at the Indian healthcare scenario today, there are some excellent examples of patient centricity and excellence in care. Today India ranks almost at par with Western models when it comes to quality healthcare at affordable cost. Yet we also hear almost on a daily basis that today the Indian healthcare scenario lacks trust and the way the patients and the general consumers perceive especially the private healthcare with lot of suspicion. So I think, first and foremost what the sector needs to do and what the Indian hospitals need to do, is to build trust which comes through transparency and credibility in their engagement with their patients. The second piece, which again is corollary to the first one is how does hospitals today empower patients, whether it is through technology or otherwise and make them participate in the decision-making in the health decision-making and not treat it as a transaction or an episodial situation when a patient comes to the hospital he is discharged and then, you know, it’s all done with. It’s very important to ensure that the followships-survivorships are closely linked and patient remains in the center of the decision-making.FICCI is an excellent platform for exchange of ideas, where thought leaders both from public as well as private sectors engage and work towards betterment of the industry, and in this case in Healthcare sector. FICCI has very actively worked on issues of industry, working with the government whether it was related to taxation, custom duties, penetration of healthcare insurance in this country, and now we will look at the scenario around price-controls or standard treatment guidelines, public-private partnerships. So there are bunch of areas where FICCI has, and the teams, and the taskforces which FICCI creates, so that to ensure that there is inclusive approach in working on these subjects.I believe GST is good for the country, as well as for the healthcare sector, because it rationalizes and simplifies the environment. Having said that, and given the fact that healthcare services are exempt from GST, but, there could be an increase in input costs because lot of things that the hospitals buy, whether its medical equipment or other infrastructure, the impact of GST could be different, for example medical equipment especially capital equipment because of GST there is an increase in the custom-duty by two-two and a half points, so those will lead to increase in input costs for the hospitals. And given that, they cannot use this to set off, because there is no on-the-end GST, it make some increase in the cost but I think overall hospitals will have to find ways to be more productive and I don’t foresee that it would increase patient cost or the patient treatment channel.The pricing policy unfortunately has added a lot of confusion in this sector, while the intent may be good on part of the government to ensure that the patients are not exploited, because there have been cases around that. But what is very important is, for all the stakeholders again, government as well as the hospital providers to keep the entire care continuum and the costs around the care continuum in mind because it’s not just the device cost which is important, one has to look at the entire treatment, at what cost it can be delivered, say Angioplasty, at what price the Angioplasty gets delivered in the end to the patient is critical, is not just the cost of the stent for instant and I think, the government should've engaged the private sectors and the medical technology companies and the hospital providers in a manner that ultimately the patient would benefit, which unfortunately has not happened and that's where the confusion is.I believe there is a huge opportunity around public-private participation and the good news is that the government at the center is supporting it. The NITI Aayog had already been tasked to build models and NITI Aayog very actively has sought inputs from FICCI as an industry forum, they have invited even World Bank to help them build those models. We have done lot of PPPs in U.K and other parts of the world so we are helping t he government to create models which can then be adopted by the state governments. So that there is template available, and no one has to reinvent the wheel as far as PPPs are concerned because PPPs in healthcare can be very complex, and it’s important that in the end we build a model which is win-win and in the interest of patients at the large.When we talk about public-private participation or even private - private participation, example especially in the oncology space of private - private participation given the space in oncology is a little difficult the incubation is very long it requires a lot of regulatory approvals from AERB and so on. You will find some of the oncology chains in India going and setting up Oncology departments in existing hospitals. For instance, DMC in Ludhiana is a very good hospital run for several years doing excellent patient care but they had no oncology department so they invited a group called CTSI, Cancer Treatment Services International who run hospitals in Hyderabad to come and setup the Onco department and run it, so this is also a public private-private participation, it's not a public-private so we see these kind of models especially in oncology getting stronger there are companies like CTSI, Healthcare global, International Oncology, many of them who specialized in oncology. I see it’s a good step because building a hospital is not easy.Traditionally in India, it has been a doctor and his son and they will setup or a wife, to setup a hospital, but then it would normally be a one hospital phenomenon they would provide good service but they would not be able to expand because it requires huge amount of capital. So given now all the groups are coming in big corporates like this Apollo, Fortis, Max and they are expanding private equity funding which is coming in. CTSI got funded through TPG capital for instance so that gives them the breath and the muscle to then expand and reach out even to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there is a dearth of a good hospitals."
I've learnt so much out of failures: Dhawan,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

I've learnt so much out of failures: Dhawan

• Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 12:08 AM Gokul Gopal in Dambulla

Dhawan slammed his 11th ODI to guide India past the finishing line. © AFP

That Shikhar Dhawan becomes a whole different force when it comes to ICC events is a fact that can hardly be contested. In the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, he amassed two centuries and a fifty. Come the 2015 World Cup, he repeated that feat and also came up with big contributions in the 2017 edition of the Champions Trophy that concluded in June. Between the said events, however, he has had a few slumps that has resulted in him being out of the reckoning on occasions.

But since his latest comeback, Dhawan has gone from strength to strength with each performance of his, and in doing so, reaffirming his footing as one of the key members in the core group. His latest contribution was an unbeaten 132 in the opening ODI against Sri Lanka, that resulted in India's biggest victory in the format in terms of deliveries remaining,

""I would like to keep performing well. That would be my goal because I don't perform there are such great batsmen in our side that anyone can take the place,"" said Dhawan, who also recollected how some of his past failures have made him stronger as a cricketer. ""I embrace that period also. When I was not doing well I was just focusing on my processes. And when I am doing well, I am still focusing on my processes. I feel failure teaches you a lot and I am lucky I have learnt so much out of that.""

A few days before the start of the ODI series between Sri Lanka and India, the visiting team's chief selector, MSK Prasad, had stressed that the emphasis, going forward in Indian cricket, would be on fitness in the lead up to the 2019 World Cup. Parameters and strict adherence were some of the terms he had used to make his point while he also advocated a rotation policy to identify and nurture a core unit that would feature predominantly in the mega event. Dhawan too spoke about fitness and the need to perform consistently in order to remain atop the pecking order when it comes to team selection.

""I would like to keep my fitness on a high level because all the young boys are there (in the Indian side). I like to keep myself fit (and be) at the pace of the game. I don't really have too many goals that I have to score these many runs. I just focus on my process and in my process everything comes in. My fitness, skills, fielding. These are my process and I keep doing it,"" he said.

Elaborating on the fitness, especially how it helps a team become stronger as a fielding unit, Dhawan said: ""It is very important that everyone should be at the same level of fitness. Fielding is a major part in all three formats. One loose fielding can change the momentum and in today's cricket you have to be fit. Now it is very high-paced cricket and you have to be fit. It's a very fair thing. If you are not fit then I think the team has to take that load and it's not fair on the team. Every cricket team like Australia, England, etc. they all have fitness parameters. So it's good that we are doing it and becoming more professional,"" Dhawan said.

Speaking about being professional, the Indians were just that as they clinically dismantled Sri Lanka for 216 before reaching the target with more than 20 overs to spare. Be it the batting, bowling or fielding, India appeared light-years ahead of the home team to extend their dominating run in the series. Such was the apathy of Sri Lanka's performance that slogans were being shouted against them and abuses were hurled as the fans held a mini protest outside the ground after the match. Dhawan, though, had some comforting words for the Sri Lankan team.

""This is a young side and they are in transition period where all the boys will mature. In international cricket you need to have that experience. The young boys are good but with time they will get better that's what I feel.

""I don't use those harsh words,"" he said when asked if this was the worst Sri Lankan attack he has faced in his career. ""They have a good fast-bowling attack. Even in the Champions Trophy, they beat us. It's just that we have got a mature side, very experienced side so that plays a huge role because how you handle pressure situations matters a lot with experience. So I feel that with time Sri Lankan team will do good,"" Dhawan concluded.

Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release — to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour’s standards. Somehow ‘comfort zone’ has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life’s journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‘until a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.’ Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‘I’,the soil into which it is buried is God — the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected — into us.■

"SC Upholds Gender Equality, Suspends Triple Talaq For Six Months. Asks Govt To Form New Law","In a landmark judgement, the Indian Supreme Court has held that the practice of triple talaq among a section of Indian Muslims is unconstitutional.

BCCL/ Representational Image

Triple talaq, or verbal (triple) divorce, is practiced by some in the Muslim community to instantly divorce their wives by saying talaq three times.

A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khare has asked the parliament to pass a new law in this regard. If the law doesn't come into force in six months, then the injunction on Triple Talaq will continue.

AFP/ Representational Image

The apex court also expresses hope the Centre's legislation will take into account concerns of Muslim bodies and Sharia law. The verdict came in a host of cases filed by various rights groups and individuals challenging the controversial practice.

The petitioners claimed that the practice was against women's rights and regressive. Many Muslim women who were given triple talaq on trivial issues had also approached the court seeking a ban on the practice, something that is outlawed even in Islamic countries.

AFP

Islamic organization like the All India Muslim Personal Law Board had vehemently opposed any move to abolish the practice, citing constitutionality. Narendra Modi and his BJP had extensively campaigned against the practice, especially during the UP elections.

"Need to blend healthcare and technology for the hospital, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Technology enabled care is growing rapidly today

ByDirector Operations, Primecare INDIA, Bangalore mobile devices , and related technologies are presenting new opportunities in health care to better diagnose, monitor, and manage patients and treatment. Many providers employ these technologies along a continuum of wellness and prevention, to therapeutic remedies and treatments for illness. Some examples of current innovations include:Thanks to rapid advances in technology, today our doctors can diagnose, monitor and consult a patient from a distance through advanced telemedicine technology, videoconferencing, remote monitoring and other methods.Adoption of EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system has enabled the hospital and doctors to share patient health records such as prescriptions, lab reports, X-rays, CT, MRIs, Medical information through e-report by just a click.With the help of Electronic Medical Record/Electronic Health Records (EMR/HER) all risk factors such as loss of critical information, mismanagement of health records are ruled out. Patient files or patient records are being kept in databases securely. This is keeping with the best practices which have become a norm for doctors and hospitals today.“We live in an age in which every moment counts heavily and the price of delay is human lives.”At Hospital usage of technology advancements in Lab & Radiology diagnostics has substantially assisted in patient management. The technological advancements in the field of Radiology have transformed diagnosis interpretation. Earlier, the results used to take three to five days to reach the ordering physician but now it reaches within a short period of just thirty minutes. This advancement is of great gain because now, the interpreted report will reach the ordering physician quick enough to treat the patient in a shorter time span. All of this will prevent diseases from spreading to others’ and in turn save many lives. Due to advancement in technology, comprehensive information helps in accurate diagnosis and enables physicians to create an effective treatment plan and gain control over patients’ health during critical stages is much more accurate and fast. Following best practices have become a norm for doctors and hospitals today. Hospital Health Information System (HIS) technology focuses mainly on the administrational needs of the hospital. HIS is another integrated information system implemented in hospitals to manage all aspects of hospital’s operations like appointment scheduling, patient billing, financial accounting, patient visits for outpatient care, in an emergency, admission either a short stay or long in duration, medication therapy evaluation in inpatients care settings, OT management, Lab information system (LIS), pharmacy management, inventory management, resource management and corresponding processing of services is efficiently managed with the help of HIS. Hospital generate a wealth of data round the clock, 365 days a year, all of which needs to be well managed to ensure efficient functioning of hospital. Thanks to the IT for making healthcare look more organized and professional.We certainly can’t deny the benefits of technology in healthcare. Among the advantages of technology in healthcare we can also count the decline in preventable death cases, along with a general improvement of patients’ well-being. Treatment and recovery time have been reduced significantly. Medical technology doesn’t only affect patient’s quality of life; it also affects the lives of thousands of medical professionals and students spend time in training to become medical experts.From a bigger perspective, innovative health technology is helping us grow the world economy. More and more entrepreneurs and business owners have started to invest in medical technology today. If we are to widely consider the question, how has technology changed healthcare? There is no straightforward response since it’s an ongoing process. All we know is that it’s becoming a huge focus on world economies."
"renewable energy production: Karnataka at 3rd spot in renewable energy production, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Bengaluru: Karnataka has overtaken Gujarat to become the third highest producer of renewable energy after Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.The state, which occupied the fourth position last year, has outranked Gujarat in the recently released progress report of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy Energy minister D K Shivakumar said in a tweet: ""At 7,458MW, Karnataka now has the 3rd highest installed capacity in renewable energy. We will soon surpass Maharashtra to become 2nd in India."" The neighbouring Tamil Nadu is on top with 10,625 MW.G V Balaram, MD of Karnataka Renewable Energy Devlopment, said with the development of Asia's biggest solar park at Pavagada in Tumakuru district, they were confident of clinching the number one spot by April 2018. Farmers have voluntarily contributed over 12,000 acres for the project, which is estimated to cost Rs 20,000 crore.What led to the paradigm shift? ""The third rank among 29 states follows a marked shift in policy. Strong government support coupled with an attractive renewable energy policy has propelled Karnataka to the third place,"" Balaram said.He said the turnaround was possible because of increased targets fixed by Union ministry of renewable energy at 175 GW (gigawatts) by 2022. The Karnataka government revised its policy twice and set an ambitious target of solar energy generation at 6,000MW by March 2022 while the state's solar power potential is estimated to be above 24,700 MW.""Wind and solar energy have received good response, and the state has added 3,200 MW from renewable energy sources in the past four years. This year, we will add 3,000MW from solar power alone,"" he added.At present, he said Karnataka is the only state to provide such a lucrative proposition for solar power adoption. The state government acts as a major facilitator to bridge the energy demand and supply gap and supply power to the grid. Solar energy is getting cheaper by the year and in some time, it would be cheaper than the electricity grid,"" Balaram added""The favourable policy has also enabled large corporates to buy significant proportion of their power from solar farms at a discount to supply to grids under long-term contracts with solar developers,"" said Mahesh Raviraj, an executive associated with a reputable solar company.The Karnataka government is also working with farmers to lease their land for solar and wind power generation and make them stakeholders in the energy future. When it comes to cogeneration (use of power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time) and biomass generation, Karnataka is growing faster than other states."

ONGC currently owns 71.63 per cent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 per cent stake in it.Sources said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership isn't changing.The deal will be completed within a year, he said.HPCL will become a subsidiary of ONGC and will remain a listed company post the acquisition, the source said adding the board of the refining and marketing company will continue to remain in place.The government has also constituted a committee -- headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and road minister Nitin Gadkari to work out the modalities of the sale.Jaitley had in his Budget for 2017-18 talked about creating an integrated oil behemoth. After that oil companies were asked to give their options.ONGC had evaluated options of acquiring either HPCL or BPCL -- the two downstream oil refining and fuel marketing companies.It found the nation's second-biggest fuel retailer BPCL too expensive and conveyed its choice to the parent oil ministry.Sources said the transaction is likely to be completed within this fiscal year.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries"
House guests and fish: Both of them begin to stink up the home after about three days 😜,"It is truly said that house guests and fish have a common factor. After three days they begin to stink. You arrive at the host’s place full of warmth and sunshine and thoughtful gifts and they give you the hastily refurbished room with spanking new sheets, a fresh bar of soap, a fluffy towel smelling of naphthalene (saved in the suitcase for a special occasion) and a tube of toothpaste.

Come next morning and they have told you, relax, no rush to wake up, get over your jet lag, so you are lying there not making a noise in case they wake up and they are in the adjoining room lying there not making a noise in case you are disturbed and this absurd scenario in mutual accommodation can go half way onto lunch and then finally both have the same thought, they have to go and so the encounter occurs outside the bathroom door and now there is a flurry of no, no, you go first, no, you please, no hurry, all yours, it’s okay.

And then it is lunch and they have laid on a veritable feast and you haven’t the heart to tell them that you are on a sparse diet (so much for what the health) and this is going to wreck it and why have they bothered and the host is thinking, we never make this much on any other day, costs a fortune and they have pulled out the finest linen and crockery and that silver cutlery set that is used only to impress guests.

Then they have mapped out the tour for you to sightsee and you are not a sightseer and you have to pretend this is the most exciting idea and what you don’t know is that the host would rather watch Chelsea play Arsenal and instead he has to go with you because his wife hissed and said, it doesn’t look nice if you stay back, it’s only a soccer game.

Finally, it is day three and you have both run out of conversation and you are avoiding their obnoxious teenage children who resent you for having ‘stolen’ their room so they are having to share and the husband and wife are now asking oblique questions to ascertain when you are leaving like should we book theatre tickets for Sunday and your wife sends you a WhatsApp saying take them out for dinner and now you are in this fancy restaurant calculating the bill and it is a sobering thought that it is big enough for you to have stayed in a hotel and watched India play Sri Lanka."

While Australia have gone back to hiring the services of S Sriram, who helped their spinners during the India series earlier in the year, Bangladesh have added to their contingent, former India spinner Sunil Joshi, who has been roped in as the spin consultant for the immediate future.

The former slow left-armer confirmed the development to Cricbuzz but refused to divulge details of the duration of his service with Bangladesh's national side. ""Yes, I will be working as the spin consultant for the Australia series, and will be joining the (Bangladesh) side shortly,"" Joshi told Cricbuzz.

With Bangladesh having shown drastic improvements as a Test team in the last year,. the forthcoming two-match series marks a big opportunity for them to register their maiden Test win over Australia. It would be no surprise that they would bank on their strength, which also happens to be Australia's biggest weakness - spin.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board had gone all out in search of a spin consultant for the series, including the possibility of having Stuart MacGill in their coaching setup.

With the former Australian legspinner declining to take up the role due to illness, BCB turned towards Joshi, with whom they had earlier tried to initiate talks for the role of a bowling coach.

Joshi, who has played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs for India, was the Man of the Match in Bangladesh's first ever Test in 2000. He had scored 92 in his only innings and bagged eight wickets in the match, including a fifer.

Poland's amended renewables law positive for state-run utilities,"WARSAW: Poland's amended renewables law is positive for state-run utilities - Energa, Enea , PGE and Tauron, but negative for renewable power producers, Moody's Investors Service said.

The amended law, signed on Aug. 14, curbs subsidies for renewable power producers but reduces costs related to reaching green energy target for state-run utilities.

""The amendment to the RES Act will benefit energy supply companies, which purchase green certificates from renewable energy producers as a reduction in the substitution fee will lower their costs,"" Moody's said in a statement dated at Aug 21.

Support for renewable energy producers has been based on a certificates scheme, in which green certificates are issued to eligible power generators for each megawatthour of output.

Green certificates are traded either through an exchange or over the counter.

Demand for green certificates comes from retail energy suppliers, which need to meet the government-set requirement to obtain a certain proportion of energy from renewable energy sources, Moody's said.

The utilities can buy green certificates from renewable energy producers or pay a substitution fee.

The amended law changes the substitution fee from a fixed amount to one that is linked to the certificate's market price, which has been falling due to an oversupply of green certificates.

This will hit renewable energy producers, making their projects unprofitable, Moody's said.

The government, which sees renewable energy as unstble and a threat to the coal-burning industry, has banned building wind farms too close to dwellings and imposed higher property tax on wind farm owners.

""We caution that the lack of predictability of the regulatory framework may impact the financeability of renewable energy projects in Poland as regulatory risk is an important credit consideration,"" Moody's also said.

"Indian thrust on renewables will affect thermal projects: CEA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Overemphasis on renewable energy would result in reducing viability of coal-fired thermal power plants in India, adding to the massive non-performing assets (NPAs) of state-run lenders, Chief Economic Adviser ( CEA Arvind Subramanian said on Thursday.""Rapid changes in technology are promising to help realize the promise of renewables, which is an eminently desirable development. At the same time, these changes need to be seen in the context of India's current economic situation and its enormous endowments of coal, which is still a very cheap way of providing energy to hundreds of millions who are still energy-deprived,"" he said at the 16th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture here organised by The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ).Noting that both coal and renewable sources should be the focus of power generation, Subramanian said that ""for India today, the social cost of renewables is higher than that of thermal power, and it is highly unlikely for the converse to be true, at least for some time"".""Over-expansion, fuelled by the growth optimism of the mid-2000s, combined with stresses in the discoms and slowdown in the economy has led to a plummeting plant load factors, declining profitability, the spectre of large amounts of stranded power assets, and consequentially stranded coal assets as well.""All this can have a detrimental effect on the health of the banking sector, especially the public sector banks, in the country, which in turn can adversely impact the health of the Indian economy, already afflicted by the 'twin balance sheet' challenge,"" the CEA said.The declining viability of thermal power plants and the rising NPAs of state-run banks, which have lent to power companies ""seems a double whammy for the government,"" he said.For India, which is struggling to provide basic electricity to about 25 per cent of its population, coal will provide about 60 per cent of the country's power needs until 2030, he addedIndia's total renewable generation capacity has crossed 57 gigawatts (GW), with an increase of 24.5 per cent being registered in the last fiscal year. The capacity addition in solar energy last year stood at 81 per cent.--IANSbc/vd"
"The king is dead, long live the king","Infosys is going through an internal convulsion, beating down its stock and contributing to the fall of the overall market index. When a palace coup happens, who falls and who rises is a matter of vital interest to a small number of people who form the dramatis personae. For the country as a whole, what matters, once shedding a ceremonial tear for the fallen and hailing the victor are done, is that whoever is the new ruler should keep the country stable and improve the quality of governance. The same principle applies to Infosys.

It is natural for Infosys insiders to work up a passion over the rights and wrongs of Narayana Murthy’s constant sniping at Vishal Sikka and Sikka’s failure to counter that guerrilla action, leading to his eventual ouster. For investors in the company and for the rest of the information technology sector, what matters is that the transformation in the business model initiated by Sikka, leading to steady rise in revenue per employee, should continue. The information technology sector is ripe for disruption. It must adapt to the new environment in which automation and artificial intelligence would take over a lot of the customary work done by legions of coders.

Instead of falling victim, India’s information technology needs to drive the change. Vishal Sikka and the current Infosys board that supported him recognised the challenge and set in motion a process of change. This is all to the good. But the process of change has been accompanied by a cultural clash, between austere conservatism and expensive flamboyance, which has led to much heartburn among the old guard.

Their backlash has been strong enough to oust the torchbearer of change. Whoever comes in next would have to be culturally more compatible but no less insistent on the need for change than Sikka has been.

Narayana Murthy’s return from corporate self-exile to activism raises serious questions. Should a founder retire at all, unless other shareholders find him a hindrance to growth? Having handed over the wheel to someone else, why do backseat driving? But the real challenge is to keep Infosys growing and evolving."
"The diagnosis of Lysosomal Storage Disorders is challenging: Dr. Madhulika Kabra, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,Additional Prof.& Officer-In-Charge, Genetics Unit, Dept of Pediatrics,, New Delhi, talks about the rare disease scenario in India. Edited excerpts:Different countries define rare disease differently. There is no uniform definition, it is based on their resources and whatever epidemiological data is existing in that particular country. There is no global definition but WHO defines rare diseases as an incidence of about 1 in 10,000, which translates to about 1 in 2500. India doesn’t have any data basically on rare diseases to define it. So, it’s important to have a definition because based on that many things can be guided like policy and things like that. So, WHO defines 1 in 10,000 but different countries have highly variable definitions. Some countries have 1 in 2000, somebody has 1 in 1 lakh so it is highly variable.World over almost 7 thousand rare diseases have been described. There are huge numbers of rare diseases if you go to the websites and it is very difficult to even list all of them. But then some of which are seen in clinical practice not only in tertiary care centers but also in specialized centers like pediatric, neurology and hematological practice include some of the inborn errors of metabolism which include Lysosomal Storage Disorders and some small molecule disorders like phenylketonuria, galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease. These are all clubbed under inborn errors of metabolism. Then there are various blood related disorders which are also there in rare diseases. You have immune disorder diseases like fever combined immunodeficiency or hypogammaglobulinemia and things like that. Then you have disorders of skeleton like skeletal dysplasia where the bones are not properly formed, neuromuscular disorder, muscular dystrophies and spinal muscular dystrophies and then you have cystic fibrosis which is again a disease which was thought not to be existing in India but we do see a good number of cases. So, there are a whole lot of them but these are some of them which we do see in the clinical practice and many more in a tertiary care setup or a referral setup.The prevalence of various rare disorders is available from certain countries, where they have demographic data available, community based or hospital based, but we do not have any such data available from India. But then based on some hospital based data we do know that the disorders which I have just talked about are being seen in tertiary care centers at least by many of the specialists in India. So, we do not have a data which is available from India based on a systematic screening, that’s for one. Some data may be coming up now because we have some new born screening data available based on some of the projects which have just finished like government funded project. So, to quote Indian data it is as of now not available but there are some of the initiatives which have recently been taken up by the Indian Council of Medical Research and they are coming up with the initiative of rare disease registry, choosing some of the disorders to begin with and hospital based registries as of now. So that’s an initiative which is very recent.In rare diseases, the numbers are huge, that is one. Some of them may be comparatively more commonly seen and some of them may be extremely rare which one may see once in a lifetime or not even see once in a lifetime and then some of the disorders which are seen in the clinical practice, the diagnosis may be missed for few reasons. One could be that the awareness is not there and nobody is to blame for that because these are rarer disorders and in the periphery these patients might not reach or just reach the tertiary care centers where the diagnostic facilities are available. So, one is awareness. Second thing is that they are mimickers, some of the relatively common rare diseases are mimickers. They may mimic some of the other common disorders which are seen in clinical practice.Once the patient comes, you are always thinking of a commoner diagnosis first, will not shoot to the rare diagnosis immediately. So, they may be missed initially and later on one may think that this maybe a particular rare disorder. The third thing is that even if the diagnosis is thought of or is kept as a differential diagnosis the facilities for diagnosis may not be available everywhere. Though in the last few years these facilities have really improved and many labs are offering these facilities. The ease of transportation of samples is also there. Now it has definitely improved but these are the challenges because of the lack of awareness and diagnostic facilities.Is there a need for improving the diagnostic facilities? What are the steps that can be taken for timely diagnosis?If you are specifically talking about Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) which are relatively common and seen in clinical practice, one is they are mimickers, so the clinicians who are likely to see these disorders should know that when they should think of LSDs, like which are the conditions which mimic LSDs, and we should exclude LSDs in what situations. So, that includes medical education and that’s really going on in a big way and which is probably the reason that the diagnostic capabilities have really improved over time and then diagnostic facilities. Though they are available in some government, private setups but these are limited to bigger cities. These are not available sort of everywhere. So, there is a need to have improvement on this, more labs should be available and the existing labs should be strengthened also.There is a plethora of Lysosomal Storage Disorders. So as of now treatment is available for 7 of them, just to understand what are Lysosomal Storage Disorders, these are the disorders which are due to some enzymes deficiencies in the body which are genetically determined. So these are inherited disorders and most of them are autosomal recessive which means that both the parents are carriers and there is a 25% chance that the baby will have the disease and the problem is with the enzyme which metabolizes certain substrates in the cells, certain waste products in the cells, so once these enzymes are deficient, these waste products get accumulated in the cells, and then because these are multisystem disorders, different parts of the body get affected and because of that various manifestations are there.In therapy, first is the Enzyme Replacement Therapy which is available for 7 of these disorders as of now. This intravenous therapy is to be given but the cost of the enzyme is very high as of now. For few disorders, some oral therapy is also available which is also very exorbitant and if you talk of the enzyme replacement therapy the main disadvantage of this therapy is that the enzyme does not reach the brain and does not affect the involvement of joint and heart if it is involved in some of the Lysosomal Storage Disorders that much.Enzyme replacement if started late and when the brain is already involved you cannot revert that back. Some of the drugs have the advantage that they can cross the blood brain barriers and brain involvement can also be prevented to some extent. These are two modes of therapy which are available. Another mode of therapy is Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. So, before Enzyme Replacement Therapy was available for these disorders, the main stay of therapy was Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation but there are various disadvantages of that and various problems in that because we need to have a match donor and there can be lots of morbidities because of stem cell transplantation because the immune system of the individual who is the recipient has to be suppressed to see the bone marrow and there can be complications. The effect of Enzyme Replacement Therapy particularly for some diseases like Gaucher disease is much better than the Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation but that still remains an option for disorders for which the patient is unable to get the therapy and also for disorders where Enzyme Replacement Therapy is not available as of now, but then limited experience is available worldwide. Not many centers are routinely offering this. So, about the Enzyme Replacement Therapy there are 7 disorders for which it is available and the experience is most for Gaucher’s disease. The treatment is most rewarding as of now for Gaucher disease."
Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."

"Johnson & Johnson baby powder: Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $417m in lawsuit linking baby powder to cancer, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LOS ANGELES - A Los Angeles jury on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay a record $417 million to a hospitalized woman who claimed in a lawsuit that the talc in the company's iconic baby powder causes ovarian cancer when applied regularly for feminine hygiene.

The verdict in the lawsuit brought by the California woman, Eva Echeverria, marks the largest sum awarded in a series of talcum powder lawsuit verdicts against Johnson & Johnson in courts around the U.S.

Echeverria alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about talcum powder's potential cancer risks. She used the company's baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007, according to court papers.

Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a ""proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,"" she said in her lawsuit.

Echeverria's attorney, Mark Robinson, said his client is undergoing cancer treatment while hospitalized and told him she hoped the verdict would lead Johnson & Johnson to put additional warnings on its products.

""Mrs. Echeverria is dying from this ovarian cancer and she said to me all she wanted to do was to help the other women throughout the whole country who have ovarian cancer for using Johnson & Johnson for 20 and 30 years,"" Robinson said.

""She really didn't want sympathy,"" he added. ""She just wanted to get a message out to help these other women.""

The jury's award included $68 million in compensatory damages and $340 million in punitive damages, Robinson said. The evidence in the case included internal documents from several decades that ""showed the jury that Johnson & Johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer,"" Robinson said.

""Johnson & Johnson had many warning bells over a 30 year period but failed to warn the women who were buying its product,"" he said.

Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement that the company will appeal the jury's decision. She says while the company sympathizes with women suffering from ovarian cancer that scientific evidence supports the safety of Johnson's baby powder.

The verdict came after a St. Louis, Missouri jury in May awarded $110.5 million to a Virginia woman who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012.

She had blamed her illness on her use of the company's talcum powder-containing products for more than 40 years.

Besides that case, three other trials in St. Louis had similar outcomes last year - with juries awarding damages of $72 million, $70.1 million and $55 million, for a combined total of $307.6 million.

Another St. Louis jury in March rejected the claims of a Tennessee woman with ovarian and uterine cancer who blamed talcum powder for her cancers.

Two similar cases in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said the plaintiffs' lawyers did not presented reliable evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer.

More than 1,000 other people have filed similar lawsuits. Some who won their lawsuits won much lower amounts, illustrating how juries have wide latitude in awarding monetary damages.

Johnson & Johnson is preparing to defend itself and its baby powder at upcoming trials in the U.S., Goodrich said."

"Cooler temperatures dampen China coal rally, but for how long?, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","BEIJING: Cooler weather and ample supplies pushed China's thermal coal prices lower on Tuesday, spurring speculation that tapering demand may threaten the months-long rally even as concerns linger about slower output as Beijing cracks down on safety.

Prices shot to record highs last week, reaching 603 yuan a tonne ($90.62) amid concern about tightening output as the government launched sweeping safety checks across major producing province Shanxi after a fatal accident at a mine.

Investors have pushed prices up 50 percent this year, piling into the market with bullish bets as hotter than usual weather scorched the north, increasing electricity demand for air conditioning and hence demand for China's favourite fuel.

Now, as the heat wave passes and long-range forecasts point to a warmer than average winter in the world's top consumer of the fuel, analysts and sources at utilities and miners are speculating over whether pressure on prices will increase.

China's most actively trade thermal coal futures for delivery in January inched down 0.9 percent on Tuesday to close at 595.6 yuan a tonne.

""We see increasing risks of a correction in the thermal coal market, due to lower consumption from power companies and cooling temperature,"" said Zhang Min, analyst at China Sublime Information Group.

The forward structure of the thermal futures curve shows investors are betting on prices peaking in October before falling steadily until August 2018. October's premium over August was 73 yuan a tonne ($10.97).

Reflecting reduced appetite from power producers, inventories at China's largest coal trading port Qinhuangdao have been stable at about 600 million tonnes in August, up from critically low levels of 400 million tonnes in March.

That's double the level this time last year and above the average of recent years.

""Weak appetite from utilities and growth in hydropower production has dampened purchases of thermal coal,"" China Coal Industry Association said in a report on Monday. ""Declining freight rates for seaborne coal also indicate weakening demand.""

The uncertain outlook may unsettle large rival producers such as Australia and Russia, which have sold more coal to China over the past year and benefited from higher prices.

Still prices may not fall too far before finding support from falling output as China's government clamps down on safety. Coal output in July fell to its lowest since October.

A trader with one of China's top miners believes that prices will hover in their current range between 560 and 590 yuan.

""In the near term, coal prices are supported by limited production,"" Zhang said. $1 = 6.6543 Chinese yuan renminbi)"
"Johnson & Johnson announces partnership with CSIR-IMTECH to develop innovative new tuberculosis treatments, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi, August 16, 2017: Johnson & Johnson Private Limited today announced a new partnership with the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), part of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), to unlock the potential of Indian science and help accelerate the discovery of innovative new treatments for tuberculosis (TB).Under the Memorandum of Understanding, scientists from Johnson & Johnson’s global public health team will work closely with scientists from CSIR-IMTECH , based in Chandigarh, India, on a research and development program to explore potentially more effective, safer, all-oral treatment regimens to tackle multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), as well as new molecular entities to treat all TB patients.“We are united with India in our determination to make TB history,” said Paul Stoffels , M.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, who joined Dr Harsh Vardhan , Minister for Science and Technology, at an event in New Delhi, to announce the Memorandum of Understanding. “While we have made great advances in recent years with the approval of new TB medicines much more needs to be done. By bringing together some of India’s brightest minds with our scientists, we increase the potential to achieve major research breakthroughs that can lead to innovative new treatments for the millions of people in India and around the world who suffer from TB.”The new research program will capitalize on CSIR-IMTECH’s world-class expertise in microbial technology and research and the proven research and development capabilities of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies to strengthen the collective potential of our research efforts.“TB remains a significant challenge in India, killing approximately half a million-people in 2015 alone,” said Dr. Anil Koul , Director, CSIR-IMTECH. “The partnership we have announced today with Johnson & Johnson has the potential to accelerate our work in support of India’s National Strategic Plan, our accelerated action plan to End TB by 2025, and most importantly save lives.”Today’s announcement builds on nearly 20 years of TB research and development by Johnson & Johnson, which led to the approval of bedaquiline, the first new TB medicine in nearly 50 years, and adds to existing partnerships at central and state levels in India to increase awareness, diagnosis and care, and broaden access to bedaquiline."

"Australia court dismisses appeal against Adani coal mine project, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MELBOURNE: Indian mining giant Adani Group 's 16.5 billion dollar controversy-hit coal mine project in Australia has cleared another hurdle with Brisbane Supreme Court dismissing an appeal filed by indigenous group against the project. Carmichael coal mine project, one of the world's largest, will start construction this year after being given the green light by the federal and Queensland state governmentsThe project involves dredging 1.1 million cubic metres of spoil near the iconic Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which will then be disposed off on land.Despite being targeted by several political and environmental groups from time to time, the Adani group has reaffirmed its commitment for the project and promised to create economic prosperity, including creating thousands of jobs for the people in Queensland.In May this year, the lawyers of Wangan and Jagalingou group, who have a native title claim over the proposed site of the mine in the Galilee basin, argued in the court that the issuing of the mining leases to Adani were unlawful as they had not been given adequate opportunity to address the state government on native title issues relating to the proposed Carmichael site.However, Adani and the state government argued that the traditional owners had never made a proper objection to the mine under the terms set out by the Mineral Resources Act 1989.Responding to today's decision, senior spokesperson for the W&J Traditional Owners Council, Adrian Burragubba, said ""where there is mining there is no justice for Traditional Owners. We are not done yet. We will exhaust all legal avenues in our fight to for our rights and to protect our country"".""Adani cannot move on the critical infrastructure for the mine until they can get us out of the way,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Adani group welcomed the court's decision and said, ""it represents yet another independent judicial decision upholding nearly eight years of development planning and rigorous approvals, and dismisses activist claims to the contrary"".It is also another legal rebuff to activists' use of the courts to seek to delay a project, the company said claiming that the project will inject 22 billion dollars in royalties and charges into the State coffers to be reinvested back into the community.The company is expected to kick off the pre-construction work in September quarter of this year following Adani chairman Gautam Adani announcing the signing off on the project."

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. “She was an audacious woman who could hold her own,” she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda — who initiated her in brahmacharini vows — Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‘Nivedita,’ one who has dedicated her life to God.“She was a remarkable person.I don’t think we have focused enough on her,”says Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita’s life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master’s views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta’s Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta’s elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita’s 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.” Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.“Swami Vivekananda had said that it’s not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It’s a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,” says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. “Nivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,” elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.“ She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission — Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.” “Her nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India’s identity,” explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita’s sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. “Patriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it’s about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it’s not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.” In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms — from her extensive travels across the country — her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:“India must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion — the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.” Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.“Tradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it’s not about this and not that. It’s about inclusive Vedantic theory,” says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore’s Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.“One had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.”

Taskin keen to deliver 'match-winning spell' in his first home Test series

Bangladesh pace bowler Taskin Ahmed is eyeing to come up with a match-winning spell against Australia in the upcoming two-match Test series. Taskin, who has played only four Test matches so far, admits it would be an icing on the cake if he could pick Steven Smith, David Warner and Matt Renshaw, calling them his dream wickets.

Taskin was included in the 14-member squad for the first Test scheduled to start on August 27, along with two other pacers, Mustafizur Rahman and Shafiul Islam.

The 22-year-old seamer made his Test debut against New Zealand in Wellington earlier this year and has played four out of the five Tests Bangladesh have played since.

He was sidelined for Bangladesh's historic 100th Test where they defeated Sri Lanka, fielding two pacers Mustafizur and Subashish Roy in their playing eleven. ""If I get an opportunity, I will like to bowl a match-winning spell,"" Taskin told reporters in Dhaka on Tuesday (August 21).

""I don't say that match-winning spell means taking five to seven wickets. I will like to bowl some good overs instead of that. As like, our spinners may take seven wickets and in the middle, I may pick two wickets. I really want to do something for the team that will help the team,' the 22-year-old said.

Taskin added that they were not too worried with the performance of Mustafizur, and are confident of his ability. The recent form of Mustafizur has been a matter of concern for Bangladesh, where he has failed to live up to his reputation on his comeback after the shoulder surgery.

""We always expect much from Mustafiz. He fulfilled the expectations as well. It is true that he was not up to the mark in the last few matches. The greatest bowlers of the world also could not bowl well in two-three matches,"" Taskin said.

""We are not worried about that. I hope he will come back strong. We also have many responsibilities against Australia,"" he added. ""Australia is one of the best teams in the world. But we understand the surface very well than them as it is well known to us. I hope we will do well in the series,' Taskin said.

Referring to Test cricket as a game of patience and skills, Taskin admitted that he was eagerly waiting to play his first Test series at home. ""The pleasure I got bowling in New Zealand didn't feel in the same way in Sri Lanka. I haven't played a Test match yet in Bangladesh. I think Test cricket is a matter of great patience and skills. I hope good things are coming ahead,"" added Taskin.

""To be honest, I didn't play many Test matches. I find it really difficult after playing only four Test matches. I played only One-Day Internationals and Twenty20s before starting to play in Test matches.

""You have [to] play Test matches according to a plan. It is really important to implement change of pace. I hope that we can play according to the situation. I am looking forward to playing at home soil,"" Taskin concluded.

Infosys crisis: Are we soft on never-go-letters?,"Everybody and their auntie are having a go with their sharp stick at the Right Honourable N R Narayana Murthy. The man’s a kook, they say, putting a Chosen One on the Iron Throne and then treating him like a bekaar damaad. That NRN, once having decided (twice, actually) to walk into the sunset, is once again caught acting like a ‘benevolent well-wisher’ from some Spartan I’m-not-Vijay Mallya getaway and pulling the strings till the puppet decides to walk away.

That Master Yoda is the one who needs to walk away — and stay walked away — has been the general consensus from the chorus line. I mean, who likes the younger generation to be brought in with moderate fanfare, and then have the same younger generation (slightly older by then) shunted, for, well, being young and stupid? Answer: India 2017.

Being stupid is what NRN has really been accusing Vishal Sikka, handpicked as MD-CEO in the summer of 2014, of. According to Murthy and his fellow Infytainers, Sikka is responsible for Infosys becoming a spluttering train. If Clark ‘Nagavara Ramarao’ Kent had not coaxed himself into bringing Murthyman out of retirement, the spluttering train was sure to become a train wreck, goes one theory.

But my heart, despite all the flak he’s facing, goes out to NRN. It’s not because I don’t agree with his critics. Yes, Sikka’s Infosys ship isn’t the same Infosys raft that the Seven Samurai led by Murthy-san launched from the harbour in 1981. For starters, the software field had only a handful of players to contend with. Plus, the post-BPO world of technology has changed faster than Infy may have had.

Also, Infosys was really a startup before any startup invented the word ‘startup’. So, making the rules then was more fun than keeping the rules now. And despite the mantra about ‘Learning how to fail, learning from the failures’ blahblahblah, Indians, especially India Inc, still don’t like rules being (seen to be) broken, and are loath to allow things to fail. Intervention is a constant nanny in the form of concerned ‘elders’ in the background, or pusillanimous gatekeepers in the front.

But let’s face it. Is Murthyman the only one who likes holding on to the reins even when he has passed them on? More importantly, is our culture not a wee bit bonkers when it comes to allowing‘elders’ to linger, and then meddle so that they can have their cake, eat it, and then complain about the icing too?

Amitabh Bachchan, thankfully, picks and chooses his roles better these days. But I remember a whole decade when toupée not in hand, he was offered roles — which he accepted — that fit him as snugly as a glove fits a goat. Even as an admirer of Sachin Tendulkar’s cover drive, the less said about how he reached his 100th international century, courtesy the BCSCI (Board of Control for Sachin’s Cricket to Inspire), the better.

In politics, of course, we find the original trendsetters. Any politician saying that he or she will now make way for ‘new blood’ either has no clue about transfusion, or is making a strategic move. Let’s just say that in the Congress, this rule applies if your surname happens to be the same as Sonia Gandhi’s. A free hand given to aScindia or a Pilot or even a Singh is as plausible as the queen of England making way for her eldest son while she (and he) is still alive.

In the BJP government, the ‘holding on to the reins’ quality is marked by the quantum of policymaking-andbreaking powers ministers have in aShah-sprayed Modi government.

That could, perhaps, maybe, possibly explain the current disinterest in the impending Cabinet reshuffle. In regional parties, too, sharing responsibilities, or passing the pillow, down the ranks of Didis and the ghosts of Ammas is not just frowned upon, but proactively resisted as the recipe for ‘chaos’.

We like our busybody taus the same way we extol our workaholics. So, if Murthyman is singled out as a demagogic Nerd-Uncle, it’s a bit rich.

In the world of films, the Lifetime Achievement Award is given to someone who has crossed his creative pinnacle and reached his creative tether. To drive the message home, this award simultaneously recognises his greatness as well as implores him to take a back seat, preferably of a bus and not a car.

In politics, with governorships and presidencies becoming increasingly political, something new is needed for the over(long)-ambitious. In business, the most anarchic of ‘industries’, we are yet to change how we treat our founders and family minders.

So, till then, before you can say hello to Cyrus the Great and Tata to Xerxes, be prepared for more NRNs not leaving the stage, whether sulking, kicking or squealing."
"New tool developed for diabetes patients at risk for low blood sugar emergencies, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representational image

Washington D.C. : According to a recent research, a group of researchers have found and validated a practical tool for identifying diabetes patients who are at the highest risk for being admitted to an emergency department or hospital due to severe hypoglycemia, or very low blood sugar.

Advances in care and improved treatment options have reduced the risk of long-term complications and death for more than 25 million Americans who have diabetes, which is characterized by high blood sugar.

Andrew J. Karter, PhD, senior research scientist with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and the study's lead author, said, ""Sometimes a person with diabetes is unaware that their blood sugar is dropping and can progress quickly into severe hypoglycemia, which has been associated with falls, automobile accidents, heart attacks, coma, and even death.""

Adding, ""Hypoglycemia is often preventable with the proper clinical attention, and we believe this tool will help focus that attention on the patients who most need it.""

With an estimated 100,000 hypoglycemia-related adverse events resulting in emergency room visits each year in the United States, hypoglycemia is now one of the most frequent adverse events in patients with type two diabetes.

Older patients and those with a longer history of diabetes are particularly susceptible, noted Karter.

The study developed the hypoglycemia risk stratification tool by identifying 156 possible risk factors for hypoglycemia and collecting data from more than 200,000 patients with type two diabetes receiving care from Kaiser Permanente in Northern California.

Using machine-learning analytical techniques, they developed a model to predict a patient's 12-month risk of hypoglycemia-related emergency department or hospital use.

The final model was based on six variables: number of prior episodes of hypoglycemia-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations; use of insulin; use of sulfonylurea (an oral medication commonly used to treat diabetes); severe or end-stage kidney disease; number of emergency room visits for any reason in the past year; and age.

The researchers created a practical tool to categorize patients into high (greater than five percent), intermediate (one to five percent) or low (less than 1 percent) annual risk of hypoglycemia-related emergency department or hospital utilization.

The tool was then validated with data from more than 1.3 million members of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration and nearly 15,000 Kaiser Permanente members in Washington state with type 2 diabetes.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) funded the development of the tool for identifying patients at risk of hypoglycemia under their Safe Use Initiative, a collaborative effort to reduce adverse events related to medication use, including diabetes medications linked to an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

The results are being disseminated with help from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

""This work is an example of how federal agencies can work with private researchers to reduce preventable adverse drug events. The goal is to identify the patients who are at highest hypoglycemic risk, so that health care providers can focus their attention on the specific needs of these patients and reduce preventable hypoglycemia harm,"" noted John Whyte, MD, MPH, Director of Professional Affairs and Stakeholder Engagement for the FDA.

The study was published in journal JAMA Internal Medicine."

The Tesla Model X SUV Just Crushed A Lamborhini Aventador In A Drag Race Like A Boss!,"It’s probably a bad idea to race an SUV against a racing-focused supercar. But there are some cases where you‘d be wrong.

Auto website DragTimes posted a video online last week, where they pitted a Tesla Model X P100D against a Lamborghini Aventador SV in a drag race.

And the Tesla won!

Sure, it was a narrow win, Tesla had a quicker start, and the Lamborghini was catching up near the end. But consider that one is a $165,000 electric SUV, while the other is a $530,000 premium supercar, and you’ll see the race in a whole new light.

The Tesla Model X came in at a 11.418 second time on the quarter mile (approximately 400 m) drag race, setting the world record for the fastest ever time to be achieved by an SUV on that stretch.

Not a bad day overall for Tesla and its fans.

"Tracking and treating Hepatitis B and C, Health News, ET HealthWorld","About one million Indians are at risk of acquiring HBV infection and about 10,000 die from the virus every year.

ByDevare,Director of Diagnostics Research, Abbott, IllinoisThere’s a war of epic proportions going on right now between the human immune system and a plethora of infectious diseases such as HIV, Dengue, Chikungunya, Swine Flu, Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and Hepatitis . Are we losing this battle? We could if we don’t keep up with these viruses as they tend to mutate rapidly, outpacing diagnostics. The ways to address these evolving challenges are to continue to strengthen our virus surveillance efforts and develop tests to track and detect these viruses.Hepatitis is caused by aggressive viruses that have resulted in worldwide epidemics. In 2015, deaths due to viral hepatitis were higher than those due to HIV, TB and Malaria. Hepatitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the liver. Over time, this inflammation in the liver results in scarring, chronic liver damage (also called cirrhosis) and even liver cancer. At the point of cirrhosis, the liver is unable to heal itself.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in India, 40 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 6 to 12 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition to HBV and HCV, there are three other hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). HBV, HCV and HDV are transmitted through exposure to infected bodily fluids including shared toothbrushes and razors; shared drug needles, sexual transmission, unscreened blood transfusions and non-sterilized medical equipment. HAV and HEV are transmitted by ingesting contaminated food or water. Most acute liver failures diagnosed in India are due to hepatitis E infection. Children are most susceptible to hepatitis A as it’s associated with poor sanitation and hygiene. Unlike HBV and HCV, HAV infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but in rare situations, it can cause debilitating symptoms and acute liver failure. Globally, HBV and HCV are given priority as they are a leading cause of death .India is one of the 11 countries which carry almost 50 percent of the global burden of chronic hepatitis. While HBV and HCV cause chronic infections, HAV and HEV are not chronic. HAV and HEV could be effectively dealt with by public education, improving sanitation and hygiene. To eliminate hepatitis in India, it is important to screen and diagnose those infected with the virus. About one million Indians are at risk of acquiring HBV infection and about 10,000 die from the virus every year. Anti-viral drugs for treatment of HBV infected people are helpful to help suppress the disease, but because the treatment does not cure HBV infection, most people who start treatment must continue it for life. Vaccination at birth is the most effective avenue for protection from HBV infection. For HCV elimination, it is important to use diagnostic tests to identify people with active infection and treat them with anti-viral drugs now available in India. A 12 to 24 weeks anti-HCV treatment leads to cure in over 95% of infected people.To align with the WHO’s 2030 goal of hepatitis elimination, many countries, including India, have embarked on national plans investing in screenings for earlier detection and paving the way for people to have access treatment. Recently on World Hepatitis Day, India’s Union Minister of Health – Dr JP Nadda announced the National Action Plan for Hepatitis C, which will be completed by December 2017 and rolled out subsequently next year. Funded fully by the government, the plan will focus on three key aspects – prevention, screening and surveillance.While with the collective push from the WHO and local health authorities, and the awareness about treatment has increased, the incidence continues to rise. As per the WHO, in 2015, 1.75 million adults were newly infected with HCV largely due to injection drug use and due to unsafe injections in health care settings in some countries. Therefore, in addition to monitoring incidence of viral outbreaks, India’s focus should be on populations with high-risk of viral infections – such as patients who receive multiple blood transfusions because they have inherited blood disorders, such as thalassemia (abnormal haemoglobin production) and sickle cell anaemia (a group of disorders caused by deformed red blood cells to break down); haemodialysis patients (whose kidneys do not work normally and depend on a dialysis process for purifying the blood), intravenous drug users, prison inmates, and emergency unit patients.The weakest link in gauging the ongoing impact of the hepatitis virus is the availability of incidence data. India should build a national hepatitis surveillance hub that tracks the strains over the years across various communities. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a strategy to screen all people born between years 1945 to 1965 for HCV as this population accounted for 73 per cent of all HCV-associated deaths. A similar approach could be implemented to identify population groups greatly impacted by hepatitis viruses in India. Since most people living with hepatitis are not aware of the infection, public education, screening, diagnosis and treatment are the critical steps in eliminating hepatitis. The WHO goal to eliminate hepatitis by 2030 is ambitious, and its success will depend of the global effort from high-burden countries.Diagnosis is the first step for identifying the presence of an infection. HIV and hepatitis viruses evolve to produce diverse strains. Increasing diversity and the ever-changing distribution of these viruses continue to present a challenge to diagnostic and monitoring tests. The way to ensure that diagnostic tools keep pace with these viruses is to remain committed to ongoing research. It is of utmost importance to monitor viral evolution and track new strains around the world by establishing global surveillance programs and warrant that all viral infections are efficiently detected by diagnostic tests despite of wide genetic diversity.The WHO estimates that 257 million people were living with HBV and 71 million living with HCV infections in 2015. The majority of these people were not diagnosed, and only less than one tenth of the HBV and HCV infected people who were diagnosed were on treatment in 2015. What’s unique about HCV is that it operates on the sly, 80 percent of people with an acute HCV infection show no apparent symptoms, with many people progressing to chronic infection. Because so many are not aware of an HCV infection, the condition may go unnoticed for decades, often until permanent damage has been done to the liver. So, how can you detect a virus that rarely, outwardly shows its face? First, understanding the genetic diversity of the virus is a key factor to building the right strategy.With advances in testing and treatments, it is possible to eliminate hepatitis C with patient proactivity - if you have not been tested for HCV, please talk to your doctor about getting tested so you know your status. Anti-viral treatment is available to eliminate HCV and get cured from the viral infection."

PCB chairman confirms World XI tour in September

While World XI is set to play a three-match T20 series in September, West Indies will play three T20Is in late November. © Getty

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, put to rest all speculations regarding the World XI tour to Pakistan, confirming on Monday (August 21), a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in Lahore, starting September 10. A 15-member squad led by former Zimbabwe great Andy Flower will take part in a seven-day long camp in Dubai before heading to Lahore for the series. However, the bigger news is Windies is set to tour the cricket-starved nation for a three-match T20I series in Lahore in late November.

Sethi also stated that the three games against World XI will be played across four days, but refused to divulge the dates citing security reasons.

""CWI and PCB are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies play three T20I matches in Lahore in late November,"" read the statement. ""In September, October and November, we'll have the World XI, we'll have Sri Lankan team and then the West Indies (come play in Pakistan).

""We just hope that the security we've promised, we'll keep it up. Sri Lanka have said they'll come after the World XI, provided the security is fine. It will be fine, Punjab government has indicated that the preparation are in full swing. At the end of this month, ICC's security team is also arriving. So far all signals are good,"" Sethi added. He also stated that talks with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were still on over the number of games to be played.

While the Punjab Government approved 'Presidential level security' for the week-long World XI series in Lahore, Sethi expressed his desire to host a few games in the other cities too, notably Karachi. ""I have the desire to take some games out of Lahore and host them in Karachi, but everyone I speak to reject that idea. They tell me that we've succeeded in hosting something well in Lahore (PSL 2 final) so keep that going. First host the PSL in Karachi, then we will come there.""

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

""This is my objective. I had given myself a mission statement - to organise PSL, to bring it to Pakistan, to bring international cricket to Pakistan. Game development needs to be done, fund raising needs to be done - and all that we're going to do slowly. And I also want to try to professionalise PCB,"" Sethi said.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India’s freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat – today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected – political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians’ narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department’s 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations – which included Nathuram Godse’s Hindu Rashtra Sena – viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn’t ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province’s chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh’s decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government’s delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police’s fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar’s participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year’s rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh’s anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, “Of late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation’s activities.”

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman’s query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh’s mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh’s growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had “infiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes”. It further stated “the organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.”

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government’s real intention: “the holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.” Subsequently, the Sangh’s training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh’s weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists’ privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation’s history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."

Fashion Diaries: Here’s Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one’s fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone’s going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it’s a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

OPPO F3

Well, selfies come handy not just to change display pictures, but when we need to check our pretty faces anywhere, anytime. And if on some days, if we look a bit too extra cute, why not click a selfie and save it too, right? And if you use a Selfie Expert phone, your picture is bound to look even prettier. If you want more, nowadays they even have a beauty mode btw!

And when friends are around, the selfie-game gets even better!

OPPO F3

Because when we are with our favourites, we are always in our happy and cheerful spirits which totally reflects on our pictures too. With a wide-angle group selfie, we can even get a full-length selfie to compare each other's style quotient!

One last word: Our phone's style quotient speaks a lot about our fashion diaries.

Pinterest

That’s why, nowadays people focus not just on the colour of the phone, but even on extra-accessories for it such as phone cases, bedazzlements or extra-customizations. Recently, even Bollywood style-icon Deepika Padukone had customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as the #F3DeepikaEdition.

OPPO F3

She had designed her own icon with OPPO, which has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded along, at the back of the phone and it pretty much signifies her personality, isn’t it? The special Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie, a 16 MP selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

So, dear style-divas if you are planning on buying a new phone, go for a Rose Gold OPPO F3, it’s pretty much going to be your new personal stylist!"

"For Digital India to really reap benefits, some key technology-related issues need to be resolved","By Kala S Sridhar & V Sridhar

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has argued for making the country digital, and paved the way for electronic payments and receipts through applications such as the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and online wallets. GoI intends to offer higher cashbacks if digital modes of payment are adopted. This has the potential to make India a country with low degree of corruption and black money, given that all transactions will be accounted for.

But there’s a flip side. Psychologically, cash brings with it responsibility. By extension, cashless transactions imply irresponsibility. When we swipe a debit or credit card, it doesn’t really pinch. But when we pay for something in cash, it makes us think several times, since we need to go to the ATM or bank regularly to get cash. So, what are the disadvantages of ‘digital’ spending? At the macro level, saving takes a hit, and the economy may be deprived of much-needed investment and capital accumulation in infrastructure and in other sectors required to boost the rate of economic growth.

At the micro level, the spending spree enabled by cashless transactions will imply less liquidity, and less saving for future generations. According to the Institute of Management Development’s World Competitiveness Centre, tech-savvy countries most digitally ready are Singapore, Sweden, the US, Finland and Denmark. The scores are based on the country’s ability to adopt digital technologies, leading to changes in government practices, business approaches and society in general. India is ranked 51st here. While the average domestic savings rate in the most tech-savvy countries is at 29%, and only at 15% in the least techsavvy ones, the future trajectory of the ‘savings and digital’ relationship is clear.

India’s domestic savings rate for 2015, according to the World Bank, is 31%, much higher than that of tech-savvy and digital Finland (21%), and of the US (17%) in 2015.

Further, Brazil and South Africa with higher digitisation are at only 16% and 20% domestic savings rate respectively, lending credence to the inverse relationship between digital payments and savings.

Don’t Have Right Connection

Also, is India prepared for digital transactions? This is a country with low information and communication technology (ICT) penetration. ‘There is a problem with the system’, ‘servers are slow’ or ‘OTP is not sent’ are constant refrains.

Digital payments require the user to be internet- and mobile-savvy. One has to remember at least two factors of authentication before completing each transaction. The two-factor authentication, while improving security, is not very user-friendly and, in most cases, depends on the telecommunication infrastructure.

According to the World Economic Forum Global Information Technology Report 2016, India is ranked 114 (out of 139 countries) in network infrastructure sub-index. The recent State of the Internet Connectivity 2017 by Akamai Technologies indicates that India is ranked 89th in internet connection speed. The poor broadband infrastructure and associated quality of services affect the timely and successful completion of electronic transactions.

Further, the digitally illiterate depend on middlemen to perform their digital transactions. As old habits die hard, the middlemen, now armed with technological skills, extract rent from the user. These tech-savvy middlemen have access to the passwords and account details of their customers, and, hence, can do irreparable financial damages and invade consumer’s financial privacy.

The accountability and liability of the different service providers — such as the telecom operators, payment gateway providers and app providers — in case the digital transactions fail, are not specified in any regulation. In most cases, it is left to the poor user/consumer to fight it out. Most often, the blame game on each other leaves the customer empty handed and with his or her financial privacy at risk.

It may well be the case that cash or digital payments do not really determine the degree, and pace, of consumer spending. But this much is for sure: if we accept rational human behaviour, digital payments are needed in an era of slow growth, when effortless consumer spending is needed for pump-priming the economy.

On the other hand, when the economy is inflationary, it is preferable that cash transactions are made, enabling consumer restraint. The promise of cashback for a digital payment is counterproductive.

A Tech-tonic Shift

In the interests of freeing the country of corruption that it promises, digital payments should be encouraged, understanding their effects on consumer spending. After all, as a country’s income keeps increasing, it will become more, not less, technologically advanced.

Hence, to facilitate digital transactions, regulations should be formulated regarding the onus and liability of different players in the digital economy, such that consumer interests are protected.

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
Two leaves and a lotus bud,"After AIADMK merger, BJP can say cheers but not uncork the bottle

On Monday morning, festoons welcoming BJP leader Amit Shah flanked Chennai’s Grand Southern Trunk Road and Mount Road all the way from the airport to T Nagar, where the BJP’s state headquarters stand. On most of the posters, at Shah-ji’s feet was the lotus party’s state chief, a vivacious gynaecologist with a broad smile, flashing a ‘thumbs up’. On a few others was another ambitious woman leader doing a more courteous ‘vanakkam.’ In the few remaining vacant spots on the road medians, a certain Mr Naidu, with goggles and all, managed to install his modest hoardings joining the leaders in ushering in Shah: Come, come (varuga, varuga)! Amit Shah didn’t come.

Chennai, meanwhile, was hosting another drama— that of the merger of two AIADMK factions led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) and his predecessor O Panneerselvam (OPS). OPS now becomes the deputy chief minister with the finance portfolio, and the coordinator of the party steering committee. After J Jayalalithaa’s death in December last year, the party had split into two, then three, the third one led by Jayalalithaa aide V K Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran. In a way, the BJP festoons hadn’t gone waste—it was an inadvertent celebration of BJP having successfully orchestrated the reunion of the AIADMK groups.

Tamil Nadu governor C Vidyasagar Rao with O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami after the AIADMK factions merged on Monday

The logic was simple: The BJP wanted the AIADMK, which has 50 members in Parliament, to stay alive at least till the 2019 general elections. The saffron party needed the Tamil Nadu MPs’ support in getting crucial legislation passed and, when the elections came, a regional party to sail with. The withering party of two leaves fitted the bill perfectly. With a menacing stick (the threat of raids by central agencies on AIADMK leaders who refused to fall in line) and a tantalising carrot (a cabinet berth or two when Modi-ji returns to power in 2019, as even opposition leaders admit), Amit Shah tamed the meek AIADMK.

But the circus has just begun. TTV, who went from being an accidental leader to an anarchist in eight months, is plotting his revenge. Despite a much-retweeted sore throat that started around the same time the AIADMK merger happened, TTV ordered some 19 MLAs to the Raj Bhavan, demanding EPS be removed as chief minister. A more optimistic TTV count puts his support base at 27, including three ministers and three legislators who are unattached to the AIADMK, but won on the party symbol.

Time for some math. TTV’s 27 can’t rock the EPS-OPS boat on their own. But if their rebellion has the tacit support of the 89-member DMK, which has indicated its eagerness to introduce a no-confidence motion in the Assembly, the government is in troubled waters. The opposition, including Congress (8) and Indian Union Muslim League (1) has a combined strength of 98 in the 234-member House where Jayalalithaa’s seat remains vacant. If the 19 legislators who called on the governor on Tuesday support a no-confidence motion that the opposition would vote for, the numbers would cross the half mark of 117.

Suddenly, M K Stalin is the star. The DMK working president, who has waited too long for the AIADMK government to collapse under its own contradictions, is under pressure from within his party and outside to pull the rug. A Stalin advisor told me last month that the leader didn’t want to be seen as a destabilising factor, but now he is aware that “people are getting impatient to see this non-performing government go.”

Sooner the better, agree DMK strategists. For, giving more time for the AIADMK would also mean giving the BJP more time to handhold and handshake, and imparting a semblance of acceptance to the government. The BJP could then partake the glory to gain a few electoral points that the saffron brigade so badly needs to complete its footprint which has been sparse in the Dravidian land.

TTV is in a rage. And if Stalin proves to be strategically sound, it may not yet be time for Amit Shah and mitron to uncork the Patanjali brhami sharbat."
"Amma’s children: Two AIADMK factions have merged, with a little help from BJP","The political turmoil that Tamil Nadu witnessed since the death of chief minister J Jayalalithaa has subsided for now, with a merger of the two AIADMK factions. The AIADMK (Amma) faction of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and the AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) group led by his predecessor O Panneerselvam have buried their differences and arrived at a compromise formula, both having agreed to nullify Sasikala’s appointment as party general secretary and keep her clan out of party affairs. The Palaniswami faction had already passed a resolution cancelling the appointment of her nephew TTV Dhinakaran as the deputy general secretary. Also worked out were the positions offered to team OPS.

BJP spotted in the churning a wonderful opportunity to make inroads into a state where non-Dravidian parties had only a minimal presence, and made the most of it. It is an open secret that it was BJP which orchestrated the sequence of events that led to the merger. In the process, it now has a vice-like grip over the united AIADMK, which is well aware of the threat to the stability of its government from a bruised Dhinakaran who purportedly has about 20 MLAs with him. The success of the BJP mission has dealt a body blow to DMK that was hoping AIADMK would disintegrate, paving the way for it to fill the vacuum. With the general election not far away, a weakened Congress-led UPA will now have to rethink its strategy.

It’s advantage BJP at this point. Save Karnataka, the south has always been a tough nut for BJP to crack. Its perseverance appears to be yielding fruit. However, in a state where Dravidianism is the bedrock of politics, it will be no mean task for the party to consolidate its position. Tamil Nadu could well be heading for yet another phase of uncertainty."
These Smart Labels Will One Day Tell You When To Throw Away Old Food And Makeup,"It’s always sad when you think you have ingredients for a yummy snack in the fridge, only to take them out and realise they’ve gone bad. Now, scientists have developed a new type of sensor that can warn you when that’s about to happen so you can prepare.

Image courtesy: Silvana Andreescu

An American research team from Clarkson University presented their design at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) yesterday, for a low-cost, portable, paper-based sensor that can detect when food and cosmetics are spoiled or contaminated.

“I’ve always been interested in developing technologies that are accessible to both industry and the general population,” Silvana Andreescu, Ph.D., says. “My lab has built a versatile sensing platform that incorporates all the needed reagents for detection in a piece of paper. At the same time, it is adaptable to different targets, including food contaminants, antioxidants and free radicals that indicate spoilage.”

The key to her sensors, Andreescu says, are nanostructures within the sensors used to trap and bind the compounds they’re looking for. “Most people working on similar sensors use solutions that migrate on channels,” Andreescu says. “We use stable, inorganic particles that are redox active. When they interact with the substances we want to detect, they change color, and the intensity of the change tells us how concentrated the analyte is.”

Because of this, the sensors are extremely easy to use. All someone would have to do is add a bit of the sample they’re testing to the paper, and watch for a colour change.

CHENNAI: Blindness could have been averted in nearly one out of three children if medical intervention was sought early, a new study that covered two city-based schools for the blind has found.A team of doctors from Regional Institute of Ophthalmology and Madras Medical College examined the medical history of 302 students in two schools – Little Flower Convent in T Nagar and St Louis school for the blind in Adyar. They found that while visual impairment in 45% of them were because of “incurable causes”, in 31% it could have been avoided. Dr M V Prakash , one of the authors, said the team set out to study the medical history of these students, including their family history, to pin the reason for their blindness and plan early intervention programmes. “Literature on reasons for paediatric visual impairment in Chennai is limited. Studies from other regions cannot be applied here as prevalence of and reasons for blindness varies based on the nutrition intake, culture and sanitation,” he said. The study was recently published in the Indian Journal of ophthalmology A majority of the subjects in the study – whose ages varied from 5 to 16 years were girls. While 15% of the children were completely blind, the rest had various degrees of visual impairment – some able to perceive light, others having blurred vision in one eye while being completely blind in the other. Around 21% of the students, the study found, had a history.Researchers found that one of the leading causes of blindness were disorders in the optic nerve – the nerve that carries impulses from the retina at the back of the eye to the brain, followed by retinal and corneal disorders, lens-related problems and congenital anomalies.“Among those that were preventable, we found corneal scarring to be most prevalent,” said Dr Prakash, attributing it to Vitamin A deficiency and infections like measles and trauma."

"Age Of Empires IV Is Confirmed! It's Been 12 Years Since Last Game, Coming To A PC Very Soon!","Sorry StarCraft fans, but the mother of all real-time-strategy games is coming out of hibernation!

Microsoft announced at Gamescom 2017 yesterday that it’s resurrecting a classic strategy game. The company has revealed that a new Age of Empires game will be coming to PC, developed by Relic Entertainment, the makers of the Dawn of War series.

The Age of Empires IV trailer released alongside depicts battles across the world through different stages of history, from the Roman Empire at the peak of its power, to Spanish conquistadors, tribals, revolutionaries, and samurai.

This is the first sequel to the game in 12 years, ever since Age of Empires III was launched in 2005. The original developers, Ensembles Studios, released the first Age of Empires way back in 1997. They were then later acquired by Microsoft in 2001, where it operated internally until 2009.

Despite the studio eventually being shut down that year, the Age of Empires brand has lived on as both a nostalgia title in gamers’ memories, and a source for spinoff games.

Prior to the trailer unveiling, Microsoft confirmed that Age of Empires II and III would also be receiving Definitive Editions, along the lines of the upcoming remaster of the first game in the series.

Age of Empires IV still doesn’t have a release date. However, Microsoft has announced that the series will also be receiving Definitive Editions, which are likely to drop sooner than the latest sequel."

"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."

Privacy as fundamental right: Minding our business,"By Smriti Parsheera

The Supreme Court’s upcoming verdict on whether we have a fundamental right to privacy will be one of the most momentous decisions of our times. It is, however, inopportune that this vital issue has arisen as an offshoot to the Aadhaar litigation.

Both sides are alive to the fact that the decision will take them a step closer or further from proving their stance in the main petition. This has undeniably coloured the arguments in court. The real implications of the nine-judge decision will, however, run much deeper than the immediate questions of Aadhaar.

The term ‘privacy’, while not expressly spelt out under the Constitution, forms the crux of what it means to live a dignified life in a liberal democracy. The concept of a secret ballot, for instance, finds its origin in the need for ‘political privacy’, our ability to vote anonymously, without the promise of reward or fear of persecution. Section 94 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, codifies this right by providing that a person cannot be mandated to disclose for whom she has voted, not even before a court of law.

Then there’s ‘physical privacy’ that guards a person’s body and physical space from unwelcome intrusions. ‘Behavioural privacy’ gives us the freedom to keep private our religious practices, sexual orientation and associations. ‘Informational privacy’ deals with the expectation of privacy in the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. ‘Cognitive privacy’ calls for new thinking about the use of technologies that can decipher thoughts and brain activities.

Some of these rights are already covered by existing constitutional provisions, some have been protected under laws, while others are still waiting to be born. A legal right can, however, not be a substitute for a fundamental right. Legal rights can be conferred and withdrawn at will and their validity rests on conformity with the Constitution.

The declaration of privacy as a fundamental right will not imply that it will become an unassailable, paramount right, which can never be undone. The contours of privacy, and the limitations on its scope, will have to evolve through jurisprudence developed by the courts. Even until recently, when we believed privacy to be an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, the Supreme Court had pointed on several occasions that privacy is not an absolute right.

For instance, in Mr X vs Hospital Z ((1998) 8 SCC 296), while dealing with the right to confidentiality of an HIV patient, the court held that in case of a conflict between right to privacy and right to health of another, the latter prevails. In another case, ordering a person to undergo a medical examination was not regarded as being violative of the person’s right to privacy where the test was necessary to determine unsoundness of mind, a recognised ground for divorce. The person could still refuse the medical examination, allowing the court to draw an adverse inference (Sharda vs Dharmpal, AIR 2003 SC 3450).

Conferring privacy with the status of afundamental right will achieve two key goals. One, it will offer a guaranteed constitutional framework to test against ingressions into the various dimensions of privacy. Two, it will provide courts with greater confidence when comparing the tradeoffs between privacy and other constitutional protections.

The separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary demands that courts cannot question the wisdom of legislative actions. So, any law, no matter how odious it may appear, cannot be struck down by a court unless covered by certain specific grounds. These grounds, as stated most recently in the Aadhaar-PAN case (WP Civil No. 247 of 2017), are that the legislature did not have the competence to make the law; or the law is void for being in violation of any of the fundamental rights or any other constitutional provisions.

If privacy is not to be a fundamental right, what protection would we have against future transgressions of this right by various laws? Always having to derive this right from other provisions in the Constitution would dilute its efficacy. Relying on political processes to solve the issue would be too little, too late.

The key challenge, therefore, is not just about the privacy implications of the Aadhaar Act, or any other legislation, but the unforeseen laws and practices of the days to come. A few years ago, the Bombay High Court directed the UIDAI to share the biometric information of Aadhaar holders in Goa to aid the CBI in a rape investigation. The UIDAI challenged this before the court on grounds of privacy, which was accepted by the court.

The passage of the Aadhaar Act has now closed the door on such speculative searches, at least so far as biometric data is concerned. If the law were to be subsequently amended to allow biometric data to be shared for investigation and surveillance purposes, one would like to believe that the supporters of the Aadhaar architecture will join the detractors in opposing such a move. What we will need then is a fundamental right to privacy against which the actions of the legislature can be tested.

Shagun and Hingonia: Are these gaushalas or torture chambers?,"The horrifying scandals of government-aided gaushalas exposed in Chhattisgarh last week and in Rajasthan last year suggest that the elaborate sociopolitical architecture created around gau raksha since 2014 is essentially hypocritical. Unless beating up people for transporting cows is considered a proxy for improving the condition of cows, where is the evidence that India’s cows are better off today than three years ago? And if they haven’t benefited what’s worth asking is who has.

BJP leader Harish Verma is at the center of the Chhattisgarh scandal. He has been running the Shagun gaushala in the Durg district. Police have arrested Verma but he says (unconvincingly) that he is not to blame as the gaushala has been saddled with 600 cows when it is meant to hold only 220, plus for two years government hasn’t given him the Rs 10 lakh per year he is supposed to get to run the gaushala.

Verma is also associated with Mayuri and Phulchand gaushalas in the same district. As in the Shagun gaushala, here too reporters have found cows starving and carcasses rotting. The gory story has taken an even more ghoulish turn with allegations surfacing that Verma used to skin cow carcasses to feed fish in his pond and that he may be involved in cattle trafficking as well. Together around 200 cows are alleged to have died at these three gaushalas in around a week.

A year ago it was in Rajasthan – which not only boasts India’s first ever gaupalan ministry but also has very energetic gau rakhaks who among other misadventures have harassed Kashmiri students on suspicion of cooking beef (lab report said it wasn’t beef) and beaten up truckers transporting cattle and killed Pehlu Khan – that the death of hundreds of cows due to gross negligence amounting to torture was reported at the government-run Hingonia gaushala.

In all these case it is reported that not only were the gaushalas not being cleaned, locking cows to ordure and disease, but the cows weren’t even being watered and fed. In the Hingonia case some cows struggled to free themselves from the swamp of muck for days before succumbing to pain and exhaustion. One year on overcrowding and disease remain rife in Hingonia.

These scandals are shocking but perhaps predictable. Forcibly replacing a rational economic cycle of raising, selling and slaughtering cows with some arbitrary religious grid is bound to have various tumorous side-effects. The diversity of stakeholders has also been forcibly lessened even as a privileged new breed of stakeholders has been created – BJP leader Verma is very much representative of this breed. Its political power grows by sloganeering gau raksha vehemently – without a commensurate burden of actually providing gau raksha."

Cairn had before an international arbitration tribunal in July last year sought USD 5.6 billion in compensation from the Indian government for raising a retrospective tax demand of Rs 10,247 crore on a decade old internal reorganisation of its India unit.In its half-year financial and operations statement, the company said the government had raised Rs 18,800 crore as interest on the principal tax demand. The interest demand was quashed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.""Following that, the Income Tax Department issued a revised demand including interest running from February 2016 i.e. 30 days after the date of the assessment order.

"Single use medical devices: Mumbai: FIRs against 37 hospitals for reusing devices, patients to be reimbursed, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has filed complaints against 37 hospitals across the state for reusing single-use medical devices and overcharging patients, said minister for consumer protection Girish Bapat . The government is also working on ways to refund patients who were unfairly charged for reused devices, he announced in the legislative council on Tuesday.Moreover, to prevent such incidents from recurring in hospitals, the state government plans to develop a web portal that will record every medical device’s journey—right from its purchase to use and re-use.“The web portal will keep a track of each medical device from the moment it is purchased, the medical institute it is sold to, and its use,” said Bapat, replying to a query raised by Congress MLC Satej Patil during question hour. The minister added that discussions with the Medical Council of India, the Drug Council of India and secretary of the public health department on the issue are in the final stages.The announcement follows special investigations by the state Food and Drug Administration in May-June that showed many private hospitals charged premium charges from patients for reused cardiac catheters and guidewires; most of these devices are only meant for single use.In April, the state FDA had found three city hospitals guilty of not only reusing medical devices meant for single use, but also charging multiple patients for the same. Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi, which is managed by the Fortis group, and BSES Hospital in Andheri were later issued show-cause notices for violating the Drug and Cosmetics Act.On Tuesday, when Patil pointed out that a few hospitals have already reused implant devices and cheated patients, the minister assured him that the government would get information about such cases and refund those patients."

"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.“The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,” Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. “The only solution is our focus on improving execution.“India’s biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers’ pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma’s Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India’s pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun’s consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun’s profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun’s U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG’s blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.“Going forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters” as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. “The U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.”As prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company’s leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."

"PPA renegotiation by discoms may adversely impact RE sector growth: ICRA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Recent attempts by state-owned power distribution utilities ( discoms ) in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh to renegotiate or cancel signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with wind and solar power developers could have an adverse impact on the renewable energy (RE) sector, credit ratings agency ICRA has said.If implemented, the renegotiation could also impact the credit profile of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and investment interest from the private sector, the agency said. “Significant uncertainty exists for wind-based IPPs which have recently signed PPAs based on feed-in tariffs. The same is estimated to be about 830 MW in Andhra Pradesh and 490 MW in Karnataka. Such cancellation or renegotiation, if finalized by discoms, may be legally challenged by the affected IPPs and the resolution of the same could be a protracted affair,” Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head, ICRA said.He, however, added that the agency understands the centre is trying to dissuade state discoms from such unilateral action on PPAs.Apart from this, several PPAs tied-up by wind and solar power developers with state-owned discoms do not have any termination penalty clause related to any discom in the event of default, the report stated. These PPAs usually do not have any deemed generation clause and are based on single part tariff – which is linked to actual generation.“As a result, the wind and solar energy projects with PPAs at a relatively higher tariff in comparison with average power purchase cost of the off-taker discom remains exposed to a risk of forced back-down / grid curtailment, a situation which has occasionally been seen in a few states in the past,” the report said.This also comes at a time reverse auction-based bidding mechanism has helped in lowering the wind power tariffs under the 1,000 MW scheme by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE). It has prompted discoms to stop signing PPAs based on feed-in tariff and instead opt for the auction route.“The visibility for actual wind-based capacity addition remains quite weak in near term. Nonetheless, long term demand drivers remain intact due to an improved tariff competitiveness of wind and solar energy against conventional energy sources, large untapped renewable potential and strong policy and regulatory support. However, the resolution of the PPA renegotiation or cancellation issue remains crucial to retain investor interest in the sector,” Majumdar said.The tendering process for projects as announced by discoms in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and the second 1,000 MW scheme by MNRE is yet to be concluded."
"Lions to spend Rs 1cr for Measles Rubella vaccination campaign in Telangana, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Hyderabad: Lions of Telangana pledged their support Government’s Campaign for Measles Rubella Vaccination Drive Malla Reddy , MP launched the Measles Rubella Campaign by releasing a mammoth balloon into the sky in the city on Thursday in a function held at St. Peters Public Schools, Bowenpally.The function was graced by Secunderabad Cantonment Board Chief Executive Officer (CEO) ...

"Researchers Have Developed The World's Smallest Surgical Robot Arm, Thanks To Smartphones!","A team of British scientists have developed the world’s smallest surgical robot, one that could change the face of medicine forever.

Image courtesy: Cambridge Medical Robotics

Developed by a team of 100 scientists and engineers in Cambridgeshire, the robotic arm has been specially designed to conduct keyhole surgeries, using technology borrowed from mobile phones and the space industry.

Called Versius, the device mimics the movements of a human arm and can be used for a wide range of keyhole surgeries. This kind of operation involves making a series of tiny incisions in order to avoid the risks of traditional open surgery, as well as improve the patient’s recovery time.

In this case, Versius can supplement a traditional surgeon in order to improve the accuracy and reduce the chances of a slip up. The surgeon controls the arm via a 3D screen within the operating theatre. While surgical bots already exist, this one takes up a third of the space required by existing models, as well as being easier to use, according to the Cambridge Medical Robotics team.

“Having robots in the operating theatre is not a new idea,” the company’s chief executive, Martin Frost, said. “The problem at the moment is that they are phenomenally expensive – not only do they cost £2m each (approximately Rs 16.52 crore) to buy, but every procedure costs an extra £3,000 using the robot ( Rs 2.5 lakh) – and they are very large. Many hospitals have to use the operating theatre around the robot. Their size can also make them difficult for the surgical team to use.”

One major benefit to the Versius over a human surgeon is its utmost precision. Not only can it mimic a human arm’s movement, but inbuilt technology can also detect just how much force needs to be applied when the instruments are inside the patient.

The new bot will launch next year, and CMR expects surgeons to be trained and practiced enough to begin using the devices by the end of 2018.

Here’s A Bacteria That Could Potentially Boost Athletic Performance!,"Been trying to boost your athletic performance but don't know how? Scientists have recently identified a bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of runners and rowers that may aid in improving your athletic performance. The bacteria is set to be used to develop probiotic applications that aid in performance and recovery.

Twitter/Representational Image

The results showed that the bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of the athletes may help develop probiotic supplements that could help them, and even amateur fitness enthusiasts, recover from a tough workout or more efficiently convert nutrients to energy.

""We are more bacteria than we are human. The bugs in our gut affect our energy metabolism, making it easier to breakdown carbohydrates, protein and fibre,"" said Jonathan Scheiman, a post-doctoral student at Harvard Medical School.

NewsX/Representational Image

""They are also involved in inflammation and neurological functions. So perhaps the microbiome could be relevant for applications in endurance, recovery and maybe even mental toughness,"" Scheiman added.

For the study, presented at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, the team collected fecal samples on a daily basis from 20 athletes training for the 2015 Boston Marathon, to capture how the microbiome changes between performance and recovery.

When they compared the pre-race and post-race samples, the researchers found a sudden spike in the population of one particular type of bacteria after the marathon.

Facebook/Representational Image

""This bug's natural function is to breakdown lactic acid,"" Scheiman said.

During intense exercise, the body produces more lactic acid than usual, which can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. This bacteria could potentially help with that.

The researchers are now feeding the bacteria to mice to measure its effects on lactic acid levels and fatigue.

Twitter/Representational Image

In another experiment, the researchers compared the bacteria from ultra-marathoners to those found in rowers training for the Olympics.

They found a type of bacteria in ultra-marathoners that can help breakdown carbohydrates and fibre—which is key during a 100-mile run—that was not present in the rowers, suggesting that different sports may foster niche microbiomes.

"Indian Railways: Indian Railways signs first EPC contract to speed up electrification, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: With the aim of boosting its ‘ Mission Electrification ’ plan, Indian Railways signed its first Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with L&T for large electrification projects on Friday. The contract valuing Rs 1,050 crore for electrification of 781 route kilometres (RKM) was awarded by Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE) and Konkan Railways.“For faster execution of Railway Electrification projects, Indian Railways has changed from Business as usual (BAU) approach and entrusted new electrification works not only to Railway PSUs like Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) and Rail India Techno Economic Service (RITES) but also to Power Grid Corporation India Limited (PGCIL),” the ministry of railways said in a statement.The contract was awarded for electrification of Delhi Sarai Rohilla – Rewari and Alwr – Bandikui – Jaipur – Phulera – Ajmer (353 rkm) section at a cost of Rs 594 crore and Roha – Verna (428 rkm) of Konkan Railway at a cost of Rs. 456 crore. Also, eight agreements were also exchanged between Zonal Railways and Public Sector Undertakings for 1,735 rkm of electrification projects valuing Rs 1,746 crore.This comes on the heels of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) stating in its audit report on ‘Electrification Projects in Indian Railways’ that the Indian Railways lost savings to the tune of Rs 3,006 crore on account of delays in execution 21 railways electrification projects out of 29 projects which were examined.Under ‘Mission Electrification’, ten different electrification projects covering 2,516 rkm at a cost of about Rs. 2,797 crore have been finalized in a short duration, the statement added. “It is a very important milestone for us. We had also announced in the rail budget that we will increase the pace of electrification. Around 42 per cent of electrification will be doubled in the next 5 years. Rs 16,500 crore of track doubling has also been sanctioned which will be electrified after getting commissioned,” rail minister Suresh Prabhu said at the signing.Prabhu also said the national carrier is also in the process of procuring electric locomotives from GE and Alstom , adding that the manufacturing of the locomotives will begin within a few months. He also stated that electrification has been given a higher thrust during the last four years as a total of 103 electrification projects were sanctioned.“We are also introducing 40,000 retrofitted and modernised coaches. Railways is constantly reforming itself by taking various initiatives in energy sector. With rolling stock getting modernised, lines getting electrified and guage conversion you can imagine the huge impact it will have on the whole Indian Railways network,” he added.The national carrier aims to reduce its total energy bill by over Rs 4,000 crore per annum through rapid electrification. At present, only 42 percent of the total Indian Railways network is electrified. The rail ministry plans to increase its electrified network to 52,400 rkm by 2021. On completion of 90 percent of railway electrification, the national carrier expects its total energy bill to come down to Rs 16,000 crore as against Rs 26,500 crore at present."
The Hacker Of GoT Season 7 Episode 4 Leaked It Because He Wanted To Please His Girlfriend!,"It happens only in India?!

The first time it happened with the fourth episode of Game of Thrones, the most hyped and loved American series that the entire episode was leaked online before its official release, and it happened in India.

The leaked episode had Star India’s watermark on it, which means that Hotstar who is HBO’s partner in India for airing the episode was responsible for the leak. Later it turned out that Prime Focus Technologies—the agency which manages Star India Private Limited’s data, is the root of the entire problem. Four people were arrested in the same regard and now one of them has revealed how it got revealed.

What was supposed to be a grave severe affair turned out to be rather funnier and realistic, to say the least.

So, now it has been revealed that one of the IT professionals named Alok Sharma who was under arrest in the same regard had sent the episode to his girlfriend in order to please her, and that is from where it was leaked and later uploaded online.

Twitter

“Initially, there were suspicions that one of the accused had accessed the episode as his girlfriend wanted to see it. The girlfriend had then passed it onto others, one of whom uploaded it online,” revealed an official to Indian Express who was part of the probe earlier.

“The investigation is still in progress. However, so far, it appears that they had leaked it for self-consumption. We are now trying to find out who uploaded it online,” another senior officer added.

According to the report, first Alok had accessed the episode and it is he who shared it with the other four who are also under arrest. Police is trying to find out who uploaded it online.

Meanwhile, hackers responsible for the leak of the sixth episode have warned HBO that the finale episode will also be leaked before the actual air date.

This 3200MP Camera In World's Most Hi-Tech Telescope Will Start Hunting For Dark Matter In 2019,"Ever since astronomers discovered in 1998 that our universe is expanding faster as time goes by the idea has captivated researchers across the world. The idea is that this acceleration in the rate it’s expanding because of “dark energy”, the mysterious gravitational force spread throughout our universe.

A concept render of what the LSST facility will eventually look like

Now, scientists from dozens of institutions across 23 countries have come together to work on a new telescope they believe can shed light on dark matter. Called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), it’s a gigantic digital camera to be mounted on Earth, which will capture images from galaxies millions of light years away.

“All the existing telescopes with cameras were built before the discovery of dark energy,” Paul O’Connor, a senior scientist from Brookhaven National Laboratory told Atlas Obscura. “We expect the LSST to map the entire sky and find out where all that dark matter has been hiding.” O’Connor has been working on the project for over ten years and he believes it could completely change how we understand the workings of the universe.

The LSST's 3.5 metre wide mirror cells, part of its camera assembly

The LSST would serve to capture images of galaxies much further away than our current technology allows. The camera’s field of view when pointed at the sky would be just ten square degrees, but it would still be able to spot around a million distant galaxies in that area. It'll also be outfitted with a 3,200 megapixel sensor being developed by O'Connor at Brookhaven, able to capture light from stars 100 million times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye.

About the size of a small SUV car, ""the LSST camera is the largest camera ever constructed for astronomy.""

It is a large-aperture, wide-field optical camera that is capable of viewing light from the near ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths. It's 3 metre long, 1.65 metre high, weighs 2800 kg, and has a pixel count of 3200 megapixel -- several times better, more precise than even the best smartphone cameras out there.

When the LSST begins operations in 2020, in the mountains of Chile, it will be tasked with scanning regions of the sky over and over for the next 10 years. It’s expected to capture each patch of sky a thousand times, over the course of 3,000 nights. “We’re really going to be making a movie of the universe,” O’Connor said.

The camera assembly of the LSST compared with a human

With that data, astronomers hope to better understand dark energy by looking at how it interacts with objects in the universe. Studying how these far-flung galaxies are shooting away from us could bring new discoveries in the field of astrophysics that we’ve never even thought"
"Oil major Total's shares rise as analysts welcome Maersk Oil deal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","PARIS: Shares in Total rose on Tuesday, on the back of upbeat analyst comments regarding the French oil major's $7.45 billion takeover of Maersk Oil .

Total was up 0.8 percent in early session trading, among the top performers on France's benchmark CAC-40 index.

""The credentials of this deal, and the deals in Brazil and Uganda last year, suggest that Total is able to realign the portfolio in a manner that is not value-destructive,"" wrote Citigroup analysts in a research note.

Citigroup kept a ""buy"" rating on Total, while UBS increased its rating on Total to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".

Ion-Marc Valahu, a fund manager at Geneva-based firm Clairinvest, also said he thought the price paid for Maersk Oil was a reasonable one for Total.

""I think it's positive. It's not too expensive,"" said Valahu, whose firm owns some Total shares."
"Why The Saying ‘Once A Cheater, Always A Cheater’ Is Scientifically True","Think twice before admitting you were unfaithful in your past relationships to your partner. There a good chance that the adage “once a cheater, always a cheater,” holds true claim recent studies.

dnaindia.com

In one such study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, the researchers asked the participants questions about their infidelity with their partners; which was called extra-dyadic sexual involvement (ESI) by the researchers.

au.finance.yahoo.com

The study revealed some interesting results:

-People who cheated in their first relationship were three times as likely to cheat in their next relationship!

-Those who knew their partners had engaged in ESI in the previous relationships were twice as likely to report the same from their next partner.

-People who suspected their partners of ESI in their first-relationship were four times as likely to report suspecting their partner in the next relationship as well.

kadinvekadin.net

The results were indicative of the importance of prior infidelity in your current or next relationship.

One of the reasons the ESI’s find it easier to cheat and then lie about it could be explained by another study that reveals how the brain gets used to lying over time.

cotton-hairy-club.fr

A study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience states that telling lies builds the density of our brain against the negative emotions associated with it.

In other words, even if you feel guilty about cheating the first time you do, you’re unlikely to feel the same level of guilt the next time around, which in a way may encourage you to repeat the act in the future.

thismumbusiness.com

The studies no doubt provide some interesting insights into the minds of ESI offenders. Regardless of these insights, it’s up to people to view this with scepticism or take it at face value on an individual level. Besides, you have to give credit to the person for owning up to his/her past doings."

More than 20 bidders in race for IPL media rights

K Shriniwas Rao • Last updated on Tue, 22 Aug, 2017, 12:04 PM

industry experts say the digital market is clearly a far more dynamic industry going further, which BCCI is unwilling to explore © AFP

A little more than 20 companies have bought the Invitation To Tender (ITT) for the high profile media rights of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the submissions for which have now been scheduled for September 1.

The submissions, earlier scheduled to take place on August 28, had to be postponed by four days because of matters related to taxation and impending bank holidays. In the first round of clarifications on the ITT sent out last Friday, the BCCI had informed potential bidders about the same.

The list of those who have picked up the ITT will be submitted to the Supreme Court on Tuesday when the petition submitted by MP Subramanian Swamy asking for an e-auction to ensure transparency will come up for hearing.

Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who is also hearing the matter concerning the BCCI in its longstanding legal tussle with the Cricket Association of Bihar, will hear Swamy's petition.

As the fraternity waits for the Supreme Court to show the way forward, TOI has learned that Star India Pvt Ltd, Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt Ltd, Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Digital lead a list of 20-odd companies that have picked up the ITT, with another internet giant Yahoo joining the race.

Others include Follow on Interactive Media, Times Internet Ltd, Gulf DTH, SuperSport International, GroupM Media India, Bein IP, Econet Media Group, Sky UK, ESPN Digital Media, BTG Legal Service, BT Sport, Twitter, Facebook, Discovery , Airtel and DAZN Perform Group.

While it certainly happens to be an attractive line-up, the fact that BCCI has kept all options open in terms of inviting the bids - a consolidated bid, breakdown of bids and both, it remains to be seen if it will be a level-playing field.

Those with an industry perspective say a consolidated bid will not allow market-specific bidders like Amazon and Yahoo looking to cut the cheque from a digital viewpoint to contest on equal footing because the option of a consolidated bid heavily tilts the game in favour of the television broadcaster.

While the cricket board's logic is that keeping all options open allows it to look at revenue maximization, industry experts say the digital market is clearly a far bigger and a more dynamic industry going further, which BCCI is unwilling to explore keeping broadcaster interests in mind.

""A separate bid for digital will force the rights-owner to do a deferred live of matches whereas if one party owns digital and broadcast both, then there's no restriction. Where's the logic in this?

Why not have a paywall instead? This is like suppressing a market that hasn't even woken up yet,"" says an industry executive.

Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."
Going to Gorakhpur’s root: Here are some simple steps that would turn around and restore vibrancy to government hospitals,"The Gorakhpur tragedy has exposed the weakness of the public health system. Instead of finding a scapegoat, let us look at how India’s broken public health system can be mended. There are three main problems with Indian public health, and none of them have to do with lack of money. The problems are (i) acute shortage of medical specialists; (ii) lack of career progression for nurses; and (iii) accountability.

Shortage of medical specialists is evident even in a state like Karnataka which has the largest number of medical colleges. Yet there are over 1,200 vacancies for specialists in government hospitals. Unlike in the past, an MBBS doctor with adequate training but without a post graduate degree is legally barred today from performing a caesarean section, an anaesthetic procedure, an ultrasound or interpreting a chest X-ray.

The top 10 causes of death in India cannot be treated by an MBBS doctor. In simple terms, even a brilliant MBBS doctor cannot do anything more legally than what a housewife is permitted to do. These rigid regulations were created by the Medical Council and upheld by the Supreme Court for patient safety.

Unfortunately, we also have an acute shortage of post graduate seats needed to convert existing two lakh MBBS doctors into specialists. Because of the shortage of specialists, Indian maternal and infant mortality rates are worse than some sub-Saharan African countries.

The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery recommends preparedness for “bellwether procedures”, ie emergency caesarean section, laparotomy and surgery for open fractures at community health centres – of which there are 5,500 in India – as an indicator of an efficient public health system. Today, 60% of deaths are due to non-infectious diseases. According to the commission, while only 3.83 million people die globally due to malaria, HIV and TB, 16.9 million people die due to lack of access to safe surgery every year.

India needs 65 million surgeries annually, but only 26 million are performed and the rest suffer and die. Legally, only specialists can perform surgeries and treat non-communicable diseases. This is the reason a hospital without adequate number of specialists is of no use for the patient and the community.

Ten years ago, maternal mortality rate (MMR) of Maharashtra was as bad as in the rest of the prosperous south Indian states. In 2009, Maharashtra’s health ministry recognised diplomas from the then 96-year-old College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) to convert MBBS doctors into specialists. Today, nearly a thousand specialist medical officers working for Maharashtra health service are not MD or MS but diploma holders from CPS. By 2013, these diploma holders had produced a Maharashtra miracle: they dramatically reduced its MMR from 144 to 68, half of Karnataka’s MMR. Very soon, Maharashtra will be challenging Kerala for the number one spot.

Fortunately, the Union health ministry is considering recognising CPS diplomas across India. National Board of Examinations is also converting large government hospitals as teaching institutes to train medical specialists. With trained and certified gynaecologists, paediatricians, anaesthetists and radiologists, community health centres and taluka and district hospitals will become the most vibrant hospitals.

Second, the nursing profession is in crisis in India. In the US, 67% of anaesthesia procedures are administered by nurse anaesthetists. In India, a nurse who worked in an ICU for 20 years is legally not allowed to prescribe even a painkiller. The younger generation will never take up a profession where there is no career progression. Recently, the health ministry and Indian Nursing Council launched the nurse practitioner course, which will be a turning point in Indian nursing profession. Nurse practitioners can reduce doctors’ workload in government and private hospitals, improving clinical outcomes.

Third, the accountability question. People need hospitals only for the procedures. Health ministry should monitor hospitals on just four parameters for every government hospital – outpatient numbers, number of diagnostic tests, number and outcomes of surgeries and number and outcomes in critical care service. This data should be uploaded real time to a cloud-based app. Based on this data the ministry can grade every government hospital, plan budgetary allocation, increments and promotions of staff. Real time data in public domain will hold the mirror for policy makers to reflect on. We believe in god, but the rest is data.

When i was growing up, government hospitals were the most vibrant institutions and government doctors were our heroes. My brother, a doctor himself, insisted on my getting a tonsillectomy in a government hospital. If there were 20 full-time paediatricians working at Gorakhpur’s BRD hospital, tragedy would have been averted.

Medical specialists are always at the highest level of the government pecking order. Young and qualified medical specialists will insist on improvement of infrastructure to practice their newly acquired skill and build their reputation. As always happens in India, one of the 20 paediatricians would be taking care of a senior minister’s or politician’s grandchild, thus having access to the state’s power centre.

Maharashtra’s experience has convinced us to believe that recognition of CPS diploma courses across the country will be a turning point in the history of vibrancy of government hospitals, along with empowering nurses and digital accountability tools. I am convinced, after spending my entire professional life in managing hospitals, that private enterprise cannot replace government hospitals for rural healthcare. If you think government is not capable of managing hospitals look at Jayadeva Institute of Cardiac Sciences Bangalore, UN Mehta Heart Institute Ahmedabad and ILBS Delhi which make India proud."
Tiger Shroff Saves Rumoured Girlfriend Disha Patani From An Embarrassing Moment On The Ramp!,"It has, for long, been rumoured that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been dating but the couple has kept what's between them under wraps. Often they have been spotted together and the rumours thereafter spread like wildfire.

Recently, the alleged couple attended the Lakme Fashion Week together, and what happened there was rather cute that fans have been fawning over.

Just like Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani was also supposed to walk the runway but she didn't. Why, you ask? Because Tiger saved her from what could have been a major embarrassing moment.

So, before the diva walked the ramp, Tiger figured out that the stage was made up of a reflective glass, and her alleged girlfriend was wearing a short dress. Being a keen observer of thing or just being a caring boyfriend, Tiger was seen muttering something into her ears and thereafter she decided not to walk the ramp.

Isn't that cute?

Earlier as well, the alleged couples of the B-town have saved their girlfriends from such awkward moments. Remember, how once, Salman told Katrina to cover up her neck while at a press conference through Alia Bhatt.

Also, how once Singh Rajput saved Kriti Sanon from a probable wardrobe malfunction?

That's indeed cute, isn't it?

"11th edition of FICCI gets under way, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI, August 17, 2017. C K Mishra , Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, today underlined the need for investing two-thirds of the spending in primary healthcare and enhancing preventive care to keep the requirement of diagnostic care and admission to hospitals in check. As financial resources are limited, it is essential to invest in the right place for optimal results, he said while inaugurating the 11th edition of FICCI HEAL on the theme ‘ Indian Healthcare : A Patient’s View’.Mr. Mishra said that infrastructure in remote areas was weak and only government establishments were functional in such places; therefore active private sector participation was needed to make quality and affordable healthcare accessible to all.He said that the new National Health Policy 2017 with the three pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality of care are in line with a patient’s needs. He added that there was a need to customize care and value the choices of a patient.Recognising FICCI’s efforts in the health care space, Mr. Mishra said that the industry had been forthcoming with policy and reform suggestions, which enabled the government to strengthen its policies. He urged FICCI to develop a framework in conjunction with the government to step the country’s healthcare delivery system.On the occasion, Mr. Mishra released a Knowledge Paper ‘The healthcare consumer: Understanding expectations & experiences in the patients journey’ prepared by FICCI in collaboration with KANTAR-IMRB . The report is based on interviews with over 5000 patients pan-India from both public and private hospitals. Some key findings show that 61% of the patients rated their overall experience in private hospitals positively as compared to 45% for government hospitals. The report delves on the experiences and expectations of the patient and provides recommendations for the government and healthcare providers.Mr. Pankaj Patel, President, FICCI, said that the government’s intent to increase the public health spend to 2.5%, efforts should be made to increase it to 4% of GDP to meet the universal healthcare goals of the country. He added that long-term financing options from banks are still not available to healthcare providers and this was hampering the penetration of private healthcare in the country. He said that while retention of healthcare services in the tax exemption list under the GST regime is thoughtful and will enable flow of seamless tax credit and improve overall tax compliance, the services rendered by the hospital are exempted from taxes, several input services are subject to GST, which will result in increase in overall cost of care for the patient. Mr. Patel said that FICCI assures the government, its complete support for achieving affordable, accessible and quality healthcare to all Indians."

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"diabetes: New diabetes drug reduces blood glucose by pushing it to urine: Dr Alvin C Powers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi:, President of, was recently in India to co-inaugurate ‘ International Diabetes Update ’ 2017, which highlighted many advances in diabetes therapy and how to use these advances to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."

"Govt brings in new norms on solar power procurement, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government has implemented new rules for buying power from grid-linked solar power projects through competitive bidding under the National Solar Mission to improve transparency and standardise auctions.

These guidelines, prepared by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), cover the grid-connected solar PV power projects with a size of 5 mw and above, an official said.

The official said this will help in reducing off-takers' risks, encourage investments, enhance bankability of projects and improve profitability for investors.

The norms provide that the minimum power purchase agreement tenure (PPA) will be 25 years that will help ensure lower tariffs. Besides, unilateral termination or amendment of PPA is not allowed.

The issues related to land, connectivity and clearances and the extension in the case of delay have been streamlined for ensuring project preparedness.

The event of default and the consequences thereof are clearly defined to ensure optimal risk sharing.

There is a provision for termination compensation to increase bankability of projects by securing investment by the generator and lenders against any arbitrary termination of a PPA.

The guidelines also provide for payment security mechanism. The risk of generator's revenue getting blocked due to delayed payment or non-payment has been addressed through provision of Payment Security Mechanism through instruments like Letter of Credit (LC), Payment Security Fund, State Guarantee and the like.

The early commissioning and part commissioning of projects have not only been allowed, but incentivised, by way of allowing the PPA for a minimum 25 years from the scheduled commissioning date under the new norms.

The penalties have been rationalised so as to reduce the overall cost to the generator while at the same time ensuring compliance with rules.

The new framework also contains provision for force majeure. Now, the PPA would have provisions with regard to force majeure definitions, exclusions, applicability and available relief as per the industry standards.

The successful bidder -- if it is a single company -- shall ensure its shareholding in the SPV company executing the PPA shall not drop below 51 per cent at any point prior to one year from the commercial operation date except with the prior approval of the procurer."
Merger drama and fragile Tamil dreams,"Two factions of Tamil Nadu’s AIADMK party have come together, attempting to fill a J Jayalalithaa-size hole after her death earlier this year. E K Palaniswami of AIADMK (Amma), the standby incumbent, will continue as chief minister. His rival O Panneerselvam will be accommodated as deputy chief minister. It is common knowledge that the reconciliation was brokered by the BJP, in power at the Centre. The BJP believes that its role as dealmaker between the two factions of AIADMK and support to keep it in power in Chennai, will allow it to get a toehold in the southern state.

Elections for the assembly are due only in 2021. But Lok Sabha polls are due in two years, and Tamil Nadu’s 40 seats, 39 of them now held by the AIADMK, are crucial for the BJP. Its managers like Amit Shah know that an alliance with the AIADMK might enable the party to make inroads into India’s vast southern peninsula. Yet, there are two reasons why the gamble might fail to yield results. One, a third, disgruntled AIADMK faction, led by TTV Dhinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaa’s aide Sasikala, claims the support of 20 elected lawmakers. Sasikala is behind bars on a case related to disproportionate assets. If Dhinakaran withdraws his lawmakers and sides with the main opposition party DMK, the incumbent government could fall.

Two, even if this does not happen, the BJP is firmly identified as a north-Indian outfit by Tamil voters. For decades now, the latter have consistently voted for Dravidian parties, relegating even the once-powerful Congress to the margins of electoral politics. The BJP cannot be faulted for its attempts to break new ground. But the tremendous uncertainty that has gripped Tamil and AIADMK politics casts a long shadow over administrative stability and governance."

"Compassion is the key to Hinduism, does it still exist?","The Times has reported that the Holy Banyan tree is dying, the same tree under which Krshna ‘delivered his message of the Bhagwad Gita to Arjun’. With cemented paths, large bells, lights fixated all over, the problem has escalated with two claimants battling for the care of the tree while the tree is withering. The last remaining relic of the Mahabharata is dying; we have lost sight of what is important.

We pray to nature, to animals, to every living being. We pray to images that replicate holy deities in the form of shivling, in the form of a footprint. Yet we have turned the heart of our nation, Delhi, into the most polluted city of the world. Our metropolitans are growing fast, but to what end? Children have asthma, pm 1.0, 2.5 and 10 are polluting every pore of our natural being, blackening our lungs, shortening our life expectancy. During winters young and old alike leave the city and head for the mountains or the beaches, shutting down businesses, taking long vacations from their jobs, while breadwinners of the family send their spouse and children outside of the city to make sure they are safe.

As a religion that equates every living being to God, we have failed in respecting nature and our religion. In turn we are poisoning our family, our friends, and our neighbors. The cruelest act to mankind is pollution, we are living in a slow poison genocide. Each one of us is responsible for this act, and each one of us can make a difference.

India has a rich history when it comes to forest conservation. In 1730 AD Khejarli Village of Rajasthan, the King had ordered for the felling of Khejri trees, sacred to the Bishnois. Bishnois are an offshoot of Hinduism following 29 principles. Amrita Devi couldn’t bear to witness the destruction of her faith and the village’s sacred trees, so she hugged the trees and said “A chopped head is cheaper than a felled tree.” People from different villages joined her. The soldiers chopped slaughtered 363 Bishnois. As soon as the King received news of this he ordered the soldiers to stop the operation and designated the Bishnoi state as a protected area. This legislation still exists today. In memory of the deceased, a number of khejri trees are planted around the area.

This was the beginning of the Chipko movement, now nationally prevalent and widely acclaimed as an effective method of forest preservation.

The United Nations made June 5th World Environment Day in 1947, in 1950 Dr. K M Munshi created Van Mahotsav festival for forest conservation and planting trees. It is now a week-long festival, usually from the 1st of July to 7th July. We celebrate World Environment Day where for an hour we turn off the lights of our homes, but have forlorn Van Mahotsav festival which is more in-line with our ‘dharma’.

On World Environment Day 2017 ‘Mann ki Baat’, Prime Minister Modi talked about how traditional Hindu scriptures such as Gita, Shukracharya Niti, and Anushasan Parv of the Mahabharta highlight the values of forests. He planted a Kadam tree which has much religious value in Hindu scriptures, and also placed a traditional earthen-pot with it, a traditional method of conserving water, and ensuring it has regular water supply.

On Twitter Narendra Modi encouraged farmers to plant 5 trees in celebration of the birth of their daughter, as the farmer can reap monetary benefits from the plantation and use that for her marriage. A two pronged approach which saves the life of a girl child and doesn’t make her seem like a burden, and also helps the farmers family economically.

‘Each one plant one tree,’ a popular yet simple motto if followed can make a huge impact due to our 1.3 Billion population, the second largest population in the world. As at 2016 the tree cover of India was 23.81%. The Government of India has set a target of 33% cover by 2020. If united we can bring a change in the pollution levels, not only nationally but also globally thereby leaving a world safe for our future. If each one plants one tree, if each one ensures that each sapling lives its complete life, we can save the world. With Delhi’s population of 18.98 million people, if each person decides to plant at least one tree we can come closer to meeting the minimum requirement of 33% forest coverage in a metropolitan area.

The question arises, why only ‘each one plant ONE tree’, why not two? For each Hindu’s Antim-Sanskar we need at least 2 trees, we can return the favor to Mother Earth. If we could make the effort, find the motivation, respect our heritage and living beings of all nature then we can collectively make a difference in India which can impact the globe positively."
"Unit Tariff: Solar tariffs at Rs 3 a unit may be the new normal: NTPC CMD Gurdeep Singh, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh said Rs 3-3.20 a unit tariff for solar power may be the new normal and can be achieved without the support of “cheap funds or cheap panels"", which have been a concern for the industry.Solar and wind energy units generate less than 10% of the global electricity output and have remained on the side-lines historically as these projects were taken up to fulfill a social responsibility towards clean energy But these green energy sources have seen a decline in prices making them comparable to conventional energy and causing a disruption in the power sector. India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.“We should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.“We are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,“ Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."

"Disrupted Gut Microbiome makes children more susceptible to amoebic dysentry, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Children with lower diversity of microbial species in their intestines are more susceptible to severe infection with the Entamoeba histolytica parasite , according to a new study published in PLOS Pathogens E. histolytica is an amoeba that typically spreads via food, water, or hands that have been contaminated with feces. Some infected people have no symptoms, but others experience symptoms of varying severity, from mild abdominal symptoms to life-threatening disease. The factors that influence severity are unclear, but previous studies suggest an important role for the gut microbiome In the new study, Koji Watanabe of the University of Virginia and colleagues collected and analyzed stool samples from children in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. They found that children who experienced colon inflammation because of E. histolytica infection had lower diversity of microbes in their stool than children with asymptomatic infection.To better understand these findings, the researchers used antibiotics to disrupt the gut microbiome in mice. They then exposed the mice to E. histolytica to see whether they were more susceptible to infection. The researchers found that mice treated with antibiotics had more severe colon inflammation than untreated mice.Mouse tissue and gene expression analysis showed that disruption of the gut microbiome decreased the activity of infection-fighting white blood cells known as neutrophils. The surface of neutrophils in these mice had lower amounts of a protein known as CXCR2 than in untreated mice. CXCR2 plays a role in the recruitment of neutrophils to fight infection in the gut, so decreased CXCR2 levels likely resulted in the observed decreased neutrophil activity.The analysis also showed that disruption of the mouse gut microbiome decreased production of a protein known as interleukin-25, which aids the function of the mucosal barrier that acts as the intestine’s first line of defense against infection.These findings suggest a molecular mechanism by which disruption of the gut microbiome increases severity of E. histolytica infection, but further research will be needed to determine if similar molecular effects occur in humans. Meanwhile, the finding that disruption of the mouse gut microbiome can interfere with neutrophil activity may be of broader interest in research of other infectious diseases."

"Rosneft says Essar Oil deal will enable entry in one of the fastest growing markets, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Russian oil major Rosneft today said its acquisition of 49 per cent stake in Essar Oil will enable the oil producer entry in one of the fastest growing markets and it stands to gain from the over 3,500 retail pumps operated by Essar in India on the back of pricing deregulation of the country’s retail oil market.In a statement issued today, Rosneft said with the successful closure of the strategic deal for the acquisition of 49 per cent of Essar, “a platform for further development of international trading – entering the high premium markets of the Asia Pacific region and South East Asia has been created.”The company said it has successfully closed strategic transaction for the acquisition of 49.13 per cent of shares of Essar Oil Limited (EOL) from Essar Energy Holdings Limited (EOL) and its affiliates. An investment consortium comprising Trafigura and UCP has also announced the closure of their acquisition of a separate 49.13 per cent share of EOL.Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin said the completion of the deal marks the beginning of a new chapter for EOL. “Together with our partners we intend to support the company to significantly improve its financial performance and, in the medium term, adopt an asset development strategy,” he said.Sechin added the closing of the deal is a remarkable achievement for Rosneft too as the Company has entered the high-potential and fast-growing Asia Pacific market. “The acquisition of the stake in the Vadinar refinery creates unique opportunities of synergies with existing Rosneft-owned assets and will help improve efficiency of supply to other countries within the region,” he said.The company clarified in the statement the price parameters of the deal are in line with the legally binding agreements signed previously. The Vadinar refinery of Essar is a high-tech project equipped with all the necessary infrastructure with a refining throughput of 20 million tonne, Nelson complexity index of 11.8 and a conversion rate of 95.5 per cent, it said.The Vadinar refinery possesses high feedstock flexibility with heavy grades from Latin America accounting for more than half of all the feedstock processed. The refinery’s configuration is one of the most technologically complicated in the Asia-Pacific region and has significant prospects for expansion in development of the petrochemical production.“The availability of all the necessary infrastructure (a deep-water port, storage terminals and own power station are part of the transaction), as well as Rosneft’s shares in upstream projects in Venezuela and working offtake contracts with PDVSA will provide Rosneft with significant operational synergies and help improve the refinery’s economics. A further synergy will be derived from cross-supplies of oil products to Asia Pacific markets,” Rosneft said.The Russian oil major also said Essar Oil’s vast retail network of 3,500 pumps will improve the assets operational and financial performance thanks to the steadily growing local demand high value-added oil products and EOL’s retail development strategy.According to International Energy Agency (IEA), from 2000 onwards, motor fuel consumption in India grew on average 6.8 per cent annually. IEA predicts that by 2040 India’s automotive sector will be consuming 132 million tonne of oil equivalent (mmtoe) of oil products annually."
England's maiden day-night Test a 'huge success',"ENGLAND'S DAY-NIGHT TEST DEBUT

England's maiden day-night Test a 'huge success'

Rob Johnston • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:27 PM

Just under 70,000 spectators turned up over three days and Friday's attendance of 23,922 was a record crowd for a non-Ashes Test since 2001. © Getty

The experiment of England's first ever day-night Test match at Edgbaston has been described as a success by Warwickshire's Chief Executive Neil Snowball.

Just under 70,000 spectators turned up over three days and Friday's attendance of 23,922 was a record crowd for a non-Ashes Test since 2001. According to reports, over 50,000 pints of beer were sold on the first day and there was also a healthy boost to Birmingham's economy in the region of 15 million GBP. To top it, an England victory rounded off a successful week.

""We are really pleased,"" Snowball told Cricbuzz. ""For the club and city, it was a huge success. It was a shame it didn't go into the fourth day but we did very well on the three days. As a first effort at a day-night Test in England, it couldn't have gone much better.""

Warwickshire had put a lot of work into preparing for the match, including having lights installed in the net areas and putting shuttle buses on for spectators. The feedback they have received from both teams as well as spectators and officials has been overwhelmingly positive. ""The feedback we have had from the fans and our members is that they had a fantastic time and it was great fun. Operationally we were very happy with how it went.""

Perhaps the only negative was the thinning out of the crowd in the final hour of the first day. ""That's surprised us,"" Snowball admitted. ""All day, the bit that everyone was excited about was the final hour with the new ball under the lights. Whether it's because it was a Thursday, people had work the next day. Pretty much as soon as it reached 9 PM, people started to drift away.

""Having said that, it does get a bit cold in the evening but Saturday night when you had Broad's record-breaking wicket and Roland-Jones finishing it off in front of a full crowd under the lights, I think we'll remember that for a long time.""

As to whether there is a need for day-night Test cricket in England given the strong attendances at most games, ""the jury is still out"" according to Snowball. ""The traditional Test grounds are very good at selling Test cricket. We are bucking a trend internationally. There's the question of if we need to do it. But if England are going to be playing more and more day-night Test cricket around the world, they probably should have an opportunity to play it here.

""I would say it's been successful enough to do it in the future. As to when that would be we don't know. That'll be determined by the schedules."" It is unlikely to happen for the next two years. India visit England next summer and a day-night Test would not fit the Indian TV schedules while the following year is an Ashes series for which the games will be sold out anyway.

It remains to be seen when the ECB next schedule a day-night Test and where it will be held. One venue which may not be bidding for any future day-night game is Headingley. ""We are a progressive bunch at Yorkshire and happy to consider most things but I think the case for day-night Tests here is far from proven,"" Steve Denison, Yorkshire's Chairman, told Cricbuzz. ""Our preference is for a summer Test which starts on a Thursday or a Friday like the one later this week.""
