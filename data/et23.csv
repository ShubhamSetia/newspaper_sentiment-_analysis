"For Digital India to really reap benefits, some key technology-related issues need to be resolved","By Kala S Sridhar & V Sridhar

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has argued for making the country digital, and paved the way for electronic payments and receipts through applications such as the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and online wallets. GoI intends to offer higher cashbacks if digital modes of payment are adopted. This has the potential to make India a country with low degree of corruption and black money, given that all transactions will be accounted for.

But there’s a flip side. Psychologically, cash brings with it responsibility. By extension, cashless transactions imply irresponsibility. When we swipe a debit or credit card, it doesn’t really pinch. But when we pay for something in cash, it makes us think several times, since we need to go to the ATM or bank regularly to get cash. So, what are the disadvantages of ‘digital’ spending? At the macro level, saving takes a hit, and the economy may be deprived of much-needed investment and capital accumulation in infrastructure and in other sectors required to boost the rate of economic growth.

At the micro level, the spending spree enabled by cashless transactions will imply less liquidity, and less saving for future generations. According to the Institute of Management Development’s World Competitiveness Centre, tech-savvy countries most digitally ready are Singapore, Sweden, the US, Finland and Denmark. The scores are based on the country’s ability to adopt digital technologies, leading to changes in government practices, business approaches and society in general. India is ranked 51st here. While the average domestic savings rate in the most tech-savvy countries is at 29%, and only at 15% in the least techsavvy ones, the future trajectory of the ‘savings and digital’ relationship is clear.

India’s domestic savings rate for 2015, according to the World Bank, is 31%, much higher than that of tech-savvy and digital Finland (21%), and of the US (17%) in 2015.

Further, Brazil and South Africa with higher digitisation are at only 16% and 20% domestic savings rate respectively, lending credence to the inverse relationship between digital payments and savings.

Don’t Have Right Connection

Also, is India prepared for digital transactions? This is a country with low information and communication technology (ICT) penetration. ‘There is a problem with the system’, ‘servers are slow’ or ‘OTP is not sent’ are constant refrains.

Digital payments require the user to be internet- and mobile-savvy. One has to remember at least two factors of authentication before completing each transaction. The two-factor authentication, while improving security, is not very user-friendly and, in most cases, depends on the telecommunication infrastructure.

According to the World Economic Forum Global Information Technology Report 2016, India is ranked 114 (out of 139 countries) in network infrastructure sub-index. The recent State of the Internet Connectivity 2017 by Akamai Technologies indicates that India is ranked 89th in internet connection speed. The poor broadband infrastructure and associated quality of services affect the timely and successful completion of electronic transactions.

Further, the digitally illiterate depend on middlemen to perform their digital transactions. As old habits die hard, the middlemen, now armed with technological skills, extract rent from the user. These tech-savvy middlemen have access to the passwords and account details of their customers, and, hence, can do irreparable financial damages and invade consumer’s financial privacy.

The accountability and liability of the different service providers — such as the telecom operators, payment gateway providers and app providers — in case the digital transactions fail, are not specified in any regulation. In most cases, it is left to the poor user/consumer to fight it out. Most often, the blame game on each other leaves the customer empty handed and with his or her financial privacy at risk.

It may well be the case that cash or digital payments do not really determine the degree, and pace, of consumer spending. But this much is for sure: if we accept rational human behaviour, digital payments are needed in an era of slow growth, when effortless consumer spending is needed for pump-priming the economy.

On the other hand, when the economy is inflationary, it is preferable that cash transactions are made, enabling consumer restraint. The promise of cashback for a digital payment is counterproductive.

A Tech-tonic Shift

In the interests of freeing the country of corruption that it promises, digital payments should be encouraged, understanding their effects on consumer spending. After all, as a country’s income keeps increasing, it will become more, not less, technologically advanced.

Hence, to facilitate digital transactions, regulations should be formulated regarding the onus and liability of different players in the digital economy, such that consumer interests are protected.

"Open letter to incoming CJI: The most pressing priorities before India’s judiciary, and how to address them","Respected CJI designate,

You are about to head the world’s most populous functioning democracy’s apex court, the planet’s most dynamic judicial institution, a final court with globally the highest degree and scope of judicial review, the global inventor of basic structure theory and PIL and the Indian institution in which maximum faith is reposed by over 1.25 billion Indians. Any wish list for such a powerful and all encompassing institution is bound to be overflowing. I will, due to exigencies of space, limit mine to a few priorities.

Firstly, you and your successor Chief Justices, down to the last known one presently on the bench, should sit down together at least once every two months to create and then monitor the implementation of one, two and five year plans for the entire judiciary, including your court. It is tragic that for the last 70 years such plans have not even been formulated with a minimum perspective of five years, subsuming sub plans for shorter periods.

This is especially vital since most of you have roughly one year (or shorter) Chief Justiceships (with one exception reaching two years). On the many fundamental issues on which the brethren may and do have disagreements, you should agree to disagree and leave them aside to be decided by each incumbent CJI.

Secondly, this agreed five year perspective plan must not be changed for any reason, except fine tuning and calibration for better achievement. Synergistic results are bound to follow. The practice of each CJI anxious to stamp his own brand of policy tends to create transitory and disruptive paradigms, precluding accelerated cumulative consequences.

Thirdly, an example of Thomas Hardy’s admonition “Take care of the small things and the big things will take care of themselves” arises in the case of our collective war on the biggest scourge of judicial arrears and backlog, besmirching the otherwise glorious face of the Indian judiciary. Since your colleagues have now firmly re-established the primacy of the collegium for judicial appointments at all except the district court level, why is it not possible to establish a flow chart which is uniform, unchangeable and institutional (not personal) to expedite appointments? The single biggest reason for backlog is unfulfilled vacancies, reaching a peak of 450 out of a total 1,100 high court judges about a year ago (plus a normal 25-33% vacancy amongst the lower judiciary, where appointments fall within the jurisdiction of the respective HCs).

This flow chart must ensure throwing up names at least six months before a SC or HC vacancy. The process must be managed by a senior non-legal, non-judicial managerial officer whose only job is to see that a judicial replacement is known at least a fortnight before the incumbent’s retirement. The flow chart must factor in that there are serious delays and stalemates amongst yourselves, but that can be taken care of by constantly throwing up names at least three times the number of vacancies.

Irrespective of the merits of the appointment, the rigidity of the “pre-retirement fortnight rule” will ensure that your whole team works to a deadline. It will obviate serious hit wickets and self-goals like the apex court committed while adopting a self-defeating standstill policy of non-meeting of collegium and non-appointment of anyone while the NJAC hearing and judgment process was on for almost 18 months.

Fourthly, having reiterated the exclusive jurisdiction of the apex court regarding judicial appointments, you as a judicial collectivity cannot adopt a policy of “prepared to strike afraid to wound”. If there are deliberate and persistent government-related reasons for delay in clearing files, it is time you began to exercise coercive powers reaching upto and including contempt against secretary and even ministerial level functionaries to ensure timely appointments. There can be no dyarchy of appointment power in practice despite a definitive SC judgment asserting exclusivity of the collegium (this comes from a supporter of the NJAC Bill like me; final SC orders must be final in letter and spirit).

Lastly, it is time that the collegium started adopting a uniform marking system for HC and SC elevations, even if it is destroyed immediately after the event. My wish list would be an equal weightage on quality of judgments written, integrity issues and a residual category of all other factors like temperament, experience, etc. The headings, though important, are less important than the fact that they must be uniform and intergenerationally consistent, forcing the various collegiums to have some uniformity of focus.

Ideally, one of your Committee of CJIs or one amongst the collegium should, like the erstwhile Sultan of folklore, sit in the court of potential appointees, disguised and completely anonymous, and report back. Physical reality is often shockingly different from paper reality! Since that will never happen, a group of 10 senior advocates of each court should be informally consulted.

None of this is rocket science. It arises from the experience of each one of us who have spent a lifetime at the Bar. It presupposes a reasonably bona fide attempt to improve the speed and quality of judicial appointments. It does not presuppose an ideal world without “the politics of the judiciary” or the “politics of the political system” but seeks to accommodate those realities. It is a great opportunity for you to start. I have no doubt that you will get full collegiate support. But even if you do not, it’s is always better to try and fail rather than fail to try."
Being Popular In School May Not Lead To Happiness After All!,"You kid in high school might believe popularity is of the utmost importance to them. A new study, however, found that kind of acceptance may not lead to long-term happiness. Close friendships that they maintained over time is what mattered more, according to a study published in the journal Child Development.

So, if you're worried about your son or daughter being too friendly with his or her mates, take heart. Having strong and intimate friendships during adolescence may help improve several aspects of mental health such as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression, researchers say.

""Our research found that the quality of friendships during adolescence may directly predict aspects of long-term mental and emotional health,"" said lead author Rachel K. Narr, PhD candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Virginia.

""High school students with higher-quality best friendships tended to improve in several aspects of mental health over time, while teens who were popular among their peers during high school may be more prone to social anxiety later in life,"" Narr added.

BCCL/Representational Image

The study looked at a community sample of 169 adolescents over 10 years, from the time they were age 15 to when they were 25.

The youth were racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, with 58 per cent Caucasian, 29 per cent African American and eight per cent of mixed race or ethnicity.

Adolescents were assessed annually, answering questions about who their closest friends were, reporting on their friendships and participating in interviews and assessments exploring such feelings as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression.

Researchers found that teens who prioritised close friendships at age 15 had lower social anxiety, an increased sense of self-worth and fewer symptoms of depression by the time they reached age 25 than their peers.

Neither having a strong friendship nor being more popular predicted short-term changes in mental health, the researchers noted.

The researchers suggested that this may be because positive experiences with friends help bolster positive feelings about oneself during a stage of life when personal identity is being developed.

Also, close friendships may set adolescents on a trajectory to expect and therefore encourage supportive experiences in the future."
"Diagnostics, Latest Diagnostics News, Health News","LSDs are disorders caused due to some enzymes deficiencies in the body which are genetically determined and most of them are autosomal recessive. Some of them may be comparatively more commonly seen and some of them may be extremely rare and hence, their diagnosis is very challenging. Lack of awareness about these disorders their mimicking symptoms and lack of diagnostic facilities are some of the major challenges faced."
"The diagnosis of Lysosomal Storage Disorders is challenging: Dr. Madhulika Kabra, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,Additional Prof.& Officer-In-Charge, Genetics Unit, Dept of Pediatrics,, New Delhi, talks about the rare disease scenario in India. Edited excerpts:Different countries define rare disease differently. There is no uniform definition, it is based on their resources and whatever epidemiological data is existing in that particular country. There is no global definition but WHO defines rare diseases as an incidence of about 1 in 10,000, which translates to about 1 in 2500. India doesn’t have any data basically on rare diseases to define it. So, it’s important to have a definition because based on that many things can be guided like policy and things like that. So, WHO defines 1 in 10,000 but different countries have highly variable definitions. Some countries have 1 in 2000, somebody has 1 in 1 lakh so it is highly variable.World over almost 7 thousand rare diseases have been described. There are huge numbers of rare diseases if you go to the websites and it is very difficult to even list all of them. But then some of which are seen in clinical practice not only in tertiary care centers but also in specialized centers like pediatric, neurology and hematological practice include some of the inborn errors of metabolism which include Lysosomal Storage Disorders and some small molecule disorders like phenylketonuria, galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease. These are all clubbed under inborn errors of metabolism. Then there are various blood related disorders which are also there in rare diseases. You have immune disorder diseases like fever combined immunodeficiency or hypogammaglobulinemia and things like that. Then you have disorders of skeleton like skeletal dysplasia where the bones are not properly formed, neuromuscular disorder, muscular dystrophies and spinal muscular dystrophies and then you have cystic fibrosis which is again a disease which was thought not to be existing in India but we do see a good number of cases. So, there are a whole lot of them but these are some of them which we do see in the clinical practice and many more in a tertiary care setup or a referral setup.The prevalence of various rare disorders is available from certain countries, where they have demographic data available, community based or hospital based, but we do not have any such data available from India. But then based on some hospital based data we do know that the disorders which I have just talked about are being seen in tertiary care centers at least by many of the specialists in India. So, we do not have a data which is available from India based on a systematic screening, that’s for one. Some data may be coming up now because we have some new born screening data available based on some of the projects which have just finished like government funded project. So, to quote Indian data it is as of now not available but there are some of the initiatives which have recently been taken up by the Indian Council of Medical Research and they are coming up with the initiative of rare disease registry, choosing some of the disorders to begin with and hospital based registries as of now. So that’s an initiative which is very recent.In rare diseases, the numbers are huge, that is one. Some of them may be comparatively more commonly seen and some of them may be extremely rare which one may see once in a lifetime or not even see once in a lifetime and then some of the disorders which are seen in the clinical practice, the diagnosis may be missed for few reasons. One could be that the awareness is not there and nobody is to blame for that because these are rarer disorders and in the periphery these patients might not reach or just reach the tertiary care centers where the diagnostic facilities are available. So, one is awareness. Second thing is that they are mimickers, some of the relatively common rare diseases are mimickers. They may mimic some of the other common disorders which are seen in clinical practice.Once the patient comes, you are always thinking of a commoner diagnosis first, will not shoot to the rare diagnosis immediately. So, they may be missed initially and later on one may think that this maybe a particular rare disorder. The third thing is that even if the diagnosis is thought of or is kept as a differential diagnosis the facilities for diagnosis may not be available everywhere. Though in the last few years these facilities have really improved and many labs are offering these facilities. The ease of transportation of samples is also there. Now it has definitely improved but these are the challenges because of the lack of awareness and diagnostic facilities.Is there a need for improving the diagnostic facilities? What are the steps that can be taken for timely diagnosis?If you are specifically talking about Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) which are relatively common and seen in clinical practice, one is they are mimickers, so the clinicians who are likely to see these disorders should know that when they should think of LSDs, like which are the conditions which mimic LSDs, and we should exclude LSDs in what situations. So, that includes medical education and that’s really going on in a big way and which is probably the reason that the diagnostic capabilities have really improved over time and then diagnostic facilities. Though they are available in some government, private setups but these are limited to bigger cities. These are not available sort of everywhere. So, there is a need to have improvement on this, more labs should be available and the existing labs should be strengthened also.There is a plethora of Lysosomal Storage Disorders. So as of now treatment is available for 7 of them, just to understand what are Lysosomal Storage Disorders, these are the disorders which are due to some enzymes deficiencies in the body which are genetically determined. So these are inherited disorders and most of them are autosomal recessive which means that both the parents are carriers and there is a 25% chance that the baby will have the disease and the problem is with the enzyme which metabolizes certain substrates in the cells, certain waste products in the cells, so once these enzymes are deficient, these waste products get accumulated in the cells, and then because these are multisystem disorders, different parts of the body get affected and because of that various manifestations are there.In therapy, first is the Enzyme Replacement Therapy which is available for 7 of these disorders as of now. This intravenous therapy is to be given but the cost of the enzyme is very high as of now. For few disorders, some oral therapy is also available which is also very exorbitant and if you talk of the enzyme replacement therapy the main disadvantage of this therapy is that the enzyme does not reach the brain and does not affect the involvement of joint and heart if it is involved in some of the Lysosomal Storage Disorders that much.Enzyme replacement if started late and when the brain is already involved you cannot revert that back. Some of the drugs have the advantage that they can cross the blood brain barriers and brain involvement can also be prevented to some extent. These are two modes of therapy which are available. Another mode of therapy is Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. So, before Enzyme Replacement Therapy was available for these disorders, the main stay of therapy was Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation but there are various disadvantages of that and various problems in that because we need to have a match donor and there can be lots of morbidities because of stem cell transplantation because the immune system of the individual who is the recipient has to be suppressed to see the bone marrow and there can be complications. The effect of Enzyme Replacement Therapy particularly for some diseases like Gaucher disease is much better than the Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation but that still remains an option for disorders for which the patient is unable to get the therapy and also for disorders where Enzyme Replacement Therapy is not available as of now, but then limited experience is available worldwide. Not many centers are routinely offering this. So, about the Enzyme Replacement Therapy there are 7 disorders for which it is available and the experience is most for Gaucher’s disease. The treatment is most rewarding as of now for Gaucher disease."

Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."

"Kuwait: Kuwait says oil spill contained, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Sylvia Westall



DUBAI - Kuwait's state oil company said on Tuesday that an oil spill off the country's coast had been contained and that it was in contact with oil companies operating in the Gulf region to try to locate the source of the leak, state news agency KUNA said.

Kuwait Petroleum Corporation said large amounts of the leaked oil had been removed and the rest contained during around-the-clock emergency operations that include air and sea monitoring.

At least two spillages have hit different areas off the coast of the Gulf Arab state since last week.

Kuwait reported a spill on Friday in the Ras al-Zour area near the southern border with Saudi Arabia and on Tuesday at Abu Fatira, about 15 miles (25 km) south of the capital Kuwait City. Authorities have not said what caused the spills.

The size of the first spill was not given last week. Kuwait said on Tuesday the second spill spanned one nautical mile.

Kuwait's oil minister said on Monday that neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran had said they had not detected any oil spillage in their waters.

The minister also said on Monday that electricity and water production had continued at full capacity at the Al-Zour North and Al-Zour South plants.

Ras al-Zour is where Kuwait National Petroleum Co is building the Middle East's largest oil refinery, with a processing capacity of 615,000 barrels per day and $11.5 billion worth of contracts."

"HC threatens to launch probe into working of pharma council, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Chandigarh: Perturbed over unusual delay in granting permissions to run pharmacy courses in private institutes, the Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the chairperson of the Pharmacy Council of India to explain why a probe into its affairs by an independent agency should not be ordered.A division bench headed by Justice Surya Kant passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by private institutes seeking direction to permit them to admit students in diploma of pharmacy (DPharma) against their sanctioned intake for the 2017-18 academic session.The Haryana State Board of Technical Education (HSBTE) had denied affiliation to these institutes on the grounds that the last date to submit approval from the Pharmacy Council of India was May 15 but the approval was granted by the council on June 15-16.During the hearing in the case, it came to fore that the council had received the application for approval from August to October 2016 and sat over it till June 2017, when the final approval was granted.Upset over the delay, the bench observed that there was annual vicious circle, forcing the private institutes to approach the high court due to delayed action of one or the other statutory authority.“It appears that the delay at the hands of the council is not for a routine cause. There is something more than what appears on record. There is no explanation as to why the requests received from the institutes were kept pending for almost eight months and suddenly the entire process was concluded within one and a half month. The chairperson of the Pharmacy Council of India shall explain as to why a probe into its affairs by an independent agency be not ordered,” observed the court.The bench also directed HSBTE to apprise the court how it had decided to grant approval to some private institutes and deny the same to others.“Let the Haryana State Board of Technical Education file a comprehensive affidavit in this regard. The All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) is also directed to explain as to why it compels the institutes to apply for its consent/approval on yearly basis,” ordered the court while adjourning the case to October 12."

"Indian Railways: Indian Railways signs first EPC contract to speed up electrification, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: With the aim of boosting its ‘ Mission Electrification ’ plan, Indian Railways signed its first Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with L&T for large electrification projects on Friday. The contract valuing Rs 1,050 crore for electrification of 781 route kilometres (RKM) was awarded by Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE) and Konkan Railways.“For faster execution of Railway Electrification projects, Indian Railways has changed from Business as usual (BAU) approach and entrusted new electrification works not only to Railway PSUs like Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) and Rail India Techno Economic Service (RITES) but also to Power Grid Corporation India Limited (PGCIL),” the ministry of railways said in a statement.The contract was awarded for electrification of Delhi Sarai Rohilla – Rewari and Alwr – Bandikui – Jaipur – Phulera – Ajmer (353 rkm) section at a cost of Rs 594 crore and Roha – Verna (428 rkm) of Konkan Railway at a cost of Rs. 456 crore. Also, eight agreements were also exchanged between Zonal Railways and Public Sector Undertakings for 1,735 rkm of electrification projects valuing Rs 1,746 crore.This comes on the heels of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) stating in its audit report on ‘Electrification Projects in Indian Railways’ that the Indian Railways lost savings to the tune of Rs 3,006 crore on account of delays in execution 21 railways electrification projects out of 29 projects which were examined.Under ‘Mission Electrification’, ten different electrification projects covering 2,516 rkm at a cost of about Rs. 2,797 crore have been finalized in a short duration, the statement added. “It is a very important milestone for us. We had also announced in the rail budget that we will increase the pace of electrification. Around 42 per cent of electrification will be doubled in the next 5 years. Rs 16,500 crore of track doubling has also been sanctioned which will be electrified after getting commissioned,” rail minister Suresh Prabhu said at the signing.Prabhu also said the national carrier is also in the process of procuring electric locomotives from GE and Alstom , adding that the manufacturing of the locomotives will begin within a few months. He also stated that electrification has been given a higher thrust during the last four years as a total of 103 electrification projects were sanctioned.“We are also introducing 40,000 retrofitted and modernised coaches. Railways is constantly reforming itself by taking various initiatives in energy sector. With rolling stock getting modernised, lines getting electrified and guage conversion you can imagine the huge impact it will have on the whole Indian Railways network,” he added.The national carrier aims to reduce its total energy bill by over Rs 4,000 crore per annum through rapid electrification. At present, only 42 percent of the total Indian Railways network is electrified. The rail ministry plans to increase its electrified network to 52,400 rkm by 2021. On completion of 90 percent of railway electrification, the national carrier expects its total energy bill to come down to Rs 16,000 crore as against Rs 26,500 crore at present."

"BJP to launch state-wide campaign on mining scam in Odisha, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Bhubaneswar: The opposition BJP has accused the BJD government in Odisha of failing in all fronts and protecting interest of mine owners allegedly involved in the mining scam.

The BJP has decided to make the mining scam an issue and launch a state-wide campaign over the state government's alleged protection to the mines owners.

A resolution in this regard was passed at the BJP's two-day state executive meeting here presided over by party's state president Basant Panda, a party statement said.

The meeting attended by four union ministers -- Prakash Javadekar, Narendra Singh Tomar, Jual Oram and Dharmendra Pradhan -- also resolved on 12 other issues.

The party alleged that Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's ""fake clean image"" has been exposed by the mining scam and his election expenditure affidavits.

Alleging that the state government has failed to resolve the Mahanadi issue, the BJP said that the BJD government during its 17 years tenure has not taken any step to store water in the downstream of the river.

The opposition party said that the health, education, employment and power generation have suffered a lot during the BJD government and corruption is rampant.

The BJP also criticised the state government for not implementing recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for Odisha government employees, the statement said.

The party also thanked Union Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan for resolving the tax dispute between the state government and the Indian Oil Corporation Limited. ""The state government will benefit by Rs 1500 crore per annum due to Pradhan's cleaver handing of the issue,"" the resolution said.

It also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government for providing funds for the overall development of the state."
"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.“The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,” Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. “The only solution is our focus on improving execution.“India’s biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers’ pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma’s Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India’s pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun’s consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun’s profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun’s U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG’s blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.“Going forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters” as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. “The U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.”As prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company’s leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."
Battle over quit India: Modi boisterously appropriates what Congress believes to be its family heirloom,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been thinking on his feet, as it were, on the issue of hitching his party to the bandwagon of freedom struggle. He is celebrating, with all the fervour that he can muster, the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement of 1942, the 70th anniversary of India’s independence, and he is planning grand celebrations for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 and the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022.

It has become clear by now that Modi believes hugely in atmospherics. The main opposition party, Congress, feels left out and more than a little peeved by the PM’s boisterous appropriation of the freedom struggle, which the grand old party of India believes to be its family heirloom.

Congress leaders have always been contemptuous of the Hindu right-wing and they have forever taunted their ideological adversaries for having never taken part in the freedom struggle. Of course, the charge is unfair in historical terms. There were many who did not believe in the politics of agitation popularised by Mahatma Gandhi from 1920 onwards which placed the Congress party in the lead position, but who had been looking at other ways of gaining independence from British suzerainty.

The Muslim League was never part of the agitational approach of Gandhi’s Congress, and neither were many other sections like the Zamindars, the Unionist Party in Punjab, the Justice Party in the Madras presidency and the Krishak Samaj Party in Bengal. One of the prominent leaders who did not accept Gandhi’s extra-constitutional approach was BR Ambedkar.

So, if the case is to be argued as to whether people who did not court prison and raise anti-British slogans did not fight for freedom from the British, then it would be an argument that would be difficult to sustain. There were different political groups and each dealt with the British keeping in mind what they believed to be their own interests. There is little doubt that Congress had a broader viewpoint than all the others put together. It claimed to speak for the whole country, for all the groups and all the regions. The others contested the Congress claim to be representing all.

This was specially so in the case of Muslim League. The Hindu right-wingers were indeed in a quandary because they could not say that Congress did not represent the Hindu majority. As a matter of fact, the League dubbed the Congress as the party of the Hindus. There was no room in the arena for other Hindu sectional interests. Hindu Mahasabha leaders like MR Jayakar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya continued to exert influence in Congress. In a way, communal Hindu elements found a voice within Congress. Nehru and others were aware of this and greatly resented their presence.

Modi has turned the argument over whether one participated in the freedom struggle on its head by asserting that present day India ruled by BJP derives inspiration from the 1942 Quit India Movement to transform India. In contrast, all that Congress president Sonia Gandhi could bring herself to say was that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had moved the Quit India resolution on August 9, 1942. Sonia was clutching a twig of history, while Modi took upon himself the burden of carrying the spirit of Quit India Movement, at least by way of rhetoric, to transform India of today.

Congress has now been reduced to a party which clings to memories of the past, invoking its heroism of long ago to seek solace in its bleak present and infuriated by the Modi strategy of appropriating the heritage of the freedom movement for BJP with much panache. It can be said that Modi’s words and gestures sound hollow because he does not really believe in the Gandhian morality of loving the adversary. And most importantly, he is not able to come to terms with Gandhi’s proclaimed political heir, Nehru.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no hesitation in looking up to the Nehruvian legacy because Vajpayee had greater self-confidence than Modi does. The prime minister’s belligerence in what he says and what he does not say betrays a brittle sense of his own self. But he is moving in the right direction by acknowledging loudly and clearly events like the Quit India Movement which was essentially a Congress ploy.

It can be seen in retrospect that the Quit India Movement was a historical blunder because the Muslim League and others became stronger between 1942 and 1945. Many Congress leaders, including Nehru, were not comfortable with Gandhi’s decision. Though it was a tactical blunder, Gandhi was right in going ahead with it because all the Congress leaders were imprisoned, and when they came out of prison at the end of the war, they were burnished heroes who had paid the price for refusing to go with the British war effort.

But no Congress leader of the day ever showed any resentment towards the bureaucracy, towards the Indian armed forces who participated in World War II, nor with the industrialists and many others from different walks of life who were not in the Quit India Movement. Congress in 1945 carried everyone else with it. Modi seems to be trying to appropriate the legacy of the freedom struggle with barely a nod towards Congress. Congress’s anger is palpable."
Here’s A Bacteria That Could Potentially Boost Athletic Performance!,"Been trying to boost your athletic performance but don't know how? Scientists have recently identified a bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of runners and rowers that may aid in improving your athletic performance. The bacteria is set to be used to develop probiotic applications that aid in performance and recovery.

Twitter/Representational Image

The results showed that the bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of the athletes may help develop probiotic supplements that could help them, and even amateur fitness enthusiasts, recover from a tough workout or more efficiently convert nutrients to energy.

""We are more bacteria than we are human. The bugs in our gut affect our energy metabolism, making it easier to breakdown carbohydrates, protein and fibre,"" said Jonathan Scheiman, a post-doctoral student at Harvard Medical School.

""They are also involved in inflammation and neurological functions. So perhaps the microbiome could be relevant for applications in endurance, recovery and maybe even mental toughness,"" Scheiman added.

For the study, presented at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, the team collected fecal samples on a daily basis from 20 athletes training for the 2015 Boston Marathon, to capture how the microbiome changes between performance and recovery.

When they compared the pre-race and post-race samples, the researchers found a sudden spike in the population of one particular type of bacteria after the marathon.

""This bug's natural function is to breakdown lactic acid,"" Scheiman said.

During intense exercise, the body produces more lactic acid than usual, which can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. This bacteria could potentially help with that.

The researchers are now feeding the bacteria to mice to measure its effects on lactic acid levels and fatigue.

Twitter/Representational Image

In another experiment, the researchers compared the bacteria from ultra-marathoners to those found in rowers training for the Olympics.

They found a type of bacteria in ultra-marathoners that can help breakdown carbohydrates and fibre—which is key during a 100-mile run—that was not present in the rowers, suggesting that different sports may foster niche microbiomes.

"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don’t want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don’t interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that’s the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors’ well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."

"vaccine research: ICMR partners with IVI, invests Rs 3.20 crore for vaccine development in India, Health News, ET HealthWorld","IVI may also facilitate further global testing of vaccine candidates developed in Indian labs by linking developers here with global partners.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) has entered into an agreement to collaborate on vaccine research and development with international vaccine development organisation International Vaccine Institute (IVI). Through this partnership, India will commit $5,00,000 (Rs 3.20 crore) annually for a stake in IVI—an amount approved during a cabinet meeting in January.Under its latest Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), ICMR will be focussed on research and development of vaccines combatting various infectious diseases “This partnership will help us better address the vaccine needs of low- and middle-income groups in the country and ultimately contribute to protecting people from infectious diseases,” said Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.While the government and IVI have not narrowed down which diseases they will develop vaccines for, ICMR Director General Soumya Swaminathan said some disease areas that may be in focus are high-burden diseases.“Depending on the burden of disease, tuberculosis ( TB ) and malaria are both high priority areas. Apart from that, there are diseases with high morbidity like dengue and chikungunya,” Swaminathan told ET. “Influenza, where people are talking about a universal flu vaccine, is another potential area,” she added.India is on the World Health Organisation’s current list of 30 high TB burden countries and in 2015 recorded the highest TB-related deaths—around 60,000—among children under 15 years of age, according to a study published in the Lancet.The country also has a high burden of malaria, recording upwards of 10.90 lakh cases every year since 2014. As of June this year, India has already recorded 3.52 lakh cases, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program’s data.According to NVBDCP, in 2016, India recorded the highest number of cases of dengue (1.29 lakh) and chikungunya fever (64,057) in the last seven years.Under ICMR’s latest partnership, vaccine candidates developed in IVI labs could be brought to India and given to one of the companies here for further development, explained Swaminathan. IVI may also facilitate further global testing of vaccine candidates developed in Indian labs by linking developers here with global partners, she added.The partnership is further expected to help with capacity building for clinical trials within India as well, according to Swaminathan. The MoU is also expected to help support companies like Bharat Biotech, which has completed phase I clinical trials of its chikungunya vaccine and has expressed the need for support in conducting phase II and III trials for the candidate, according to her.India supplies 60% of the world's vaccines for vaccine-preventable diseases and contributes to 60-80% of the United Nation’s annual vaccine purchases, according to Jerome H Kim, Director General, IVI.“We look forward to having India’s representation on the IVI Board of Trustees, which will increase engagement with Indian academia and industry even further,” he said.IVI has partnered with Indian vaccine manufacturers, research institutes, government, and public health agencies on vaccine development, research, and training for over a decade, according to Kim.One such collaboration was with Shantha Biotechnics on the development of ‘Shanchol’, the world’s first low-cost oral cholera vaccine, which was licensed in India in 2009 and WHO-prequalified in 2011. IVI had collaborated with health authorities in Odisha to introduce this vaccine for the first time in India in 2011, according to a press statement."
The Hacker Of GoT Season 7 Episode 4 Leaked It Because He Wanted To Please His Girlfriend!,"It happens only in India?!

The first time it happened with the fourth episode of Game of Thrones, the most hyped and loved American series that the entire episode was leaked online before its official release, and it happened in India.

The leaked episode had Star India’s watermark on it, which means that Hotstar who is HBO’s partner in India for airing the episode was responsible for the leak. Later it turned out that Prime Focus Technologies—the agency which manages Star India Private Limited’s data, is the root of the entire problem. Four people were arrested in the same regard and now one of them has revealed how it got revealed.

What was supposed to be a grave severe affair turned out to be rather funnier and realistic, to say the least.

So, now it has been revealed that one of the IT professionals named Alok Sharma who was under arrest in the same regard had sent the episode to his girlfriend in order to please her, and that is from where it was leaked and later uploaded online.

Twitter

“Initially, there were suspicions that one of the accused had accessed the episode as his girlfriend wanted to see it. The girlfriend had then passed it onto others, one of whom uploaded it online,” revealed an official to Indian Express who was part of the probe earlier.

“The investigation is still in progress. However, so far, it appears that they had leaked it for self-consumption. We are now trying to find out who uploaded it online,” another senior officer added.

According to the report, first Alok had accessed the episode and it is he who shared it with the other four who are also under arrest. Police is trying to find out who uploaded it online.

Meanwhile, hackers responsible for the leak of the sixth episode have warned HBO that the finale episode will also be leaked before the actual air date.

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, put to rest all speculations regarding the World XI tour to Pakistan, confirming on Monday (August 21), a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in Lahore, starting September 10. A 15-member squad led by former Zimbabwe great Andy Flower will take part in a seven-day long camp in Dubai before heading to Lahore for the series. However, the bigger news is Windies is set to tour the cricket-starved nation for a three-match T20I series in Lahore in late November.

Sethi also stated that the three games against World XI will be played across four days, but refused to divulge the dates citing security reasons.

""CWI and PCB are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies play three T20I matches in Lahore in late November,"" read the statement. ""In September, October and November, we'll have the World XI, we'll have Sri Lankan team and then the West Indies (come play in Pakistan).

""We just hope that the security we've promised, we'll keep it up. Sri Lanka have said they'll come after the World XI, provided the security is fine. It will be fine, Punjab government has indicated that the preparation are in full swing. At the end of this month, ICC's security team is also arriving. So far all signals are good,"" Sethi added. He also stated that talks with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were still on over the number of games to be played.

While the Punjab Government approved 'Presidential level security' for the week-long World XI series in Lahore, Sethi expressed his desire to host a few games in the other cities too, notably Karachi. ""I have the desire to take some games out of Lahore and host them in Karachi, but everyone I speak to reject that idea. They tell me that we've succeeded in hosting something well in Lahore (PSL 2 final) so keep that going. First host the PSL in Karachi, then we will come there.""

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

""This is my objective. I had given myself a mission statement - to organise PSL, to bring it to Pakistan, to bring international cricket to Pakistan. Game development needs to be done, fund raising needs to be done - and all that we're going to do slowly. And I also want to try to professionalise PCB,"" Sethi said.

"Cancer hospitals: Healthcare Global to set up 12 new hospitals in 18 months, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Healthcare Global Enterprises (HCG), a Bengaluru-based chain of specialised cancer care centres, plans to set up a dozen new hospitals over the next 18 months, the publicly traded company’s chairman, BS Ajai Kumar, said.HCG plans to expand its network of cancer care centres to about 30 from 21 now, and will add a few more IVF clinics to its existing network, Kumar told ET.HCG has a partnership with Kamini Rao, a leading medical practitioner in the field of assisted reproduction, to run IVF clinics under the brand name ‘Milann’.The IVF clinics contributed about a tenth of HCG’s revenues of Rs 700 crore for the previous financial year.Founded 27 years ago by Kumar, a doctor trained at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, the hospital chain has expanded to include centres in cities such as Cuttack, Ahmedabad and Vijayawada.It recently acquired a facility in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, and is scouting for more facilities in Africa and the Middle East.Kumar, 66, who returned to India after practicing as a medical and radiation oncologist for nearly two decades in the US, said HCG’s model-—what he described as ‘value based medicine’— has been chosen as a case study by the Harvard Business Review and the World Bank, as the hospital chain has been able to drive down the cost of cancer treatment to almost a tenth of global prices in some cases while achieving the same outcomes.The hospital chain has a stated policy of not to invest in land and takes up facilities on lease rental model from owners. In certain cases, it also enters into partnerships with doctors who own the land and building.A 60-bed facility could cost as much as Rs 35-40 crore to build, not including real estate costs, according to Kumar.HCG raised Rs 650 crore through an initial public offering of shares in March last year. International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, and Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec were among investors that subscribed to shares in the offering.The family office of Wipro founder Azim Premji and Singapore state investor Temasek divested partial stakes in the IPO but continue to remain prominent investors in the company."
"diabetes: New diabetes drug reduces blood glucose by pushing it to urine: Dr Alvin C Powers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi:, President of, was recently in India to co-inaugurate ‘ International Diabetes Update ’ 2017, which highlighted many advances in diabetes therapy and how to use these advances to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."
Donald Trump’s realism and implications for India,"By: Sanjay Pulipaka

The United States President Donald Trump, on Monday,delivered a nuanced speech outlining the new Afghanistan strategy. He did not deviate from the prepared text, and the speech received considerable appreciation from within and outside the United States. While President Trump’s speech focused mostly on the United States (US) policy towards Afghanistan, it also briefly reflected on the domestic politics as well.

After 17 years of military engagement, fatigue has come to characterise the US policy towards Afghanistan. The necessity of the withdrawal defines the public discourse on Afghanistan in the United States. Contrary to his initial impulse, President Trump has stated that victory in Afghanistan is possible and constitutes an “outcome worthy of tremendous sacrifices that have been made.” He also alluded to the possibility that a rapid withdrawal may create a vacuum which will be filled only by the ISIS and Al Qaeda.

In 2009, former President Obama announced deployment 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan and simultaneously enunciated a timetable for the withdrawal commencing from the middle of 2011. This surge-and-withdrawal approach did not yield results,as the Taliban instead of launching offensives merely waited for the draw-down of American forces. Contrary to Obama’s approach, President Trump’s Afghan strategy refrained from clearly specifying the troop levels or defining the timetable. Instead, he stated that the US military posture in Afghanistan will evolve constantly based on ground conditions and the commanders would have greater freedom in terms of deploying various resources.

It appears that the current senior White House staffs, who were involved in the drafting the new strategy, are serious students of noted realist thinker Hans J Morgenthau. The resonance of Morgenthau views was evident when President Trump stated:“we must address the reality of the world as it exists right now.” By repeatedly asserting that the US should be guided by ‘security interests’ and not normative concerns, President Trump declared his preference for a realist framework over a liberal approach. This implies that agenda such as the promotion of democracy and protection of human rights will take a back seat. While the focus on “killing terrorists” is an important objective, Trump’s Afghan strategy seems to be neglecting the need to recognise and contest the political structures and ideological processes that are creating and validating terrorism.

President Trump was sharply critical of Pakistan’s tactic of taking assistance from the US to fight terrorism and providing a haven for terror groups such as the Taliban. While President Trump has called on Pakistan to demonstrate its genuine commitment to combat terrorism, one wonders as to how the US will respond if Pakistan fails to comply. With significant improvement in the bilateral relationship with China, Pakistan will demonstrate considerable reluctance to change the course.Not surprisingly, in less than 24 hours, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson came out in support of Pakistan and pointed out that sacrifices made by Pakistan in fighting terrorism should be recognized.

India will feel vindicated that Pakistan has been recognised for its duplicity in promoting terrorism and simultaneously claimingto be its victim. However, there will be concerns in India on equating the rest of South Asia with developments in the Af-Pak region. Terrorism emanating from the Af-Pak region has its own dynamic, and there is no need to expand the definition of the problem area to the rest of South Asia.

President Trump referred to India’s tireless efforts in Afghanistan and called on India to play a more proactive role in Afghanistan. However, he went on to add that “India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan.” This is the second time that President Trump has deployed the phrase ‘billions of dollars’ referring to India, which conveys an impression of disproportionate and an unfair gain. Earlier, he used a similar phrase while announcing the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

India will also have to carefully examine if Trump is deploying a ‘good terrorist’ and a ‘bad terrorist’ distinction. President Trump stated his objectives are obliterating the ISIS and crushing Al Qaeda. However, concerning Taliban, his goal is to prevent it from taking over Afghanistan. Further, he added that it is “possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban” in Afghanistan. Terrorism is a consequence of regressive social and political ideas propounded by groups such as Taliban. Therefore, incorporating elements of Taliban in the Afghan government and its implications for regional security needs to be mapped out.

Friends, such as India, and allies would have taken note that President Trump started his major foreign policy speech by referring to domestic politics in the US. He reiterated the necessity of transcending race, ethnicity, creed and colour to build a unified country. In a telling statement, he noted: “The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home.” It is clear that President Trump was responding to the events in Charlottesville and his statements, which elicited a sharp response from across the political spectrum in the US. While analysts will dissect the metaphor of “war” to describe domestic politics, it should be noted that President Trump seems to have made an honest admission of the deep political divide that America needs to transcend. Friends and foes of the US will assess as to whether the current US administration has theenergy to respond to an intense domestic crisis and also pursue robust external posture. Further, the sustainability of the new Afghan strategy, based on principles of realism, will also be contingent on stemming the high attrition rate in the White House.

Lamborghini's Ultra Luxury Android Smartphone Is Worth Far Less Than Its Rs 1.57 Lakh Price Tag,"There are a lot of people who prefer the iPhone for its UI, or its premium look and feel, but there are some for whom it’s just a status symbol. Buying expensive sub-Rs 1 lakh phones is one thing, but what do you call someone who buys a smartphone at the price of a small car?

Behold with thine eyes, the face of stupid purchases.

Insane. The word you’re looking for is insane. But, apparently, some brands don’t think the same way.

Lamborghini has just launched a premium Android smartphone they’re calling the Alpha-One. Billed as the “perfect fusion of Italian design and the most luxurious technology”, it’s an exercise in excess, except where it matters.

The smartphone features a 5.5-inch QHD (1440x2560) display with a 20MP rear camera and a 8MP front camera. It packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB internal storage, expandable up to 128 GB. The device also has a fingerprint scanner, dual SIM support, and runs Android Nougat.

And that’s it...

Yes, for the same kind of hardware you could purchase at a significantly cheaper price, Lamborghini is selling the Alpha-One for $2,4,50 (approximately Rs 1,57,100). Pretty much all you’re paying for is the leather casing and the Lamborghini brand, stamped front and center at the bottom of the panel. But if you’re rich enough (and willing to throw your money away), the device is available starting today in the UK and UAE."
Why Siddaramaiah’s googly on Lingayats has put Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on a sticky wicket,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah’s combination of cultural nationalism and realpolitik has resulted in a disunited opposition at the national level. BJP seems to be on a new high after having tamed Bihar and Tamil Nadu to some extent. Yet there is one regional leader who has managed to keep the BJP’s nationalism at bay – Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.

Last Saturday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had exhorted the Lingayat and Veerashaiva community to set aside their differences and stay united in Karnataka. Lingayats form nearly 17% of the state’s electorate and have been BJP’s core vote-bank led by former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa. This should have had a sobering and uniting effect on both communities as per the prevailing mood at the national level. But Siddaramaiah’s Karnataka seems to defy the narrative much to the ire of BJP’s top brass.

Lakhs attend Lingayat rally, push for religion status https://t.co/u6u1AkGHta — TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) August 23, 2017

Bhagwat’s call to unite resulted in over 100 representatives of Lingayat mutts organising a huge rally attended by over a lakh people in Belagavi this Tuesday. The RSS chief bore the major brunt of the attack for his statement at the rally where BJP leaders including Yeddyurappa were conspicuous by their absence. Leader after leader appealed that the community should not adhere to any political party, instead follow the teachings of the 12th century saint Basaveshwara, the founder of Lingayat community.

Now, memo exposes B S Yeddyurappa's doublespeak on Lingayats https://t.co/5Kfaj5xbFG via @TOIBengaluru pic.twitter.com/y7wh6IpXrn — Times of India (@timesofindia) July 29, 2017

Assembly elections are due in 2018 in the only major state in south where Congress is in power and BJP is keen to regain it. But Siddaramaiah has other plans. He has tactfully supported the demand for Lingayat to be given the status of an independent religion and asked some of his ministers to gauge the mood of the community on this issue. This has put Yeddyurappa and BJP in a catch-22 situation: if they support the demand, then it will put pressure on PM Modi to take a call; and if they don’t, BJP runs the risk of alienating the community which has been the bedrock of their politics in the state.

As Congress eyes Lingayats, Amit Shah reaches out to Vokkaliga bloc https://t.co/uXG1d9dA6k — TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) August 14, 2017

Little wonder that Shah has termed this demand as Siddaramaiah’s divide and rule policy in the run up to the assembly elections."
The Best Way Out,"Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape, the problems will continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life, says MARGUERITE THEOPHIL



Sometimes, it feels easier to avoid a problem or challenge — or even an opportunity that has no guaranteed positive outcome. You distract yourself, make excuses, procrastinate; do anything but enter the situation. There are times when this is simply self-preservation; nothing too wrong there — but often it keeps you from entering a space that will help you learn and grow or keeps you stuck in a place that diminishes you. Sometimes,though,you are thrown into just such a situation, ready or not. You struggle, going through most stages of what is called the ‘grief cycle’, an extended form of this being the stages of shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression — but you stop short of the last two: testing (of realistic options and solutions) and acceptance. This is because often acceptance does not mean the end of things; it is the beginning of moving into spaces, into decisions, into unfamiliar ways of being you would rather not move into. Such an attitude and the corresponding behaviours are often referred to as escapism. Escapism is when you try to avoid something. Some escape by excessive sleeping, shopping, eating, playing or inordinate time spent online. Some drown themselves in work; or alcohol or drugs. We all know people who stay in jobs or abusive marriages only because they are afraid of failure in pursuing what they love, or because they are not sure if there is another better someone elsewhere.People who avoid challenges because they are afraid of possible pain and suffering; who avoid healing their past because they are reminded of their deepest sorrows;who avoid confronting issues because they think they have no strength to face them.



‘Better the devil we know…’ they say sadly. Rather than ease your pain and suffering, this attitude prolongs and sometimes deepens them. At times people think the solution is to bury them or numb themselves to their effects — but the issue and its effects just stay dormant, silently growing until the day it will all resurface. Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape from, your issues will not miraculously disappear.They continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life — getting stuck again and again in similar situations and contexts, thinking the same things,feeling the same emotions,doing the same things, linking up with similar people. Looping patterns require conscious intervention in order to break out of them.And the best and most wise advice for these times — though not that easy to follow — is:‘The best way out is through.’ An old teaching story comes to mind: Once upon a time, there was a tortoise on a ship, and the ship sank in the middle of the ocean.The tortoise made it to a bit of land surrounded by water on all sides except for one. The strip of barren land led up to a high, steep, craggy mountain. To avoid starving to death, the tortoise decided to climb to the top,hoping that he would be able to cross, and find something to eat on the other side. You would know this would take a long, long time; not only was the terrain daunting — this is a tortoise we are talking about! When he finally got to the snow-covered summit he was freezing cold, and then a blizzard started.



He just managed to make out a narrow pathway leading down the other side of the mountain and made his way towards it. But ahead on the path was a big monster that wouldn’t stop shouting, ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ This sound and his fear almost killed the tortoise; all he wanted to do was hide his head inside his shell. But, looking around him, he noticed many other animals of all sizes lying there, frozen to death. He summoned up all his courage to move down the path towards the monster.The closer the tortoise got, the more the monster changed its shape. Then, when he was almost upon it, the tortoise realised that what he had thought was a monster, was only a great pile of rocks, what he thought were dead frozen animals were other smaller rocks. As for the ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ — the tortoise realised this was just the sound of the wind blowing through a small cave. He made his slow but determined way to the greenery that he could see ahead. Remember, in the process of working through your issues, you don’t always win quickly. Sometimes you may make some progress, only to slide back later.



Sometimes, you get beaten back down almost immediately, particularly if it involves dealing with something you have been struggling with for a long time. Don’t be afraid of asking for help or guidance; admitting you need help does not make you weak, it makes you strong.You might need help and support of others, professionals or loved ones, to ‘hang in there’, but ultimately, it is your journey. Yet being convinced that the best way out is through, you find out that as long as you keep going, as long as you keep confronting your issues, as long as you keep fighting, as long as you confront your fears, as long as you know that the way out lies through and beyond all this — you become stronger and stronger, and find a way to conquer the mess.

"Tougher foreign investment norms for pharma companies likely, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: In a move to protect the Indian drug manufacturing sector, the government is contemplating tougher foreign investment norms for multinational firms to acquire existing pharmaceutical facilities in India The new draft pharma policy lists out a range of measures such as continuation of manufacturing of essential medicines, expenditure on R&D and technology transfer to seek approval for foreign direct investment (FDI).This assumes significance as it comes after the government in June 2016 allowed up to 74% FDI in brownfield projects through automatic route, with an aim to promote investment in the sector.""At present there is no mechanism or system to monitor the post-acquisition (FDI) activities of the company. A system would be developed to monitor the adherence to these conditions,"" the new draft policy says.The draft highlights how many neighbouring countries like Vietnam , South Korea, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are emerging as generic drug manufacturers and posing competition to India. India, which is known for its ability to supply low priced quality generic medicines, is witnessing a decline in its compounded annual rate of growth in the pharmaceutical industry. It has seen a decline from 14.36% in 2010-11 to 8.68% in 2014-15. This is significant also because pharmaceutical industry is the third largest export revenue churner for India.""The competitive advantage is being undermined through another route - the acquisition of Indian companies by foreign companies. Countries that are traditionally not strong in manufacturing formulations have started acquiring formulation-manufacturing plants/companies through automatic and government approval route,"" the draft policy document says.Officials say since manufacturing in India is cheaper and most of the facilities have state-of-the-art infrastructure, foreign firms acquire these units and then stop manufacturing drugs for use in India."
11 Corrective Measures India Can Adopt To Make Its Trains Safer For Passengers,"After two train accidents in a span of just five days, India's Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu has offered to resign. He took ""full moral responsibility"" on Twitter for the mishaps after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has asked him to 'wait'.

Nearly 20 people lost their lives and over 200 were injured on Saturday when 13 coaches of the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express derailed in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district.

ap

Today, 10 coaches of Kaifiyat Express en route New Delhi derailed after it collided with a dumper in Uttar Pradesh near the district of Auraiya. Over 70 people were injured in the accident.

Taking these accidents into account, and several others that have occurred in the past, we look at 11 steps that can help Indian Railways in making its trains safer for passengers.

1. Railways tracks

India needs more railway tracks that frees up line capacity, mitigating the traffic on existing routes. The chances of collision will automatically be reduced if the existing traffic is diffused to other lines. Adding more tracks will also boost the speed of the trains.

bccl

2. Hiring more workers

Unmanned level crossings is a major concern in India. Hiring more workers would ensure the safety of such crossings where human population intersects with that of a travelling train. Since India is home to hundreds of such crossings, having flagmen and safety personnel stationed here would definitely aid in reducing the number of mishaps.

3. Positive train control

Positive train control is a technology that leverages the use of GPS, Wi-Fi, and radio signals to foresee something on the track ahead. The technology can help prevent accidents by bringing a train to a halt before it gets into trouble. So if an engineer fails to stop at a signal or if the train is moving too fast, with positive train control the brakes can be pushed to stop the train from derailing or hitting another.

bccl

4. Regular check-ups

Accidents don't always happen due to human error; sometimes the fault is in the tracks or the locomotive itself. This is where check-ups play an important role in figuring out the wear and tear. Rail equipment should also always be tuned-up to prevent accidents.

5. Crumple zones

When a car gets into an accident, its hood is designed so that it crumples up and absorbs maximum damage to protect its passengers. It has been harder to figure out similar designs for trains, and the cost of smashing huge rail cars can get expensive very quickly. Many new trains are equipped with this feature, which is called crash energy management. Fortunately, computers have played an important role in gauging crash scenarios and the response of a railcar, allowing engineers to design crumple zones.

bccl

6. Drones

Drones can help respond to emergencies. In cases of train accidents, drones can help first responders gauge the scenario better - the kind of heat, chemical or other risks they may find themselves walking into. Drones can deliver sensor readings before a rescuer puts on a suit and walks into the disaster.

7. High-speed transit

Behind Japan's famed Shinkansen train lines is the brain of a computer system that manages everything from scheduling to dispatching trains, and manning the crews and trains available to rescheduling them. A similar response system can work wonders for Indian Railways.

afp

8. Satellite stop signals

A satellite navigation system called SafeRail from the European Space Agency is working toward enabling train drivers to track their location in real-time and send a signal that can trigger a stop light or lower a gate at a train crossing. This can aid in reducing human errors and subsequently accidents.

9. Tougher rail cars

Freight trains carrying hazardous material could do well with tougher rail cars that can withstand disastrous mishaps. What's sturdier even than steel is a fibreglass composite that is highly puncture-resistant and can mitigate the magnitude of an accident with a passenger train.

bccl

10. Maintaining track conditions

Many countries' railways use advanced instruments to inspect every aspect of track geometry. These technologies can predict the response of trains to any deviations in track geometry, enabling railway systems to determine when a track needs maintenance.

11. Driverless trains

Similar to driverless cars, autonomous trains can bring their own set of advantages. They can reduce human error and manage mass transit in big countries like India. All operations on board a train can be managed by remote technologies, including the ones that track trains and potential hazards.

bccl

In a country as massive as India, these various aspects can work in tandem to improve train and passenger safety to a great extent. After all, saving lives is a priority that should never be compromised with."
"Pradhan meets Odisha CM Patnaik to resolve Paradip refinery tax issue, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today met Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here and discussed an ongoing tax issue between Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the nation’s largest fuel retailer, and the state government over the latter withdrawing tax incentives provided for setting up the Paradip refinery project in 2004.“Discussion happened in positive environment and both sides displayed the willingness to come to a mutually benefitting and agreeable solution,” Pradhan said in a tweet following the meet.The Odisha government had in February this year sent a notice to IOC stating it is withdrawing the promised 11-year tax deferment on payment of sales tax on Paradip refinery products sold in the state.The state government had originally offered the tax incentives to IOC and its then partner Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) in December 1998 to invest in setting up a refinery in the state. These investments were withdrawn in February 2000, leading to the company shelving the project.The state later restored the incentives and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IOC in February 2004 for providing a set of eight sops. The state government had reportedly withdrawn the tax incentives in ""public interest"", citing 6-year delay in commissioning of the project that was larger in capacity than originally planned 9 million tonne plant.IOC, however, pointed out the February 2004 MoU clearly allowed change in design, capacity and configuration of the project and that the Odisha government was informed about the change in capacity and the delay in construction caused by cyclone, land acquisition and law and order problems, according to a report.As per the MoU, IOC was to commission the refinery in 2009, but actually did it in November 2015 and the state government allowed IOC to avail of construction-related sops totalling Rs 550 crore all through the six years.The foundation stone of the Paradip refinery was originally laid by the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 2000."

We've been harping over vegetables like spinach and supplements that boost your intake of iron for decades now. But did you know that not only are some fruits loaded with iron they also help your body absorb it better from other sources. If you’re a lover of fruits though, these are some potent options you can try out:

Raisins

picturebritain.com

This easily accessible fruit is one of the most potent fruit sources of iron, with around 1.6 milligrams of iron in it. Raisins can be mixed with almonds, cashews and pistachios or mixed with sweet dishes.

Figs

fitbody.ro

The beauty about figs is that they can be eaten fresh or dried. Their iron content is amplified when they are soaked overnight.

Dates

media24.az

Not only are these fruits super-sweet a cup (250gm) of dates contain up to 3 milligrams of iron. Add it to salads or sweet dishes like ice creams.

Pomegranates

greek-gourmet.gr

You can literally never get bored of having pomegranates in any form you like every day. Whether it be in a salad or as fresh juice they are loaded with iron and can help you fight blood-related such as anaemia or iron deficiency.

Citrus fruits

slurrpy.com

Although the citrus fruits are an excellent source of vitamin C, the citrus in the fruit is ideal for absorbing the iron in the greens and the nuts.

Tropical fruits

healthexcellence.net

Fruits like guava, papaya, kiwi’s and mango contain copious amounts of vitamin C as well; thereby helping with the absorption of iron.

Berries

"Cyborg bacteria can harvest solar energy to produce fuel, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Los Angeles: Scientists have created cyborg bacteria - microbes covered with tiny, highly efficient solar panels - that are better than plants at harvesting the Sun's energy to produce fuel from carbon dioxide and water.

Photosynthesis provides energy for the vast majority of life on Earth. However, chlorophyll, the green pigment that plants use to harvest sunlight, is relatively inefficient.

To enable humans to capture more of the Sun's energy than natural photosynthesis can, scientists have taught bacteria to cover themselves in tiny, highly efficient solar panels to produce useful compounds.

""Rather than rely on inefficient chlorophyll to harvest sunlight, I have taught bacteria how to grow and cover their bodies with tiny semiconductor nanocrystals,"" said Kelsey K Sakimoto, from University of California, Berkeley in the US.

""These nanocrystals are much more efficient than chlorophyll and can be grown at a fraction of the cost of manufactured solar panels,"" said Sakimoto.

Humans increasingly are looking to find alternatives to fossil fuels as sources of energy and feedstocks for chemical production.

Many scientists have worked to create artificial photosynthetic systems to generate renewable energy and simple organic chemicals using sunlight.

Progress has been made, but the systems are not efficient enough for commercial production of fuels and feedstocks.

The new research focuses on harnessing inorganic semiconductors that can capture sunlight to organisms such as bacteria that can then use the energy to produce useful chemicals from carbon dioxide and water.

The scientists worked with a naturally occurring, nonphotosynthetic bacterium, Moorella thermoacetica, which, as part of its normal respiration, produces acetic acid from carbon dioxide (CO2).

Acetic acid is a versatile chemical that can be readily upgraded to a number of fuels, polymers, pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals through complementary, genetically engineered bacteria.

Researchers fed cadmium and the amino acid cysteine, which contains a sulfur atom, to the bacteria, they synthesized cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles, which function as solar panels on their surfaces.

The hybrid organism, M thermoacetica-CdS, produces acetic acid from CO2, water and light.

""Once covered with these tiny solar panels, the bacteria can synthesize food, fuels and plastics, all using solar energy,"" Sakimoto said.

""These bacteria outperform natural photosynthesis,"" he said.

The bacteria operate at an efficiency of more than 80 per cent, and the process is self-replicating and self- regenerating, making this a zero-waste technology.

""Synthetic biology and the ability to expand the product scope of CO2 reduction will be crucial to poising this technology as a replacement, or one of many replacements, for the petrochemical industry,"" said Sakimoto."
"Putting a price cap may not work in IVF, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: “In India, there is no clear projection of the number of In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) centres. There is no clear record or mandatory registration,” said Dr Rishma Pai, President, Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India ( FOGSI ).Unregulated IVF clinicsThe IVF and ART (assisted reproductive technology) industry has been witnessing growing demand due to changing lifestyles and women marrying in their 30's today. Due to this rising demand, there has been a rapid increase in the number of IVF clinics. In India, just 20 percent of IVF clinics and only 2 percent of ART centres are registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ).“We have tried to bring together data information with the National ART Registry of India (NARI) but it is voluntary and the number of clinics which have registered are very few. It is because of this that there is no standardisation in result, policy or cost,” added Dr Pai.Dr Devika Chopra, Obstetrician, Gynaecologist & Fertility Specialist at ‎ Bhatia Hospital , said, “ICMR is trying to get the IVF centres regulated. There are efforts being made but it has not been very effective in enforcing the law.”Social stigma associated with infertilityInfertility is more of an emotional trauma then a medical one, especially in the Indian setup. Talking about the other challenges in India like social stigma associated with infertility, Dr Chopra said, “Even today it is considered as a woman's responsibility to bear a child. After knowing that getting pregnant naturally is not possible and the woman may need ART, there is a sudden change in their behaviour and towards the woman.”Importance of counsellingWith IVF techniques rapidly becoming an assessable option, women facing non-conception build up huge expectations. Elaborating on the lack of knowledge and awareness about the IVF success rates, Dr Nandita Palshetkar, Medical Director, Bloom IVF Group, said, “Failure is a major aspect and the success rates are not hundred percent. Counselling the woman, communicating with her and giving her an informed choice are very important.”Commenting on the same, Dr Chopra said, “The patients need to be counselled before going for IVF and that is where we are lacking in India. It is important to adequately counsel the couple and not rush through the process as it may impose psychological trauma on the patient.”Cap on IVF costIVF prices can invariably vary as there is zero transparency in the cost. A single IVF cycle can cost anywhere between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh. Such variation in cost has often invited suggestions like price caps in order to make it more standardised.“Putting a price cap may not work but I think what we need to do is offer low budget cycles or free cycles to economically unprivileged people and that would be more sensible than capping the price,” said Dr Palshetkar.Dr Chopra said, “National capping limit would have certain variables because not all women would respond to the same amount of drugs. The major costs in IVF are the drugs that you are giving; a younger woman may require lesser injections but an older woman may require more. So, how would you set up the cost is the question.”“Assisted reproduction is the need of the hour. I believe that IVF can be a major source of benefit to most couples and even to our GDP,” added Dr Chopra."
"Draft rules against 'cut practice' recommend 5 years in jail for doctors, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The nine-member committee working on the legislation recently submitted the first draft to the state's medical education department. A final version is expected soon

MUMBAI: A preliminary draft of the proposed legislation against ""cut practice"" has recommended a jail term of five years and penalty of up to Rs 50,000 against doctors indulging in unethical means to exploit patients.The nine-member committee working on the legislation recently submitted the first draft to the state's medical education department. A final version is expected soon.Tentatively named the "" Prevention of Cut Practices in Healthcare Services Act, 2017"", the legislation is being framed to clamp down on unnecessary referral of patients by a doctor, hospital or a diagnostic centre. A doctor or medical institution will face an inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) if a complaint is lodged against them under section 3 of the law that defines the offences of ""cut practice"".The ACB is expected to check the veracity of the complaint and complete the investigation within three months. It can seek additional time of three months. A provision of fining bogus complainants has been made. After a probe, the ACB will file a complaint before the sessions court, which will try the case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Till the inquiry is complete, anyone trying to malign the reputation of the doctor or the healthcare service provider shall be liable to one month's jail (see box).The draft rules also call for simultaneous action from the respective medical council under which the doctor or the hospital is registered. ""If a medical professional or a hospital is found guilty, the council shall take cognizance of such offence and initiate an inquiry into the case within six months of the receipt of the FIR,"" it says. It should take appropriate legal action and may also suspend the guilty for at least three months.Former DGP Praveen Dixit , who is heading the nine-member committee, said the draft will take into account public opinion. ""Stakeholders can send their opinion to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), which will be considered and incorporated after discussions,"" he said. He added that veterinary doctors, occupational therapists and even dentists will come under the purview of the law. Interestingly, the rules are silent on alternative medicine practitioners, such as homeopaths.DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said a series of meetings has been lined up with medical experts. ""Several clauses may be added, refined. We are planning to get the final draft ready by November and sending it to the law and judiciary department. We want to table it in the winter session of the assembly,"" he said."
"Does a mother's pre-pregnancy weight determine her child's metabolism ?, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The study was limited by the fact that BMI was self-reported, as well as the fact that BMI may not fully capture the complexity of different body compositions.

The link between a mother’s body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy and the metabolic traits of her children is likely mediated by shared genetics and familial lifestyle rather than effects on the fetus during gestation, according to study published this week in PLOS Medicine by Debbie Lawlor of the University of Bristol , UK, and colleagues.20 to 50 percent of women in Western populations now start pregnancy overweight or obese, and researchers have hypothesized that this may lead to metabolic disruptions in offspring. Lawlor’s group used data on 5,337 mother-father-offspring trios collected in three European birth cohorts. Each dataset included maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, paternal BMI, offspring BMI, and information on 153 metabolic traits in the offspring, based on a blood sample taken at age 16, 17, or 31.The researchers found associations between parental BMIs and offspring metabolic traits including VLDL-lipoproteins , VLDL-C, VLDL-triglycerides, VLDL-diameter, glycoprotein acetyls, triglycerides, HDL-lipoprotein, and HDL-C (all P<0.003). However, the association was not significantly stronger for maternal compared with paternal BMI, arguing against an intra-uterine mechanism. In addition, after taking offspring BMI into account, the data suggested that the apparent link between parental BMI and offspring metabolic traits could be largely explained by the association between parental BMI and offspring BMI. The study was limited by the fact that BMI was self-reported, as well as the fact that BMI may not fully capture the complexity of different body compositions.“Our findings are more supportive of shared familial factors than an intrauterine developmental overnutrition mechanism for associations of maternal BMI with offspring metabolic traits,” the authors say. “Interventions to reduce BMI in all family members may be more beneficial for cardio-metabolic health than focusing on reducing maternal pre-conception or pregnancy BMI."
"As NASA's Mission Voyager-2 Enters Its 40th Year, Indian Classical Music Still Resonates In Space","Forty years on and 11 billion miles from earth in the huge vastness of space there is the sound of India. And how did this happen? As Nasa's ground-breaking Voyager-2 mission enters its 40th year this month, not many are aware that the spacecraft is carrying a golden record with different sounds of earth and international music and one of them are from India.

AFP/Representational Image

Voyager-2 was launched on August 20, 1977, and is the first spacecraft to have flown by all the four outer planets--Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter and Neptune. The music of India is a Hindustani classical composition called ""Jaat Kahan Ho"", rendered by Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar, a noted khayal singer of the second half of the 20th century.

The recording, which lasts for three minutes and 25 seconds, forms part of the 12-inch gold-plated copper disc carried by Voyager-2. Its twin, Voyager-1, launched on September 5, 1977, also carries a similar disc.

Reuters

The Indian music was chosen by a Nasa-appointed committee chaired by Carl Sagan. In the book ""Murmurs Of Earth - The Voyager Interstellar Record"", published in 1978, Ann Druyan, Sagan's wife, recalls that Robert Brown, then executive director for the Centre For World Music in Berkeley placed ""Jaat Kahan Ho"" at the top of his list of world music for outer space.

After a great deal of effort, Druyan finally located the record at a shop in New York.

Brown has stated: ""If I could extend the list, it would include the following: a lively mridangam solo from India in a tala of five beats played by Palghat Mani Iyer who may well be the world's best drummer ...""

AFP

Timothy Ferris, who served as a producer of the Voyager Golden Record, says Kesarbai, who was born in 1893 in Goa, was awarded the title of 'Surshri' in 1938 by Rabindranath Tagore on behalf of the residents of Kolkata.

""One of my favourite transitions on the Voyager record comes when 'Flowing Stream' ends and we are transported, quick as a curtsy, across the Himalayas to the north of India and from the sound of one musical genius, Kuan Ping-hu to another, Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar,"" Ferris says. ""The raga heard on Voyager is formally designated for morning performance, but its popularity has led to its use as a closing number, a kind of encore, for concerts day and night.""

"Knee surgery: After cardiac stents, government now caps knee implants price, cuts prices by up to 69%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: After coronary stents, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has wielded its powers of price control on knee implants — devices used to replace parts of the knee joints that are damaged. The difference this time is that the regulator has exercised its own emergency powers to do so, instead of waiting for the government to bring the devices under the National List of Essential Medicines as it did on stents.The drug pricing watchdog slashed the prices of total knee replacement systems and their individual components by as much as 69%, an NPPA notification issued on Wednesday evening showed.This decision is expected to lead to a saving of Rs 1,500 crore per year for the people of India, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar said. According to him, 1-1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures are done in India annually.Industry bodies representing manufacturers said they were reviewing the order and would take their suggestions to the regulator for its effective implementation.The price of total knee implants made of cobalt chromium has now been capped at Rs 54,720, down 65% from its average maximum retail price of Rs 1.58 lakh, data from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers showed. These are the most widely used complete knee implants, it said.Total knee implants made of special metals like titanium and oxidized zirconium can be priced at a maximum of Rs 76,600, or 69% lower than the original average MRP. High-flexibility implants have also seen a similar reduction in the maximum price to Rs 56,490. Revision implants, used in repeat procedures when the initial knee implant has failed, is capped 59% lower at Rs 1.14 lakh, down from an average of Rs 2.77 lakh.Special knee implants for cancer or tumours will follow the prices of revision knee implants, NPPA said.These prices are exclusive of goods and services tax, but take trade margins for manufacturers or importers, distributors and hospitals into account, NPPA said.The regulator's latest order specifically highlights the ceiling prices of each component used in a knee replacement procedure, such as femoral, tibial, insert and patellas. In most cases, the ceiling prices of these components have been set according to the materials used, but in the case of certain components, these have been fixed regardless of the materials used.NPPA's order comes around six months after it slashed the prices of coronary stents by up to 85%.Unlike stents, the government did not put knee implants on the essential medicines list. Usually, the Department of Pharmaceuticals notifies products for price control and NPPA caps the prices after the health ministry puts it on this list.Out of 1.5-2 crore patients who require arthroplasty interventions, only around a lakh are in a position to pay for the procedure every year, NPPA stated. Citing a World Health Organization bulletin from 2003, it said osteoarthritis could become the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. India is likely to be one of the leading countries of such immobilized citizens in terms of numbers.""As the public is aware, prices remain too high for devices across the board. We would like this to be the start for NPPA to systematically fix prices of all other devices on which data was collected in public interest,"" said Malini Aisola of patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN). ""The price reductions still need study and it will not be successful without a check on the hospital rates,"" she added.According to some knee implant manufacturers, the order has left a lot of issues unresolved without which the price cuts might not be possible. One of the companies that ET spoke to said a knee implant device has a number of components, and without fixing the prices of those components, it would be difficult to gauge the price cut.The Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD) is expected to meet the drug regulator asking for time in implementing these price cuts. The Medical Technology Association of India, another body that represents knee implant makers like Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew, said it is currently reviewing the order and will respond with suggestions to NPPA to ensure practicality of its decision.“Prices are reasonable and we are with the government. We believe this price cap will help every person of the country who needs implants,” stated Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD."
"Kolkata hospitals say they can't lower rates, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representative image.

KOLKATA: Private hospitals in Kolkata have made it clear to the West Bengal Health Regulatory Commission that they won’t be able to sustain operations by lowering their existing charges. Asked to explain why their rates were higher than the Swasthya Sathi rates, prescribed by the state government to provide treatment at reasonable charges to the underprivileged, hospitals have pointed out that their operational expenses and technological investment costs were too high to be matched with the suggested rates without compromising with the quality of service. Hospitals were asked to respond to the commission by August 15.While each hospital has sent its response individually to the commission, several had got together last week for an informal discussion among themselves. “Our cost explanation is accompanied by a covering letter which makes it clear that charges are consistent with the operational expenses and technological input costs which are necessary for high quality healthcare and satisfactory clinical outcomes. We have to spend on upgrading our instruments and machinery which is a huge cost. Our running expenses, too, can’t be lowered any further,” said R Ventkatesh, zonal director – east, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences ( RTIICS ).The RTIICS letter also seeks further 'advice from the health commission’ and has sought a further meeting with the commission. “Since everything can’t be explained in a letter, we are expecting an interaction that would help us take the discussion forward. In that meeting, we plan to have our own experts to present our case,” added Venkatesh. Belle Vue Clinic, too, has pleaded its inability to revise charges. The hospital has re-sent an earlier letter to the commission, in which it had mentioned that the existing charges can’t be scaled down. “We have not explained our existing rates, but mentioned that they can’t be revised,” said P Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue."

"EESL to sign MoU with Malaysian counterpart to replicate UJALA scheme in Malaysia, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Following the successful implementation of the Indian government’s Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) in UK, the Malaysian government has now evinced interest in replicating the scheme in Malaysia.The state of Melaka in Malaysia is set to partner with EESL with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Green Growth Asia (GGA) and EESL in the first week of September 2017 on the sidelines of the Urban Environmental Accords (UEA) at the Melaka Summit.“We were deeply encouraged by India’s UJALA story, which is being implemented by EESL. As the world’s largest zero-subsidy government LED distribution programme, this is an extraordinary example of successful energy efficiency programmes that we believe should be replicated in Melaka, ”Chief Minister of Melaka, Malaysia, Datuk Seri Utama Ir. Haji Idris bin Haron, said in a statement released by EESL on Friday.Being the Chairman of the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee, he also is keen on collaborating with EESL in other programmes in addition to the UJALA scheme , the statement added.The UJALA scheme implemented by EESL has now become a global case study, whereby we have been approached by the governments of many countries to seek assistance for implementation of similar interventions in the energy efficiency space, with the Government of Melaka being the latest addition. In line with this, we have already commenced talks with the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee soon to assess their requirements.” Raj Kumar Rakhra, National Programme Manager (UJALA), EESL, said.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme, according to the ministry of power The scheme has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."
"Single use medical devices: Mumbai: FIRs against 37 hospitals for reusing devices, patients to be reimbursed, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has filed complaints against 37 hospitals across the state for reusing single-use medical devices and overcharging patients, said minister for consumer protection Girish Bapat . The government is also working on ways to refund patients who were unfairly charged for reused devices, he announced in the legislative council on Tuesday.Moreover, to prevent such incidents from recurring in hospitals, the state government plans to develop a web portal that will record every medical device’s journey—right from its purchase to use and re-use.“The web portal will keep a track of each medical device from the moment it is purchased, the medical institute it is sold to, and its use,” said Bapat, replying to a query raised by Congress MLC Satej Patil during question hour. The minister added that discussions with the Medical Council of India, the Drug Council of India and secretary of the public health department on the issue are in the final stages.The announcement follows special investigations by the state Food and Drug Administration in May-June that showed many private hospitals charged premium charges from patients for reused cardiac catheters and guidewires; most of these devices are only meant for single use.In April, the state FDA had found three city hospitals guilty of not only reusing medical devices meant for single use, but also charging multiple patients for the same. Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi, which is managed by the Fortis group, and BSES Hospital in Andheri were later issued show-cause notices for violating the Drug and Cosmetics Act.On Tuesday, when Patil pointed out that a few hospitals have already reused implant devices and cheated patients, the minister assured him that the government would get information about such cases and refund those patients."

Australia batsman Glenn Maxwell, on August 23 (Wednesday), stressed upon the need to strengthen their defence ahead of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh, starting on August 27.

The middle-order batsman, who sustained a heatstroke on the opening day of the makeshift training session after the Fatullah practice game was called off, is eager to work on the compactness of his technique in order to extend his innings in the series.

""I caught a bit of heatstroke on the first day which wasn't a good start,"" Maxwell told the reporters after the training session. ""I think just doing some running outside, then had to go inside to do some fitness tests and then going back outside didn't help too much. The body shut down a little bit but I was fine after the ice bath and plenty of fluids.""

The 28-year-old spoke extensively about the defensive technique being one of the major requisites needed to succeed in the country. ""A lot of my practice revolves around defense and expanding from there. I haven't done so much of it since I have been here but I am sure I will get a chance before the game starts,"" Maxwell said.

""It is more about guys who are hitting the stumps regularly and Bangladesh do that really well. They bowl stump to stump and put pressure on your defence so I suppose that's one thing we will work on,"" he added.

Maxwell reiterated that their batsmen need be confident of their own ability, especially when it comes to using their pad as the second line of defense. However, his emphasis remained more on using the bat than anything else.

""I think the main thing is to basically use your bat. If you don't have the safety of your front pad, it makes you get your leg out of the way and actually use your bat. I think it is more about refining your defence and making sure you trust the fact that you can hit the ball and not hoping that your pads are there just to save you,"" Maxwell noted.

Maxwell, however, was quick to dismiss any pressure regarding the kind of surface that would be put out by the hosts. The big-hitting batsman mentioned that they had trained in extremely difficult conditions at Darwin in the build-up to this tour, and had covered all bases to be prepared for the subcontinent wickets.

""The wickets here are similar to what we faced in Darwin where it was perfect. We put extreme conditions in Darwin with the wickets where we made it ridiculously tough to bat on and guys tested themselves really well during that week. I think the guys are more than well equipped to handle whatever comes their way in the first Test,"" he said.

Maxwell also admitted that it won't be cakewalk against Bangladesh, especially with bowlers like Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, who are capable of posing a threat to any side in the world.

""Mustafizur is obviously an exceptional bowler we faced during the IPL.. during his breakthrough season. I suppose his pace [has] dropped off as he played a bit more Test cricket.

""He is still an outstanding bowler who has the ability to swing it and has an unbelievable change-up slower ball. He is not your conventional left-arm seamer. He is obviously got a very flexible wrist with which he can flick it in the last moment. It looks exactly the same either it is his bumper or his slower ball. It is a hard thing to pick up,"" said Maxwell while conceding that even Shakib would be a major thorn in the eye.

""He is a really experienced player. He has been the No. 1 all-rounder in the world for a while. He is an excellent cricketer. We have to play these guys really well to negate their influence in the Test series and make sure we are staying on top of the game.""

Maxwell, who scored his maiden Test ton against India in Ranchi, exuded confidence about the plans he had employed for the India tour earlier in the year. ""I don't think I will change too much from what I did in India. I thought I had really good plans during the Test series against them. I will employ probably something similar, basically backing my defense and trying to revolve my game around that.

""It is basically going to be batting long periods of time and making sure that when we do bat those long periods of time we are making big hundreds.""

"Johnson & Johnson baby powder: Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $417m in lawsuit linking baby powder to cancer, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LOS ANGELES - A Los Angeles jury on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay a record $417 million to a hospitalized woman who claimed in a lawsuit that the talc in the company's iconic baby powder causes ovarian cancer when applied regularly for feminine hygiene.

The verdict in the lawsuit brought by the California woman, Eva Echeverria, marks the largest sum awarded in a series of talcum powder lawsuit verdicts against Johnson & Johnson in courts around the U.S.

Echeverria alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about talcum powder's potential cancer risks. She used the company's baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007, according to court papers.

Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a ""proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,"" she said in her lawsuit.

Echeverria's attorney, Mark Robinson, said his client is undergoing cancer treatment while hospitalized and told him she hoped the verdict would lead Johnson & Johnson to put additional warnings on its products.

""Mrs. Echeverria is dying from this ovarian cancer and she said to me all she wanted to do was to help the other women throughout the whole country who have ovarian cancer for using Johnson & Johnson for 20 and 30 years,"" Robinson said.

""She really didn't want sympathy,"" he added. ""She just wanted to get a message out to help these other women.""

The jury's award included $68 million in compensatory damages and $340 million in punitive damages, Robinson said. The evidence in the case included internal documents from several decades that ""showed the jury that Johnson & Johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer,"" Robinson said.

""Johnson & Johnson had many warning bells over a 30 year period but failed to warn the women who were buying its product,"" he said.

Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement that the company will appeal the jury's decision. She says while the company sympathizes with women suffering from ovarian cancer that scientific evidence supports the safety of Johnson's baby powder.

The verdict came after a St. Louis, Missouri jury in May awarded $110.5 million to a Virginia woman who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012.

She had blamed her illness on her use of the company's talcum powder-containing products for more than 40 years.

Besides that case, three other trials in St. Louis had similar outcomes last year - with juries awarding damages of $72 million, $70.1 million and $55 million, for a combined total of $307.6 million.

Another St. Louis jury in March rejected the claims of a Tennessee woman with ovarian and uterine cancer who blamed talcum powder for her cancers.

Two similar cases in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said the plaintiffs' lawyers did not presented reliable evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer.

More than 1,000 other people have filed similar lawsuits. Some who won their lawsuits won much lower amounts, illustrating how juries have wide latitude in awarding monetary damages.

Johnson & Johnson is preparing to defend itself and its baby powder at upcoming trials in the U.S., Goodrich said."

"Firing of neurons changes the cells that insulate them, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Through their pattern of firing, neurons influence the behavior of the cells that upon maturation will provide insulation of neuronal axons, according to a new study publishing 22 August in the open access journal PLOS Biology by Balint Nagy Maria Kukley and colleagues at the University of Tübingen , Germany. The findings suggest the existence of a complex and nuanced interplay between neurons and the non-neuronal cells that support and protect them. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to oligodendrocytes, which wrap the axons of neurons in the central nervous system with myelin to electrically insulate them. Neurons signal to OPCs through chemical synapses. Previous work has shown that electrical or optical stimulation of nerve fibers influences the proliferation of OPCs and their differentiation into oligodendrocytes, but whether that stimulation acts like an on-off switch, influencing OPCs only by its presence or absence, or more like a dimmer switch, inducing a graded response in the OPC, has been unclear.To investigate that question, the authors studied oligodendroglial cells in the corpus callosum, a nerve tract which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, both in fresh brain slices and in living rodents. Using electrodes, they stimulated neurons to fire and recorded responses in the neighboring OPCs.They found that stimulating neuronal fibers in brain slices at low frequencies led to a slowly oscillating movement of ions through the membrane of OPCs, while high-frequency stimulation caused a much more rapidly oscillating movement of ions. High-frequency stimulation of neuronal fibers in living animals led to greater OPC proliferation (creating more OPCs) over the course of a week than did low-frequency stimulation; low-frequency stimulation, in turn, led to more differentiation of OPCs into pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, the cells that then go on to develop into oligodendrocytes which make myelin.How OPCs translate different patterns of neuronal firing into differences in proliferation and differentiation is unknown, but differences in firing pattern have been seen to affect gene expression in neurons themselves in a graded rather than on-off way, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be at work in OPCs. Intriguingly, different neuronal firing patterns affect properties of chemical synapses between neurons and OPC, as well as intracellular concentrations of ions in OPCs such as sodium, potassium, and calcium, in a distinct fashion. Hence, it is possible that neurons use synapses with OPCs to influence OPCs behavior, including proliferation and maturation. It is not yet known whether the frequency-related differences in behavior of OPCs actually match the neuron’s respective needs.Myelination in the brain is plastic. It can be influenced by our everyday behavior and is responsive to environmental inputs, with physical activity increasing it and social isolation decreasing it. Understanding the mechanisms mediating the effects of activity on myelination may offer significant opportunities for therapeutic intervention in disorders in which myelination or remyelination are deficient. “This research may open new perspective to therapy of demyelinating disorders where remyelination strongly relies on the increased proliferation and differentiation of OPCs,” commented Kukley."

"FM Jaitely urges states to reduce VAT on petroleum products used for making goods, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today urged state governments to reduce Value Added Tax ( VAT ) on petroleum products used for making goods which attract Goods and Service Tax ( GST ), an official statement said. The move is aimed at easing tax burden on manufacturing sectors using petroleum products.The GST regime rolled out on 1 July excludes crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel while other products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha are included in GST. In the pre-GST regime, both petroleum products and final goods produced attracted VAT and hence input tax credit of petroleum products used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different states.However, in the post-GST regime, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products like natural gas, petrol and diesel used in manufacturing of the products attract VAT which leads to stranded taxes and cascading of taxes.“In view of this, in the pre GST regime certain States had lower rate of 5% VAT on Compressed Natural Gas used for manufacturing of goods. Some States also had lower rate of VAT on diesel being used for manufacturing sector. Thus the FM has requested other states also to explore the possibility of having lower VAT on petroleum products used for manufacturing items on which there is GST, so that there is minimum disruption in the costing of goods,” the statement said.At least one analyst told ETEnergyWorld VAT reduction on petroleum products used in manufacturing would reduce tax disadvantage currently suffered by City Gas Distribution (CGD) Companies as well as Piped Natural Gas (PNG) consumers along with the power, Ceramics, Glass, Chemicals, Pharma, Dairy, Steel and Engineering industry.“Currently CGD companies face a significant disadvantage when they sell PNG (Industrial and Commercial) as it continues to attract VAT on which input tax credit cannot be availed by its consumers who would be under GST. On the other hand, if they were to use liquid fuels such as Fuel Oil, Diesel, Naphtha, LPG, input tax credit is available because these products come under GST. If the states were to reduce VAT on PNG, that will reduce the tax disadvantage suffered by CGD companies and some of their consumers,” K Ravichandran, Senior Vice President at ICRA told ETEnergyWorld .He also added sectors such as ceramics, glass, chemicals, pharma, dairy, steel and engineering will be benefited as many of them use PNG. If the VAT were to be lower, under recoveries of companies operating in these sectors on taxes will be lower, which will improve their cost structure.Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the statistical arm of the oil ministry has projected the natural gas demand for the financial year 2017-2018 to be 494 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter Per Day (MMSCMD). Of which the power industry would require 225 MMSCMD followed by the fertilizer industry requiring 113 MMSCMD, city gas distribution 47 MMSCMD and Industrial requirement of 28 MMSCMD among others. Sanjiv Singh , Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the country’s largest fuel retailer, had recently said the firm is in talks with state governments for deferring levy of VAT on petrol, diesel, Aviation Turbine Fuel and crude oil to reduce the tax impact of these products as they are outside the ambit of GST."
Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"renewable energy production: Karnataka at 3rd spot in renewable energy production, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Bengaluru: Karnataka has overtaken Gujarat to become the third highest producer of renewable energy after Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.The state, which occupied the fourth position last year, has outranked Gujarat in the recently released progress report of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy Energy minister D K Shivakumar said in a tweet: ""At 7,458MW, Karnataka now has the 3rd highest installed capacity in renewable energy. We will soon surpass Maharashtra to become 2nd in India."" The neighbouring Tamil Nadu is on top with 10,625 MW.G V Balaram, MD of Karnataka Renewable Energy Devlopment, said with the development of Asia's biggest solar park at Pavagada in Tumakuru district, they were confident of clinching the number one spot by April 2018. Farmers have voluntarily contributed over 12,000 acres for the project, which is estimated to cost Rs 20,000 crore.What led to the paradigm shift? ""The third rank among 29 states follows a marked shift in policy. Strong government support coupled with an attractive renewable energy policy has propelled Karnataka to the third place,"" Balaram said.He said the turnaround was possible because of increased targets fixed by Union ministry of renewable energy at 175 GW (gigawatts) by 2022. The Karnataka government revised its policy twice and set an ambitious target of solar energy generation at 6,000MW by March 2022 while the state's solar power potential is estimated to be above 24,700 MW.""Wind and solar energy have received good response, and the state has added 3,200 MW from renewable energy sources in the past four years. This year, we will add 3,000MW from solar power alone,"" he added.At present, he said Karnataka is the only state to provide such a lucrative proposition for solar power adoption. The state government acts as a major facilitator to bridge the energy demand and supply gap and supply power to the grid. Solar energy is getting cheaper by the year and in some time, it would be cheaper than the electricity grid,"" Balaram added""The favourable policy has also enabled large corporates to buy significant proportion of their power from solar farms at a discount to supply to grids under long-term contracts with solar developers,"" said Mahesh Raviraj, an executive associated with a reputable solar company.The Karnataka government is also working with farmers to lease their land for solar and wind power generation and make them stakeholders in the energy future. When it comes to cogeneration (use of power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time) and biomass generation, Karnataka is growing faster than other states."
Astronauts' Urine Might Help In Getting Humans To Mars And Beyond,"When Matt Damon was stranded alone on the Red Planet in the movie ‘The Martian’, he used his own faeces mixed in with the dirt to fertilize the potatoes he was trying to grow. Of course, Matt Damon wasn’t the real astronaut, but it seems he had the right idea when it came to using human excrement for other purposes.

Yarrowia lipolytica cells under a microscope - Wikimedia Commons

Researchers from Clemson University are currently working on a way to convert astronauts’ sweat and urine into plastics that can be used to build tools on board a spacecraft.

The team is researching a strain of yeast called Yarrowia Lipolytica, one that astronauts would theoretically be able to imbue with carbon and nitrogen found in their excrements. The yeast would then act as a natural recycler, generating oils and fats that could be turned into bioplastics. The Clemson team are presenting their work at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

If the process works according to plan, the yeast can be tweaked to create polyester, a material commonly used in clothing. However, instead of crafting uncomfortable urine shirts, the polyester can instead be fed into 3D printers, which could use the plastic to craft tools the astronauts need, whenever required.

This sort of research is crucial for deep space missions, where astronauts would be confined to a spacecraft for long periods of time with no chance of a resupply mission from Earth. The amount of cargo they could carry in that situation would be limited by the fuel reserves, so it would be easier to recycle trash to build new items than carrying spares.

In fact, astronauts on board the International Space Station already do that to a small extent. The spacefarers recycle their sweat and urine on board the ISS and purify it to make drinking water

But if those same astronauts can just visit the bathroom whenever a crucial tool breaks and make a new one, the possibilities are almost endless.

"L&T annual general meeting: L&T succession well-calibrated, to go smoothly: AM Naik, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) chairman AM Naik believes that unlike Infosys and the Tata Group , the succession at the company would be smooth as it was transparent and well-calibrated.Naik addressed his last annual general meeting for L&T as an executive chairman as he would move to a non-executive role from October at the company where he has worked for 52 years.“Our succession was planned 12 years before, announced three years before, notified six months before, and it will be the smoothest leadership transition in the industry,” Naik said.The Tata-Mistry spat and recent resignation of Infosys' CEO Vishal Sikka have brought to limelight the struggle of big conglomerates in executing a succession plan smoothly. Naik declined to comment on these two cases, but said, “L&T is an example of formidable and best transition against these two.”The AGM was an emotional affair as Naik took a walk down the memory lane and his successor and shareholders praised him for his role in the growth of the $17-billion engineering conglomerate.“Growth in sales, profitability and shareholder values have been so immense and humongous, I doubt anybody else at L&T would ever be able to do that again. You have done the impossible. Probably to repeat the same would be a huge task,” said SN Subrahmanyan, managing director and chief executive officer, L&T.Subrahmanyan takes over reins of the company when it is going through one of the most challenging times, as private sector investments have almost vanished and order inflows have slowed. The company witnessed a decline in new orders in the first quarter of 2017-18 but believes that its guidance of 12-14 per cent order inflow and 12 per cent revenue growth for the entire year is achievable.“There are some positive trends in the economy but the irritation of the industry is that the pace is not as fast as we would want. There are some good programmes on the anvil and we hope that the government will finalise at least two of the defence programmes that we are participating in,” Subrahmanyan said.The company aims to bag defence orders worth Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 crore over the next three-four years. Responding to shareholders, who asked him to continue to guide the company, Naik said he would be around for the next three years, albeit in a different role.The mood at the AGM turned tense when a former employee Uday Dikshit , also a shareholder, accused the company’s management of wrongfully diverting land in Powai, reserved for building homes for employees, to commercial residential projects.Dikshit has has also filed a petition in the court on the matter. “The management has committed fraud of almost Rs 1,800 crore, which otherwise was required to be distributed among all employees because certain amount was deducted from salaries of employees fraudulently and shown as voluntary contribution towards welfare trust,” he said.He was cut short and escorted away by security personnel. Naik dismissed the shareholder as a “disgruntled employee.”"

"India Is 8th Most Cyber Attacked Nation In World, With Return Of An Old Deadly Malware In 2017","According to a new security report, India ranks eighth among countries across the world that are targeted by DDoS attacks.

Cloud delivery firm Akamai released its State of the Internet report for Q2 2017, and it shows that India not only suffers Distributed Denial of Service attacks, it’s also the 5th most popular source country for these attacks, with close to 12 million attacks sourced from here between Q3 2016 to Q2 2017.

According to the report, after three quarters showing a decline in the number of global DDos attacks, it rose by 28 percent once more this quarter. In fact, targets around the world are averaging 32 attacks during the quarter, up from 25 last quarter. The target with the highest number of incidents, a gaming company, clocked a whopping 558 attacks this quarter, an average of six times a day.

The US leads the top 10 list of countries most targeted by DDoS attacks, followed by the UK and Brazil. India places 8th on that list, rounded out by China and the Netherlands in the bottom two.

“Events like the Mirai botnet, the exploitation used by WannaCry and Petya, the continued rise of SQLi attacks and the re-emergence of PBot all illustrate how attackers will not only migrate to new tools but also return to old tools that have previously proven highly effective,” Martin McKeay, Senior Security Advocate at Akamai, said in a statement.

India was also a source for 5,224 of those DDoS attacks this quarter, making it the fifth-most popular source country, behind, Egypt, the US, Turkey, and China.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Triple talaq: Removing gender injustice would only strengthen minority rights in India,"Triple talaq has been quashed by the Supreme Court. A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‘pampered minorities’ in their place.

Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.

At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.

For Muslim Women

To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.

Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world’s earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.

The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.

The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.

The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.

The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel’s statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.

Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole

Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.

Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.

When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.

In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.

And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.

The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.

Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all."
A Riot Of Vegetables,"The vibrant colours of vegetables bring out the artist in me. It makes me internally happy, French chef ALAIN PASSARD says to RANJENI A SINGH



Till the year 2000, he cooked meat. Then began his love affair with vegetables,thanks to the garden he created in 2001. Since then, French chef Alain Passard has been dishing out vegetarian fare, with each plate turning out as a piece de resistance. Just like an artist who contemplates his palette before he paints the first stroke on the canvas, Passard takes a long look at the colours of vegetables — “a mauve, yellow, a marbly white, celadon green, a pearly orange,” to quote him — for inspiration before getting into the technical aspects of cooking.And when he is not cooking, Passard is sculpting crabs and hedgehogs in bronze or making collages. The three Michelin star chef,known as the greatest vegetarian cook in the world,says,“When I saw the vegetables in the garden, I wanted to change professions, to renew my senses,change my hand. It wasn’t so much killing animals that made me change but the excitement of travelling on a different kind of fabric.”He says that nature,too,does not like the same routine — that is why she created seasons and seasonal vegetables to fire the imagination and you can,therefore,cook up something new every day. About his relationship with his garden, Passard says,“They definitely make me a better chef.



It’s made my cuisine better, and gives value to farmers, because a garden is a playground for culinary creation.”To not let refrigeration or any such thing meddle with the natural flavour of the vegetables, his lovingly tendered vegetables are transported from his garden — located in the Eure and the Sarthe regions of France — to his kitchen in Paris, in time to make meals. And when the vegetables of a particular season are over, the produce of the next season takes over. Such is his love for vegetables that his restaurant,Arpege, also sells organically grown vegetable baskets every morning.Six gardeners work at the vegetable garden in Fille sur Sarthe.Three people look after the vegetable garden in Bois-Giroult.The latest one,the garden of Porteaux, located opposite the Mont St Michel bay, has its own orchard. For the wellbeing of the gardens as well as the earth, there are two donkeys, two foals, as well as cows, chickens, and a goat that live there.Call it total communion with nature! Passard is proud of his prized possession: His vegetable garden. And he declares on his website,“I grow my own vegetables to be able to tell a story from the grain to the plate…and to be able to combine the chef ’s touch with that of the gardener,two passionate professions.Through these gardens, I have trusted nature with my creativity;it is nature that dictates my actions. The most beautiful cookery book was written by nature itself.”



The shift from meat to vegetables has changed his perspective.“Spiritually, it brought me a lot of happiness.I reconnected with painting thanks to the immeasurable amount of colours that vegetables can offer, and this gave me a completely new perspective on what being a chef means.It helped me realise that cooking vegetables was more artistic,” says Passard and adds, “I think it’s very personal. For me, there are different kinds of cooks: one that will nourish his inspiration through colours and seasons, the shapes and colours of vegetables, and one who doesn’t have that sensitivity and who will inevitably see his cuisine as a job, not as a passion, and a source of creativity.” He likes to listen to what is cooking, hearing the subtleness of the crackling,for he says, the sound of tomatoes cooking isn’t the same as the sound of beetroot cooking. “Taste is a combination of two or three flavours and it is linked to textures,and what gets on the plate is strong,yet delicate.” Does he agree with eastern wisdom that says,‘You are what you eat’? He prefers to change the maxim to ‘You eat what you want’.“That says even more about a person, because it is a personal choice. By eating what you want, you accept your tastes, and through the effort you put into it, you can know whether you like the art of the table or not,” says the chef. Is food all about cooking up a great dish and savouring it,or is it something more? “Of course! Cooking and savouring are decisive steps, but before they can even begin to exist, you have to think.Think about what it is you want, who you would like to share it with, what techniques and touches will you use? It all revolves around your senses, and they are moments you linger and long for,moments you cherish and that lead up to cooking, then serving. It’s such a sensitive space, so large....” And in this celebration of food, the family plays a key role. Passard believes that family meals are the richest of these moments.“You share dishes,ideas,a moment where you discuss your past,your future, because a family bond is timeless. It’s an opportunity to connect through classical dishes that everyone identifies with”. (Alain Passard interacted via email).

Merger drama and fragile Tamil dreams,"Two factions of Tamil Nadu’s AIADMK party have come together, attempting to fill a J Jayalalithaa-size hole after her death earlier this year. E K Palaniswami of AIADMK (Amma), the standby incumbent, will continue as chief minister. His rival O Panneerselvam will be accommodated as deputy chief minister. It is common knowledge that the reconciliation was brokered by the BJP, in power at the Centre. The BJP believes that its role as dealmaker between the two factions of AIADMK and support to keep it in power in Chennai, will allow it to get a toehold in the southern state.

Elections for the assembly are due only in 2021. But Lok Sabha polls are due in two years, and Tamil Nadu’s 40 seats, 39 of them now held by the AIADMK, are crucial for the BJP. Its managers like Amit Shah know that an alliance with the AIADMK might enable the party to make inroads into India’s vast southern peninsula. Yet, there are two reasons why the gamble might fail to yield results. One, a third, disgruntled AIADMK faction, led by TTV Dhinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaa’s aide Sasikala, claims the support of 20 elected lawmakers. Sasikala is behind bars on a case related to disproportionate assets. If Dhinakaran withdraws his lawmakers and sides with the main opposition party DMK, the incumbent government could fall.

Two, even if this does not happen, the BJP is firmly identified as a north-Indian outfit by Tamil voters. For decades now, the latter have consistently voted for Dravidian parties, relegating even the once-powerful Congress to the margins of electoral politics. The BJP cannot be faulted for its attempts to break new ground. But the tremendous uncertainty that has gripped Tamil and AIADMK politics casts a long shadow over administrative stability and governance."

Realist strategy: Trump’s new Afghanistan plan puts much-needed squeeze on Pakistan,"In a marked departure from his campaign rhetoric, US President Donald Trump has outlined his new Afghanistan strategy that favours realism over politics. Reversing the previous Obama administration’s approach that was focussed on drawing down American troops, the new plan authorises the deployment of an additional 4,000 soldiers to train and buttress Afghan forces. Trump is right in assessing that a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan would create a vacuum for terrorists, including the Afghan branch of Islamic State (IS), to fill. This is precisely what happened with Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq that led to the rise of IS.

Obama’s Afpak policy didn’t work for a number of reasons. Announcing deadlines for a drawdown made it easy for the Taliban to wait out the Americans. Secondly, it is next to impossible to defeat an insurgency which has safe havens, and Pakistan provided those havens. The new Trump policy seeks to address both. It will not focus on deadlines but on actual ground conditions. Thirdly, Trump put Pakistan on notice for providing safe havens to terror groups. Part of the problem of the US policy in Afghanistan has been Washington’s over-reliance on Islamabad. This has allowed the Pakistanis to shelter terror groups.

Trump has said this situation needs to change. It is in Pakistan’s best interest that it stops providing safe havens and succour to terrorists. If it refuses to do so, the Trump strategy promises that the full panoply of available diplomatic, economic and military instruments will be used in concert to achieve this outcome. Sustained pressure along these lines is bound to yield results. It’s good that Trump has acknowledged India’s role in Afghan stability and development. To buttress the new strategy Trump should also not rock the boat with Iran, which too has a stake in Afghan stability."
"ITC to enter healthcare sector with hospital, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket."

Tiger Shroff Saves Rumoured Girlfriend Disha Patani From An Embarrassing Moment On The Ramp!,"It has, for long, been rumoured that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been dating but the couple has kept what's between them under wraps. Often they have been spotted together and the rumours thereafter spread like wildfire.

Recently, the alleged couple attended the Lakme Fashion Week together, and what happened there was rather cute that fans have been fawning over.

Just like Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani was also supposed to walk the runway but she didn't. Why, you ask? Because Tiger saved her from what could have been a major embarrassing moment.

So, before the diva walked the ramp, Tiger figured out that the stage was made up of a reflective glass, and her alleged girlfriend was wearing a short dress. Being a keen observer of thing or just being a caring boyfriend, Tiger was seen muttering something into her ears and thereafter she decided not to walk the ramp.

Isn't that cute?

Earlier as well, the alleged couples of the B-town have saved their girlfriends from such awkward moments. Remember, how once, Salman told Katrina to cover up her neck while at a press conference through Alia Bhatt.

Also, how once Singh Rajput saved Kriti Sanon from a probable wardrobe malfunction?

That's indeed cute, isn't it?

"UP government slashes medical education budget by 50%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LUCKNOW: As the death of 23 children in a single day in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) grabs national headlines, a sharp cut by the Aditya Nath Yogi government in the budgetary allocation for medical education this year is raising questions. That's because this is the head under which the BRDMC, like other state-run colleges, receives funds.The budgetary allocation for 14 such medical colleges and their associated teaching hospitals has been pared to less than half from Rs 2,344 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,148 crore for 2017-18. The allocation for BRDMC followed the pattern, plunging from Rs 15.9 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 7.8 crore for 2017-18. More specifically, its allocation for machines/equipment was slashed from Rs 3 crore to just Rs 75 lakh.The budgetary allocation fell across all medical colleges. For example, the medical colleges in Kanpur and Allahabad saw their allocations come down from Rs 15.9 crore each to Rs 3.3 crore and Rs 4.2 crore, respectively."
India needs banks of different sizes,"SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya’s caution on bank mergers has much merit, even as the Cabinet has given an in-principle nod for consolidation.

Yes, the economy does need bigger banks to meet its growing needs. A bigger bank will be able to fund large infrastructure deals, bring more efficiency in treasury operations and trim operating costs. But the need is also to ensure that it does not lead to the creation of banks that are too big to fail or are too cumbersome.

That’s a fear among regulators after the financial crisis in 2008. The country’s experience with mergers — New Bank of India with Punjab National Bank and Global Trust Bank with Oriental Bank of Commerce — has been either unhappy or under duress.

So, the ministerial panel that will be set up to supervise proposals from bank boards must exercise caution. India needs banks of varying sizes, with intense competition among them. Banks will face a threat from fintech companies, and the debt market.

Ideally, therefore, the government should allow some state-owned banks that want to merge for valid commercial reasons to consolidate, subject to their meeting tougher loss-absorbing capacity norms.

The RBI’s financial stability report is candid that the risks to the banking industry’s stability have worsened. Reportedly, the gross bad loan ratio is estimated to rise to 10.2% of the total loan book in March 2018 from 9.6% in 2017.

For public sector banks, the gross bad loan ratio could be as high as 14.2% by March 2018, from 11.4%. A resolution of bad loans is vital for state-owned banks so that capital infusion does not end up as provisioning against bad loans post the merger. Consolidation will benefit deposits growth.

The combined entity should also be well capitalised and have the capacity to raise resources without depending unduly on the state exchequer.

But there could be challenges in terms of employee integration due to the differences in the remuneration structures, and synchronisation of technology as well as accounting policies to recognise bad loans. Let there not be a tearing hurry to merge."

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad,"BREAKING RECORDS

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad

• Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:47 AM Rob Johnston in Birmingham

Broad admitted it was extra special to have moved passed Botham - one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. © Getty

Stuart Broad admitted that it was a special feeling to become England's second-highest Test wicket-taker on the final day of the first Test against Windies at Edgbaston. When Broad bowled Shane Dowrich in the evening session of the final day with a ball that nipped back sharply, he moved to 384 Test wickets, overtaking Sir Ian Botham in the list of England's highest Test wicket-takers. James Anderson, Broad's great friend and opening partner, leads the list with 492 Test wickets.

""It's a really special day,"" Broad said on Saturday (August 19). ""I felt really good in that little spell of bowling [on the final evening]. It was probably the best 40 minutes of bowling I've had this summer."" After a frustrating start to Windies' innings - he had two catches dropped on the second evening - Broad's rewards came quickly as he took the five wickets he needed to overtake Botham across two of the visitors' innings on the third day.

It was, Broad admitted, extra special to have moved passed Botham, one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. ""He's someone who has been a big influence on me, playing with my Dad, watching some of his performances against Australia,"" he said. ""He is a huge legend of English cricket but someone who has given back to this team. I was fortunate to get my first cap off him in 2007.

""In the past couple of years, he's spent more and more time in the changing room and guys really listen to him. He's someone who's passionate about English cricket and wants us to do well. I could tell he was genuinely proud and delighted that I've managed to go past him. That's testament to him,"" he added.

Broad has bowled well this summer without the rewards to show for it. He took just 11 wickets against South Africa but looked in good rhythm throughout that series and had not been unduly worried about his form. ""I feel like I've been threatening and creating chances,"" Broad said. ""If I save all my wickets for Australia I don't mind,"" he said.

On the third day in Birmingham, he picked up two wickets in the Windies' first innings and three in the second, bowling a full length at good pace. He took 3-17 in a seven-over spell in the final session which was somewhat reminiscent of some of the magical spells Broad has delivered during his Test career to date.

After dismissing Roston Chase and captain Jason Holder in successive balls, leaving him in joint second place with Botham, Broad could have gone passed the former all-rounder in style. The Edgbaston crowd willed him on but Broad's hat-trick ball was resolutely blocked by Kemar Roach although Dowrich was dismissed soon after.

Broad, who has played 107 Tests, is probably not given the credit he deserves for his exploits. His 384 wickets have come at the impressive average of 28.47 and he has taken 15 five-wicket hauls and two ten-fors. He will go down as one of England's finest-ever fast bowlers and it is perhaps his misfortune that his career has coincided with that of Anderson. Had it not, he may have got even more plaudits.

At 31, Broad will have plenty of opportunity to add to his haul. His injury record has been generally good and provided he stays fit and is managed well, achieving 500 Test wickets is by no means out of the question. ""I still feel like I've got quite a lot of cricket left in me,"" he said. ""I'm really enjoying being a part of this team at the moment. I'd certainly hope that my performances will keep improving so I'd be part of that 2019 Ashes. I'm not someone who looks too far ahead because I think it slows you down as a performer. You don't know if you'll have the luck with injuries.

""I play cricket for the competitive side of it. I love that feeling of being in a battle, that feeling with the new ball, getting an opening batsman out and they're desperate to

survive. That's the reason I play. I'll play as long as that drive is there. It's still within me now. As soon as that goes, I'll know that I'm gone.""

Broad is best known for the magic spells that have defined his career; his 8-15 against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2015, 6-17 against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2016, 5-37 against Australia at the Oval in 2009. Perhaps because of those standout performances, his consistency is often overlooked. Not since 2012 has he averaged more than 30 runs per wicket in a calendar year.

""My career has always been a little bit like that,"" Broad said. ""Pick up a two-fer, a two-fer and then get a six-fer out of nowhere."" Can he sense when he is on the cusp of one of those spells? ""I sort of can. I do feel light in my run-up. I make the batsmen play every ball. When I don't get it quite right, I get pushed in to fifth stump and get left. I really don't like being left, it feels like a waste of a run-up. I love batsmen playing forward defensives at me because if I get any sort of nibble, it brings both sides in.""

Broad will be a key player for England in this winter's Ashes, a series he thinks is going to be ""a belter"". Although, if England's management are considering resting him from one of the next two Tests against Windies to save him for Australia, they might have to think again. ""I will be politely suggesting that I will have sufficient rest in September and October to be available for the next two Tests against West Indies,"" he said.

"Doctors in convoys: Specialists’ lives on line, patients ignored, Health News, ET HealthWorld","CHENNAI: On April 26, 2003, when DMK president M Karunanidhi slumped midway through a speech in Coimbatore, two doctors from his convoy rushed to his aid — only to meet the brawny chest of a security guard. Karunanidhi was rushed to a private hospital as the medical team watched from a few feet away.Little has changed since for doctors deputed to VIP entourages as they continue to fight for basic facilities and respect while on duty. Last week, the death of a cardiologist in an accident while going to join the chief minister’s motorcade, has prompted a group of government doctors to write to the director of medical education, questioning the practice of sending specialists on convoy duty and the lack of guidelines to ensure their safety.From travelling in ambulances that struggle to keep pace with SUV-led cavalcades, to scouting for food and accommodation, to being sidelined on those rare occasions when their services are required — doctors say there is little dignity in being on convoy duty.""Everyone talks about a ‘Blue Book’ with guidelines on who should be part of a VVIP ’s convoy but few know what it says,"" said Dr A Ramalingam, state organising secretary, Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association. Though many are accompanied by their personal physicians, a team of doctors, including specialists, are deputed from a government college in Chennai. Another group from district hospitals joins the convoy when it passes through their zone. ""All these doctors attend to an average of 150 patients in government hospitals daily,"" said Ramalingam.At present, doctors are deputed based on what the police demands, said a senior health official, adding that the department does not have a list of those entitled to have a medical team. ""There have been several instances where we’ve had to pull out doctors on outpatient duty for convoy assignments, which vary from four hours to two days,"" said the official.The biggest problem is conveyance. A doctor in Madurai recalled a 2014 incident when seven doctors from Government Rajaji Hospital were bundled into a car that could accommodate five people, including the driver. They were accompanying a former President during his visit to Rameswaram. ""The old car could barely keep pace with the convoy. When the driver applied brakes, a doctor was injured,"" he said. When the team finally arrived at the destination, two hours after the convoy, they struggled to get close to the former President because of the surging crowd.A senior assistant professor in general surgery at Stanley medical college narrated his ordeal when in 2015 he was deputed to accompany the then Tamil Nadu governor to Neyveli to attend a wedding. The ambulance broke down in Tindivanam. ""We finally went in a van, sitting on top of the governor’s store supplies,"" said the doctor.Several doctors had a harrowing story to tell. One recalled driving away a cow that had sneaked up behind a public figure, only to be shooed by the leader’s aides.Doctors’ associations say while it is the state’s duty to provide doctors to VVIPs in case of emergencies, they have to be deputed wisely.The director of medical education Dr Edwin Joe said he had got representations to streamline the process. ""We will be writing to the department concerned,"" he said."
‘SC’s decision will liberate Muslim women … if Parliament wants to reform personal laws it has full rights to do so’,"Arif Mohammad Khan famously quit in protest as minister of state in the Rajiv Gandhi government after the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986, which overturned the Supreme Court’s historic Shah Bano judgment giving maintenance to a divorced Muslim woman. He made an impassioned parliamentary defence of the Shah Bano judgment, the last such landmark case on Muslim women preceding the Supreme Court’s latest 3:2 judgment which has ruled instant triple talaq as unconstitutional, before resigning. Khan spoke to Rohit E David and Nalin Mehta on how ‘talaq-e-biddat’ violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women, gender equality and reforms in Muslim personal laws:

How do you read the Supreme Court’s judgment on triple talaq?

The abolition of triple talaq by the Supreme Court is a big victory. I welcome this verdict. I honestly feel that we are not in a position today to make a realistic assessment of the positive fallout this judgment would have on the future of Muslims.

If a divorce between a Muslim man and woman has to happen, it will take place. The real problem was that a Muslim girl grows with this consciousness that after marriage her husband can turn her out of the house by simply saying triple talaq. This was really oppressive for Muslim women. This apparent law on triple talaq had distorted the minds of the Muslim world. Now, they will see a new Muslim community growing up in India which will not have the fear of triple talaq among them.

With the abolition of this law, Muslim ladies will have the courage to report against their husbands, if they abuse or mistreat them.

Is the Supreme Court’s ruling that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women a great victory for progressive Muslims?

This is a great victory for every Muslim woman. The Supreme Court has held this decision to be arbitrary. Now, when it comes under the arbitrary category, this cannot come under the fundamental rights of a Muslim. I have not read the judgment in detail but there is six months’ time for the government to bring up detailed legislation.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been opposing the abolition of triple talaq. Do you think they are on the wrong side of history?

In 1986, their decision was different but in the Supreme Court whatever Kapil Sibal has said on their behalf, particularly the affidavit which was submitted when the arguments were concluded, is different. They have also recognised that it was an unjust practice and they want to abolish this practice.

The Muslim Personal Law Board had said that Parliament has the authority. If it wants to reform the laws, it has full rights to do so. Their new stand is totally different from the position they took in 1986.

Isn’t this decision a great step for gender equality?

Yes, absolutely. It will not only liberate Muslim women from the threat of triple divorce but it will also impart a sense of equality and empowerment.

Doesn’t this judgment by the apex court make Indian Muslim personal law more compatible with personal laws relating to marriage and divorce in orthodox Islamic countries?

Of course. Almost all Muslim countries have already got rid of this practice. Triple talaq was undoubtedly part of their practices earlier. Now, this law finds no standing in any court. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh which had the same laws on triple talaq had reformed their laws in the 1990s. It was high time, and thankfully India has done this now.

The last time triple talaq was held problematic in the Shah Bano case, it was overturned by Parliament and you resigned. Have your views been vindicated?

I don’t look at this whole issue from the view point of my personal vindication. I’m very happy that oppression and suppression which was being practised in the name of religion has come to an end.

Do you think that a section of Muslim clerics is holding back progressive reforms?

Try to understand the Muslim religion. My message is we should not hold back progressive reforms."
"compensation claim: Cairn Energy adds another $249 mn to compensation claim from India, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: British oil explorer Cairn Energy plc has added another USD 249 million to the compensation it is claiming from India after the government set off a tax refund due to it to settle part of a retrospective tax demand. Cairn had before an international arbitration tribunal in July last year sought USD 5.6 billion in compensation from the Indian government for raising a retrospective tax demand of Rs 10,247 crore on a decade old internal reorganisation of its India unit.In its half-year financial and operations statement, the company said the government had raised Rs 18,800 crore as interest on the principal tax demand. The interest demand was quashed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.""Following that, the Income Tax Department issued a revised demand including interest running from February 2016 i.e. 30 days after the date of the assessment order. That interest currently amounts to Rs 1,440 crore (approximately USD 224 million),"" the statement said.To recover this, the tax department ""seized"" USD 104.7 million of dividend income due to it from Vedanta Ltd, where it holds about 5 per cent stake, Cairn said, adding it has since written off the dividend income.""A tax refund in respect of financial year 2011-12 in the amount of Rs 1,590 crore (USD 249 million) which became due to Cairn as a consequence of a successful appeal by the company to the Delhi High Court has also been directed to the Income Tax Department to be set against the 2006-07 (retrospective tax) liability and Cairn's claims under the international arbitration have been adjusted to include this,"" it said.The company said it commenced international arbitration proceedings against India under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2015 for ""expropriating Cairn's property without adequate and just compensation, denying fair and equitable treatment to Cairn in respect of its investments and restricting Cairn's right to freely transfer funds in connection with its investment.""Cairn's holding in Vedanta Ltd has been attached by the Income Tax Department.In its Statement of Claim before the arbitration tribunal, the company said it has stated that applying the retrospective amendment and seizing USD 1 billion worth of shares was in breach of the Treaty's requirements of fair and equitable treatment and its protections against expropriation.""Cairn has asked the arbitration panel either to order India to withdraw its unlawful tax demand and compensate Cairn for the harm suffered by the seizure of the shares, being not less than USD 1.1 billion (plus costs); or, if the tax demand remains in place, compensate Cairn for the quantum of the tax assessment and the harm suffered by the seizure of the shares. These claims were subsequently updated to include the USD 249 million tax refund,"" the statement said.The company said based on detailed legal advice, it is confident that it will be successful in such arbitration.""The total assets of Cairn have a current value of USD 863.1 million (comprising principally the group's shareholding in Vedanta Ltd) and any recovery by the Indian authorities would be limited to such assets,"" the statement added."
Infosys crisis: Are we soft on never-go-letters?,"Everybody and their auntie are having a go with their sharp stick at the Right Honourable N R Narayana Murthy. The man’s a kook, they say, putting a Chosen One on the Iron Throne and then treating him like a bekaar damaad. That NRN, once having decided (twice, actually) to walk into the sunset, is once again caught acting like a ‘benevolent well-wisher’ from some Spartan I’m-not-Vijay Mallya getaway and pulling the strings till the puppet decides to walk away.

That Master Yoda is the one who needs to walk away — and stay walked away — has been the general consensus from the chorus line. I mean, who likes the younger generation to be brought in with moderate fanfare, and then have the same younger generation (slightly older by then) shunted, for, well, being young and stupid? Answer: India 2017.

Being stupid is what NRN has really been accusing Vishal Sikka, handpicked as MD-CEO in the summer of 2014, of. According to Murthy and his fellow Infytainers, Sikka is responsible for Infosys becoming a spluttering train. If Clark ‘Nagavara Ramarao’ Kent had not coaxed himself into bringing Murthyman out of retirement, the spluttering train was sure to become a train wreck, goes one theory.

But my heart, despite all the flak he’s facing, goes out to NRN. It’s not because I don’t agree with his critics. Yes, Sikka’s Infosys ship isn’t the same Infosys raft that the Seven Samurai led by Murthy-san launched from the harbour in 1981. For starters, the software field had only a handful of players to contend with. Plus, the post-BPO world of technology has changed faster than Infy may have had.

Also, Infosys was really a startup before any startup invented the word ‘startup’. So, making the rules then was more fun than keeping the rules now. And despite the mantra about ‘Learning how to fail, learning from the failures’ blahblahblah, Indians, especially India Inc, still don’t like rules being (seen to be) broken, and are loath to allow things to fail. Intervention is a constant nanny in the form of concerned ‘elders’ in the background, or pusillanimous gatekeepers in the front.

But let’s face it. Is Murthyman the only one who likes holding on to the reins even when he has passed them on? More importantly, is our culture not a wee bit bonkers when it comes to allowing‘elders’ to linger, and then meddle so that they can have their cake, eat it, and then complain about the icing too?

Amitabh Bachchan, thankfully, picks and chooses his roles better these days. But I remember a whole decade when toupée not in hand, he was offered roles — which he accepted — that fit him as snugly as a glove fits a goat. Even as an admirer of Sachin Tendulkar’s cover drive, the less said about how he reached his 100th international century, courtesy the BCSCI (Board of Control for Sachin’s Cricket to Inspire), the better.

In politics, of course, we find the original trendsetters. Any politician saying that he or she will now make way for ‘new blood’ either has no clue about transfusion, or is making a strategic move. Let’s just say that in the Congress, this rule applies if your surname happens to be the same as Sonia Gandhi’s. A free hand given to aScindia or a Pilot or even a Singh is as plausible as the queen of England making way for her eldest son while she (and he) is still alive.

In the BJP government, the ‘holding on to the reins’ quality is marked by the quantum of policymaking-andbreaking powers ministers have in aShah-sprayed Modi government.

That could, perhaps, maybe, possibly explain the current disinterest in the impending Cabinet reshuffle. In regional parties, too, sharing responsibilities, or passing the pillow, down the ranks of Didis and the ghosts of Ammas is not just frowned upon, but proactively resisted as the recipe for ‘chaos’.

We like our busybody taus the same way we extol our workaholics. So, if Murthyman is singled out as a demagogic Nerd-Uncle, it’s a bit rich.

In the world of films, the Lifetime Achievement Award is given to someone who has crossed his creative pinnacle and reached his creative tether. To drive the message home, this award simultaneously recognises his greatness as well as implores him to take a back seat, preferably of a bus and not a car.

In politics, with governorships and presidencies becoming increasingly political, something new is needed for the over(long)-ambitious. In business, the most anarchic of ‘industries’, we are yet to change how we treat our founders and family minders.

So, till then, before you can say hello to Cyrus the Great and Tata to Xerxes, be prepared for more NRNs not leaving the stage, whether sulking, kicking or squealing."
"Rosneft says Essar Oil deal will enable entry in one of the fastest growing markets, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Russian oil major Rosneft today said its acquisition of 49 per cent stake in Essar Oil will enable the oil producer entry in one of the fastest growing markets and it stands to gain from the over 3,500 retail pumps operated by Essar in India on the back of pricing deregulation of the country’s retail oil market.In a statement issued today, Rosneft said with the successful closure of the strategic deal for the acquisition of 49 per cent of Essar, “a platform for further development of international trading – entering the high premium markets of the Asia Pacific region and South East Asia has been created.”The company said it has successfully closed strategic transaction for the acquisition of 49.13 per cent of shares of Essar Oil Limited (EOL) from Essar Energy Holdings Limited (EOL) and its affiliates. An investment consortium comprising Trafigura and UCP has also announced the closure of their acquisition of a separate 49.13 per cent share of EOL.Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin said the completion of the deal marks the beginning of a new chapter for EOL. “Together with our partners we intend to support the company to significantly improve its financial performance and, in the medium term, adopt an asset development strategy,” he said.Sechin added the closing of the deal is a remarkable achievement for Rosneft too as the Company has entered the high-potential and fast-growing Asia Pacific market. “The acquisition of the stake in the Vadinar refinery creates unique opportunities of synergies with existing Rosneft-owned assets and will help improve efficiency of supply to other countries within the region,” he said.The company clarified in the statement the price parameters of the deal are in line with the legally binding agreements signed previously. The Vadinar refinery of Essar is a high-tech project equipped with all the necessary infrastructure with a refining throughput of 20 million tonne, Nelson complexity index of 11.8 and a conversion rate of 95.5 per cent, it said.The Vadinar refinery possesses high feedstock flexibility with heavy grades from Latin America accounting for more than half of all the feedstock processed. The refinery’s configuration is one of the most technologically complicated in the Asia-Pacific region and has significant prospects for expansion in development of the petrochemical production.“The availability of all the necessary infrastructure (a deep-water port, storage terminals and own power station are part of the transaction), as well as Rosneft’s shares in upstream projects in Venezuela and working offtake contracts with PDVSA will provide Rosneft with significant operational synergies and help improve the refinery’s economics. A further synergy will be derived from cross-supplies of oil products to Asia Pacific markets,” Rosneft said.The Russian oil major also said Essar Oil’s vast retail network of 3,500 pumps will improve the assets operational and financial performance thanks to the steadily growing local demand high value-added oil products and EOL’s retail development strategy.According to International Energy Agency (IEA), from 2000 onwards, motor fuel consumption in India grew on average 6.8 per cent annually. IEA predicts that by 2040 India’s automotive sector will be consuming 132 million tonne of oil equivalent (mmtoe) of oil products annually."
Neymar Lands In Trouble As Barcelona Demand 8.5 Million Euros From Him Over Contract Breach,"Barcelona are seeking at least 8.5 million euros ($10 million) from Neymar for breach of contract, the club said as the bitter fallout rumbles on from his world record 222-million-euro move to Paris Saint-Germain.

afp

""In this lawsuit, the club demands the amount already paid as a bonus for the renewal of his contract for breach of contract, 8.5 million euros in damages, and an additional 10 percent in interests,"" Barcelona said in a statement.

afp

Neymar signed a new five-year deal with Barca in 2016, but the Catalans were powerless to stop his move to PSG just a year later as the French side met the buyout clause in his contract. Barca added the demand was lodged against Neymar on August 11 with Barcelona's employment court, eight days after his stunning move to Ligue 1.

The Catalan giants have also passed the claim onto FIFA and the French Football Federation via the Spanish Football Federation to take what they see as ""the appropriate legal effects"".

ap

Moreover, Barca urged PSG to pay the amount they are seeking if Neymar -- who is reported to earn 30 million euros after tax for the next five years in Paris -- isn't able to meet their demands.

The club's latest move comes two days after Neymar fiercely criticised Barcelona's under-fire board after scoring twice in a stunning home debut as PSG beat Toulouse 6-2 on Sunday.

""There are people in charge that shouldn't be there,"" Neymar told reporters.

reuters

""Barca deserve much more and everyone knows that.""

Barcelona have also withheld a 26 million euro bonus due to Neymar for signing the renewal to his contract last year.

Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
"Online medical education: Medvarsity launches online MBA programme in healthcare management, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: To provide education in hospital and healthcare management Medvarsity , an online medical education company, has signed an MoU with Amity University , under which a two-year MBA programme will be offered through online medium. The online management programme will also involve an internship at affiliated institutions like Apollo Hospitals and Columbia Asia hospitals.The course is already available online for this year’s enrolments. Over 300 enquiries have already been received by the online medical education company. “We strive to provide quality education to professionals in the healthcare industry and this programme will bring in that quality for MBA aspirants in healthcare. We believe that the course has a huge potential in terms of generating industry ready professionals. MBA is already one of the most sought after programmes in the higher education space in India. We expect this to be one of our top 5 programmes in the next two years,” said Gerald Jaideep , CEO, Medvarsity.The partnership between Medvarsity and Amity University is currently signed for three years but both the institutions look forward to a longer association. “Healthcare has become one of the largest sectors in India -- both in terms of revenue and employment, with market size of over $100 billion with 15% estimated growth every year. The industry has a huge potential for employment. We will ensure that students are educated about the course and employment opportunities across the country, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities,” said Ajit Chauhan, Vice Chairman, Amity University Online.Talking about challenges, Chauhan said, “We don’t really see a challenge in programme delivery. The internship programme will present a strong proposition for students. However, what we really need to focus is on programme awareness and possible career opportunities for students. Since MBA with specialization in healthcare management is still at a nascent stage in comparison to other specialization programmes in healthcare and therefore it needs more awareness education among students.”This year, Medvarsity has also partnered with Cornell University to provide online certification programmes in healthcare education."

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
"IBC SOLAR signs contract with SECI for 20 MW solar plant in Odisha, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Germany-based solar company IBC SOLAR AG has signed a Power Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) for a 20 megawatt (MW) solar plant with Solar Energy Corporation of India ( SECI ), a company of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the company said on Tuesday.The project is part of a 270 MW solar power plant tender in the state of Odisha which was assigned to IBC SOLAR through a competitive auction process during 2016.

"PPA renegotiation by discoms may adversely impact RE sector growth: ICRA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Recent attempts by state-owned power distribution utilities ( discoms ) in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh to renegotiate or cancel signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with wind and solar power developers could have an adverse impact on the renewable energy (RE) sector, credit ratings agency ICRA has said.If implemented, the renegotiation could also impact the credit profile of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and investment interest from the private sector, the agency said. “Significant uncertainty exists for wind-based IPPs which have recently signed PPAs based on feed-in tariffs. The same is estimated to be about 830 MW in Andhra Pradesh and 490 MW in Karnataka. Such cancellation or renegotiation, if finalized by discoms, may be legally challenged by the affected IPPs and the resolution of the same could be a protracted affair,” Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head, ICRA said.He, however, added that the agency understands the centre is trying to dissuade state discoms from such unilateral action on PPAs.Apart from this, several PPAs tied-up by wind and solar power developers with state-owned discoms do not have any termination penalty clause related to any discom in the event of default, the report stated. These PPAs usually do not have any deemed generation clause and are based on single part tariff – which is linked to actual generation.“As a result, the wind and solar energy projects with PPAs at a relatively higher tariff in comparison with average power purchase cost of the off-taker discom remains exposed to a risk of forced back-down / grid curtailment, a situation which has occasionally been seen in a few states in the past,” the report said.This also comes at a time reverse auction-based bidding mechanism has helped in lowering the wind power tariffs under the 1,000 MW scheme by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE). It has prompted discoms to stop signing PPAs based on feed-in tariff and instead opt for the auction route.“The visibility for actual wind-based capacity addition remains quite weak in near term.

"Energy Transfer Partners sues Greenpeace over Dakota pipeline, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Valerie Volcovici

Energy Transfer Partners LP on Tuesday sued Greenpeace and other environmental groups, accusing them of launching an ""eco-terrorism"" campaign aimed at blocking the Dakota Access Pipeline, the center of months of opposition by Native American and green groups. The pipeline operator said Greenpeace, Earth First and other organizations engaged in ""acts of terrorism"" to solicit donations and interfere with its pipeline construction activities, damaging its ""critical business and financial relationships.""

ETP said the groups' actions and negative publicity against it, its sister company Energy Transfer Equity LP and other firms caused billions of dollars in damages.

Greenpeace USA General Counsel Tom Wetterer said the company's lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Bismarck, North Dakota, ""abuse(d) the legal system to silence legitimate advocacy work.""

In May the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline began interstate crude oil delivery, but a federal appeals court judge in June ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider its environmental review of the line, opening up the possibility that the line could be shut at a later date.

In its 231-page filing, Energy Transfer accused Greenpeace and groups like Bank Track and the Bold Alliance of ""manufacturing a media spectacle"" around Dakota Access pipeline opposition.

The company said environmentalists approached the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the public face of the months-long fight against the pipeline, and used it to wage a battle against the project.

ETP said environmental groups ""cynically planted radical, violent eco-terrorists on the ground amongst the protesters, and directly funded their operations and publicly urged their supporters to do the same.""

Energy Transfer is being represented by the Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman law firm, whose founding partner Marc Kasowitz is President Donald Trump's lawyer.

Greenpeace said this is the second time Kasowitz's firm has gone after the group. Last year it represented Resolute Forest Products in a defamation lawsuit brought by the global logging company against Greenpeace. Wetterer said that ""complaint repackages spurious allegations and legal claims.""

The case is Energy Transfer Equity LP v. Greenpeace International, 17-cv-173, U.S. District Court, District of North Dakota (Bismark)."
"Morocco’s Africa Vision: Shun politics, shared development is key to continental prosperity","The recent speech of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and People – an important event in Moroccan history – laid out a grand vision for Africa. It will be recalled that Morocco returned to the African Union (AU) earlier this year after more than three decades of self-imposed exclusion. But the Kingdom’s return to the African institutional family is not going to be an end in itself. This is something that King Mohammed made amply clear in his speech that dwelled on the need to unite Africa for shared security and prosperity.

King Mohammed said, “Now is the time for action. And Morocco keenly looks forward to continuing the efforts it has been exerting in Africa for more than fifteen years”, adding further, “Reintegration into the AU is but the start of a new era of joint action with all African countries in order to build a genuine, solidarity-based partnership, ensure – together – our continent’s development and meet the needs of African citizens. We are currently in the process of building an Africa that believes in itself, is committed to solidarity and rallies behind concrete projects while being open to its surroundings”. In fact, Morocco has been championing South-South cooperation for some time now. The idea here is to build mutually beneficial partnerships and find African solutions for African problems.

The implied meaning of King Mohammed’s speech is that Morocco’s return to the AU will galvanise the institution as the Kingdom will leave no stone unturned to facilitate common development, transfer of knowledge and boost intra-regional investments. Morocco has already demonstrated its resolve in this direction by conceptualising and actualising significant development projects like the proposed Morocco-Nigeria Trans-African gas pipeline, the construction of fertiliser plants in Ethiopia and Nigeria, and the myriad human development initiatives in the countries of the Sahel.

Why is this important? Africa is the place from where the next global growth push will come. The continent’s rising middle class combined with improving governance structures lays the foundation for solid consumption/investment-driven development. However, there are challenges that Africa must overcome first. These range from security threats and political instability to basics such as insufficient food production and clean drinking water. But today the technology is available for Africa to leapfrog some of the stages of development and catapult itself into a veritable growth hub. It is here that Morocco’s technical knowhow and experience come in handy.

What Morocco is seeking to do is plug the gaps in Africa’s development. It’s doing this through boosting fertiliser production in sister African nations, strengthening healthcare facilities in partner countries, and financing entrepreneurship in brotherly states. Further, it has been providing huge scholarships to African students as an investment on the youth of the continent. All of these measures go to show that Morocco is serious about shared African prosperity and will continue to power African growth from within the AU.

African nations ought to realise that they can’t succeed as individuals. The only way they can move forward is through genuine win-win partnerships. Hence, they would do well to heed Morocco’s vision for Africa, set aside differences and artificial disputes, and fulfil their destiny as a continent of prosperity."
A delightful 3-course Mediterranean meal,"Tart tatin

A delightful upside-down version of apple pie



Ingredients

50 g unsalted butter

1/2 vanilla pod, seeds only

50 g caster sugar

150 g puff pastry

6 apples, peeled, cored and halved



Method

Preheat the oven to 200° C. Press the butter and vanilla seeds into an oven-safe pan, so that the base is covered. Sprinkle with sugar and shake to spread evenly. Set aside.

Roll the pastry out on a floured work surface to a 3 to 4 mm thickness and cut one disk 1 to 2 cm bigger than the diameter of the pan. Leave in refrigerator to rest.

Arrange the apples in the pan, with the narrowest side of the apple on the bottom. Leave two pieces of apple to insert later.

Place the pan over low heat and caramelise until it becomes dark all round. Carefully add the remaining apple pieces as the cooked ones shrink.

Remove pan from heat and put the puff pastry on top. Using a spoon, tuck the pastry along the sides of the apples.

Place the saucepan on an oven tray, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. If your pastry is very thick it will require a longer cooking time.

Let the tart tatin rest for 5 to 8 minutes, cover with a serving dish, and quickly turn the pan upside down to turn out the tart tatin.

Serve with ice cream.

"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."

Worship Is Work,"Does God favour those who attend to their work in factories and offices, or those who sit for long in puja, wonder UMA RAM and K S RAM



Afavourite home-assignment for pupils in schools till some decades ago was to write an essay on ‘Work is Worship’. The teacher made the task easy by describing the contours of the essay:True worship lies in doing work.We should work hard.We should not waste time in idle (idol?) worship.She almost suggested that God favours those who bend their backs and attend to their work in the factories and offices,rather than those who sit for long in puja. Few of us (including the teachers who set the assignment) ever suspected the politics that went into this seemingly simple exercise. Few of us could have suspected that it was part of the Macaulian manipulation of education in India that aimed to produce an army of ever-ready servants for the government. In a land known for sedentary ways of life revolving around stretched pujas and innumerable special days for festive duty and special service, such spiritual re-engineering was necessary for developing human resources to uphold the Raj. There is probably nothing in our scriptures or in the scriptures of any major religion anywhere to support the idea that work is worship. In fact, there is good evidence to suggest the opposite: that worship is work in the real sense.Krishna describes this in his discourse on action and inaction.



‘He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action truly sees, he tells Arjuna. Sarva’rambha parityaga, renouncement of all initiatives is declared a virtue in one who is coursing ahead on the spiritual highway. Let life unfold itself and do with disinterested diligence the tasks that such unfolding presents for you. Religion began as magic.It,in fact, continues to be so. An incense stick waved around a symbol of godhead is essentially an act of waving the magic wand for a good day ahead.The day unfolds the will of God. Work presents itself and it is perfectly in order to perform it to the best of one’s ability as service in the will of God.To initiate work, or to avoid the task that has presented itself before you would mean meddling with God’s action plan. He knows, we don’t.To surrender to his action plan is true work. Work, as we understand it, is the elaborate, tedious striving to secure livelihood. Our ancients realised that there can be another way of securing it. This is through symbolic action, a kind of magic, better understood as worship. The Karma Kanda in the Vedas is essentially a manual of magic to help achieve life’s purposes. Creation itself is magic. In the Book of Genesis, God sees darkness and says, let it be day, and it was day. To say is to do.Worship is a mild simulation of such magic.Worship is not counter to work.Worship is work.To learn this is to learn the art of living. The real challenge, though, lies in understanding worship.Worship can be self-defeating if it is fruit-centric. One can be damned by getting one’s prayers answered. Rabindranath Tagore thanks God for the blessing of frustrating his prayers time and again. True worship lies in joyous surrender to the will of God.



Again, it is important to know as to who is the object of worship. Hinduism is often criticised for entertaining numberless demigods. What is missed is that there exists a great unity among this seeming diversity. All services reach the One God. But the results are according to the intermediate demigod to whom the service was directed. The message is clear:focus on the Ultimate One God, even as you worship and propitiate a demigod. Worship need not always be physical. Ideal worship is mental, whether accompanied by physical acts or not. And, a subtle instruction is that worship is not for one’s own pleasure but for the pleasure of God.And it is an incessant engagement, not a fixed hour ritual.The comfort God promises to such an unwavering devotee — nitya’bhiyukta — is: ‘Securing your mundane well-being is my concern — yoga’kshemam vahamyaham.’

"Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes, arthritis commercialised: Government, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket.

5 places in the house for a perfect quickie,"Having sex need not be a nocturnal affair every time, and neither does it need to have a fixed time. The mood for some naughty-naughty can set in any time, and that's when a quickie comes into play. But quickies in bed sound so mainstream. Why not pep up the act by choosing some cosy corners? We give you five really cool yet off-beat nooks in the house for a quick sex sesh:

On the rug

Watching a romcom together might trigger the urge for a quick and passionate nookie. While making out on the couch is an easy option, why not try something new by moving to the rug? Try out some hot postures and drive him crazy with your moves.

Shower

Having a shower together after a long, tiring day can be bliss. Making out in the shower to steam up the scene is heavenly. Let the warm water trickling down your body add to the already hot situation.

Bean bag

Sure, it's one comfy place to curl up with a book and coffee. But did you know, it can double up as the perfect setting for sex. Soft and cosy, the bean bag lends you the option to try different positions too.

Against the cupboard

And you thought it was only for storing your clothes? Cupboards make for the perfect backdrop for the irresistible, gotta-do-it-now kind of sex. And guess what! A cupboard with a mirror is an add-on, as the two of you get to watch each other in the act, thus turning up the kink level.

Rocking chair

Reading all those mushy lines of your favourite romance novel has left you craving for him, hasn’t it? Lure him with some suggestive moves and rock your way to some hot sex. All the rocking will help for deeper penetration, too. Sounds fun right!"

“The Supreme Courts against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in secular India,” Shabana Azmi told TOI. Farhan Akhtar also expressed his happiness on the same. “The way the society is moving forward, the focus that is there on women’s rights and equality, and the fight for gender equality. It is very healthy that such a decision has been made. Now there is a >six month window to figure out how it should be translated into a law, I hope it happens. Because it is a very archaic practice, it is time for it to go.”

In an interview to Hindustan Times, Toshi said, “Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don’t know about us. Hamare bachche ke bare mein humein pata hai naah ki hamara bacha kaisa hai! Uska nature hai waisa… Agle hi pal woh khelne chali jaati hai. Agar aap usko chod do toh woh kahengi main mazzak kar rahi thi. Uske nature ki wajah se chod denge toh woh padai bhi nahi kar paayengi.”

In the last episode, the Night King had killed the dragon and turned him into a Wight--the ice dragon. Since then all the discussions are revolving around the Night King, the cold-hearted evil who leads the army of the dead. While fans say they loved Richard Brake more in the role, still Twitter is going gaga over Vladimir Furdik AKA the Night King, who they think is a hottie."
Donald Trump’s latest Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy: Not much South Asian comfort,"By Pinaki Bhattacharya

It was touted as the latest US strategy towards South Asia. And, we were told by US Secretary of Defence James Mattis, that the Camp David meeting last weekend was a culmination of many months of review of US policies for the Afghanistan quagmire. So, expectations were high in the four capitals of Kabul, Islamabad, New Delhi and Beijing.

But US President Donald J Trump let South Asia down. He talked about an increased US commitment to Afghanistan — more boots on the ground. There were no numbers mentioned of fresh troop deployment, for that is a potential minefield in hyper-ventilating Washington.

US House of Representative SpeakerPaul Ryan, who was briefed earlier about what to expect from Trump’s current trumpeteering, almost called it prescient that the US President has called the latest strategy to be not time-based but “based on condition” —which means, as Trump explained, “condition on the ground”.

Lessons on conflict resolution state that one needs to divine an acceptable‘ end state’ before one sets the conflict-machine chugging. But it seems that Republican presidencies have not learnt the studied moves of the Nixon-Kissinger team. Instead, they seem as expansive as the Reagan administration that was too busy defeating the Soviet Union, thus making itself hostage to the Chinese economic miracle.

Which meant Ronald Reagan’s successor, George H W Bush, losing his presidency to ‘It’s the economy, stupid!’ rhetoric of Bill Clinton. The burgeoning US public debt that Beijing continued to feed — as reflected in the trade surpluses — shows in the lack of ‘strategic autonomy’ that Washington had enjoyed since World War 2.

George W Bush tried his hand in unilateralism, but ended up going down in American history books as a creator of not one, but two Vietnam wars in Af-Pak and Iraq.

Trump’s speech was devoid of any substance that could stir up the Indian subcontinent’s own ‘studio empire-builders’ to reach for their TV microphones.

And what did Trump tell Pakistan that could make the tinpot generals of Rawalpindi quake in their boots? “In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: we must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.”

Boilerplate words those. Thus, shorn of the finesse of a leader like Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s generals would rather have Beijing continuing its indulgence and play mediator for them.

Trump’s speech does very little for the confidence level of New Delhi, which is watching each muscle of the latest actor on the stage of Indo-US relations. There will be a holding operation that would be launched in New Delhi in the wake of this speech.

Not much extra commitment of India’s foreign exchange dollars will flow that Trump was hopeful of steering to Afghanistan. Of course India wouldbe doing its ‘best’. But that ‘best’ would fall short of Trump’s expectations.

So, this speech was really about the domestic audience: not Trump’s own white- and blue-collar electoral base, but the Establishment, whose leading lights are now firmly in the Indiancamp.

This was evident in the penultimate days of the Barack Obama administration when former Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter got the ‘blank cheque’ of the Defence Authorisation Act passed by the US Congress. That may have evoked some fraught memories. But Pentagon can play around with it, military-industrial complex or no military-industrial complex."

"Varian Medical Systems: Today we need to build trust that comes through transparency and credibility in engagement with patients: Ashok Kakkar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Co-chair, FICCI Health Services Community andManaging Director,, Mumbai, talks about the highlight of FICCI HEAL Conference 2017 and shares his views on the recent healthcare amendments. Edited excerpts:If you look at the Indian healthcare scenario today, there are some excellent examples of patient centricity and excellence in care. Today India ranks almost at par with Western models when it comes to quality healthcare at affordable cost. Yet we also hear almost on a daily basis that today the Indian healthcare scenario lacks trust and the way the patients and the general consumers perceive especially the private healthcare with lot of suspicion. So I think, first and foremost what the sector needs to do and what the Indian hospitals need to do, is to build trust which comes through transparency and credibility in their engagement with their patients. The second piece, which again is corollary to the first one is how does hospitals today empower patients, whether it is through technology or otherwise and make them participate in the decision-making in the health decision-making and not treat it as a transaction or an episodial situation when a patient comes to the hospital he is discharged and then, you know, it’s all done with. It’s very important to ensure that the followships-survivorships are closely linked and patient remains in the center of the decision-making.FICCI is an excellent platform for exchange of ideas, where thought leaders both from public as well as private sectors engage and work towards betterment of the industry, and in this case in Healthcare sector. FICCI has very actively worked on issues of industry, working with the government whether it was related to taxation, custom duties, penetration of healthcare insurance in this country, and now we will look at the scenario around price-controls or standard treatment guidelines, public-private partnerships. So there are bunch of areas where FICCI has, and the teams, and the taskforces which FICCI creates, so that to ensure that there is inclusive approach in working on these subjects.I believe GST is good for the country, as well as for the healthcare sector, because it rationalizes and simplifies the environment. Having said that, and given the fact that healthcare services are exempt from GST, but, there could be an increase in input costs because lot of things that the hospitals buy, whether its medical equipment or other infrastructure, the impact of GST could be different, for example medical equipment especially capital equipment because of GST there is an increase in the custom-duty by two-two and a half points, so those will lead to increase in input costs for the hospitals. And given that, they cannot use this to set off, because there is no on-the-end GST, it make some increase in the cost but I think overall hospitals will have to find ways to be more productive and I don’t foresee that it would increase patient cost or the patient treatment channel.The pricing policy unfortunately has added a lot of confusion in this sector, while the intent may be good on part of the government to ensure that the patients are not exploited, because there have been cases around that. But what is very important is, for all the stakeholders again, government as well as the hospital providers to keep the entire care continuum and the costs around the care continuum in mind because it’s not just the device cost which is important, one has to look at the entire treatment, at what cost it can be delivered, say Angioplasty, at what price the Angioplasty gets delivered in the end to the patient is critical, is not just the cost of the stent for instant and I think, the government should've engaged the private sectors and the medical technology companies and the hospital providers in a manner that ultimately the patient would benefit, which unfortunately has not happened and that's where the confusion is.I believe there is a huge opportunity around public-private participation and the good news is that the government at the center is supporting it. The NITI Aayog had already been tasked to build models and NITI Aayog very actively has sought inputs from FICCI as an industry forum, they have invited even World Bank to help them build those models. We have done lot of PPPs in U.K and other parts of the world so we are helping t he government to create models which can then be adopted by the state governments. So that there is template available, and no one has to reinvent the wheel as far as PPPs are concerned because PPPs in healthcare can be very complex, and it’s important that in the end we build a model which is win-win and in the interest of patients at the large.When we talk about public-private participation or even private - private participation, example especially in the oncology space of private - private participation given the space in oncology is a little difficult the incubation is very long it requires a lot of regulatory approvals from AERB and so on. You will find some of the oncology chains in India going and setting up Oncology departments in existing hospitals. For instance, DMC in Ludhiana is a very good hospital run for several years doing excellent patient care but they had no oncology department so they invited a group called CTSI, Cancer Treatment Services International who run hospitals in Hyderabad to come and setup the Onco department and run it, so this is also a public private-private participation, it's not a public-private so we see these kind of models especially in oncology getting stronger there are companies like CTSI, Healthcare global, International Oncology, many of them who specialized in oncology. I see it’s a good step because building a hospital is not easy.Traditionally in India, it has been a doctor and his son and they will setup or a wife, to setup a hospital, but then it would normally be a one hospital phenomenon they would provide good service but they would not be able to expand because it requires huge amount of capital. So given now all the groups are coming in big corporates like this Apollo, Fortis, Max and they are expanding private equity funding which is coming in. CTSI got funded through TPG capital for instance so that gives them the breath and the muscle to then expand and reach out even to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there is a dearth of a good hospitals."
"Reliance Industries to import 1.6 million tonne Ethane from US, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: Reliance Industries will import 1.6 million tonnes of ethane from the US in the current fiscal to replace natural gas and naphtha as feedstock at its petrochemical plants, a senior company official said today.

Use of ethane, a natural gas component that is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America after the shale gas revolution, will reduce company's petrochemicals feedstock cost by about 30 per cent, RIL COO for Petrochemicals Business Vipul Shah told reporters here.

The company has begun receiving consignment or cargo of ethane from US. Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) are used to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal Company Ltd terminal at Dahej, Gujarat.

""RIL has become the biggest importer of ethane from USA in 2017,"" he said, adding that using ethane would increase its petrochemicals operating profit by USD 300 million a year.

The company has contracted ethane supplies for more than 20 years from US, said Amit Mehta, head of gas business at RIL.

RIL uses 2.5 million tonnes a year of naphtha as feedstock in petrochemical crackers and ethane would reduce its use by 500,000 tonnes, which can be exported.

Ethane will be used as feedstock for RIL's crackers in Dahej and Hazira in Gujarat and Nagothane in Maharashtra. RIL sees 200,000 tonnes per annum increase in ethylene output from these crackers from ethane use.

Shah said the company has invested USD 1.6 billion in ethane business so far which include ships, pipeline and port infrastructure.

The investment, he said, can be recovered in less than four years.

The company imported 416,000 tons of ethane, amounting to total of 9 VLEC cargoes, which is 19 per cent more than the second biggest importer of ethane from U S, INEOS.

While Ineos imports ethane from Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania and Morgans Point terminal, Houston, India. RIL has an ethane supply contract in place with Enterprise Product Partners out of their Morgan's Point terminal in the US Gulf coast, he said.

Total US exports till May have been about 0.9 million tonnes, out of which exports to RIL is about 48 per cent. Other importers like Ineos, Sabic, Braskem and Borealis constitute the remaining 52 per cent.

RIL has two joint ventures in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale -- one with Chevron Corp, in which it has invested USD 1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc, in which it has invested USD 392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested USD 1.5 billion, in Texas' Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.

RIL had in 2014 ordered building of six Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at Samsung Heavy Industries Pvt Ltd's shipyards in Korea.

Two of these vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, were delivered last year. Japan's biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.

Ethane is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking."
"Indian thrust on renewables will affect thermal projects: CEA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Overemphasis on renewable energy would result in reducing viability of coal-fired thermal power plants in India, adding to the massive non-performing assets (NPAs) of state-run lenders, Chief Economic Adviser ( CEA Arvind Subramanian said on Thursday.""Rapid changes in technology are promising to help realize the promise of renewables, which is an eminently desirable development. At the same time, these changes need to be seen in the context of India's current economic situation and its enormous endowments of coal, which is still a very cheap way of providing energy to hundreds of millions who are still energy-deprived,"" he said at the 16th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture here organised by The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ).Noting that both coal and renewable sources should be the focus of power generation, Subramanian said that ""for India today, the social cost of renewables is higher than that of thermal power, and it is highly unlikely for the converse to be true, at least for some time"".""Over-expansion, fuelled by the growth optimism of the mid-2000s, combined with stresses in the discoms and slowdown in the economy has led to a plummeting plant load factors, declining profitability, the spectre of large amounts of stranded power assets, and consequentially stranded coal assets as well.""All this can have a detrimental effect on the health of the banking sector, especially the public sector banks, in the country, which in turn can adversely impact the health of the Indian economy, already afflicted by the 'twin balance sheet' challenge,"" the CEA said.The declining viability of thermal power plants and the rising NPAs of state-run banks, which have lent to power companies ""seems a double whammy for the government,"" he said.For India, which is struggling to provide basic electricity to about 25 per cent of its population, coal will provide about 60 per cent of the country's power needs until 2030, he addedIndia's total renewable generation capacity has crossed 57 gigawatts (GW), with an increase of 24.5 per cent being registered in the last fiscal year. The capacity addition in solar energy last year stood at 81 per cent.--IANSbc/vd"
"Lighting major Bajaj Electricals eyes Rs 5,000-crore turnover this fiscal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: Lighting products and consumer durables maker Bajaj Electricals said it is eyeing a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore this fiscal, while aiming to double it in the next four years.

""There is negative sales in the first quarter (because of GST). We should be able to catch up a little bit in the second quarter, but July was very weak,"" Bajaj Electricals Chairman and Managing Director Shekhar Bajaj told here.

""For the year, we are still looking at 10 per cent growth in the consumer products and 20 per cent coming from EPC. From Rs 4,300 crore, which was last year, we should do about Rs 5,000 crore,"" he said.

Bajaj added that the company will grow at 15-20 per cent year on year and will take four years to become a Rs 10,000 crore company from Rs 5,000 crore.

However, he said the company will not look at the revenue share from engineering and projects (EPC) to be more than its consumer durable business.

""Our business of EPC, we will not allow it to grow faster than our consumer product business. At least 50 per cent of our sales must come from consumer products because EPC business has its ups and downs and there is risk involved,"" he said.

The company is restructuring its consumer products business by adopting the distribution system from wholesale model and Bajaj said the company will complete the process by the fiscal year end.

""We have covered 80,000 outlets already and by end of March, we should have covered 1,60,000 outlets, which will be 90 per cent of the market,"" he said.

Bajaj Electricals has a licensing agreement with Morphy Richards to make, sell, market and distribute products under the brand name in India.

It launched a new range of Morphy Richards products in the super premium segment today.

Morphy Richards has a revenue of Rs 230-240 crore in India at present and the company is looking at a turnover of Rs 300 crore this fiscal.

""We are looking at over a period of three years our level of Rs 300 crore for Morphy Richards growing to Rs 600 crore. Out of that Rs 600 crore, Rs 100 crore should come out of these new range of products,"" Bajaj said.

Bajaj Electricals is also exploring opportunities in the internet of things (IoT) space and he said the first product in the cooler category would be out this year.

The company has already introduced luminaries with artificial intelligence."
"Unit Tariff: Solar tariffs at Rs 3 a unit may be the new normal: NTPC CMD Gurdeep Singh, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh said Rs 3-3.20 a unit tariff for solar power may be the new normal and can be achieved without the support of “cheap funds or cheap panels"", which have been a concern for the industry.Solar and wind energy units generate less than 10% of the global electricity output and have remained on the side-lines historically as these projects were taken up to fulfill a social responsibility towards clean energy But these green energy sources have seen a decline in prices making them comparable to conventional energy and causing a disruption in the power sector. India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.“We should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.“We are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,“ Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."

Why Men Are More Likely To Be In A Grumpy Mood At Around 2pm In The Afternoon!,"As a guy, you’re prone to be a little a grumpy in the afternoon as compared to in the morning or evening hours. Not because we assume so because science says so!

cementmarketing.com

A recent study claims that men find their mood most slumped at around 2 pm in the afternoon!

Scientists from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia came up with this conclusion after taking the brain scans of men during various times of the day.

yamuzhchina.ru

The reason the researchers stated was due to of the activation of the reward-processing brain regions of the brain at different times of the day.

The findings showed that activation of a reward-processing region of the brain peaks in the morning and evening and dips at 2 p.m.

For the study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the team compared activation of the brain's reward system in young men during a gambling task at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.

trend.ge

They found that activation in the left putamen was lowest in the early afternoon. This finding may parallel the drop in alertness people tend to feel in mid-afternoon, the researchers said.

""While the left putamen had the greatest activation at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., it had significantly lowered activation at 2 p.m.,"" Jamie Byrne from the varsity was quoted as saying to Daily Mail.

""The left putamen is particularly responsive to unexpected rewards, so our data suggest that the brain's reward centres might be primed to expect rewards in the early afternoon and be surprised when they appear at the start and end of the day,"" Byrne added.

Understanding how activity in the brain's reward system changes throughout the day could have implications for depression, substance abuse and sleep disturbances, said Greg Murray from the Swinburne University in Australia.

Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it’s a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there’s one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it’s Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India.

De Villiers gives up ODI captaincy; available to play all three formats

South African batsman AB de Villiers has stepped down as the captain of the One-Day International side with immediate effect. With so much speculation surrounding his Test future, de Villiers also made it clear on Wednesday (August 23) that he will be available to play in all three formats of the game from late September when South Africa begin their home season.

He last led South Africa in ODIs during the Champions Trophy in May-June, which ended in major disappointment as the side couldn't even make it past the Group Stages. Following the tournament, he had to fill in temporarily for Faf du Plessis as the T20I skipper for the series against England.

Making the announcement through a video released on his app, de Villiers felt that it was time for someone else to take over the role. He also pulled his weight behind Faf du Plessis, who has done a good job leading the Test and T20I teams.

Looking forward to a great summer #ProteaFire pic.twitter.com/yojybIrvjZ — AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) August 23, 2017

""Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I've informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,"" de Villiers said. ""It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for somebody else to lead the ODI team forward.""

There has been a lot of speculation and even disappointment among fans, about him opting out of Test matches. It has led to much concern over his future in the longest format of the game. De Villiers last played a Test in January 2016, against England, and has since been unavailable due to either injury or workload concerns. Addressing those doubts, de Villiers completely dismissed suggestions that he was putting himself before the team.

""A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,"" de Villiers stated. ""Over the past year or so, I've tried to manage my commitments. I've felt mentally and physically tired. Playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll. Together with Cricket South Africa, we've tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say that I'm picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas and even to suggest I'm somehow putting myself before the team. This is simply not true. Playing for South Africa is and will always be the greatest privilege of my life.

""Following this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived. I want to get back on the field and I have assured the national selectors that I'll be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly. But I'll be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.""

South Africa's next assignment is against Bangladesh, when they come touring in late September. The tour begins with a two-Test series, followed by three ODIs and two T20Is.

SC issues show cause notice to BCCI top brass

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 08:53 PM

BCCI's top brass have been asked to appear personally by the SC for the next hearing. © Getty

The Supreme Court, on Wednesday (August 23), issued a show cause notice to the top brass of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, namely acting President CK Khanna, secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, asking them to personally appear on September 19 (next date of hearing) and offer their explanation to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) for the continued resistance towards the implementation of the Justice RM Lodha panel reforms.

While the CoA reiterated to the apex court that not a single recommendation had been implemented till date, the Supreme Court asked the CoA to prepare the draft constitution in line with the July 24, 2017 order.

However, the apex court didn't heed to the request made by the CoA in its fifth status report regarding their expulsion.

The hearing on the latest status report submitted by the CoA on BCCI's functioning was originally meant to take place last week, before it was adjourned to Wednesday (August 23).

Earlier, in its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Vinod Rai-led Committee of Administrators was scathing in its criticism of the BCCI. The CoA had called for the expulsion of the current office bearers of the board for non-compliance of the court's orders to implement the Lodha reforms. Taking into account the court's order dated January 2, that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their positions with the board, the CoA requested the three-member bench for the removal of acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry and acting president CK Khanna.

The CoA had also noted that in the absence of a working committee, administrators, and not the office-bearers needed to be given the authority to manage the board's affairs. The CoA had also added that the office bearers were limiting the role of the board CEO Rahul Johri.

Incidentally, during the Special General Meeting (SGM) held on July 26 this year, Johri wasn't allowed to partake in the meeting under intriguing circumstances. Choudhary had then observed that the Apex Court in its judgment dated July 24 had ruled only office-bearers with regard to state associations eligible to attend the SGM. Therefore, the board claimed to have been following the order of the Supreme Court ""in letter and spirit"".

The ruling that was taken into account to deny Johri's participation in the meeting was related to CoA's objection about N Srinivasan and Niranjan Shah attending BCCI's meetings. The apex court had stated on July 24 that only the office bearers of the state associations can attend BCCI's meetings.

CoA had also stated in its report that the board was impeding the implementation of the 'new administrative structure' which is based on accountability and clarity. The Supreme Court, on their part, had asked the BCCI to identify those ""exceptional and extremely limited areas of difficulty"" in relation to implementation of the Lodha reforms.

At its Special General Meeting held on July 26, the BCCI had then said the following needed to be re-examined: one state-one vote policy, the number of members in selection committees (which had been reduced to three from five), the concept of associate membership, the segregation in relation to functions executed by office bearers and paid professionals, disqualifications or restrictions on office-bearers in terms of age cap, tenure, cooling-off period and the formation of Apex Council.

The three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud had given its nod to reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership.

In its Status report, the CoA, however, had quoted Rai and said, ""the heart, kidney and lungs are being taken out of these reforms"" in relation to the board observing that the crux of the reforms approved by the Supreme Court was ""impracticable.""

Last year, in a landmark judgment on July 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had approved majority of the recommendations put forth by the three committee, led by retired Chief Justice RM Lodha. The board, on the other hand, was given a deadline of six months to implement the accepted reforms.

"Piyush Goyal: Centre rejigs PPA, takes the wind out of state power discom bullies, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The Centre has taken a stern view of state distribution companies violating contracts by bullying solar and wind power developers to cut prices, which bankers say will discourage lenders and investors.The minister for power, coal, renewable energy and mines, Piyush Goyal , has expressed concern at the development and has opposed violation of contracts that have already been signed. Goyal is spearheading India’s massive expansion of renewable energy capacity, which has made India a world leader in growth of wind and solar generation.“The government view is very clear that the legal framework has to be respected.All PPAs, whatever the legal terms are, they will be respected. But if a PPA has a mutual negotiation clause, and somebody is willing to do it, then what can be done?” he told ET.Fierce competition in solar and wind power auctions along with falling prices of equipment have helped tariffs tumble to record lows, making older projects look very costly. This has prompted many state discoms to ask project developers to sell electricity at the lowest available rate even if the contract for a particular plant was signed when costs were much higher.A government official said the Centre was considering sending an advisory to states, cautioning them about the adverse implications of their efforts to arm-twist companies to cut rates. The Indian Banks Association has also written to the power and finance ministries saying that the action by states was threatening the viability of projects, which in turn would make their loans risky.States where project developers are being pressured to cut tariffs include Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, UP and Jharkhand. Government officials said that renewable energy projects are a key part of India’s efforts to meet its climate commitments and to reduce the use of polluting fossil fuels, and the effort to promote clean energy has the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At a recent meeting with the wind developers and state nodal agencies for renewable energy, newly appointed secretary of the renewable energy ministry, Anand Kumar, expressed great surprise at the deluge of complaints from developers. Most of them related to state discoms trying to go back on their commitments on wind energy.He promised to do something about the matter and also told them to keep filing petitions before the appropriate forums. Subsequently, there has been a meeting of state regulators with MNRE officials at which issues raised by developers were discussed with them. Thereafter MNRE has also been in touch with the power secretaries of different states pointing out the problems that have arisen and urging them to get their discoms to behave and honour commitments.Kumar also wants power purchase agreements to be honoured unless there is an issue of irregularity or corruption."

NASA Predicts That A 4 Kilometer Wide Asteroid Will Zip Past Earth On 1 September,"Asteroids are whizzing past Earth all the time, though they don’t come too close to hitting us. NASA has now predicted another fly by the incident to occur next month, but it’s slightly different.

For one thing, the space agency is saying the rock that’ll hurtle past us is the largest near-Earth object (NEO) we’ve seen since we began tracking them 20 years ago.

Measuring 4.4 km across, asteroid Florence, as it’s called, is more than large enough to cause massive destruction, were it to hit Earth. Even the 20 m wide Chelyabinsk meteorite that made contact in 2013 wrought havoc, and any object larger than 1 km impacting Earth could cause a global extinction. And NASA has tracked over 880 such NEOs in our vicinity.

But, though asteroid Florence is about making its closest pass of Earth at a distance of 7 million km, the space agency there’s no chance of a collision anytime in the next 500 years.

“While many known asteroids have passed by closer to Earth than Florence will on September 1, all of those were estimated to be smaller,” says Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). “Florence is the largest asteroid to pass by our planet this close since the NASA program to detect and track near-Earth asteroids began.”

"Specialist norms may be eased to fight doctors' shortage, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Deaths of children in Gorakhpur have once again thrown the spotlight on the lack of specialists, nurses and healthcare workers, mainly in government hospitals in rural areas. In another effort to meet this challenge, the health ministry is mulling relaxation of eligibility norms for doctors and healthcare workers who can handle life threatening critical medical situations.The ministry plans to soon recognise diplomas from certain reputed institutes to convert MBBS doctors into specialists, allowing them to legally perform surgeries and critical procedures. It is also bringing in provisions to rope in mid-level healthcare workers and Ayush practitioners to do deliveries, noninvasive abortions and do certain types of interventions for treatment of noncommunicable diseases.The government plans to recognise diplomas from Maharashtra’s College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) across the country to convert MBBS doctors into specialists. “ MCI has also agreed to the proposal,” a senior health ministry official told TOI.At present, an MBBS doctor without a PG degree is legally not allowed to perform surgeries, anaesthetic procedures or C-section. Only specialists can treat noncommunicable diseases.About 1 lakh doctors take PG medical examinations every year in India, but only around 25,000 clear it. As a result, a lot of posts in hospitals either remain vacant or are filled with doctors on contracts, who practice at multiple places.The three member central government team which visited BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur following the death of over 70 children there over a week, highlighted the problem in its report to the Union health ministry. It said that eight of 12 senior resident or specialist posts are vacant in the hospital.“The number of senior residents (post-MD residents) is grossly inadequate being four against 12 vacancies and they need to be on the floor to provide 24/7 cover and not just during routine hours. It is these post-MD senior residents who take decisive actions as regards patient care and make a significant difference to the quality of care provided to patients.Currently, the patients are managed beyond routine hours by junior residents who are themselves still students and learning to manage sick patients,” the report stated. The hospital also severely lacked trained nurses."
Buoyant India aim to extend dominance,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Buoyant India aim to extend dominance

Malinga's form hasn't helped Sri Lanka either. © AFP

The one-sided nature of the India-Sri Lanka contests, which resulted in the hosts being clean swept in the Test series, extended into the first ODI as Virat Kohli's side registered a record victory in Dambulla, chasing down 217 with more than 20 overs to spare. The stage now shifts to Pallekele, the same venue where India registered their first overseas Test whitewash, for the second and the third ODIs, and going by how the series has progressed so far another huge Indian victory would only be a fair prediction.

It wasn't that Sri Lanka did not show any fight in the first ODI. Just that they couldn't capitalise on a good start and threw their wickets away causing much anger among the fans who resorted to protesting and shouting slogans against the team soon after the game. At 139 for 1, Sri Lanka had reached a solid position before crashing to 216 all out. Four out of the top five managed to cross 30 but only Niroshan Dickwella managed a half-century while the rest failed to convert their promising starts. Their bowling too was no match for India's batting might as the visitors raced to the target, registering a nine wicket victory.

Shikhar Dhawan, who scored an unbeaten 132, summed it up by saying that Sri Lanka is a young side going through a transitional phase. However, this phase has been going on for a long time now and what isn't also helping the team is that the selectors are trigger-happy. ""For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months,"" said interim head coach Nic Pothas, urging the selectors to show some patience. But the lack of it has had a cascading effect on the team, whose performances only seems to be getting worse.

Batting, fielding, catching, bowling - nothing has gone right for the Sri Lankans in this series, with a fair share of injuries further depleting the resources. The hosts also haven't been helped by the fact that Lasith Malinga, their pace spearhead over the years, has been a pale shadow of his former self. Having not seen any ODI action since November 2015, Malinga returned to the squad for the ICC Champions Trophy. In the nine games that he has played since June 2017, Malinga has picked up seven wickets while going at close to six an over with a bowling average of 61.71. The 33-year-old might be on borrowed time and unless he can justify his place in the team, Sri Lanka might have to look at different options.

Meanwhile, everything has been rosy in the Indian camp ever since they set foot in Sri Lanka. One dominating performance after another, contributions coming in from all corners, emphasis on fitness and a proposed rotation policy keeping everyone on their toes, the Indian team is in a happy place at the moment. There are, however, a few concerns which might have been masked by their towering performance in the last game. The quick bowlers erred on either side of the wicket and were finding it difficult to hit the right lengths, thus contributing a major share of the 10 wides that were bowled in the first ODI. Bowling coach Bharat Arun stressed on the importance of assessing the conditions beforehand and adapting to it. Whether the practice sessions leading up to the game have given them a fair idea remains to be seen.

The other immediate issue that India needs to address is the running between the wickets. Rohit Sharma did not appear too agile in the first game and was involved in a few mix-ups with Dhawan. Clearer calling and better judgement are imperative and the onus is on Rohit as well as Dhawan to figure out what works for them best. These apart, India pretty much have covered all bases and will head into the game with their confidence meter running in surplus.

When: Sri Lanka vs India, 2nd ODI - Thursday, August 24 at 2:30 PM Local Time

Where: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium

What to expect: Totals in excess of 300 have been limited in Pallekele, only three in 18 completed matches here, as the pitch offers a good balance between bat and ball. The last time India played at this venue was in August 2012 when they defended a total of 294. It is expected to be cloudy for the entire duration of the game with a high of 30 degree Celsius.

Team news:

Sri Lanka: Thisara Perera, Lakshan Sandakan and Wanidu Hasaranga failed to impress in the last game and they are likely to be out of the eleven for the second ODI. Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara and Dushmantha Chameera are the ones likely to replace them.

Probable XI: Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedara, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga, Vishwa Fernando

India: Unless the nature of the wicket forces a change in combination or a late injury, the visitors are likely to stick to the same eleven that took the field at Dambulla.

Probable XI: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), Lokesh Rahul, MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal

Did you know?

- Rohit Sharma's last seven outings in ODIs in Sri Lanka read 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4 and 4. He is one single-figure dismissal away from breaking Sanath Jayasuriya's record of most such dismissals in succession.

- Chamara Kapugedara has scored 162 runs from his last 15 ODI innings at 11.57, with a highest of 62. The other 14 innings have fetched him a mere 100 runs.

- MS Dhoni is one short of equalling Kumar Sangakkara's world record of 99 stumpings in ODIs. Dhoni has so far affected 98 stumpings and has taken 278 catches behind the wickets.

What they said:

""In 2014, India were in the same situation when you got new players and new support staff. It takes time for everyone to get used to each other. I don't know what the time-frames are but all I know is that if we keep doing what we are doing at the moment you'll see results pretty soon"" - Nic Pothas, Sri Lanka coach, remains optimistic about his team's chances.

""If the wicket is similar to Dambulla I don't see any reason to change the team just after one game. It was a perfect game for us because we came back into the game beautifully, we did well with the bat and were really sharp in the field. Very happy with how it went in the first game"" - Virat Kohli, India captain, hints at an unchanged line-up.

"Tired Of Eating Flesh, 'Cannibal' Surrenders Before Police After Walking In With Humans Limbs","In a bizarre incident, suspected cannibal surrendered to the police in South Africa to hand over human body parts – a leg and a hand – while telling officers: ‘I’m tired of eating human flesh.’

Reuters

According to reports, the man gave out a part of human leg and a hand as evidence. The evidence led to a house in KwaZulu-Natal where more body parts were found.

Nino Mbatha, Sthembiso Sithole, Lindokuhle Masondo and Lungisani Magubane were charged with murder and conspiracy, after one of them walked into a police station and announced that he was ‘tired of eating human flesh’. Nino Mbatha was a traditional ‘healer’, according to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele.

Reuters

At a community meeting people said they had eaten human remains after they were given them by Mbatha as medicine.

The man who confessed to his crimes has reportedly raped, murdered, dismembered and even also eaten several women. Meanwhile, few other admitted to digging up graves on the instruction of Mbatha, and bringing him the bones they uncovered.

Reports also state that hundreds of people in a South African town have admitted to eating human flesh. More people were caught after four men were arrested for killing a woman and eating her body.

"Despite Jab Harry Met Sejal's Failure, Imtiaz Ali Stands By His Film & Says It's Not Regressive","They say criticism is the best teacher but for many of us, it doesn't go down too well. For directors, a film is like their baby and nothing can hit you more than it tanking at the box-office.

For Imtiaz Ali, box-office success has never mattered much. Apart from Jab We Met and Rockstar, none of his films proved out to hit but that in no way has fizzled out his love for Cinema. People love him for his thought-process, his flawed love stories and the way his erratic love stories turn out.

His latest film Jab Harry Met Sejal became a fragile victim of online bullying and wrath of people. From calling him out for sketching regressive characters to claiming that it is his weakest film till date, people went overboard with their criticism this time.

Red Chillis

But for Imtiaz, his craft and heart matter to him more than anything else. Apart from standing by his film, he accepts that he might have failed this time but he also asked the audience to have faith in him.

Just a few days ago, he shared his picture with a beautiful message. He thanked people for liking and disliking his film and he wrote how he is looking forward to making better films.

And yesterday, he chose FB live to interact with the fans and followers. The live-session lasted for one hour and he patiently chose to answer all the accusations, criticism and questions people had about his latest offering that failed to leave a mark.

From explaining Sejal‘s desperation to be ‘worthy’ of Harry to the scene where Sejal refers to herself as not a ‘ghatiya‘ woman who runs away with his Tour-guide, Imtiaz patiently answered the questions and defended his work.

Pinterest

1. He went on to explain why SRK didn't come with any superstar baggage. Rather, he was one of the easiest actors he has worked with. He said,

Viral Bhayani

""Shah Rukh is a very easy person to work with since he's a theatre actor. I don't have to change anything because of his persona but I do change a lot of things as I go along. There were things that changed but not because Shah Rukh imposed it on me.""

2. He also spoke about the flak that the film received online. Talking about all the nasty things that people have written and said about his film, he said,

Red Chillies

""I have never received an overwhelmingly positive review of any. I am old enough to not take criticism negatively even if the criticism is negative. I believe a lot is achieved by constructive criticism than say, dishonest praise. I do stand by Jab Harry Met Sejal. This is the movie I wanted to make. Don't worry too much about critics. Sometimes they say valuable things which we must acknowledge. I am sure it'll help me make better films as I always find a way of benefitting from criticism. ""

3. And then he decided to talk about the pink elephant in the room-Sejal's character and obsessive behaviour on getting sexual validation from Harry. Many pointed out that it is one of the most regressive characters Imtiaz has ever written. Defending his character, he said,

Red Chillis

""That's a question Anushka has asked me often. I feel that when girls grow up, they, through some ways that are not even nice, get to know about their worth in terms of a physical being – whether they are attractive, beautiful, sexy and so on. And even now, there aren't any ways where a girl can know if she is attractive to a man. Even now we find all of that (probably referring to a woman's sexuality) as a taboo in Indian society and perhaps rightly so (?). For Anushka's character, she meets a man who she doesn't know and is not going to spend a lifetime with, or so she thinks. And he's honest about talking about himself and so she decides to ask him about her latent insecurities – which are about the way she appears.""

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

"India to seek investments for oil and gas auctions at mega hydrocarbon event in UK, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government will seek global investor participation for its ongoing mega oil and gas auction during the international Society of Petroleum Engineers ( SPE ) Offshore Europe conference to take place in Aberdeen, UK next month.The four day-conference that will begin on 5 September will include technical sessions, conferences, workshops, exhibitions from industry players across the value chain of the oil and gas sector and include a special event by the Indian government on Open Acreage Licensing Programme ( OALP ), National Data Repository (NDR) and the latest investment opportunities in the Indian oil and gas sector.“In order to showcase investment opportunities in upstream Oil & Gas sector in India and recent policy reforms – OALP, Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy ( HELP ) and National Data Repository, the government is organising an event at SPE Offshore Europe-2017 at Aberdeen,” upstream regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons ( DGH ) said in a notice today.The SPE Offshore Europe Conference is expected to witness participation from oil and gas giants including Schlumberger Limited, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Wood Group, Petrobas, GE and leading E&P professionals from across the world.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had called upon the global investor community to participate in India's current oil and gas bidding round at the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) held in Istanbul, Turkey last month. The move by the government has the potential to attract investors in the auction which has already received over 45 Expression of Interest (EoI) in more than a month, according to DGH website. However, a senior executive close to the auction process said the government has received around 75 EOIs since the auctions were made live on 1 July.The oil ministry is offering over 85 percent of the country’s 3.14 million square kilometres of hydrocarbon sedimentary area under the new bidding mechanism of OALP and a revamped exploration policy HELP.

"N Chandrasekaran: Tata Trusts must work on common CSR goals with group companies: Ratan Tata, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Ratan Tata wants Tata Trusts to work with the group companies on social development goals for “one powerful set of initiatives,” breaking away from a four-year tradition. Under former chairman Cyrus Mistry , companies charted their individual corporate social responsibility road map — separate from that of Tata Trusts.“In the years that I was chairman of the group, I tried to bring our companies together to have a more unified approach in this regard. The last four years have seen the dismantling of that approach and a return to individual companies doing their bit,” said Tata Trusts chairman Tata in an inhouse magazine.“Consequently, instead of one powerful set of initiatives, we could end up having disparate projects run by various companies.”Tata Trusts, a bunch of 14 charitable organisations that own two-third shares in Tata Sons, was at the heart of the spat between the two former chairmen last year. Mistry asked the government to intervene in the functioning of Tata Trusts, alleging misgovernance and improper interference by trustees in companies’ business decisions. N Chandrasekaran , who took over as chairman in February, sees binding the group together as his key responsibility.The three-tier structure has Tata Trusts at the top, promoter Tata Sons in the middle and then the operating companies. Chandra has come out with the ‘One Tata’ approach to harness the synergies and brand of the loosely-held conglomerate.“I think it’s for the new leadership to decide which model best suits the group,” said Tata. “My preference, of course, would be a unified model that gives us considerable strength, scale, unity and multiple capabilities... whenever a Tata company is willing to work together with the Trusts, we are happy to make the connection.”The chairman also mentioned the new approach he has taken to running Tata Trusts more dynamically, versus its previous approach to give charity grants to causes and people in need.The objectives of Tata Trusts’ philanthropy remain largely unchanged but are now more deeply involved on the ground with how the projects they support are implemented.“We have been judiciously backing ventures that result in sustainable benefits for individuals and communities. Our intention is to have our grants create sustainable solutions and bring self-sufficiency to communities, rather than establish long-term dependencies,” said Tata, who took the group into global markets during his tenure as chairman between 1991and 2013.The trusts use dividend income from Tata Sons to work on education, healthcare, livelihood and sanitation. Tata said that with resources flowing into the trusts from Tata Sons increasing, it became more difficult to find well-run NGOs capable of handling large projects.“That’s when we started to look at getting involved in bigger causes and undertaking projects ourselves, maybe not physically but managing them and participating in them to a much greater extent than previously.”Tata Trusts is no longer looking for non-government organisations and agencies to support but causes to take up. They have started partnering with state governments and official agencies to work on major initiatives."

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

Sunil Joshi appointed Bangladesh's spin consultant,"EXPERIENCE COUNTS

Sunil Joshi appointed Bangladesh's spin consultant

Aayush Puthran • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:30 PM

While Australia have gone back to hiring the services of S Sriram, who helped their spinners during the India series earlier in the year, Bangladesh have added to their contingent, former India spinner Sunil Joshi, who has been roped in as the spin consultant for the immediate future.

The former slow left-armer confirmed the development to Cricbuzz but refused to divulge details of the duration of his service with Bangladesh's national side. ""Yes, I will be working as the spin consultant for the Australia series, and will be joining the (Bangladesh) side shortly,"" Joshi told Cricbuzz.

With Bangladesh having shown drastic improvements as a Test team in the last year,. the forthcoming two-match series marks a big opportunity for them to register their maiden Test win over Australia. It would be no surprise that they would bank on their strength, which also happens to be Australia's biggest weakness - spin.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board had gone all out in search of a spin consultant for the series, including the possibility of having Stuart MacGill in their coaching setup.

With the former Australian legspinner declining to take up the role due to illness, BCB turned towards Joshi, with whom they had earlier tried to initiate talks for the role of a bowling coach.

Joshi, who has played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs for India, was the Man of the Match in Bangladesh's first ever Test in 2000. He had scored 92 in his only innings and bagged eight wickets in the match, including a fifer.

Fashion Diaries: Here’s Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one’s fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone’s going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it’s a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

OPPO F3

Well, selfies come handy not just to change display pictures, but when we need to check our pretty faces anywhere, anytime. And if on some days, if we look a bit too extra cute, why not click a selfie and save it too, right? And if you use a Selfie Expert phone, your picture is bound to look even prettier. If you want more, nowadays they even have a beauty mode btw!

And when friends are around, the selfie-game gets even better!

OPPO F3

Because when we are with our favourites, we are always in our happy and cheerful spirits which totally reflects on our pictures too. With a wide-angle group selfie, we can even get a full-length selfie to compare each other's style quotient!

One last word: Our phone's style quotient speaks a lot about our fashion diaries.

Pinterest

That’s why, nowadays people focus not just on the colour of the phone, but even on extra-accessories for it such as phone cases, bedazzlements or extra-customizations. Recently, even Bollywood style-icon Deepika Padukone had customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as the #F3DeepikaEdition.

OPPO F3

She had designed her own icon with OPPO, which has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded along, at the back of the phone and it pretty much signifies her personality, isn’t it? The special Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie, a 16 MP selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

So, dear style-divas if you are planning on buying a new phone, go for a Rose Gold OPPO F3, it’s pretty much going to be your new personal stylist!"
"Brazilian Woman Acts Weird After Watching Annabelle: Creation, Screams While Punching Herself!","While for some people horror movies are unintentionally funny, for others they are no less than creepy nightmares. But still, people love to watch them.

"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys — starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka’s resignation on August 18 — need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I’ve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India’s boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect — one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal’s remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn’t end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company’s board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company’s website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn’t, as you didn’t in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here’s my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys’ share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn’t end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka’s pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal’s task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don’t I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren’t needed.

Legendary Carl Lewis Is Unhappy With The Singular Focus On Jamaican Showman Usain Bolt,"The last decade in world athletics belonged to Usain Bolt but the legendary Carl Lewis is not happy with the singular focus on the Jamaican showman.

Considered the greatest athlete of all time, Jamaican Bolt drew curtains on his illustrious career after a disappointing performance at the World Championship in London, where he could only win a bronze in the 100m.

AFP

""The sport is not just about one person. Nobody is irreplaceable. Track and field survived many civilizations. Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and now Usain Bolt. Men will all come and go but the sport will always remain,"" Lewis, who has won nine Olympic gold medals, told PTI in an exclusive interview.

With Bolt's retirement, Lewis feels that it's time to build on the sport now that people will get over their obsession with a singular man.

""We need to do more to build on the sport. We don't need to follow that trend that we have been in the last eight years, which was just about following one person (Bolt),"" Lewis didn't mince words as he spoke on the sidelines of the 29th Summer Universiade here.

""Our job is to fill the void. In the last 10 years, the sport has not grown as the focus was just on one man. The point is we need to build competition. We now have a unique chance to rebuild and grow our sport. Now we have a chance to make a difference, grow our sport and not just grow yourself,"" Lewis' sarcasm on Bolt's cult status was pretty much evident.

AFP

Lewis, who won Long Jump gold in four successive Olympic Games (1984, 88, 92 and 96), is not at all amused that 'Brand Bolt' became bigger than the sport.

""We were just so caught up trying to make one person all about the whole sport and now we have a unique opportunity to spread it across the board and really allow it grow,"" said Lewis.

Lewis termed World Championship 100m silver medallist Christian Coleman and Rio bronze medallist Canadian Andre de Grasse are the ones to watch out for in the coming years.

""Christian Coleman was second (in World Championships) behind Justin Gatlin and he had the fastest time this year. Gatlin is 35 years old and that was probably his last Major championship. I think De Grasse and Coleman are both great athletes and I am really excited about them,"" Lewis is confident that they can maintain the standard set by Bolt.

Lewis, is in Taiwan as the assistant coach of the US track and field University team and named young Cameron Burrell as the next big thing among American track and field.

Young Cameron competes both in 100m and long jump like Lewis and is the son of Lewis' former teammate Leroy Burrell (a 1991 World Championship 100m bronze medallist) and Olympic relay champion.

Lewis and Burrell Sr also competed together for the famous Santa Monica Track Club.

AFP

""I was a long jumper who ran sprints. And now Cameron is trying to do that. I would love to see that. He is a great kid and he has the potential to become an Olympic champion,"" Lewis opined.

With Cameron's reference, Lewis took another dig at Bolt. ""That's the great thing about our sport and I think Cameron is going to be an Olympics champion one day and Coleman is also going to be an Olympic champion.

""Everyone just wants to talk about the garden centre instead of lumber area or the clothing area. We have a great sport that we need to spread it across and talk about the unique relationships. Don't let people get into the box where it is about just one person.""

Lewis however did not like termed the booing of Gatlin after winning the 100m dash at the recent World Championships ahead of Bolt as ""childish"".

""It was unfair. I am not saying what he has done is right. But it was childish,"" he said."
"Triple Talaq: Time to divorce religion from inequality, exploitation and discrimination","The verdict of a five-member bench of the Supreme Court – the members representing five different faiths – marks a milestone in India’s legal history and has been widely hailed by all those who acknowledge that inequality, exploitation and discrimination, on the basis of gender or religion or social mores, has no place in a society which proudly proclaims itself to be the world’s most populous democracy.

The judgment, delivered by a 3:2 majority, ruled that triple talaq was open to ‘arbitrary and whimsical’ misuse and violated Muslim women’s constitutional right to equality.

Though two of the five judges recorded dissenting remarks – citing Article 25 of the Constitution which guarantees the fundamental right to religious freedom – it was deemed that triple talaq, whereby a man can divorce his wife by merely repeating the word ‘talaq’ three times, was not an integral part of Islam and as such could not be defended on the grounds of the liberty to follow the faith of one’s choice. Indeed, Islamic states like Pakistan and Bangladesh have abolished the practice.

The government is said to be unlikely to ban triple talaq, but in individual cases the matter can be taken up courts of law.

The SC ruling comes as a political plus point for the BJP government, and could prove to be a stepping stone to introducing a uniform civil code, which has long been on the lotus party’s agenda.

Even those who disagree with the BJP’s saffron ideology will agree that a common civil code, which doesn’t discriminate between religions, is not only appropriate but necessary in a polity which deems itself to be a secular republic.

While a consensus about a common code needs to evolve within the Muslim community, the debate should not be restricted to those of that particular faith but should involve all citizens of our diverse society which is bedrocked on the right to universal equality.

A common civil code is – or ought to be – above partisan politics. Because the right to equality is – or ought to be – common to us all, irrespective of faith or ideological hue."
"Smile Train aims to empower local doctors and professionals to treat patients : Dr. Alvaro Figueroa, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Co-Director, Rush Craniofacial Center, Chicago and also Member, Medical Advisory Board, Smile Train , talks about the various protocols followed by Smile Train in providing effective cleft care. Edited excerpts:Effective cleft care cannot be provided by just one professional, it needs to be done by a group of professionals because patients that are born with cleft lips and palates have many needs that one specialist cannot treat by himself/herself. Usually the team is composed of several members, a surgeon, a paediatrician, anaesthesiologist and many medical support professionals.At Smile Train, in addition to providing cleft repair surgeries , we focus on comprehensive transformation with expert interventions for pre and post-operative care. Hence, we have specialists from dentistry, orthodontics, speech therapy, hearing aids, psychology and mental health, and social workers. We at Smile Train believe in not just providing surgery to heal the cleft visibly, but also provide comprehensive cleft care to improve speech so that children born with clefts can lead a normal life. Speech therapists and orthodontists play an integral role in ensuring that quality comprehensive care is provided to all.The impact at the end of the entire process, is a complete transformation in the patient who emerges as a confident and beautiful individual.Smile Train is a charity that was started in 1999 and since then, has provided help and assistance in cleft care across 85 countries. India and China are two of the biggest programs and recipients of this support. Smile Train aims to empower local doctors and professionals to treat patients with cleft lips and palates and enable them to provide treatment to people in their own communities. Smile Train does not rely on professionals coming from other countries to do the treatment. This ‘teach-a-man-to-fish’ model is also helping build capacity in these countries to enable local hospitals and doctors to provide free cleft care to children throughout the year, rather than flying in missions from abroad, intermittently. It has also enabled us to provide ancillary services such as speech therapy and orthodontics to ensure comprehensive cleft care.Through a fair and totally transparent but highly rigorous process of screening, Smile Train credentials hospitals and surgeons who deliver safe, quality treatment to children. An independent, voluntary team of very senior and celebrated plastic surgeons and anaesthesiologists form the Smile Train Medical Advisory Board which credentials hospitals that apply to become a partner.Once the Board is convinced that the hospital is equipped with safety protocols and has experienced surgeons and associated medical staff to provide safe surgeries to children, the hospital enters into a formal agreement with Smile Train. As of today, Smile Train works with close to 1100 partner hospitals in over 85 countries. In India, Smile Train works with 160 partner hospitals and over 250 partner surgeons.At Smile Train, safety and quality come first. All treatment partnerships are strictly required to follow Smile Train's Quality Improvement Protocol, which lays down the basic elements needed to ensure safe surgeries and provide ongoing improvement of the quality of outcomes. The surgery of every patient is closely evaluated, and follow-up surgeries or ancillary treatments and therapies, such as orthodontics, speech therapy, etc., are provided accordingly. When a team has been approved by Smile Train, there are different requirements that partners need to fulfil, and one of the requirements is documentation of what they are doing.We document our patients’ progress for two reasons – firstly, to evaluate and assess what the team is doing to ensure there is proof of effective utilization of grants. The second and important factor is that documentation of patients especially at the critical stages of surgical care or other services, allows teams to monitor the progress of their patients on a long term basis.Eventually, this information will help us improve our services across teams around the world, and would help individual teams to determine how well they are performing, since Smile Train grades some of these records that the teams are sending. If we determine the quality of surgeries do not meet the global quality standards, Smile Train will find ways to train and upskill doctors and facilitate access to additional support.Doctors are provided with opportunities to attend international conferences, engage with well-known partner surgeons to adopt and implement best practices in the field. Our partner doctors ensure that protocols set by Smile Train are adhered to at all times. Visits by an independent team are conducted to maintain a close check on the surgeries being performed at our partner hospitals."

"Essar Group: Could’ve been conservative, but in 2008-09 everyone was chasing growth: Prashant Ruia, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Growing and “sweating” the existing $17-billion asset base spread across steel, power, ports, hydrocarbons and coal bed methane (CBM) — that together generates $15 billion of revenues — will be the focus of the Essar Group after selling a quarter of its empire for $13 billion to Rosneft and partners Trafigura and UCP Partners, said its top executive.The diversified group will also “cautiously” evaluate prospects in the services sector to derisk a highly commoditycentric, cyclical portfolio even as rivals may be preparing bids for the other big pillar of the Essar empire — the 30 million tonnes per annum steel and pellet division, which is currently facing bankruptcy proceedings.“The idea is to remain invested, if required, invest more and grow,” said Prashant Ruia , Director, Essar Capital . Sitting in his 20th floor office that offers a panoramic view of the Mumbai skyline, a day after Essar Oil ’s sale was consummated — the biggest monetisation by India Inc that deleveraged the group’s balance sheet to Rs 70,000 crore — Ruia outlined the blueprint for Essar “beyond oil”.“We have a much lighter balance sheet to reinvest and grow the existing business,” he said in an interaction with ET. “Most of our focus has been in India and will remain so. We have built 10 greenfield assets and despite the cyclicality of each of those business verticals, we have created value for shareholders,” he said. “Like in the past, there will be turnaround in these sectors.”Looking back, Ruia admitted the group could have done a few things differently. “In hindsight we could have been more conservative. But in 2008-09, the mood of the nation was to chase growth, build assets. The government encouraged that. Fresh from the (telecom business) sale to Vodafone , we took a call to reinvest.Your vision is always 20/20. Maybe we could’ve taken up lesser projects,” he said.But even then, Ruia clarified, the group made profitable exits. In telecom, Essar made 10x gains in 16 years when it sold out to Vodafone in 2011.The rewarding exit from telecom and the subsequent London listing of its energy assets allowed the group to press the growth pedal even harder. The conglomerate also monetised its BPO arm Aegis in two tranches at 5x the investment.Those transactions are about to get consummated. Even the oil deal fetched the group 4x returns on investment.Being the principal shareholder of a largely privately owned conglomerate, the Ruia family would have enjoyed most of the windfall.On Tuesday, the group announced an additional Rs 880-crore payout to minority shareholders of Essar Oil who had tendered shares during a delisting in 2015.For Essar Oil shareholders, this translates into a gain of Rs 75.48 per share over and above the Rs 262.80 per scrip that they had received for tendering their shares. The additional payment is based on theRs 338.28 per share that Essar received for the deal. The Securities and Exchange Board of India had directed Essar to pay shareholders the per-share difference if the valuation of the Rosneft deal was higher than the delisting price.“Essar Oil was valued at Rs 2,000 crore during its 1995 IPO, and today it has been sold at a valuation of Rs 50,400 crore. The promoters had agreed to a 80% premium to the Sebi-mandated formula. But now, the price represents a 132% premium,” added Ruia.The group’s troubles are far from over, admits the 48-year-old who is the second generation to administer the family-run conglomerate.The group faces the real prospect of losing its steel operations.“We are negotiating a restructuring package with the lenders. We will compete with other bidders,” he added. “In the past, there have been instances of other proposals. Lenders had invited bids from 160 companies RBI, the government and even the lenders have made it clear they are looking at a resolution and not liquidation.”Essar’s problems got compounded in the past few years after the government reneged on contractual obligations, claims Ruia. Its $18-billion capex programme executed over a decade to more than double its steel and refinery capacity, add 6000 mw of thermal power plants and 140 MMTPA port capacity led to debt ballooning toRs 1,40,000 crore. Stagnant sales and aresultant sharp downturn in profitability amid commodity price volatility and slowing demand choked the group’s cash flows, making it among the top three indebted business conglomerates.Essar is in the process of completing a $250-million investment in its Stanlow refinery in the UK. “We acquired the company for $350 million and since then have invested $800 million. The net impact of these investments is that the margins have improved handsomely and we are best-in-class with European refineries,” Ruia said.While the group does not plan to increase the UK refinery’s capacity, given the high cost, it is aggressively expanding its fuel retail network there. Essar aims to run 400 retail outlets over the next two years in the UK compared with over 30 now.The group is also eyeing the Middle East, where Essar Projects is scouting for engineering, procurement and construction jobs. “Middle East and Africa are important markets for projects. From an order book worth zero only three years ago, we have scaled it to $1 billion and are bidding for more projects.”Back home, Essar has retained its CBM asset at Raniganj while holding other projects spread over 2,700 sq km of contract area."
Privacy as fundamental right: Minding our business,"By Smriti Parsheera

The Supreme Court’s upcoming verdict on whether we have a fundamental right to privacy will be one of the most momentous decisions of our times. It is, however, inopportune that this vital issue has arisen as an offshoot to the Aadhaar litigation.

Both sides are alive to the fact that the decision will take them a step closer or further from proving their stance in the main petition. This has undeniably coloured the arguments in court. The real implications of the nine-judge decision will, however, run much deeper than the immediate questions of Aadhaar.

The term ‘privacy’, while not expressly spelt out under the Constitution, forms the crux of what it means to live a dignified life in a liberal democracy. The concept of a secret ballot, for instance, finds its origin in the need for ‘political privacy’, our ability to vote anonymously, without the promise of reward or fear of persecution. Section 94 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, codifies this right by providing that a person cannot be mandated to disclose for whom she has voted, not even before a court of law.

Then there’s ‘physical privacy’ that guards a person’s body and physical space from unwelcome intrusions. ‘Behavioural privacy’ gives us the freedom to keep private our religious practices, sexual orientation and associations. ‘Informational privacy’ deals with the expectation of privacy in the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. ‘Cognitive privacy’ calls for new thinking about the use of technologies that can decipher thoughts and brain activities.

Some of these rights are already covered by existing constitutional provisions, some have been protected under laws, while others are still waiting to be born. A legal right can, however, not be a substitute for a fundamental right. Legal rights can be conferred and withdrawn at will and their validity rests on conformity with the Constitution.

The declaration of privacy as a fundamental right will not imply that it will become an unassailable, paramount right, which can never be undone. The contours of privacy, and the limitations on its scope, will have to evolve through jurisprudence developed by the courts. Even until recently, when we believed privacy to be an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, the Supreme Court had pointed on several occasions that privacy is not an absolute right.

For instance, in Mr X vs Hospital Z ((1998) 8 SCC 296), while dealing with the right to confidentiality of an HIV patient, the court held that in case of a conflict between right to privacy and right to health of another, the latter prevails. In another case, ordering a person to undergo a medical examination was not regarded as being violative of the person’s right to privacy where the test was necessary to determine unsoundness of mind, a recognised ground for divorce. The person could still refuse the medical examination, allowing the court to draw an adverse inference (Sharda vs Dharmpal, AIR 2003 SC 3450).

Conferring privacy with the status of afundamental right will achieve two key goals. One, it will offer a guaranteed constitutional framework to test against ingressions into the various dimensions of privacy. Two, it will provide courts with greater confidence when comparing the tradeoffs between privacy and other constitutional protections.

The separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary demands that courts cannot question the wisdom of legislative actions. So, any law, no matter how odious it may appear, cannot be struck down by a court unless covered by certain specific grounds. These grounds, as stated most recently in the Aadhaar-PAN case (WP Civil No. 247 of 2017), are that the legislature did not have the competence to make the law; or the law is void for being in violation of any of the fundamental rights or any other constitutional provisions.

If privacy is not to be a fundamental right, what protection would we have against future transgressions of this right by various laws? Always having to derive this right from other provisions in the Constitution would dilute its efficacy. Relying on political processes to solve the issue would be too little, too late.

The key challenge, therefore, is not just about the privacy implications of the Aadhaar Act, or any other legislation, but the unforeseen laws and practices of the days to come. A few years ago, the Bombay High Court directed the UIDAI to share the biometric information of Aadhaar holders in Goa to aid the CBI in a rape investigation. The UIDAI challenged this before the court on grounds of privacy, which was accepted by the court.

The passage of the Aadhaar Act has now closed the door on such speculative searches, at least so far as biometric data is concerned. If the law were to be subsequently amended to allow biometric data to be shared for investigation and surveillance purposes, one would like to believe that the supporters of the Aadhaar architecture will join the detractors in opposing such a move. What we will need then is a fundamental right to privacy against which the actions of the legislature can be tested.

"Limited-overs series chance for team, including MS, to create good habits: Kohli","INDIA HOME SEASON 2017

Limited-overs series chance for team, including MS, to create good habits: Kohli

• Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 08:51 PM Gokul Gopal in Pallekele

In the past few years, Dhoni the batsman, has been playing a sedate role in the middle order and had had problems finishing games on occasions. © AFP

Ever since he retired from Test cricket in December 2014, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India duties have come in patches with several breaks in between his limited-overs assignments. The first three months of 2016 saw a busy schedule for the former India skipper, who played as many as 21 matches. But that period apart, Dhoni hasn't played a string of games to keep himself at pace with India's limited-overs requirements.

Despite being 36, Dhoni's fitness levels have been well maintained and he continues to remain one of the fittest and quickest Indian cricketers in the current era. But his performances with the bat have dipped, especially when it comes to finishing matches; not getting a chunk of cricket under his belt could be one of the reasons. ""We all want the Indian team to do well. If he is delivering, why not? If he is not, we will have to look at alternatives,"" chief selector MSK Prasad had recently said when asked if Dhoni remains an automatic choice in the ODI format.

In the past few years, Dhoni the batsman, has been playing a sedate role in the middle order and had had problems finishing games on occasions. He has also been shuffled around in the batting order, five times at number four, once at number six while he has batted at number five for most of the games this year. With the Indian selectors confirming KL Rahul as the number 4 batsman and the likes of Kedar Jadhav and Hardik Pandya coming lower down, Dhoni at five seems to be the best option for India currently. However, that will also leave him manning the finishing role, which will come as an added pressure.

As a finisher, Dhoni's contributions have been off-colour in the last few months. A 65-ball 39 against New Zealand in October 2016, a 36-ball 25 against England at the start of this year and a 114-ball 54 against Windies before this series are some of the instances where Dhoni didn't see his team over the line despite being in the best position to do so.

The current streak of India's limited-overs assignments count to 20 matches - five ODIs and one T20I against Sri Lanka, five ODIs and three T20Is against Australia and three ODIs and as many T20Is against New Zealand. It remains to be seen if Dhoni features in all these games, considering Rishabh Pant is also on the selectors' radar, especially in T20Is. But in the two T20Is that Pant has played so far, Dhoni has remained India's middle-order option and also the first-choice wicketkeeper.

""It's a great opportunity for us as a team to play limited-overs cricket for a while,"" skipper Virat Kohli said on Wednesday (August 23) with regards to the host of limited-overs assignments lined up for the Indian team. ""Last year and a half we haven't played as much limited-overs cricket and maybe that's the reason we haven't been as consistent in the shorter formats. But this gives us an opportunity to create momentum like we have done in Test cricket.

""We have made few changes already with where the teams want to go as far as our fitness goals are concerned. And we want to have possibly the best fielding side on the park, one that is dynamic that will remain consistent. And this coming season gives us an opportunity to define roles for players and give them time to execute it so that for the World Cup we know exactly what one player needs to do in certain situations. And it is not going to be anything that we have done in the past repetitively, it is not going to be predictable anymore,"" Kohli added.

For someone like Dhoni, who has been used to multiple breaks since his Test retirement, the string of matches will help him get on the same page as far as the team's goals are concerned, and also get a fair share of international matches which will help him build some momentum as a contributor in the team, something that Kohli acknowledged in agreement.

""It helps someone like Dhoni because he doesn't play Test cricket anymore and this long streak of matches will help him to be in touch with the international games and finding some momentum and sticking to it. It goes for every player in the team. You want to find momentum in a season like this and make sure you carry it through with consistent performances every now and then. So it's an opportunity for everyone in the team including MS to create good habits and sustain them over a period of time,"" he said.

As a accumulator who likes to take the game close, Dhoni's modus operandi has been to minimise risks at the start of his innings and attempt a few big hits only later in his innings. While this has, on occasions, helped him make up for his strike-rate, it still leaves him with the risk of having a lot to do towards the end. Dhoni, of late, has also struggled a bit to rotate the strike, consuming a lot of dot deliveries in the process. This has invariably left him with a lot of catching up to do and has allowed the opposition to keep him quiet with set fields, all combined it has contributed to some of his recent failures.

However, watching Dhoni bat in the nets - striking the ball cleanly, a compact technique and handling the bowlers with ease - there is a sense of assurance and also hope that Dhoni of the old could make a reappearance. He appears to have made some changes to his batting, eliminating some of the fidgety, trigger movements that he used to have earlier. Whether this helps him will only be known when he comes out to bat the next time. But there is some urgency about him, which India will be hoping that it serves the team well in their preparations for the next big event.

"China coal imports from key supplier Australia climb for second month, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","BEIJING: Chinese coal imports from key supplier Australia chalked up year-on-year gains for the second straight month in July, customs data showed, as local output of the commodity eased amid a crackdown on illegal mining and pollution.

Cargoes from Australia rose 4.4 percent from July last year to 7.47 million tonnes, according to the data from the General Administration of Customs released on Wednesday.

Imports from neighbouring Mongolia jumped over 30 percent in July from the year before to 2.26 million tonnes, the data showed, although that was below record levels struck in June.

Major producers from Mongolia are looking to boost shipments to China in the wake of a ban on coal purchases from North Korea and as China's largest producer Shenhua Energy closed two large pits near the Mongolian border.

Meanwhile, shipments from Indonesia dropped by nearly 9 percent to 3.03 million tonnes in July. Imports from Russia fell 1.7 percent to 1.64 million tonnes, the data showed.

China imposed a ban on coal shipments at small ports from July 1, along with more random checks on coal cargoes.

Looking forward, a warmer-than-usual winter has been forecast for southern China, potentially crimping appetite for coal.

The forward structure of the thermal futures curve shows investors are betting on prices peaking in October before falling steadily until August 2018.

China's coal production in July fell 4.5 percent from a month earlier to its lowest since October, according to government numbers released in mid-August."
"Wind turbine tie-ups under pressure as sector awaits more deals, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Christoph Steitz

FRANKFURT: A sell-off in shares of recently merged wind turbine makers highlights the growing speed at which competition in the sector is heating up, raising expectations for more deals in the quest for scale.

In the latest sign of the squeeze, Siemens Gamesa last week said it would cut 600 staff, less than a month after it revealed third-quarter operating profit had dwindled by a fifth, partly due to India's shift to auctions from guaranteed tariffs.

The wind power industry, growing steadily but still largely reliant on state support, has witnessed a number of large M&A deals in recent years that were triggered by a steep drop in turbine prices, down a quarter since 2010.

General Electric beefed up its wind business with the takeover of France's Alstom, Germany's Nordex snapped up the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and Siemens merged its wind division with rival Gamesa.

The latter created the world's No.2 player, with a combined market share of 14 percent last year, still behind Danish sector leader Vestas but overtaking GE, according to consultancy MAKE. Nordex ranks sixth.

Followed by the usual mix of job cuts and the replacement of top management, these deals come at a time the industry is moving towards an auction-based system that favours those who can bid at the lowest price, not those busy with integration.

""Mergers are always difficult. And if it's companies from two different cultures it's not going to get easier,"" said Thomas Deser, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment, a shareholder of Siemens Gamesa.

""The introduction of auctions has led to a significant price erosion that has triggered concerns about margins.""

Significant share price declines also suggest that the deals were too expensive. Since the transactions were publicly announced in October 2015 and June 2016, respectively, Siemens Gamesa's stock has declined by about a quarter, while Nordex's has more than halved.

""Both companies have their own individual problems in certain markets. But it's also true that they both have to manage a merger which is a burden,"" a person who worked on one of the deals said.

Rival Vestas, in contrast, has seen its shares gain by about two thirds since late 2015.

NO MORE HIDING

Before the advent of auctions, wind farm developers could rely on feed-in tariffs that were guaranteed by law for as much as two decades, which critics say prevented the industry from becoming cost-competitive more quickly.

Now, they are increasingly relying on cheap wind turbines, leading their manufacturers to look for ways to cut production costs, including buying up rotor blade makers or outsourcing more to them. http://tmsnrt.rs/2iIwVd5

Nordex, which suffered a major loss of investor confidence earlier this year after slashing its mid-term outlook, has also flagged further job cuts, saying business in Europe contracted sharply in the first half of 2017.

""Wind is now becoming a really mature market. Parties now have to prove that they are the most efficient,"" said Danny van Doesburg, senior portfolio manager at APG Asset Management, a shareholder in Siemens, which owns 59 percent of Siemens Gamesa.

""The time you could hide in a project is over,"" he added.

In April, Germany's EnBW became the first project developer to say it would be able to build offshore wind parks -- the most expensive renewable energy source -- without any government subsidies.

That, along with recent ultra-low bids for onshore wind in Turkey, will force equipment makers to gain even more scale and seek more deal opportunities, afraid they might fall behind or go down otherwise, analysts and M&A sources said.

""We strongly believe the global... market will consolidate further, putting smaller players such as Nordex at risk of being marginalized,"" Barclays analysts wrote earlier this month.

Sources that have worked on the two German-Spanish tie-ups said that Nordex and smaller German peer Senvion were particularly exposed to become takeover targets themselves, pointing to their relatively small size.

At an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5 and 4 times, respectively -- a key indicator for M&A deals -- both groups look cheap compared to sector leaders Vestas and Siemens Gamesa, which trade between 7 and 8 times.

Acciona, which became Nordex's largest shareholder as part of the deal and now holds 29.9 percent, will likely make an offer for the rest once a three-year lock-up period ends next year, the sources said.

""We currently see no need for us to consolidate further,"" a spokesman for Nordex said. A spokesman for Senvion said that while the group saw ""enormous consolidation pressure"" it was working to implement its future strategy.

Acciona and private equity firm Centerbridge, Senvion's majority owner, both declined to comment."

"Age Of Empires IV Is Confirmed! It's Been 12 Years Since Last Game, Coming To A PC Very Soon!","Sorry StarCraft fans, but the mother of all real-time-strategy games is coming out of hibernation!

Microsoft announced at Gamescom 2017 yesterday that it’s resurrecting a classic strategy game. The company has revealed that a new Age of Empires game will be coming to PC, developed by Relic Entertainment, the makers of the Dawn of War series.

The Age of Empires IV trailer released alongside depicts battles across the world through different stages of history, from the Roman Empire at the peak of its power, to Spanish conquistadors, tribals, revolutionaries, and samurai.

This is the first sequel to the game in 12 years, ever since Age of Empires III was launched in 2005. The original developers, Ensembles Studios, released the first Age of Empires way back in 1997. They were then later acquired by Microsoft in 2001, where it operated internally until 2009.

Despite the studio eventually being shut down that year, the Age of Empires brand has lived on as both a nostalgia title in gamers’ memories, and a source for spinoff games.

Prior to the trailer unveiling, Microsoft confirmed that Age of Empires II and III would also be receiving Definitive Editions, along the lines of the upcoming remaster of the first game in the series.

Age of Empires IV still doesn’t have a release date. However, Microsoft has announced that the series will also be receiving Definitive Editions, which are likely to drop sooner than the latest sequel."

"From Shabana Azmi To Farhan Akhtar, Bollywood Applauds Supreme Court's Ruling On Triple Talaq","For long, Muslim women have been fighting against the Triple Talaq attempting to seek justice, and yesterday when the Supreme Court ruled the practice as unconstitutional, it seemed like the women of the nation achieved a milestone in their fight for their rights.

While there were some people who weren’t happy, others hailed the decision of the Supreme Court. And so did the Hindi film industry. From Shabana Azmi to Farhan Akhtar and others, the entire Bollywood industry applauded the decision.

wikimedia.org

“The Supreme Courts judgement against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have religious sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in secular India,” Shabana Azmi told TOI.

Farhan Akhtar also expressed his happiness on the same.

“The way the society is moving forward, the focus that is there on women’s rights and equality, and the fight for gender equality. It is very healthy that such a decision has been made. Now there is a six month window to figure out how it should be translated into a law, I hope it happens. Because it is a very archaic practice, it is time for it to go.”

Several other celebs also tweeted about the SC’s judgement.

Allan Donald - 1999 World Cup Semi-Final Run Out

South Africa vs Australia. 1999 World Cup semi-final. South Africa were just a run away from reaching the final. Lance Klusener was on strike. And Donald was at the other end. Klusener pushed the ball down the ground and Donald was as good as stoned. The match was eventually tied and Australia scraped through for finishing higher on the Super Six table.

Jasprit Bumrah had dismissed Fakhar Zaman for three in the final. The Pakistani batsman had edged the ball to keeper MS Dhoni. The umpire signaled a no-ball. And Zaman went on to make a century in the match. Even worse, India lost the match to Pakistan.

Chetan Sharma - Last ball Six During AustralAsia Cup final

Chetan Sharma wouldn't have seen this even in his worst dreams. It was the AustralAsia Cup final between India and Pakistan. Pakistan required four of the last delivery and Sharma ended up bowling a full toss to Javed Miandad. And what could have Miandad done? He swung it over the ropes for a six!

Herschelle Gibbs - Dropping Steve Waugh's Catch

South Africa again. But this time this wasn't Allan Donald. It was Herschelle Gibbs. After blasting his way to a 101 in the first innings, and then in the 31st over of Australian innings, dropped Steve Waugh at mid-wicket. It was out of sheer excitement that he dropped the ball soon after catching it. Yes, he'd dropped the world cup.

Beckham was the poster boy of English football. And this was the big stage. And his screwed it up by getting red-carded by the referee for fouling Diego Simeone in a harsh manner. Beckham's exit immediately put England on the backfoot as they were down to ten men. The match ended in a 2-2 draw and the Argentina won the match in penalties.

Diego Maradona - The Hand Of God - 1986 Football World Cup

Everyone knows about it. And you must have been wondering why wasn't this mentioned earlier in the list. Maradona became a controversial figure soon after this game. It was the quarter-final match against England, where Maradona jumped inside the box to head the ball in. But his hand touched the ball and the Argentine legend celebrated the most controversial goal in soccer history."
Forever expunged: Sanctity bestowed on personal laws ensured triple talaq escaped legal gaze for far too long,"The Supreme Court judgment declaring illegal talaq-e-biddat or triple talaq – the practice of instant, unilateral and irrevocable divorce – ends a source of injustice that put certain sections of Sunni Muslim women at a great disadvantage. By a 3:2 majority SC ruled that this form of talaq is “manifestly arbitrary”, allowing marital ties to be “capriciously and whimsically” broken by a Muslim man, and violated Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing equal protection of the law to men and women. With no chance for reconciliation, many Muslim women have found themselves destitute, with no recourse available in civil law.

The majority verdict attempts a delicate balancing act between individual rights enshrined in Article 14 and religious freedoms guaranteed by Article 25. While Justice Joseph found that triple talaq was against the mandate of Quran and therefore impermissible, Justices Nariman and Lalit also made the more fundamental argument that triple talaq violated Article 14 and therefore needed to be struck down. Since marriage is a civil institution, Article 14 ought to have precedence over Article 25 in case there is conflict between the two. Interestingly, the Union government wanted the court to ban all forms of talaq which none of the judges agreed to. But the government can take credit for lending its immense clout to the Muslim women who approached SC against triple talaq.

It was a colonial era law, Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, that surrendered jurisdiction on matters of marriage, divorce, succession and maintenance including talaq to clerics who later banded under the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). But Justice Nariman rightly cited the Constitution’s Article 13(1) which demands that all colonial-era laws not in consonance with fundamental rights be struck down. This is an important intervention. Matters concerning fundamental rights cannot be left to personal law bodies like the arch-conservative AIMPLB.

It is tempting to see the judgment as a body blow to personal laws and politicise it. This is not only incorrect but also dangerous. Rather than an affront to any particular religion it must be viewed as a pit stop in the path towards progressive and egalitarian changes in society. Many Muslim majority countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, have rejected talaq-e-biddat. The government’s emphasis must now shift to ensuring universal marriage registration and reforming personal laws in consultation with community groups to ensure equal rights for men and women in marriage, divorce and alimony."

"Essar Oil: Rosneft deal signifies our ability to build assets: Prashant Ruia, Essar Group, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In an interview with ET Now's Vijay Iyer,, talks about the group's deal with Russia's Rosneft . Edited excerpts:Firstly, this is not so much about debt only. It is about the ability of the Essar Group to create an asset from the scratch. In 1995, we started Essar Oil . In fact, we did our first IPO back in 1995. At that time, the market cap or the market value of Essar Oil was about Rs 2,000 crore and now we have just announced the final price at which the deal will get concluded which is at about Rs 75 premium to the Rs 262 delisting price that keeps the equity value of the company at about Rs 50,000 crore. To us, this signifies our ability to build greenfield assets, create value and then be in a position to attract global investors who can then participate in the Indian growth story. We have done it before. We have done it in the telecom space when we initially brought in Hutchison and then it was Vodafone which is now Vodafone in India and in that we brought in Vodafone and the total value of their investment was about $18 billion but in two tranches and now we have done this.To me, this signifies who we are and what we are really good at. The debt repayment is a corollary for us. We have already been very open about it. Our total debt reduction is about Rs 70,000 crore of which nearly Rs 50,000 crore goes to the Indian banks and the rest goes to the international banks. In total, about Rs 36,000 crore of this is repaid and the rest gets transferred to the new shareholders. This is the single largest deleveraging ever done in Indian corporate history and this is also the first time that shareholders, retail shareholder, individual shareholders are getting rewarded nearly two years after the company has been delisted.Yes. This is the announcement we made on Tuesday. It took us a day to get for our advisors to come out with the final numbers and that is what we have done. And this provides about a 30% premium to what the delisting price was of Rs 262.The net outgo I think is about Rs 880 odd crore. This is over and above the Rs 3,000 odd crore which was given at the time of delisting.My father and my uncle.No, obviously the decision was taken some time back because we entered into an agreement with Rosneft and Trafigura on 15th of October of last year on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit. That was the time when the sale-purchase agreement was finally documented and obviously the decision was taken a little bit before that.As a group, our philosophy has always been to build assets from scratch, nurture them and take them to international scale and then look at opportunity to monetise them. As I said. we have done this before in telecom business, we are doing it now in our oil business. We believe that the value was right and we believe that the future growth and expansion which the company needs is best done with new shareholders and we are very happy that Rosneft and Trafigura have come in as our new shareholders and I am sure they will add significant growth to the company just like Vodafone has done to the telecom business in the last five-six years.Frankly, it is really not such a material issue, the consortium of Trafigura and UCP asked us to stay invested with 2% of their stake, we have done that and we will go with the consortium and do whatever they would like us to do because in any case, for us it is not a very material investment.The non-compete is for three years. We continue to be in the oil and gas business internationally with our Essar Oil UK refinery and we continue to be in India in the E&P, exploration and production business and the cold bed methane business which we have retained from Essar Oil.Those two continue but for refining and marketing in India there is a three years non-compete clause. As for the brand, we are very happy that Rosneft and Trafigura have elicited to retain the Essar brand on the entire retail network. We believe it is a strong brand. We believe the network has been built significantly over the last two, three years and they have also announced significant growth in the retail network going forward. How long they continue the brand is really up to them. That is a decision which they will have to arrive at and we are happy that they continue to utilise the brand and whatever brand fees were being paid earlier to Essar that basically continues.I would not want to categorise it like that. Yes, we have had a challenging period over the last two-three years principally because some of the contracts which we signed for natural resources like natural gas and coal got cancelled.Basically Essar Steel was affected by the cancellation of its natural gas which was its primary fuel or primary source as feedstock for the gas based sponge iron plant which we set up and that affected our production and that affected the company in a very material way.So those were the reasons but fine we went through a challenging period and now I am happy to say that our capital investment program is complete, those issues are largely behind us, coal is now-- the mines which got cancelled, coal is now available from alternate sources like Coal India etc and natural gas is now available from alternate sources which basically we are importing LNG.We have addressed those issues, we have completed our projects, we have ramped up capacities, we have completed overall capital investment programme of about Rs 1.2 lakh crore and now we are looking with this transaction also completed, we are looking forward to a much better and a much stronger future obviously with a de-levered balance sheet.I do not want to get too much into it because we are in a regulatory court process but our ability to invest and provide a strong resolution plan is significantly better now than before because of the significant deleveraging which has taken place on our balance sheet. So, we look forward to getting this process completed as quickly as possible, restructuring the company and moving ahead.Clearly Essar Oil has been a fantastic company which has grown and created significant value over the last two decades and that was the same with telecom.We as a group have focussed on creating value and if you take the telecom business which we exited, we had about 10x exit from the time we invested to the time we exited. Essar Oil has been about 4x exit with the market cap going up from 2000 to 50,000 over the last two decades. We see the same opportunity in the rest of our portfolio.It is not that some of these companies were also looking significantly lower values when the cycles were down. So telecom went through its own period of difficulty. The oil business has gone through a period of very low refining margins and difficulty in the 2010, 2011, 2012 period. At that time people did not see these kind of values.That is part of the process in a commodity infrastructure business where markets are moving up and down. So to answer the question -- we are extremely excited with the rest of the portfolio. We believe that significant value exists and we are going to invest and grow the rest of the portfolio to create that value going forward.Yes the capital cycle is pretty much completed, as I said the Rs 1.2 lakh crore. Some of the projects which were completed are just getting commissioned. So over the next two-three months and before the end of this year, it will be completed but the majority of the funds have already been invested. From an investment prospective, the capital cycle is largely completed and we are now looking at growth in terms of bringing all these assets and sweating these assets in the next few years and looking at brownfield expansions and brownfield growth as we go ahead. This includes the Essar Oil UK asset where we have invested close to $800 million since we acquired the asset to upgrade it, improve the environmental standards and safety standards and increase the efficiency of the asset.The group revenues in the current year after Essar Oil sale would be about $15 billion.In FY18 and we have not put a specific number to it but we are looking at growth from these numbers going forward.Principally the way we see it, the consolidation and monetisation programme is largely completed now. We are looking at growth going forward in our portfolio. We do not really see the need for further monetisation at this point of time in our portfolio.Yes exactly that is exactly what I was going to tell you. Nothing is planned at this point of time. As I said we need to get these businesses to mature a little bit more. We have just completed our capex cycle and then we will see what is the best course of action.So the group revenues are as I said around $15 billion in the current year and the group EBITDA we are expecting to be in the region of $2-2.5 billion for the whole year, for the financial year currently and then we will see where it goes in the future.Companies get into difficulty for different reasons but in India, at least in some of the sectors, some of the companies or the majority of the companies have got into difficulty not entirely because of their own decisions or not entirely because of their own actions. Some of the regulatory decisions which have been made in the last few years, principally in the last couple of years of the previous government and then not necessarily by the government but also by the courts did leave many of the sectors and many of the companies facing challenges which they could not have foreseen.Issues concerning cancellation of gas contracts, cancellation of coal linkages, cancellation of coal mines, cancellation of environment approvals on a retrospective basis, right of way concerns which face the right of the highway industry, were faced by many companies. Many of the companies need a restructuring. The current government has taken a lot of steps to set right many of these issues which have hurt the industry with policies which will ensure that these kind of things do not happen in the future.Plus, in the last few years, capital investment in these sectors has been fairly low and the demand continues to grow in India and so in the next few years with these issues behind us, with the restructuring getting resolved, many of these companies will see investment cycle will come back. But it might take another year or two before you will start seeing the full impact of that investment cycle for India.I am again talking only about the core sectors which we are involved in. On the other side, on the retail sector, on the retail side on the consumer side obviously there has been significant growth and those markets remain extremely strong as what the capital markets are reflecting.Some of the issues which saw NPAs was because of policies which were not clear. As I said, those have been corrected now and the new policies are in a transparent, public manner hopefully that will ensure that in the future if investments are made in these sectors, these problems are not faced by the investors coming forward.And to ensure that that is done in an open and transparent manner which will provide comfort both to the investors and to the banks because they have also been affected largely by things which they could not have foreseen and hopefully that will provide a much more conducive and a positive environment for all of us to invest because India is still at a very early stage. We are still about 20% of Chinese consumption and we are clearly on a growth trajectory which is now higher than even China and so next few years we hope that things will be significantly better.That is the biggest attraction for India and that is also the main attraction why Rosneft and Trafigura came to India.Well I am happy for their support. I am happy for all the support which the banks have provided us which has provided us the ability to build these world class assets and we have honoured our commitment. We made a decision two years back, we have honoured our commitment and we look forward to a strong future together.Well I do not know what more we can do but yes.Well I am not an expert to comment on this...I think relationships have to be managed. It could be between two professionals, it could be between a professional and an entrepreneur or it could be between a founder and a professional, it is the same. At the end of the day it comes down to relationships and ensuring that everybody is aligned in the interest of the company or in the interest of the group is ultimately what will ensure success.

"Self-powered, paper-based device can detect diseases, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The device can plug into a handheld potentiostat, at left, to automate the diagnostic tests so that they can be performed by untrained users. (Purdue University photo/Aniket Pal)

New York: Scientists, including those of Indian origin, have developed a new portable, paper-based device that can identify diseases such as anaemia and can be powered just by rubbing or pressing it.

Researchers at Purdue University in the US built self- powered, paper-based electrochemical devices (SPEDs) can provide sensitive diagnostics to patients in regions that have limited access to resources or medical equipments.

The device detects biomarkers and identifies diseases by performing electrochemical analyses and reads out the colour- coded test results, making it easy for non-experts to understand, researchers said.

The test is initiated by placing a pinprick of blood in a circular feature on the device, which is less than two square inches.

SPEDs also contain ""self-pipetting test zones"" that can be dipped into a sample instead of using a finger-prick test, researchers said.

The top layer of the SPED is fabricated using untreated cellulose paper with patterned hydrophobic ""domains"" that define channels that wick up blood samples for testing.

These channels allow for accurate assays that change colour to indicate specific testing results.

They also created a machine-vision diagnostic application to automatically identify and quantify each of these ""colorimetric"" tests from a digital image of the SPED, perhaps taken with a cellphone, to provide fast diagnostic results to the user and to facilitate remote-expert consultation.

The bottom layer of the SPED is a ""triboelectric generator,"" or TEG, which generates the electric current necessary to run the diagnostic test simply by rubbing or pressing it, researchers said.

Researchers, including Debkalpa Goswami and Aniket Pal, designed an inexpensive handheld device called a potentiostat, which is easily plugged into the SPED to automate the diagnostic tests so that they can be performed by untrained users.

The battery powering the potentiostat can be recharged using the TEG built into the SPEDs.

Researchers used SPEDs to detect biomarkers such as glucose, uric acid and L-lactate, ketones, and white blood cells, which indicate factors related to liver and kidney function, malnutrition and anaemia.

Future versions of the technology will contain several additional layers for more complex assays to detect diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria, HIV and hepatitis, Martinez said.

""You could consider this a portable laboratory that is just completely made out of paper, is inexpensive and can be disposed of through incineration,"" said Ramses Martinez, an assistant professor at Purdue University.

The study was published in the journal Advanced Materials Technologies."

"Tracking and treating Hepatitis B and C, Health News, ET HealthWorld","About one million Indians are at risk of acquiring HBV infection and about 10,000 die from the virus every year.

ByDevare,Director of Diagnostics Research, Abbott, IllinoisThere’s a war of epic proportions going on right now between the human immune system and a plethora of infectious diseases such as HIV, Dengue, Chikungunya, Swine Flu, Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and Hepatitis . Are we losing this battle? We could if we don’t keep up with these viruses as they tend to mutate rapidly, outpacing diagnostics. The ways to address these evolving challenges are to continue to strengthen our virus surveillance efforts and develop tests to track and detect these viruses.Hepatitis is caused by aggressive viruses that have resulted in worldwide epidemics. In 2015, deaths due to viral hepatitis were higher than those due to HIV, TB and Malaria. Hepatitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the liver. Over time, this inflammation in the liver results in scarring, chronic liver damage (also called cirrhosis) and even liver cancer. At the point of cirrhosis, the liver is unable to heal itself.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in India, 40 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 6 to 12 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition to HBV and HCV, there are three other hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). HBV, HCV and HDV are transmitted through exposure to infected bodily fluids including shared toothbrushes and razors; shared drug needles, sexual transmission, unscreened blood transfusions and non-sterilized medical equipment. HAV and HEV are transmitted by ingesting contaminated food or water. Most acute liver failures diagnosed in India are due to hepatitis E infection. Children are most susceptible to hepatitis A as it’s associated with poor sanitation and hygiene. Unlike HBV and HCV, HAV infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but in rare situations, it can cause debilitating symptoms and acute liver failure. Globally, HBV and HCV are given priority as they are a leading cause of death .India is one of the 11 countries which carry almost 50 percent of the global burden of chronic hepatitis. While HBV and HCV cause chronic infections, HAV and HEV are not chronic. HAV and HEV could be effectively dealt with by public education, improving sanitation and hygiene. To eliminate hepatitis in India, it is important to screen and diagnose those infected with the virus. About one million Indians are at risk of acquiring HBV infection and about 10,000 die from the virus every year. Anti-viral drugs for treatment of HBV infected people are helpful to help suppress the disease, but because the treatment does not cure HBV infection, most people who start treatment must continue it for life. Vaccination at birth is the most effective avenue for protection from HBV infection. For HCV elimination, it is important to use diagnostic tests to identify people with active infection and treat them with anti-viral drugs now available in India. A 12 to 24 weeks anti-HCV treatment leads to cure in over 95% of infected people.To align with the WHO’s 2030 goal of hepatitis elimination, many countries, including India, have embarked on national plans investing in screenings for earlier detection and paving the way for people to have access treatment. Recently on World Hepatitis Day, India’s Union Minister of Health – Dr JP Nadda announced the National Action Plan for Hepatitis C, which will be completed by December 2017 and rolled out subsequently next year. Funded fully by the government, the plan will focus on three key aspects – prevention, screening and surveillance.While with the collective push from the WHO and local health authorities, and the awareness about treatment has increased, the incidence continues to rise. As per the WHO, in 2015, 1.75 million adults were newly infected with HCV largely due to injection drug use and due to unsafe injections in health care settings in some countries. Therefore, in addition to monitoring incidence of viral outbreaks, India’s focus should be on populations with high-risk of viral infections – such as patients who receive multiple blood transfusions because they have inherited blood disorders, such as thalassemia (abnormal haemoglobin production) and sickle cell anaemia (a group of disorders caused by deformed red blood cells to break down); haemodialysis patients (whose kidneys do not work normally and depend on a dialysis process for purifying the blood), intravenous drug users, prison inmates, and emergency unit patients.The weakest link in gauging the ongoing impact of the hepatitis virus is the availability of incidence data. India should build a national hepatitis surveillance hub that tracks the strains over the years across various communities. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a strategy to screen all people born between years 1945 to 1965 for HCV as this population accounted for 73 per cent of all HCV-associated deaths. A similar approach could be implemented to identify population groups greatly impacted by hepatitis viruses in India. Since most people living with hepatitis are not aware of the infection, public education, screening, diagnosis and treatment are the critical steps in eliminating hepatitis. The WHO goal to eliminate hepatitis by 2030 is ambitious, and its success will depend of the global effort from high-burden countries.Diagnosis is the first step for identifying the presence of an infection. HIV and hepatitis viruses evolve to produce diverse strains. Increasing diversity and the ever-changing distribution of these viruses continue to present a challenge to diagnostic and monitoring tests. The way to ensure that diagnostic tools keep pace with these viruses is to remain committed to ongoing research. It is of utmost importance to monitor viral evolution and track new strains around the world by establishing global surveillance programs and warrant that all viral infections are efficiently detected by diagnostic tests despite of wide genetic diversity.The WHO estimates that 257 million people were living with HBV and 71 million living with HCV infections in 2015. The majority of these people were not diagnosed, and only less than one tenth of the HBV and HCV infected people who were diagnosed were on treatment in 2015. What’s unique about HCV is that it operates on the sly, 80 percent of people with an acute HCV infection show no apparent symptoms, with many people progressing to chronic infection. Because so many are not aware of an HCV infection, the condition may go unnoticed for decades, often until permanent damage has been done to the liver. So, how can you detect a virus that rarely, outwardly shows its face? First, understanding the genetic diversity of the virus is a key factor to building the right strategy.With advances in testing and treatments, it is possible to eliminate hepatitis C with patient proactivity - if you have not been tested for HCV, please talk to your doctor about getting tested so you know your status. Anti-viral treatment is available to eliminate HCV and get cured from the viral infection."
"Pneumonia: India grants Pfizer patent for blockbuster brand Prevenar 13, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: India has granted US drug giant Pfizer a patent for its blockbuster vaccine Prevenar 13 , used to protect children against life threatening pneumococcal diseases. The approval comes over a decade after the company applied for the patent in the country. Pneumonia is one of the leading cause of deaths of children under five years of age. India has seven pneumonia related deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the 2016 Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report by John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Prevenar 13 is approved to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases caused by 13 strains of streptococcus pneumonia, according to Pfizer. The vaccine provides the “broadest” serotype coverage of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine available in the world today, the company’s spokesperson told ET.Pfizer subsidiary Wyeth’s application for grant of Prevenar 13’s patent “entered national phase” in October 2007, according to the Indian Patent Office’s document that granted the approval. Over the years, this patent application has been opposed by Indian vaccine maker Panacea Biotec and global medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).According to those opposing the application, Pfizer’s vaccine lacked the novelty for it to be considered for a patent but the patent office, in its approval on August 11, dismissed these arguments.According to the office, Pfizer has demonstrated “surprising effects” that have to be considered as establishing that the vaccine is inventive.“We are pleased to note that the validity of the Prevenar 13 patent has now been recognized by the Indian Patent Office,” a Pfizer spokesperson told ET.“Supported by extensive clinical research and real-world experience, each dose of PCV 13 requires 400 different raw materials, 580 manufacturing steps, 678 quality tests and two and a half years to produce…Pfizer remains committed towards further enhancing access of this vaccine in India, both in the market as well as through partnership with the Government to expand introduction in the public program.”Prevenar 13 was launched in India in 2010, according to the spokesperson.The vaccine has consistently been one of Pfizer’s strongest performing brands, experiencing year-on-year growth in the “mid double digits” and capturing 18% of the Indian vaccine market, according to Pfizer’s 2016 annual report.This March, the Indian government introduced Pfizer’s PCV 13 vaccine into its national immunisation program through a program funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Around five states (approximately 5.15 million babies) are expected to be covered in the first phase."

"New Afghan Strategy: For it to work, Trump must recalibrate approach to Iran","US President Donald Trump has finally articulated his new Afghanistan strategy that reverses the Obama administration’s focus on withdrawal of American troops. Instead, the new plan seeks to increase troop deployment up to 4,000 additional soldiers who will now work closely with Afghan security forces on the ground. The thinking in Washington today is that Obama’s focus on wrapping up operations in Afghanistan during the final years of his tenure emboldened the Taliban who have slowly clawed back the advantage. Therefore, if the Americans completely pack up now it will be tantamount to handing over Afghanistan to the Taliban.

This assessment is not without merit. The Taliban have proved to be a hardy lot. Plus, there is now a consensus that peace without any participation of the Taliban is impossible. Whether one likes it or not, the Taliban do represent a significant section of the Afghan population. Add to this the fact that the Pashtun group has been cleverly positioning itself as the only force capable of fighting the growing presence of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. Taken together, the Taliban has to be part of the political solution in Afghanistan.

So the question now is: How much space should the Taliban be given in future peace negotiations? Ideally, the US would want to negotiate from a position of strength and create a situation where the Taliban is one of many balancing forces in Afghanistan. This means denying the Taliban an overwhelming role in the future Afghan state structure. And that would require militarily beating the Taliban into an acceptable shape. Hence the focus of the new strategy on boosting American troops.

That said, the part of the equation that the US really needs to solve is Pakistan. There’s no denying the fact that Pakistan has a vested interest in supporting and sustaining the Taliban for strategic depth in Afghanistan. It has been doing this all this while, proffering a dubious ‘Good Taliban, Bad Taliban’ line to keep its own strategic assets intact. Washington’s failure has been its inability to see through Islamabad’s duplicity. While Trump has called out Pakistan for sheltering terrorists and asserted that things can’t remain the same, there’s no clarity on the way forward. Given Afghanistan’s geopolitical reality, Pakistan has a natural influence on Afghanistan. But if this has become a problem for the US, then Washington must look for another country to help actualise Afghan stability.

It’s welcome that Trump has recognised India’s role in security and development of Afghanistan. New Delhi has already done a lot in terms of infrastructure building in that country, as exemplified by the construction of the new Afghan Parliament. Of course, it can do much more. However, given its geographical proximity, Iran too is crucial for ensuring stability in Afghanistan. This is where Trump is missing a trick. If he is serious about putting Pakistan under the cosh, for the sake of Afghanistan he must recalibrate his approach to Iran.

Treating Iran as the enemy, threatening to rescind the Iran nuclear deal, and giving into Saudi insecurities won’t help the US with Afghanistan. If Washington is truly thinking of bypassing Islamabad, it must establish a credible working relationship with Tehran. The latter has enough stakes in the Afghan situation to help the Americans create the right balance between Pashtun and non-Pashtun groups. This approach will dilute Pakistan’s influence on Afghan polity, check the Taliban’s power, and allow countries like India to do more in Afghanistan. Besides, Iran today has a moderate President who is seeking to open up his country and modernise its economy. This is the worst time for Washington to adopt an adversarial position with respect to Tehran. Trump should not allow his foreign policy to be guided by Saudi paranoia."
"Government to ink MoU with private hospitals for Hridayam initiative, Health News, ET HealthWorld","KOCHI: With the government set to launch the congenital heart disease management programme Hridayam (for little hearts), the health department is in the process of inking MoU with three more private hospitals to empanel them for treating congenital heart problems.At the moment there are three government empanelled hospitals namely Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Government Medical College, Kottayam and the medical college in Kozhikode. In the private sector, only Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIMS ) was empanelled.Now, the government's assessment committee has inspected three private hospitals namely Aster Medcity , Kochi; Lisie Hospital, Kochi and Believers Church Medical College Hospital, Thiruvalla. The panel recommended that since these hospitals meet the technical requirement, government can sign MoUs with them so that patients will get free treatment at these institutions.""Three more private hospitals are being empanelled to reduce waiting time,"" said state mission director of National Health Mission (NHM) Keshvendra Kumar.Hridayam is a unique initiative by the state government to support children with congenital heart disease (CHD), which happens to be the 'largest treatable cause of death' among infants. Hridayam is a web-based solution that will care for children with CHD. The initiative will monitor the programme envisaged for the management of children with CHD, identify bottlenecks for implementing established protocols, and understand case status and response time.As per the plan, a beneficiary will have to register at Hridayam website and after the registration process is complete, the surgery dates fixed by the empanelled institutions would be provided to the child's parents.""Family members can choose the date and empanelled hospital they want to go ahead with the operation. Once implemented, this would be a first-of-its-kind system in the country,"" said an official closely associated with the programme. After the website was opened on Monday, nearly five cases were registered."

"power sector: Loan sanctions have jumped 150 per cent in the first quarter: PV Ramesh, CMD, REC, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In a chat with ET Now, PV Rames, CMD of Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, talks about his company's margins. Edited excerpts: REC continues to maintain its robust growth momentum in terms of supporting the power sector development in this country. Our sanctions have increased by 150% in the first quarter year-on-year compared to the first quarter of last year. In terms of disbursement, we have grown 25% and our growth has come from all segments like distribution, transmission renewables. We are working towards realising the the goal of the government of providing assured, affordable and quality power for all in the shortest possible time. Coming to the margins, yes there has been a marginal decline in the margins. However,they continue to remain above 4% as far as NIM is concerned.t is one of the Lanco power projects. We have an overall exposure of about Rs 500 crore. but we are not the sole lenders. There are several other lenders. Our exposure as a proportion of the overall exposure is about 15%. We have made an appropriate provision as mandated by Reserve Bank of India and our gross NPA as proportion of our loan book is less than 2.6% and in net NPA it is sub 2%. Ours is a financial institution with a sole exposure to power sector which has the lowest NPAs among all the peers.Let me say categorically that we are grateful to the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We have carefully studied them and have taken note of those observations. It needs to be abundantly clarified that this is a joint report and pertains to our sister concern PFC. CAG has made pointed comments relating to REC and to PFC. In those observations that have been made, which have been erroneously in my view presented by some of the media outlets, says that we did not adhere to the RBI norms. But in the the same report CAG has stated that REC has adhered to the RBI norms."

What ails our Temples of Health?,"The deaths of children on account of the Japanese Encephalitis Virus at the Gorakhpur Medical College is completely unacceptable and I share the anguish of every citizen of our country on these man made errors.

But as always happens, it is only a matter of time before our activist press members will find something new to cover, our politicians will get busy with new challenges and our doctors, who are responsible for these deaths every year will breathe a sigh of relief as the spotlight will shift from them.

Japanese Encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by the mosquito borne Japanese encephalitis virus. This virus makes its annual appearance during the period July – September months in Gorakhpur district and neighbourhood areas. The fatalities in the last few years are as follows:

1. 2012: 557

2. 2013: 650.

3. 2014: 525

4. 2015: 491

5. 2016: 641

6. 2017: 100, so far

What is important for the authorities is to ensure that they must not allow the deaths of these children to become an annual affair that needs to be justified and shouted about for a short period of time because it gets attention and it gets media coverage, only to go back to status quo ante when the noise recedes. Proactive steps need to be taken from vaccination to cleanliness to substantial improvement of the facilities and infrastructure at these government-owned medical institutions.

It is time for us to take stock of the state of our medical colleges not just in Gorakhpur or the state of Uttar Pradesh but in the entire country. Have we ever wondered why it is always the poor who suffer? Probably because they are the only people who have to seek medical help in government owned medical colleges, civil hospitals or primary health centres.

Has a journalist ever made a surprise visit to any of these hospitals and seen the pathetic state of the hospitals and even the Intensive Care units? They would be shocked to see that it is quite common to experience a big shortage of ICU beds and to see patients lying on the floor with their relatives holding up the drip connected to their bodies because there is no equipment even to hold the bottle of saline or the bag of blood.

In addition to the unsanitary conditions in our temples of health, it is quite common to see stray dogs, monkeys and rats everywhere in the hospital.

Have we looked at the pathetic state of waiting areas for patients in government owned medical colleges? In summer, patients sit in the intense heat with no provision of water. In monsoons, there is no covered area outside and in winter, they have to brave the bone chilling winter of North India.

Patients come from villages spread hundreds of kilometers around the medical colleges and they have no idea how long they may have to wait to get an appointment. At the same time, have we seen how easily it is for VIP’s to not only get immediate attention and the best medicines but also the best rooms while everyone else is struggling to find a place on the floor in the hospital to sit or to lie down?

Government doctors are happily operating their private practices from their homes and no one bothers to enforce the rule that government doctors are not permitted to have a private practice. In several states, there is a new term called “propaganda medicine” that has evolved over a period of time. There are specialist doctors in several medical colleges who have now taken control of the entire value chain from prescription to purchase. These doctors write the prescription, manufacture the medicines that they prescribe in partnership with someone and they have even set up a chemist shop where these medicines are exclusively available.

Have we looked at the availability of medicines in government hospitals, which under most state laws are supposed to be given free of charge to people in the economically weaker sections of society? These medicines are supplied to these medical college shops by the Government and are prescribed by the doctors. More often than not, these medicines are not available. It is the norm that when a poor patient takes the prescription to the shop, he is told that medicines are out of stock. In the same breath, the pharmacist at the store tells the patient that he should walk across the road and go to the private chemist on the other side of the road where all these medicines are easily available, albeit at a cost.

Where are the medicines that were procured by the Government and supplied to these medical colleges? Why are they not available in the hospital stores? Has anyone bothered to investigate this or is this news not “breaking” enough for people to sit up and take notice?

In order to prevent theft and re-sale of government procured medicines, a simple solution is available. All medicines procured by the government for distribution free of charge should be packaged not in a silver strip but in a black foil strip with the medicine name and ingredients printed clearly across the strip in red. The medicine strips should also clearly state that these medicines are distributed free of charge and if anyone is found to be selling these medicines, severe and exemplary action will be taken. This is a very simple solution to solve the problem but may not be economically beneficial to the procurement officials.

The poor people face challenges all the time. There are chemists who have shops outside medical colleges and they specialise in supply of medicines for illnesses – where a patient is unlikely to recover – such as cancer. These chemists sit with a lawyer who specialises in land title deeds and they take away the land of the poor people in exchange for medicines that the patient needs. Can there really be any other trade worse than this?

We need some serious introspection on the condition of all government owned health institutions in our country and the service they provide for the poor and the masses of our nation for whom they were really setup. Governments come and governments go. Some lip-sync their concerns and sympathy a little more than the others but most of them have done nothing even after seven decades of our independence.

Only when we start going to the grass root of the problems will we be able to start fixing the institutions of health that serve the people. Accountability has to be sought and discipline must be enforced. Otherwise every year there will be an outbreak of encephalitis and every year we will express our shock only to forget about the outbreak till the next epidemic strikes.

It is impossible to get anything done overnight but a beginning has to be made."

"Govt brings in new norms on solar power procurement, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government has implemented new rules for buying power from grid-linked solar power projects through competitive bidding under the National Solar Mission to improve transparency and standardise auctions.

These guidelines, prepared by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), cover the grid-connected solar PV power projects with a size of 5 mw and above, an official said.

The official said this will help in reducing off-takers' risks, encourage investments, enhance bankability of projects and improve profitability for investors.

The norms provide that the minimum power purchase agreement tenure (PPA) will be 25 years that will help ensure lower tariffs. Besides, unilateral termination or amendment of PPA is not allowed.

The issues related to land, connectivity and clearances and the extension in the case of delay have been streamlined for ensuring project preparedness.

The event of default and the consequences thereof are clearly defined to ensure optimal risk sharing.

There is a provision for termination compensation to increase bankability of projects by securing investment by the generator and lenders against any arbitrary termination of a PPA.

The guidelines also provide for payment security mechanism. The risk of generator's revenue getting blocked due to delayed payment or non-payment has been addressed through provision of Payment Security Mechanism through instruments like Letter of Credit (LC), Payment Security Fund, State Guarantee and the like.

The early commissioning and part commissioning of projects have not only been allowed, but incentivised, by way of allowing the PPA for a minimum 25 years from the scheduled commissioning date under the new norms.

The penalties have been rationalised so as to reduce the overall cost to the generator while at the same time ensuring compliance with rules.

The new framework also contains provision for force majeure. Now, the PPA would have provisions with regard to force majeure definitions, exclusions, applicability and available relief as per the industry standards.

The successful bidder -- if it is a single company -- shall ensure its shareholding in the SPV company executing the PPA shall not drop below 51 per cent at any point prior to one year from the commercial operation date except with the prior approval of the procurer."
26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Washington has signalled its willingness to end its deference to Pakistan’s sensitivities about India’s involvement in Afghanistan. New Delhi must devise a plan, based on India’s interests and one that will ensure peace, stability and progress in the region.

There has been a growing realisation in the US that Pakistan has consistently played a double game. Islamabad has successfully extracted concessions and aid from the US as a partner in the war on terror, and at the same time, it has continued to provide substantial support, including safe haven, to terrorists.

Beginning from the closing months of the Clinton administration, Washington has increasingly leaned on and called out Pakistan. What sets apart Trump’s calling out of Pakistan supporting terrorists is that it is more unequivocal than that of his predecessors.

Given President Trump’s track record, it remains to be seen if he and his administration will stay the course and follow through with concrete action. There is much that the US can do to curtail Pakistan’s continued assistance to terrorists.

Washington needs to follow its talk with action. India needs to seize this moment. Pakistan will not give up its efforts to block a greater role for India in Afghanistan; it is already unsettled by New Delhi’s $1-billion investment.

Washington needs to follow up with necessary action to translate Trump’s words into reality. At the same time, India needs to work out its interests and those of the region to map out its participation in Afghanistan.

New Delhi must seize the opportunity accorded by Trump’s calling out of Pakistan for its support of terror groups. Trump’s Afghanistan and South Asia policy gives India an opening, it is for New Delhi to fashion it."

"Biocon developing 10 biosimilars that collectively target global market opportunity of over $60 billion: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India’s biopharmaceutical company Biocon , which ranks among top three biosimilar global players for insulin , has multiple successes in its container since its inception. So far, Biocon has successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars from laboratory to market in India.“We will continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in our research and development,” said, Chairman & Managing Director,. In an email interview with ETHealthworld, the Biocon chief shared her in-depth insights on the challenges, achievements and growth prospects of the biopharma industry in India. Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion’s share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‘Start-Up India’ initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia’s first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‘lab to market’ in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‘first-in-class’ oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."
"Vegetarians Not Vegetarian Anymore? Turns Out, Plants Knew All Along They Were Being Eaten","Well, we all know that vegetarians take a lot of pride in the food they eat. They leave no stone unturned when it comes to giving a shit for eating meat as if it's a crime and as if the animals knows they are being eaten.

Well hey vegetarians, in your face because plants know it too.

Leaf&wood

A new research shows that plants know when they're being eaten and they don't like it when you do that. According to o Modern Farmer, a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri claims that all the plants possess some sort of intelligence and know it when you're approaching them to put them in your mouth.

They even send out defence mechanisms to try to stop you from doing that. The study was carried out on thale cress, which is closely related to broccoli, kale, mustard greens, and other members of the family. They are commonly used for experiments because they have genome sequenced, and scientists are intimately familiar with how it works.

vegetables

Researchers took audio recordings to understand vibrations a plant does when it's being eaten. They studied these vibration patterns, that released another shake like wind noise.

Modern Farmer claims ""the thale cress produces mustard oils that are mildly toxic when eaten and sends them throughout its leaves to try to keep the predators away.""

""Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,"" said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU.

""However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found that feeding vibrations signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars,"" he added.

This Free Smartphone App Replaces Expensive Hearing Aids For People Suffering From Hearing Loss,"Losing your hearing can be a real problem, and if you’re young it’s twice as embarrassing. It doesn’t matter that it’s a medical condition, no one under the age of 50 would be comfortable being spotted with an earpiece.

And that’s exactly why MobileEars believes there’s a market out there for their unique product. The company markets it as an “affordable and attractive” solution for people with hearing loss, especially those in a younger age bracket.

“More people today will lose their hearing earlier than our ancestors’” says VP of sales and marketing for Listen AS (MobileEars' parent company), Arjun Bhatt. He believes one of the main problems with hearing aids in the market today is that they each cost between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. To top it off, hearing loss is not covered by most health insurance plans, and the doctor consults are expensive. Another major issue, is the stigma associated with wearing the earpiece needed to return hearing to the person.

Instead, MobileEars hopes to solve the problem in a cheap, accessible, and subtle fashion. Their app uses the microphone on a user’s smartphone to amplify sounds around them, and feed them back through headphones. The kicker here though is that it isn’t just an amplifier. It uses a form of speech recognition technology to pick up and amplify voices, whether a person speaking in front of you or on TV, and dim out the ambient noise.

MobileEye has also made provisions for variations in user’s extent of hearing loss, based on statistics of the condition. When you start up the app, it collects a few details like your age and gender to optimise the experience, but you can always fine tune it later.

Right now, the app needs a user to have their headphones connected, though the next logical step is improving the hardware, Bhatt says. The idea is to one day replace hearing aids entirely, though that may be a ways off.

For the time being, MobileEars is happy to just be a cheap alternative to expensive medical aids. And by cheap we mean the app is free to use on iOS, with an Android version likely incoming in the near future. It even works offline so you don’t have to worry about your data where your well-being is concerned.

And the company supposedly doesn’t have any revenue plans in the near future. If that does eventually happen, Bhatt believes it’ll either be by adding extra features to a premium version of the app, or by manufacturing companion hardware. “Right now, the focus is on getting the word out,” he says."
"NTPC: NTPC to secure 33 per cent of coal requirements from own mines by 2030, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: State-owned power generator NTPC Ltd plans to secure around a third of its coal requirement through its own captive coal blocks by 2030, the company said in its annual report. NTPC has been allotted 10 coal blocks with a peak production capacity of more than 100 Million Tons Per Annum (MTPA). With these, the company envisages being one of the largest captive coal mining companies in India.“The previous fiscal saw the flag off of your company’s first coal rake, from its mining operations at Pakri Barwadih . This coal is being used at Barh Thermal Station of NTPC, in Bihar. This is an important step in the direction of secured fuel supplies for your Company. The medium term target for mining will be able to cater to more than 10 percent of its present coal requirements,” Gurdeep Singh, Chairman & Managing Director, said to the company’s shareholders in the report.As per its long term corporate plan, NTPC has envisioned to reach a total installed capacity of 130 GW and annual generation of more than 600 billion units (BU) by 2032. “The capacity will have a diversified fuel mix comprising 65.4 percent coal, 4.6 percent gas, 1.5 percent nuclear and 28.5 percent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) including hydro. Therefore, by 2032, non-fossil fuel based generation capacity shall make up nearly 30percent of NTPC’s portfolio,” the report said.The company also plans to replace its old and inefficient units with technologically advanced, efficient and environmentally compliant units by 2032, in a phased manner. “NTPC would continue pursuing the power trading business in India as well as with the neighboring countries increasing its market share in the region through its wholly-owned subsidiary ‘NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd’,” the report said.NTPC is also planning to make a foray into e-mobility and battery storage, supported by Research & Development and collaboration with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and research institutes, the report stated. “Apart from this, NTPC is taking several initiatives to contain pollution in various forms. Two such projects your Company is experimenting with are waste-to-energy and biomass co-firing,” Singh said.As per the report, NTPC crossed the 50,000 MW mark in Installed capacity in the previous fiscal. The company commissioned 3,845 MW and added 2,190 MW to its commercial capacity during FY16-17. The installed capacity of NTPC Group is 51,671 MW as on 31 March, 2017."
Who divided India? Jinnah or Nehru?,"What led to India’s Partition? Could it have been avoided? If not Partition, the bloodbath that claimed the lives of more than 1 million people?

In a brilliant, must-read effort, noted military historian Barney White-Spunner recounts what happened in 1947, freedom and its aftermath, in 12 riveting chapters, each earmarked for a month from January, in Partition: The Story of Indian Independence And The Creation of Pakistan in 1947 (Published by Simon and Schuster, Pages 419, Price Rs 699).

How much of Mahatma Gandhi’s famed non-violence was a sham or an ineffective ploy could be understood from reading this brutally honest account of Partition. The killings had begun much earlier than August 15, 1947.

It is important to give the background of the author. White-Spunner has commanded British and allied troops at every level from troop to field army, including the elite 16 Air Assault Brigade, whom he took into Kabul in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. He has also led operations in the Balkans and Iraq, as well as Africa and Asia. The robustness of his prose in Partition—clear, sympathetic but unsentimental—is a testament to his qualities as a fighter. He enters where it matters, the end of the Raj.



White-Spunner picks up his pieces from the time Field Marshal Lord Archibald Wavell, Viceroy of India, gets his marching orders from the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee on January 31, 1947. On February 20, Attlee made a statement to the House of Commons announcing that Britain would leave India by a date not later than June 1948. He also announced that Earl Mountbatten would take over from Wavell as viceroy.

White-Spunner offers us a soldier’s perspective. He says it is important to accept that events of August to November 1947 were a terrible tragedy, not just in bloodshed and human misery but in their consequences. Were they avoidable and who was responsible for them?

He says Britain should have handed over power to Indians in 1919 after the end of the first World War as recognition of India’s extraordinary generous contribution to the British war effort, both in the number of men who volunteered and in money. The call for Pakistan had not become shrill or sharper at that time. But White-Spunner points out that Britain’s refusal to leave while not having the resources nor the real willingness to administer and develop India in the way the country so badly needed, was the main cause of the tragedy in 1947. He also says the year 1935 presented another opportunity when the government of India Act offered the logical moment to grant Dominion status but again it was missed. “By 1947 there was little of the Raj still functioning apart from the army. India was disintegrating.”

Many have said, including Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal, that it was Congress’s hunger for power that led to the Partition. But White-Spunner makes the picture clearer when he writes that Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had their own reasons for rebuffing Muhammad Ali Jinnah. “Had Congress reacted more favourably to Jinnah’s approaches in 1937, then things might have turned out differently but their (Nehru and Patel) experience in the Interim Government had shown them that they were better without the League. For Congress, it was essential to maintain that strong central government without which they feared they could not keep the country together. For Jinnah, whose vision was a federal India with the League sharing power and exercising control over the Muslim majority provinces on the original Palestine model, this was a bitter blow. He never got what he wanted.”

White-Spunner has relied on many sources—books, interviews, newspapers—to write his account of Partition but chief among them is The Transfer of Power papers, a massive twelve-volume compendium of all official correspondence relating to Indian Independence and Partition between 1942-47. Published by the British government between 1970 and 1983, it is a godsend for a historian, gathering as it does all the government documents in one well-edited series. There is no doubt that the strength of White-Spunner’s account is ToP papers.

So instead of blaming Jinnah for the Partition, he says it was Nehru and Patel who decided to get on with it quickly. It may be stunning to know that Nehru, with Mahatma Gandhi’s support, even tried in May to get the British to hand over in June. Congress was impatient for power.

But it was not the rush for power that caused the slaughter but the inability by all the key players to foresee it. Nehru did not believe religion held such sway in India. Jinnah did not understand Punjab. Mountbatten hardly knew India.

White-Spunner says that the only way to prevent the slaughter was to police the Punjab properly. He significantly points out that there is no excuse for not using British and Gurkha troops and deploying alongside them those non-communal units of Indian troops who would not be affected by local affiliations.

Mountbatten was against it. White-Spunner argues that there was ample time to brief and deploy the army, with the accompanying air power in July. He notes that while Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims slaughtered each other in August 1947, over half a million servicemen stood idle.

But there are other views as well. A K Damodaran, the Congress activist and a future Indian diplomat, differed with the view that Mountbatten rushed it. In 1988 he told the BBC that “despite the Calcutta killings, the cosy Delhi elite had an overromantic view of the Punjab. They never expected what happened. We took a very purist Hindu logical view of partition. In retrospect we were being too clever by half.”

So while India had its heroes during its struggle for Independence and during its hour of freedom, it had none during the terrible days of Partition. A tragedy, indeed."
Placebo As Real Remedy,"Your attitude, lifestyle, mental balance and emotional harmony are the best placebos, writes MUKUL SHARMA



Although mentioned in this column earlier, but to reiterate in a revised context, Norman Cousins was a distinguished editor of the Saturday Review for the better part of 40 years, author, professor, political activist and world peace advocate. During the course of his long career he won several accolades including the United Nations Peace Medal, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and Pope John XXIII’s personal medallion. In 1964, however, his life took an unimaginable turn which was to ultimately make him far more famous — and controversial at times too — than he could ever arguably have been otherwise. After returning from a trip to the former USSR, he fell ill and was diagnosed as suffering from a suddenonset case of the crippling connective tissue disease which is also referred to as a collagen disease. Experts at more advanced clinics confirmed this and added a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as well.He was told he had one chance in 500 to survive and given a few months to live, at that. Now Cousins who dabbled in biochemistry and behavioural medicine from time to time read and discovered that both his disease and the medicines were apparently depleting his body of vitamin C, among other things.



He decided to develop his own recovery programme. Accordingly he did three things. One, he got out of hospital against the advice of his doctors and checked himself into a hotel suite nearby; two, he started watching huge amounts of comedy films like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Candid Camera; and, three, he began taking daily megadoses of vitamin C — way above the recommended dosages and in life-threatening proportions. But within six months he was back on his feet, and within two years he was able to return to his full-time job at the Saturday Review. He chronicled his experiences in the best-selling 1979 book Anatomy Of An Illness As Perceived By The Patient. When Cousins had a heart attack 15 years following his earlier illness,he wondered whether it would be possible to recover from two life-threatening conditions in one lifetime, but he was determined that he could. As he was brought into the hospital on a stretcher following the attack, he sat up and said, “Gentlemen, I want you to know that you’re looking at the darnedest healing machine that’s ever been wheeled into this hospital.” Once again Cousins recovered fully and wrote The Healing Heart: Antidotes To Panic And Helplessness.



He finally died in 1990, ten years after his first heart attack, sixteen years after his collagen illness, and twenty-six years after his doctors first diagnosed heart disease. So what’s the new context we’re talking about here now? Well, since Norman Cousins’time it has been unequivocally demonstrated by experiment after experiment that taking hefty outsized doses of vitamin C could have had no effect whatsoever on ankylosing spondylitis.And though laughter can help boost the immune system, it can’t possibly do so to such a ridiculous extent. The incredible effects had to be the result of the placebo effect where if the patient sincerely believes in the efficacy of a surreptitiously administered fake medicine — it still works. When Cousins was later confronted by this scientific evidence, he simply said that given another similar health problem, he would do exactly the same even if he knew it was a nonfunctional medication. Turns out he wasn’t wrong. Recent research at the Harvard Medical School has shown that even when people know they’re getting a fake medication — like being told upfront that it’s a placebo — they get better nonetheless and actually prefer it over what physicians would normally prescribe. It seems one’s attitude, lifestyle, outlook,mental balance and emotional harmony make the best placebo of them all.Yoga teachers and Zen masters have been saying the same thing all along.¦"
"petrol pump dealers in Uttar Pradesh: 91 Uttar Pradesh petrol pumps’ licences cancelled, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: State oil companies have cancelled the licences of 91 petrol pump dealers in Uttar Pradesh that had tampered with their dispensers to cheat fuel buyers.Disciplinary action has also been taken against 10-15 company executives, though no one has been dismissed. A statewide inspection of all 6,000 pumps across UP by state officials and oil company executives began after malpractices were detected at seven pumps four months ago.It revealed ‘critical irregularity’ at 91 pumps, where dealers had tinkered with equipment to dispense lower quantities of fuel to buyers, said an oil ministry official, adding that licences of all these pumps were cancelled after dealers failed to explain their conduct satisfactorily.Indian Oil (IOC) owns 47 of the terminated dealerships, Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) has 27 and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), 17. IOC alone operates about 3,400 pumps in the state while the balance filling stations are almost equally divided between BPCL and HPCL.Across the country, the number of pumps run by state oil companies stands at about 54,000."

"Alzheimer's disease: Novel eye test may detect signs of Alzheimer's disease, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representational image

New York: US scientists have developed a new eye test that noninvasively scans the retina and detects beta-amyloid protein -- a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease Amyloid beta are amino acids and main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer patients.The experimental technology scans the retina using techniques that can identify beta-amyloid protein deposits that mirror those in the brain.The findings revealed a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls.""As a developmental outgrowth of the central nervous system that shares many of the brain's characteristics, the retina may offer a unique opportunity to easily and conveniently detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease,"" said Keith L. Black, Director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Hospital in Los Angeles.Accumulations of neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein can be detected with positron emission tomography, or PET scans , and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, but these are invasive, inconvenient and costly, making them impractical for routine screening and follow-up evaluation.However, the new technique uses an autofluorescence imaging system that includes a specialised ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software.The tests non-invasively detects presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.In addition, the tests showed retinal plaque clusters, or ""hot spots"", containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.""Findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor Alzheimer's disease (early in the process),"" noted Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Associate Professor at the hospital."
"The king is dead, long live the king","Infosys is going through an internal convulsion, beating down its stock and contributing to the fall of the overall market index. When a palace coup happens, who falls and who rises is a matter of vital interest to a small number of people who form the dramatis personae. For the country as a whole, what matters, once shedding a ceremonial tear for the fallen and hailing the victor are done, is that whoever is the new ruler should keep the country stable and improve the quality of governance. The same principle applies to Infosys.

It is natural for Infosys insiders to work up a passion over the rights and wrongs of Narayana Murthy’s constant sniping at Vishal Sikka and Sikka’s failure to counter that guerrilla action, leading to his eventual ouster. For investors in the company and for the rest of the information technology sector, what matters is that the transformation in the business model initiated by Sikka, leading to steady rise in revenue per employee, should continue. The information technology sector is ripe for disruption. It must adapt to the new environment in which automation and artificial intelligence would take over a lot of the customary work done by legions of coders.

Instead of falling victim, India’s information technology needs to drive the change. Vishal Sikka and the current Infosys board that supported him recognised the challenge and set in motion a process of change. This is all to the good. But the process of change has been accompanied by a cultural clash, between austere conservatism and expensive flamboyance, which has led to much heartburn among the old guard.

Their backlash has been strong enough to oust the torchbearer of change. Whoever comes in next would have to be culturally more compatible but no less insistent on the need for change than Sikka has been.

Narayana Murthy’s return from corporate self-exile to activism raises serious questions. Should a founder retire at all, unless other shareholders find him a hindrance to growth? Having handed over the wheel to someone else, why do backseat driving? But the real challenge is to keep Infosys growing and evolving."

Jinder Mahal Is Still King Of The Ring As He Successfully Defends His WWE Title At SummerSlam,"Jinder Mahal defended his WWE Championship for the third time defeating Shinsuke Nakamura at WWE pay-per-view SummerSlam 2017 at the Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York on Sunday. Mahal thus extended his title reign to 91 days.

Nakamura was the odds on favourite to win, and Mahal's win is somewhat of an upset considering the match was a quite a short on for a title match. It sure seemed a rushed ending as Nakamura, who was on the offensive early on, had to deal with the Singh Brother - Sunil and Samir - on the outside and that allowed Mahal to take advantage and hit his finisher, The Khallas, on Nakamura to retain the title.

Indians and Afghans went ballistic with joy and Pakistan fretted and fumed after President Trump spelt out his “path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia”. Trump minced no words about Pakistan-sponsored terrorism saying: “Today, 20 US designated foreign terrorist organisations are active in Pakistan and Afghanistan— the highest concentration in the world. For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence and terror”. He added: “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations (like) the Taliban”. He signalled a number of changes in US—Afghanistan policies, warning that it was time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to ”civilization, order and to peace”.

It is clear that the heat is going to be turned on Pakistan by the Americans. The US Congress is proposing to enact a legislation to progressively reduce/cut off economic and military aid and supplies to Pakistan. America’s allies, notably UK, Germany, and Japan will supplement the American effort.

The US will also be enhancing its military presence in Afghanistan. The proposed US Congressional Legislation requires the administration to deny economic and military assistance to Pakistan, if it does not mend its ways.

Trump has indicated that while it “may be possible” to have a political settlement with ”elements in the Taliban”, this can take place only after it ends violence.Secretary of State Tillerson has stated: “This entire effort is intended to put pressure to have the Taliban understand that you will not win a battlefield victory and we may not win one, but neither will you”.

He added: “At some point in time, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end”. Tillerson also made it clear that the US could revoke the status of “Major Non-NATO ally” that Pakistan enjoys, clearing the way for stringent restrictions on arms supplies and economic assistance. It is now evident that the US intends to link arms and economic assistance to Pakistan ending support for terrorism in Afghanistan, through the Taliban and Haqqani network. It is also possible that US drone strike on the Pakistan -based, ISI supported Taliban and its leadership will be stepped up.

How will Pakistan react to these new US policies? Rawalpindi will protest loudly at US policies. The message will be quietly sent to the US that if it turns the squeeze too much, Pakistan will be forced to deny use of its soil to American military supplies and aid to Afghanistan. The aim will be to force the US to cool off on sanctions, by holding out promises of Taliban good behaviour, in the event of the US agreeing to continue economic and military assistance. This is something, which India and Afghanistan should ensure does not happen. There will substantial pressure on the US to agree to an early resumption of “unconditional dialogue” with the Taliban. This should, however, remain conditional on a verifiable end to Pakistan support for cross-border terrorism. China has already made noises of support for Pakistan.

Beijing has made it clear that it will back Pakistan on its position regarding a role for the Taliban, which equates the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Trump has made it clear that India remains a “strategic partner” not just in South Asia, but across the entire “Indo-Pacific” region. The old hyphenation between India and Pakistan has been eroded, but India has to be careful on this score. We also need to bear in mind that Russia, Iran and China have close contacts with the Taliban. Economic cooperation and military training for Afghanistan has to be quickly stepped up.

BCB mull postponing West Indies tour,"CHANGE IN PLAN

BCB mull postponing West Indies tour

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Cricket Operations Chairman Akram Khan, said on Wednesday (August 23), that they are mulling to postpone their tour of West Indies to July instead of February 2018, which was a part of their original itinerary, keeping in tune with the possibility of the hosts taking part in the World Cup qualifiers.

Khan also mentioned that they started to look for a feasible slot for the tour only after they learnt of the International Cricket Council (ICC) calendar which stated the qualifiers were slated for the month of March.

West Indies, currently ranked ninth in the ICC standings, look all set to feature in the competition. ""There is a huge possibility of this change in schedule for our next tour of West Indies,"" Khan told Cricbuzz on Wednesday.

""We had to look for other available options after we understood that West Indies will need to play the ICC World Cup qualifiers,"" Khan said. ""Both of us agreed to make this change if that is required under the present circumstances.""

Cricbuzz understands that West Indies will host Sri Lanka in June after the qualifiers, before hosting Bangladesh in July. Khan added that if the change happens, it would probably come as a blessing in disguise for them as they would then get some time to recover before leaving for the Caribbean in July.

""If our West Indies tour gets rescheduled, then it comes as a big relief for us,"" mentioned Khan. ""We were supposed to arrange [for] the boarding at the earliest to reach Sri Lanka after the tour in West Indies,"" he further added.

According to the original itinerary, Bangladesh would have had to fly directly to Sri Lanka to play the Nidahas Trophy, scheduled from March 15 to 31, just after finishing their assignment in the West Indies. As per the proposed schedule now, which is expected to be announced officially in a short while, Bangladesh are free from any international commitments from April-July in 2018, before heading off to Australia in August.

Bangladesh have a tight schedule for the remaining part of 2017 during which they will fly to South Africa to play two Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is within a month's span, after the two home Tests against Australia that concludes on September 8.

The Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) will start on November 2, after the players return from their South Africa tour on October 29. The final of BPL is scheduled in the second week of December, before Bangladesh ready themselves to host Sri Lanka for a full tour in December-January.

Are we judging a Subway sandwich boy by his ability to cook a biryani?,"Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. © Getty

Nineteen Windies wickets fell in a day of Test cricket in England recently. Sadder than the fact that it actually happened, was the fact that it didn't surprise a lot of people too much. We didn't rub our eyes in disbelief and even the narrative on whether a once great singer was singing terribly off-key is now an old one. As the emotional voice of West Indies cricket, Fazeer Mohammad, keeps telling us, this fall started a long time ago.

I have recently spent a lot of time in Sri Lanka, a place whose cricketers I have admired greatly for their skill and their modesty. Over three Test matches they were competitive for about three quarters of a day and some might say, that shouldn't have surprised me either. Maybe it just saddened me and expressing surprise was a means of lessening the impact.

Since the events have occurred simultaneously, they are a cue for a discussion on the state of test cricket. In England, where more is written about cricket than anywhere else (in India, we speak more about it, often in loud voices when the team loses; for eg. in a World Cup semifinal), there is even greater concern for Test cricket. It is understandable and yet futile. Understandable, because Test cricket still has strong roots in England; and futile, because they might be clamouring for a past that is never to return.

The grim pronouncements surrounding Windies and Sri Lanka leave me wondering if we are using the wrong metrics to judge teams now. It wasn't that long ago that Sri Lanka had mounted an outstanding run chase against India at the Champions Trophy. And the Windies are the only team to have won the World T20 twice. In Andre Russell, Dwayne Bravo and Sunil Narine, they have among the three most wanted players in T20 cricket and it wasn't that long ago that Chris Gayle was the reigning superstar of the format. Towards the end of India's short tour of the Caribbean in June and July, I saw the West Indies take apart a pretty strong Indian team in a T20 international.

The time has come then, some might say with justification that it came long ago, to ask ourselves whether the metrics we use to judge players and teams are still valid. Sanjay Manjrekar bemoans, and rightly so, the first class averages of those playing Test cricket now but maybe in the format they are more suited to play, Test and first-class records aren't the right indicators anymore. Players like Sunil Narine, and Lendl Simmons is actually a better example, have first-class records that you wouldn't glance at a second time but at what they are currently doing, they are invaluable. Dickwella and Gunathillake wouldn't have you up in worry the night before a game but they can trouble you over an hour's play.

Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way (and, dare I say, shot furtive glances occasionally), but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. Maybe cricket is running the 100 metre dash and we are judging the athletes for their endurance over 5000 metres. We don't ask Usain Bolt if he can run like Mo Farah but we want the Windies, the world champions over T20 cricket, to hang in there and fight grittily till the last man at a game that is ten times longer.

Many years ago, I had suggested that we accept that a slow cooked Hyderabadi biryani will have to live alongside a Subway sandwich. Indeed, we have accepted that but I fear we send the kid at the Subway counter to cook biryanis and bemoan his lack of skill. He might well turn around and say, as many in the Caribbean already are, that the queues outside his shop are longer.

Unsafe as houses: Watch out – your dream home could become a nightmare 😜,"Most Indians dream of owning a home. And, if recent developments are anything to go by, the chances are that their dream home will remain just that: a dream.

Real estate developers – including some really big boys in the business – are collapsing like a house of cards.

Some have declared insolvency as they are unable to repay banks and others whom they’ve borrowed money from. Others have left their projects only partly finished and unfit for occupation.

Indeed, if all the delays in construction across the country were to be totted up they’d probably add up to a time when folks didn’t live in houses, but in caves.

And perhaps the time will come – if it hasn’t already – when people may have to do just that: Wanted for immediate occupation 2 BHK goofa, bijli-pani optional. Brokers welcome.

Many of those who’ve been left literally home-less have invested their life savings in a place to call their own which now seems more remote and out of reach than the surface of another planet.

In fact that unearthly analogy might be only too apt. Because one of the reasons why the real estate sector is in such a mess, that it should more appropriately be redesignated the unreal estate sector, is that many developers got so greedy that they used up all the money they’d collected for Project A to buy up land on which to start Project B, leaving Project A half-finished, if that.

This Operation Landgrab was of such a scale that the recently introduced Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) might well uncover pie-in-the-sky housing projects based on the Moon, or Mars, the Earth having run out of space.

In the meantime, many who’ve put their hard-earned money into owning a home are being made to learn the origin of the phrase to be ‘flat broke’: buy a flat, and become totally broke."

Cheteshwar Pujara's Nottinghamshire return confirmed

Pujara will be available for fixtures against Northamptonshire, Worcestershire and Sussex © Getty

English county side Nottinghamshire has confirmed on Wednesday (August 23) that Cheteshwar Pujara will feature in the last four league-stage fixtures as the team seeks to gain promotion from Division Two.

The right-handed batsman was part of Nottinghamshire's ascendancy to the top of Division Two earlier this year, scoring his runs at 44.6 in the four matches he played. Nottinghamshire were relegated from Division One after finishing rock bottom in the 2016 season.

The side's head coach, Peter Moores, welcomed Pujara's return, recognizing the boost his team will receive. ""He is a fantastic player, and since he has been away he has had a great time of it in the Test matches for India,"" Moores said.

""So we are getting a guy who is coming back in form and for the team spirit, Pudji (Pujara) coming back in is a huge boost for everybody.

Pujara has been in top form recently, scoring two centuries in India's 3-0 series win over Sri Lanka in the three-Test series.

""Runs on the board at Trent Bridge is always a big influence and having a player of Test-match quality in Pudji is a real bonus. The great thing is that he has already been in the squad this season and he fitted in so well both on and off the field.""

In all likelihood, this sets up a showdown between two Indian players when Nottinghamshire host Worcestershire on September 5. Off-spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, had only recently announced his signing with Worcestershire.

Nottinghamshire are currently top of the table in Division Two, and have four games left.

The Congress’s idea of India exposed,"Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.

In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen’s Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.

Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?

India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.

For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.

It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.

Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan’s ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.

For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.

Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?"
"Technological advancements are transforming the entire healthcare industry : Dr GSK Velu, Health News, ET HealthWorld","ByChairman & Managing Director, Trivitron Healthcare Group of CompaniesAn unparalleled pace of technological revolution has transformed almost every aspect of our lives. We live in a technological era where we continuously switch between multiple devices for most parts of the day. Innovations in the digital space have now made it possible for consumers to use portable devices to access their medical history, keep an eye on their important signs, take tests at home and help in carrying out a wide range of tasks.Those days have gone by when one needs to wait for days and weeks to get effective primary healthcare. In present scenario, an individual is being advised his/her next appointment slot in two days, which seldom delivers a positive reaction.For the first time human beings are ‘digitized’. Any individual can now remotely and continuously monitor every heart beat, moment-to-moment blood pressure readings, the rate and depth of breathing, temperature of the body and many more. Now, we also have the technology to digitize a human being in highest definition, in granular detail, and in ways that most people thought would not be possible.In the present era, wearables are turning our daily health routines into a game, which is simultaneously making it easier for us to track and share our health data which is the next 'big thing'. These wearing devices allow a consumer to access their medical information, monitor their conditions and carry out a more active lifestyle.As more consumers are making use of wearable devices and apps to manage their health, it is slowly changing the dynamics of the patient-doctor relationship. Consumers having access to their own medical data makes them more knowledgeable and ultimately boosts their confidence when visiting with their doctor. These newly launched wearables and health apps have opened the door not only for doctors, but for Pharma brands and other marketers as well. Health brands now should be thinking about how to use these live patient data, or how to build patient profiles that can help align patients with right therapies.In spite of the progress in the healthcare industry , India still continues to struggle with critical issues and gaps in its healthcare system. The current hospital and welfare services are insufficient for the strain they encounter with as the growth of population ageing increases. In India, healthcare is underserved as well as under-consumed. Hard infrastructure and talent are both in short supply, and there are significant regional variations in healthcare delivery. Investments in primary care and public health have also been long been inadequate. Disruptive technologies have already transformed the delivery of public health services in the last few years, and in the new few decades, it is only going to evolve like extending care through remote health services to carry out basic protocols and much more. The primary focus of medicines have completely shifted from treating our diseases to keeping us healthy and enhancing the quality of our life. We can already imagine the round-the-clock sensors measuring how our hearts are doing while we are jogging.While technology driven disruptions is already making inroads into the health sector, our approach is limited to current socio-economic factors. How businesses and healthcare professionals prepare themselves in the coming decades also depends on cost challenges, presence of universal healthcare, social support and living arrangements of the elderly, income security and more. India will benefit to a great extent from gathering high-quality data on population ageing and using it to inform policies that will work towards creating and expanding income support and health insurance programs for older Indians.Today, Indian hospitals are stepping into the adoption of technology; government is facilitating many healthcare programs with the support of technology as their backbone. The government is now trying to build a standard for Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and medical devices which will soon help the hospitals to adopt medical technology faster, to align with the 21st century customers who believe in the fast delivery of services.Also with time, genomic based medicine is becoming more crucial and healthcare professionals keep a pace of this complex and rapidly developing field. Genomics and its related laboratory technologies have shaped a wealth of opportunities in fields such as medicine, industry and much more. It is vital to provide information for disease diagnosis and management through appropriate laboratory investigations. Effective patient care can be assured only through quality diagnosis, in each and every step. Clinical laboratories in recent times have gone through major technological advancements. With intense research development happening in the field of pathogenesis of diseases and personalized medicine, advanced diagnostic techniques and tests are being implemented extensively.Genomics continue to bring about far-reaching and impactful changes in the manner of diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases. Consistent research is being made particularly in diseases like cancer, congenital diseases and acute infections.These technologies are now becoming a big assistance to the doctors in diagnostics and determining the problems. They are being used to conduct researches and also find cures to the illness that are noticed in patients. Some equipment such CT scans MRI scan machines and even the tests that are conducted for detecting diabetics and cholesterol testing etc has now being supported by many health care manufacturing companies, encouraging faster and technologically-equipped India.Technological innovations across healthcare industry will go beyond the already used mobile technology, mobile devices, wearable technology telemedicine and information sharing platforms. One can be very optimistic about newer ways of healthcare delivery by way of drones, robots and artificial intelligence performed by humans, to reduce variability, cost and error whilst providing ‘quality’ healthcare system."

This 3200MP Camera In World's Most Hi-Tech Telescope Will Start Hunting For Dark Matter In 2019,"Ever since astronomers discovered in 1998 that our universe is expanding faster as time goes by the idea has captivated researchers across the world. The idea is that this acceleration in the rate it’s expanding because of “dark energy”, the mysterious gravitational force spread throughout our universe.

A concept render of what the LSST facility will eventually look like

Now, scientists from dozens of institutions across 23 countries have come together to work on a new telescope they believe can shed light on dark matter. Called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), it’s a gigantic digital camera to be mounted on Earth, which will capture images from galaxies millions of light years away.

“All the existing telescopes with cameras were built before the discovery of dark energy,” Paul O’Connor, a senior scientist from Brookhaven National Laboratory told Atlas Obscura. “We expect the LSST to map the entire sky and find out where all that dark matter has been hiding.” O’Connor has been working on the project for over ten years and he believes it could completely change how we understand the workings of the universe.

The LSST's 3.5 metre wide mirror cells, part of its camera assembly

The LSST would serve to capture images of galaxies much further away than our current technology allows. The camera’s field of view when pointed at the sky would be just ten square degrees, but it would still be able to spot around a million distant galaxies in that area. It'll also be outfitted with a 3,200 megapixel sensor being developed by O'Connor at Brookhaven, able to capture light from stars 100 million times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye.

About the size of a small SUV car, ""the LSST camera is the largest camera ever constructed for astronomy.""

It is a large-aperture, wide-field optical camera that is capable of viewing light from the near ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths. It's 3 metre long, 1.65 metre high, weighs 2800 kg, and has a pixel count of 3200 megapixel -- several times better, more precise than even the best smartphone cameras out there.

When the LSST begins operations in 2020, in the mountains of Chile, it will be tasked with scanning regions of the sky over and over for the next 10 years. It’s expected to capture each patch of sky a thousand times, over the course of 3,000 nights. “We’re really going to be making a movie of the universe,” O’Connor said.

The camera assembly of the LSST compared with a human

With that data, astronomers hope to better understand dark energy by looking at how it interacts with objects in the universe. Studying how these far-flung galaxies are shooting away from us could bring new discoveries in the field of astrophysics that we’ve never even thought

This Drug Can Save Lakhs Of Mother's Lives During Child Birth & It's Been Lost For 50 Years!,"Way back in the 1960s, a female Japanese doctor developed a potent drug to help mothers who hemorrhage during childbirth. Not only was it affordable to to make and safe, it was also the perfect way to quickly stop bleeding and help clotting.

Dr Utako Okamoto hoped that her drug, tranexamic acid, would be used to save pregnant women’s lives in childbirth, but the formula went relatively unused for decades. That is, until now.

Researchers from the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, led by Haleema Shakur, have now demonstrated that tranexamic acid can decrease the risk of death from blood loss during childbirth by a third. The results are huge as it’s estimated that about 100,000 die of blood loss every year, soon after their baby is born.

The study also showed that the drug has no serious side effects, and doesn’t cause risks in the case of any other medical conditions. The researchers tested more than 20,000 women for the drug in nearly 200 hospitals across 21 countries, including well off ones like the UK, and poorer regions like Pakistan and Nigeria.

Most importantly, the drug is really cheap, and costs only about $3 in the UK (approximately Rs 192), and a quarter of that amount in Pakistan. “If you can save a life for approximately $3, then I believe that's worth doing,” Shakur told NPR.

Floods in Pakistan in 2010, the worst ever, killed about 3,000 people and left millions homeless. While some areas are suffering extreme droughts, in Southeast Asia, the number of record-setting daily rainfall amounts doubled over the past three decades. Up to a quarter of Bangladesh is inundated in a normal year, and century-level flooding could put 60 per cent of the country under water, the report says. Storm surges from tropical cyclones, destructive winds and landslides are other risks from weather extremes.

Science says: Fast-melting Arctic sign of bad global warming One of the coldest places on Earth is so hot it's melting. Glaciers, sea ice and a massive ice sheet in the Arctic are thawing from toasty air above and warm water below. The northern polar region is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet and that's setting off alarm bells.

"NASA Is Working On A Plan To Prevent Supervolcano Eruption, Which Could've Devastated Our Climate","Scientists at NASA are working on plans and strategies to prevent the reputation of a supervolcano, that's believed to be residing underneath Yellowstone National Park.

WNCT

Scientists believe that this eruption could have had devastated effects on our climate, which is why it was necessary to take certain measures. They think that by drilling hole in one of the most dangerous supervolcanoes, they will subdue the effects.

High-pressure water jets would be pumped into cool it down, releasing heat from the magma chamber and preventing it exploding, but everything needs to be done with a lot of safety. NASA plans to drill a hole 10km into Yellowstone and pump in water which would be slowly extracted.

The cost of the project is in the region of £2.69bn.

“If you drill into the top of the magma chamber and try and cool it from there, this would be very risky,” said Brian Wilcox of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology, reports BBC.

“This could make the cap over the magma chamber more brittle and prone to fracture. And you might trigger the release of harmful volatile gases in the magma at the top of the chamber which would otherwise not be released.”

He further claimed that supervolcano threat is bigger than the asteroid or comet threat. An eruption of this size could cause long-term effects on the planet, altering the climate conditions to a point of no return.

If such a condition arises, the world will sweep into a starvation epidemic, with food reserves only lasting just for 74 days.

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

People often think that swearing indicates a weakness in your vocabulary. The logical assumption being that if you swear a lot you probably don’t know how to construct your thoughts using a whole lot more words. But a study published in Science Direct that those who use the maximum number of swear words within a minute scored higher on an IQ test. The test was indicative of the fact that a rich vocabulary of swear words equated strong rhetoric ability and not a compensation for a lack of vocabulary.

India News: Latest & Breaking News from India,
"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India’s freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat – today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected – political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians’ narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department’s 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations – which included Nathuram Godse’s Hindu Rashtra Sena – viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn’t ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province’s chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh’s decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government’s delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police’s fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar’s participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year’s rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh’s anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, “Of late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation’s activities.”

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman’s query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh’s mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh’s growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had “infiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes”. It further stated “the organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.”

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government’s real intention: “the holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.” Subsequently, the Sangh’s training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh’s weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists’ privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation’s history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."
"NPPA may lose absolute power to fix drug prices under new policy, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government proposes to revamp the country’s drug pricing regulator, allowing it to set prices of only essential medicines.The latest draft proposals suggest amendments to the drug pricing policy and inducting advisory body of experts in a move to strengthen the regulatory body, but at the same time may take away its absolute power to fix drug prices in public interest.Last year, Niti Aayog , the health ministry and the Department of Pharmaceuticals ( DoP ) were engaged in discussions to dissolve NPPA in its current form and reallocate it within the department. This proposal did not materialise.NPPA presently functions as an autonomous body that regulates prices of medicines under the National List of Essential Medicines and also monitors the prices of those that are not on the list. DoP’s latest draft pharma policy suggested that NPPA can cap prices of only those drugs included in the NLEM. The NPPA should lay down and enforce price ceilings of “selected medicines” and ensure that “adequate quantities” of the drugs are available.“National List of Essential Medicines will remain the basis of the medicines to be brought under price regulation… the Department of Pharmaceuticals will prepare the list of medicines for price regulation and transmit them to the NPPA for fixing the price ceilings,” according to the latest draft of the pharmaceuticals policy, a copy of which ET has seen.Appeals against NPPA’s decisions will lie with the government, while appeals against the government’s decisions will be decided by the judiciary.“On pricing, it seems to propose broad changes to the functions and processes of NPPA. The draft appears to impose greater oversight on NPPA such as review of all its decisions, which could mean greater say over NPPA’s ability to cap prices in public interest also,” said Malini Aisola, a member of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a civil society group. Some groups said the proposals would dilute the powers of NPPA.The draft may encourage profiteering if implemented as it proposes to weaken the powers of NPPA, Swadeshi Jagran Manch national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan told ET. The Manch is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It said the proposed provisions and amendments shift several important decisions to the Central government.The draft policy, circulated for stakeholder views, suggests amending the drug pricing policy and inducting an advisory body of experts to strengthen the regulatory body. It seeks to improve access to affordable medicines, reduce dependence on other countries including China for raw material, improve manufacturing quality and create an ecosystem to support innovative new drugs.One recommendation is to reorient the Drug (Prices Control) Order, 2013, which NPPA currently follows for its pricing decisions, to shift focus from price control to monitoring of drug prices, their availability and accessibility.The Department of Pharmaceuticals will be able to direct usage of emergency powers under Para 19 of the DPCO to regulate prices of patented medicines that are not under compulsory licensing.NPPA used powers under Para 19 on Wednesday to slash prices of knee implants by up to 69%, citing “extraordinary circumstances” as the devices were not on the list of essential medicines and hadn’t been notified for price control.“Language of DPCO should be made more definitive. There should not be much scope for different interpretations,” according to the draft.Apart from civil society, industry and government representatives, the draft proposes that NPPA’s advisory body for pricing should consist of doctors, pharmacists and other experts. While NPPA won’t have to accept the recommendations of this body, it will be required to assign reasons in writing for modifying or rejecting them.Civil society groups such as AIDAN said they are studying the draft. “While on the one hand the draft has some positive initiatives to improve access to affordable medicines, in some instances it seems to push towards deregulation,” said Aisola.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch wrote to Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar on Wednesday, alleging that the Department of Pharmaceuticals is “working against” the stated objectives of the Prime Minister and the chemicals and fertilizers ministry."

"Electricity Act: States producing wind energy asked to ensure regulatory nod for power purchase agreements, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked wind energy-producing states to ensure regulatory approval of power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed when tariffs and equipment costs were higher, and use special powers under the Electricity Act to issue directions to autonomous regulators in public interest, if necessary.Wind energy tariffs set by regulators varied between Rs 4 and Rs 6 per khH but tumbled toRs 3.46 per kwH after the sole wind energy auction in February. This prompted many states to seek lower tariffs from old projects, while several State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) held back approval of PPAs already signed, raising serious concerns among wind energy developers and lenders.The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has written to seven states for invoking Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003.“It has come to the notice of the MNRE that some SERCs are not according consent for wind power projects which were commissioned before March 31, and for which PPAs have already been signed,” said a letter from Bhanu Pratap Yadav , joint secretary, MNRE, to the principal secretaries (power) of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.“This creates an atmosphere of uncertainty in the wind power sector and going back on contractual documents like PPAs may not be appropriate.” The August 21letter adds that the matter was discussed at a meeting chaired by NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya and he too had “reiterated that the government should not go back on contractual agreements.”“I request you (principal secretaries) to kindly take up the matter with the SERCs for grant of consent,” Yadav added.While SERCs are autonomous, Section 108 empowers states to issue “directions in matters of policy involving public interest” to state regulators, which have to “be guided.”The section also leaves what constitutes public interest to the state government’s discretion. A direction to regulatory bodies can help developers in Andhra Pradesh, for example, where the SERC has been withholding approval of 832.4 MW of wind projects for which the state discom has already signed PPAs.Similarly, Karnataka’s SERC has put 490 MW of wind power plants on hold.The matter was brought to notice at a meeting of all stakeholders in the wind energy business chaired by Anand Kumar, secretary, MNRE, on July 28. A number of developers had complained about the attitude adopted by some state power regulators and discoms.MNRE officials thereafter held a meeting with the regulators to discuss the issue. Minister of power and new and renewable energy Piyush Goyal also strongly stressed that contracts should be honoured.“The government is very clear that the legal framework has to be respected,” he told ET, as reported in the August 18 edition. However, developers expressed reservations about the letter’s tone. “It would have had more effect had it been signed by the secretary himself and if its tone had been sterner,” said one developer."
"Rare Diseases: The National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases is a must: Advocate Ashok Aggarwal, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Social Jurist, New Delhi, talks on the national policy for the treatment of rare diseases . Edited excerpts:You see, in our country the problem is that there is no law about right of public healthcare and health is a state subject and no state has come up with a law. The problem is that today, no one in this country has the right to healthcare. With such a situation if we get a government policy, I think that will be a beginning that can lead to connecting the legislation, but if you don’t have even a policy then you cannot question government. Therefore, policy on rare diseases was must in the present circumstances when the states are not inclined to make any law and the central government is also not inclined to make the right to public healthcare a fundamental right or a legal right.You see this matter was taken up by the Delhi High Court in 2013 when the case of Mohammad Ahmed came and the High Court Judge was sensitive to this that he wanted to make sure that if some disease can be cured then one should not die for want of money. Ultimately, the High Court in 2013 passed an order saying that right to health is a right and directed the government to bear the expenses. At the same time, the High Court gave certain directions, guidelines that how can the funds be raised and how there is a need for a National Policy. In fact, the National Policy is an initiation taken by the Delhi High Court.In the policy, the government has covered all rare diseases. These diseases range from 5000 to 6000 in number but the cure is available only for a few. I hope that the government will give attention to that and whenever more treatments will be made available, I think the government will take care of them. For the time being, the central government has allocated Rs. 100 crore corpus as a beginning and they have assured that whatever money is required for the treatment, they will raise it by various sources. All ministries and all public undertakings are being taken into consideration by the government for helping in raising this fund.You see, I cannot make any comment on this as nothing is perfect. The High Court has shown its concern that the patient or his relatives are not harassed. The method for approaching the government or government approaching the patient should be very simple. I think the gravity of interest which the Honorable Judge of the High Court has shown will certainly remove any deficiency which will come to the notice in due course of time. For the time being, it is a great beginning.Presently also, in terms of the High Court orders, several patients of rare diseases are getting free treatment, either from AIIMS or ESIC. Similarly, any patient who is identified and require treatment, I hope and I am very certain that the Central Government will take care of, either through ESIC or by the hospitals or by any other method which they will determine.The High Court has already approved the policy and I think anytime it will be notified and the High Court has called Secretary of Health Ministry to demonstrate in the court itself on the next date of hearing as to how it will be implemented and what more we can put into the policy to see that the process should be so easy that the patient or his relatives are not harassed at all."

"surrogacy: Structured compensated surrogacy only way to curb exploitation, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: The 31-member Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare recently presented a report which highlighted the moralistic and unrealistic aspect of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016.The committee, headed by Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav debated on major gaps in the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill.The report began by stating the lack of regulation as the main cause of exploitation. Permitting women to provide reproductive labour for free to another person but preventing them from being paid for their reproductive labour is grossly unfair and arbitrary, the report said.Opposing the altruistic surrogacy model, Dr Rishma Pai, President, Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India ( FOGSI ), said, “All of us believed that altruistic surrogacy is not a practical solution as it expects a woman, whether she is a relative or otherwise, to go through the whole process for absolutely nothing. Everybody else involved is earning, so why should the surrogate not be compensated. We are very happy with the term “compensated surrogacy”. The surrogate should get the compensation of the effort and the whole hardship that she has gone through.” Dr Nandita Palshetkar , Medical Director, Bloom IVF Group, said, “I think it is fair enough to compensate the woman for the loss of work hours in those nine months. After all, everyone else involved in the process is getting something.”The parliamentary committee also recommended the inclusion of live-in couples, divorced women and widows in the ambit of persons who can avail surrogacy.“The surrogacy law has to be liberal and forward looking. The present time is very different and in today’s time live-in couples are a reality. The single parents, older women, divorced may want to have a child and to say that it is illegal just because you don’t have a marriage certificate is not fair. It is like taking away the women’s reproductive right. Compared to the number of live-in couples, those requiring surrogacy will be a miniscule number and in keeping with the modern day India we should include them and give them equal rights,” said Dr Pai.Commenting on the committee’s recommendation to reduce the waiting period from five years to one year of non-conception for the couples in order to be eligible for surrogacy, Dr Pai said, “There are a significant number of women who are born without a uterus; so, this lady knows from the first day that she cannot have a baby. Why would she wait for five years? This was reasoned with the government and they have been open enough to accept it. Today women getting married in their 30’s are very common and to wait for 5 years it would mean losing the egg number, its quality and quantity.”The committee has also recommended to the government to ensure medical insurance covers the surrogate not only during her pregnancy and delivery but also for the next six years. “The basic reason for making these recommendations is to ensure no one gets exploited in the process. It has been very clearly charted out. We are very happy to have standard compensation for the surrogates, it will all be very carefully and legally drawn out,” said Dr Pai.""The women are being exploited and that is why the Surrogacy Bill was brought for. The committee has recommended that the money should be paid directly into the bank account of the surrogate as it is going to make the process very transparent,"" added Dr Palshetkar.Social security insurance and maternity benefits are also part of the recommendations. However, the committee is not in favour of extending the option of commissioning surrogacy to foreign nationals. Though there was disagreement among the committee members on the Surrogacy Bill’s denial of eligibility to NRIs, PIOs and OCIs cardholders, who are of Indian origin.""The whole problem started because the foreigners used to come as it was cheaper. Out of the 10 percent that are infertile, only 1 percent of those infertile women require surrogacy. Banning the whole technology is not really a great thing as we are depriving people of our own country. So, if we ban foreigners I think that is fair enough and I agree with the government here,"" said Dr Palshetkar.Dr Pai added, “Let’s first look at the interest of our population in India and abroad and that itself is a large number to look after for providing the service.”The committee and experts agreed with having a more liberal view towards surrogacy keeping the modern day India in mind.“We feel that if fertility organisations and the government work together and listen to their ideas and to their consensus then I think the outcomes will be really balanced and appropriate for all concerned. We hope this will stay and be a part of the law. We are very happy the way it has shaped out,” Dr Rishma Pai concluded."
"Swine flu deaths: Delhi govt puts swine flu toll at 5, hospitals report over 40 deaths, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Is the government underplaying swine flu deaths in Delhi? While official records say only five people have died of the viral illness so far this year, a random check with five top hospitals in the capital reveals more than 40 deaths in the past two months. Some other hospitals refused to divulge information on deaths.Among hospitals that shared data with TOI, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) had recorded the maximum numbers of deaths at 22, of which 13 patients were from Delhi, seven from Uttar Pradesh and two from Haryana.At Safdarjung hospital, 11 swine flu patients were recorded to have died -five from Delhi and the rest from neighbouring states. AIIMS officials said there have been four swine flu deaths in the hospital in August alone.Among private hospitals, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) confirmed four and three deaths due to the disease, respectively.Many private hospitals and some government ones refused to share details of swine flu fatalities, saying the data had been sent to the authorities concerned. ""Last year, we faced a lot of harassment for sharing data on dengue deaths with the media,"" an official of a top private hospital said.Off the record, the official said more than seven people had died of swine flu at their hospital this year. Asked about the discrepancy over swine flu deaths in Delhi, state government officials claimed most of the deaths were of patients from other states. ""Also, the central government hospitals, where the maximum deaths have taken place, may not be sharing data with us. We will look into it,"" said an official.The official said, as per government records, 15 swine flu-related deaths had been reported from various hospitals of which five were confirmed to have been caused by the viral illness. ""The death review committee examined all cases and swine flu was responsible for only five of the deaths. The rest of the patients had other co-morbidities that could have led to death,"" the official said.Proper surveillance and reporting of deaths due to notifiable diseases is crucial to the management of these illnesses. ""If we don't report correctly and keep saying the situation is under control, people may not realize the seriousness of the situation until it is too late,"" said a senior doctor.Last year, the committee set up by the Delhi government to review cases of deaths attributed to dengue and chikungunya had said co-morbid conditions had led to death in many cases. Some death reports sent from hospitals were rejected due to ""lack of records"".Swine flu assumed epidemic proportions in 2009 for the first time and since then there have been sporadic outbreaks of the disease, caused by the H1N1 virus, across the country.But this year, the disease appears to have a strong comeback claiming more than 900 lives across the country in the past eight months, with nearly 20,000 people being infected. Maharashtra and Gujarat are the worst affected with 404 and 190 deaths, respectively .In Delhi, officials say, about 1300 people have tested positive for swine flu and five have died. Clinicians suspect the H1N1 virus, which causes swine flu, may have mutated. The disease initially spread through pigs but now transmits from human to human.Union health ministry officials said government has put Oseltamivir, marketed as Tamiflu, in schedule H1to enable it to be sold by all licensed chemists under prescription. The drug was earlier in schedule X, wherein only certain selected pharmacists were authorized to stock it. Symptoms of swine flu are similar to common viral illnesses. But the intensity is higher. Doctors say those suffering from asthma, diabetes and other pre-existing illness are vulnerable to serious manifestations and preventive flu vaccination is suggested. ""Regular follow-up with doctors is important. Patients often delay visiting the doctor which leads to complications and in some cases, death,"" said Dr Arup Basu, senior chest physician at SGRH."
Supreme Court has done right to quash triple talaq,"The Supreme Court’s majority verdict declaring triple, or instant, talaq unconstitutional is an important, albeit limited, victory for Muslim women in India. It aligns India’s Muslim personal law, in this regard, with the law in most large Islamic nations that have already outlawed triple talaq, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. It opens the door for a serious engagement towards creating a civil legal code based on the principle of equality.

For women of Muslim faith in this country, the judgement marks a first important step. But there is still a long way to go. The judgement focused on a single issue, the triple instant talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, a frequent method of divorce among Sunni Muslims in India. It does not address issues like polygamy or nikah halala, or even the unilateral privileging of men in two other routes of divorce: talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan. Personal laws of other religious communities, Hindus and Christians, have gone through renditions to address some concerns relating to gender equality in matters of inheritance and polygamy. Despite the gains, gender equality does not permeate all aspects of civil law. The triple talaq judgement presents an opportunity to initiate a debate on putting in place a uniform civil code that brings equality — across faiths and gender. The government should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. In doing so, care must be taken to strengthen democracy, rather than weaken it.

If any attempt to modify personal laws is seen not through the prism of gender equality and inter-community parity, but from a perspective of imposing the majority’s will over minorities, that would vitiate democracy. This depends not just on the modifications proposed in personal law but on the overall developments in the polity. Political parties would do well to not stoke sectarian passions in the name of personal laws. Ridding laws and practices of patriarchal privilege is not easy, but essential to move towards a more wholesome democracy."
