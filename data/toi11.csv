Vastu Tips for keeping Shankha at home,"3

Purpose of Shankh

As per sacred Vedic texts, Shankh is of two tupes- 1) For blowing sound, 2) For worshiping purpose. It is said that one who blows into the Shankh on daily basis is protected against any heart disease. Therefore, people often keep this sacred symbol in their house, but they often do not respect it the way it is mentioned in shastras."

CPL, PSL in talks to collaborate for annual series

The Caribbean Premier League is in talks with the Pakistan Super League to create an annual series of matches between the winners of the two leagues. The CPL hopes that the idea will give the league more context and ultimately make it more commercially viable.

It is envisaged that the series, which could could be launched next year, would feature three matches between the champions of the two leagues, to take place just before the 2018 CPL season. The United States is viewed as an attractive location to stage the games, given the large number of cricket fans from both Pakistan and the Caribbean there.

""It would make the most sense, to have a three-game series over four days,"" said Pete Russell, the chief operating officer of the CPL. ""You have to look into all the practicalities - the commercial viability of it. The US would be a great place to play games like that. There's definitely a feeling here that there's a great Pakistani community, and obviously a great Caribbean community as well, so it'd be an interesting place to play it, wouldn't it?""

The potential size of the TV audience for such matches means that the broadcasting rights could be of significant value, and therefore help to make the CPL, which has lost money in each of its four full seasons and expects to do so again this year, self-sustainable.

""Why wouldn't we do it? It seems to be a good opportunity. We are always looking to evolve here and that is definitely something on our wishlist,"" Russell said. ""It's a big thing to sort out but we're a progressive bunch here and would like to move things forward in that regard because it gives an identity - whoever wins this tournament is going on to something else. That was what was so good about the Champions League.""

Although the Champions League was discontinued in 2014, Russell hopes that the CPL can work more closely with other T20 leagues, and can eventually stage tournaments with the champions of several countries.

""There's lots of opportunities to look at the champions of CPL - they could play the champions of PSL, the champions of Bangladesh etc. It's logical. It's also what the fans would want to see because it brings the best of the leagues together. The challenge is when do you do it, and how do you do it? Those are challenges that I'm sure everyone is looking at. From CPL's perspective it's definitely something that we think would be great. The champions of all these leagues would make for a great spectator sport.""

One major problem with the Champions League was the number of players eligible to play for multiple teams. In the case of the proposed series between the CPL and PSL champions, it is understood that the CPL favours players representing the team from their home leagues if there is such a conflict. Who players from other nations would represent if they had a choice could be more problematic.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

Don't Miss 153 SHARES 341 SHARES 352 SHARES 274 SHARES 214 SHARES

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

Chameera, Gamage added to Sri Lanka squad for Pallekele Test

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Thu, 10 Aug, 2017, 07:04 PM

Chameera last played a Test match in South Africa, in December 2016. © Getty

Exciting pacer Dushmantha Chameera makes yet another comeback to the Sri Lankan side after being named in the squad for the third Test against India, scheduled to start on Saturday (August 12) at Pallekele. Fast-medium pacer Lahiru Gamage, who made his ODI debut against India in 2014, has also been called-up.

The squad for the final Test of the series has been pruned to 15 with the omission of Danushka Gunathilaka. Rangana Herath - Sri Lanka's second highest wicket-taking spinner - had earlier been ruled out with a mild back injury.

Chameera, who can bowl consistently in the high 140kph range, has often been plagued by injuries. He was ruled out of the England series in 2016 after sustaining a stress fracture to his lower back. He played the opening Test at Headingley before heading home. After being selected for the South Africa series later that year, he just played the lone Test at Port Elizabeth and was bowling well below his best - dropping 15kph in pace. That resulted in him being benched for the next two Tests as his side was whitewashed 0-3.

Chameera was not a part of the squad when Bangladesh visited the island nation for a two-match series, but was included in the extended squad when Zimbabwe came for a one-off game. There were murmurs of him being selected for the India series, but the selectors decided to overlook the 25-year-old. However, with Nuwan Pradeep being ruled out of the third Test due to a hamstring injury, Chameera's got the nod.

Gamage, on the other hand, is uncapped in Tests and has just the five ODIs to show for. He was previously called up to Test squad for the second match against Pakistan in 2014 after Shaminda Eranga injured his hip.

It will be interesting to see what combination Sri Lanka go in with, considering Herath isn't available. The squad has the mystery chinaman bowler in Lakshan Sandakan along with other spinning options in Dilruwan Perera and Malinda Pushpakumara.

Sri Lanka, who trail 0-2 in the ongoing series, will be hoping to avoid an ignominious whitewash at home for the first time since 2003-04 when a Shane Warne-inspired Australian side won on these shores.

Sri Lanka squad: Dinesh Chandimal (C), Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Gamage, Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara and Lakshan Sandakan.

"Imtiaz Ali Reveals Ranbir Is A 'Disaster' At Flirting, Couldn’t Approach A Delhi Girl He Liked","Ranbir Kapoor is the heartthrob of Bollywood - the man many women secretly dream about. He’s a flirt too; at least that’s what the perception of people is about him.

He has had many girlfriends including Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone, and he is smart when it comes to managing his relationship. Remember how in an episode of Koffee With Karan, he had admitted that he saves his girlfriend’s number as Battery Low? And also that he would also save their numbers with male names?

Twitter

But is he really a flirt? Imtiaz Ali says he is not. The ace director, who has delivered romantic masterpieces—including Rockstar and Tamasha—roping in the actor in the lead role, says he is a disaster when it comes to flirting. He tries but gets nervous and ends up in a disaster-like situation.

pinimg.com

“Ranbir I think is the biggest disaster. I think he is a victim of flirtation rather than the guys who propagate it, the propagator, flirts,” he told Neha Dhupia on her podcast show.

Twitter

Furthermore, he narrated how he liked a Delhi girl while they were shooting in the city but was too shy to approach her.

“Ranbir Kapoor? The same chap? Is he a flirt? Not at all! I mean he tries. He tries but he just gets very nervous about it. There was a time when he kind of liked a girl in Delhi. We were shooting so I said, well, I'm going to introduce her to you because I know her and so, have a chat. So he said ya ya do that. Then I went to talk to her about something else and he was so nervous, he kept clawing at me and trying to pull me back because he thought that I’m going to say something which will spill his beans.What beans? That my friend finds you attractive? He couldn’t bear to have that known about him. So this is not the sign of a flirt at all.”

Imtiaz Ali, are you talking about Bharti Malhotra who Ranbir was rumoured to be dating?

"Good News For Techies As Amazon Reveals Its Plan To Hire 10,000 Indians To Expand Business Here","Amazon is looking to hire over 1,000 people, mostly software professionals, in India. The hires will cater largely to research and development for the company's divisions, including Amazon.com, Amazon.in, the devices business, and the cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

AFP/Representational Image

The hiring was limited only by the availability of talent in the required technologies, and it was looking to hire as many as possible.

Amazon's website lists 1,245 open positions in India on its careers page as of Wednesday evening. It has around 50,000 people on its rolls in the country. India is currently the second largest workforce centre for Amazon after the US. Globally, it has 3.41 lakh employees.

""The numbers are mind boggling. We're looking at a fully functional tech organisation in India and are hiring varied skills across several job families. India is a big focus area for talent,"" Dale Vaz, director of software development at Amazon India, said.

Reuters

It is looking for talent in tech nology spheres like research scientists, data analytics, natural language processing, artificial intelligence machine learning and Android developers. AWS is looking to hire 195 people in India. Among the open positions, 557 are in Bengaluru, 403 in Hyderabad and 149 in Chennai. ""We process a lot of data and are always looking for data-processing and profiling engineers,"" Dale Vaz said.

The Bengaluru centre is the largest for Amazon in India. The Chennai centre focuses on devices like Kindle and Fire. The recruitment number for Bengaluru alone is higher than for any other centre outside of the US, including London, Luxembourg (where the global CTO of consumer business sits), Dublin, Berlin and Tokyo.

BCCL/Representational Image

Terry Hanold, vice-president of international consumer technology in Amazon, said the talent and excitement he saw in India was similar to that in Silicon Valley 20-30 years ago.

While app development is a focus globally, India, a mo bile-first market, focuses more on mobile and app. ""We are always looking for Android app developers who can solve India-specific problems like the fragmentation of the An droid universe with smaller capacity handsets and the poor connectivity and speed in India. We've seen the India team reinventing the Amazon app experience,"" Vaz said.

"Can Asia change the climate? On climate politics there is not one but three Asias, we need many Asian voices","Who is a climate leader? The Paris Agreement ensured that climate leadership became diffuse and distributed. But immediately after President Trump’s Rose Garden speech on 1 June, commentators jumped to pass the leadership mantle on to China. They might have wanted to convey the message to many other countries that all was not lost. They might have wanted to reassure affected communities and thousands of climate activists that there was a Plan B in China. Or they might have simply wanted to win over the air waves in a toxic media battle for climate hearts and minds.

There are three problems with this approach. First, its underlying premise is flawed. It presumes that the United States (until 31 May) was the world’s climate leader. It was indeed central to the problem and is needed for a practical solution. But the US has been, primarily, a “climate squatter”.

Secondly, the argument presumes that China was both ready and willing to become the climate leader. China’s response, while aggressive in ambition and action, is still very much a mixed story until now. The clean (China as the renewable energy capital of the world) goes hand in hand with a lot of dirty (more than 921000 MW of coal power, a third of which is perhaps overcapacity).

Thirdly, this technocratic passing of the baton from one country to another is deeply flawed. It measures climate leadership in presidential statements and academic charts, not from the perspective of communities impacted and people suffering. By doing so, it raises false expectations and undermines trust even further. It is clear that climate politics will be driven by national interests; and climate action will be affected by economic interests.

Asia – with the most number of poor people and being the most economically dynamic region in the world – will encounter climate change like no other. Asia must persevere for a different kind of climate politics, a reformulated climate economics, and an inclusive climate ethics.

On climate politics, there is not one but three Asias. The first is China, which stands apart in terms of its economic size and share of emissions. The second is India, along with several other South and Southeast Asian economies, which are growing rapidly, still have hundreds of millions in poverty, need to industrialise and create jobs, and whose opportunities are getting squeezed by the shrinking carbon space. The third is West and Central Asia, with many economies heavily dependent on fossil fuels, limited diversification in their economic structure, or limited capability to develop the industries of the future.

Asia – and India – could map a new geography for institutional leadership on climate change. The institutions of the 21st century need to be nimble. They need to recognise that emerging economies increasingly demand a seat at the rule-making table; that international regimes are more complex now, with many actors (including the private sector); and that networks of governance will plot the direction of travel rather than top-down diktats.

Climate economics needs to defeat persisting mercantilism. National security, economic prosperity and climate resilience will have to all go hand-in-hand with resource efficiency. But the economic opportunities presented would need a rethink of the mercantilist policies in some Asian economies, particularly China. Asian economies can tap into these opportunities if they became part of global/regional supply chains for new technologies and products, maximised resources available at home, and created trained workforces suited to these rapidly shifting trends.

Climate ethics requires new voices on issues that have largely escaped attention or on which developed countries have dominated the discourse so far. Asian economies need to emphasise that there will be many energy transitions and due space must be yielded for countries to discover and pursue their respective paths. We don’t need an Asian voice; we need many Asian voices to describe many energy transitions. Mere tokenism in representation will not do.

Another area with even fewer Asian voices is the governance of climate geoengineering or the deliberate large-scale intervention in Earth’s climate system, to limit adverse global warming. Asian countries must help design an international research programme on geoengineering, taking account of research capacities, funding mechanisms, liability rules, and intellectual property. This is a frontier that cannot be left ungoverned.

Lastly, Asia must look inwards, to promote greater transparency on climate change within the region and within countries. Asia’s leading economies should open the space for non-party stakeholders, who could bridge the challenges of building national capacity, monitoring both emissions and financial flows, evaluating inter-country initiatives, and contributing to overall assessments of the effectiveness of global collective action.

The world has changed, the climate is changing, and we must change too. As the beneficiaries of the dynamism of Asian economic transformation, and the custodians of its future sustainability, we need to recognise the direct and systemic risks climate change poses for our region. We need to celebrate the disproportionately aggressive targets we have set for climate mitigation, but also acknowledge that our efforts will fall short of what is needed. Most of all we need to resist false pretensions of grandeur about climate leadership. It is a collective burden we carry.

Asia is poised for climate leadership. Except it is not the bravado of leadership that must titillate us; rather it is the quiet self-confidence that comes from knowing – and shaping – the future."

"Over 1,000 Scientists & Students In India Marched To Save Science, Demanding More Govt Support","In April of this year, thousands of scientists in more than 600 cities across the world came together to celebrate science, and now the scientific community in India had their chance to show their support.

Image courtesy: Times of India

Over 1,000 students, scientists, and scholars came out to participate in a ‘March for Science’ in Bengaluru on August 9. Other similar events were also hosted in 35 other cities across the country.

Spearheaded by the Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), a pan-India scientific organisation, the Bengaluru march begin at Town Hall in the city before carrying on from there. The idea is to not only celebrate scientists and their work, but also to spread awareness of the various sciences, and promote their role in policy-making.

Rajini K S, the state secretary of BSS, says several Indian scientists started drafting an appeal to the government along these lines after the global March for Science on April 22. The petition claimed that “scientific research is suffering a serious setback due to dwindling governmental support.”

""Professor Soumitro Banerjee, founder of BSS, was one of the scientists drafting the appeal,” Rajini told the Times of India. “There aren’t enough opportunities for research here despite calls for Make in India. Moreover, even though the amount allocated for science and education has increased over the years, when you factor in inflation, there’s no increase at all.”

"With no sports university in the country, the mesh between sports and education is a far cry","By Boria Majumdar

Barcelona 1992 and the now famous story of Limba Ram. One of India’s finest archers, Ram had not even realised that he had been knocked out of Olympic competition. He had, the story goes, asked his coach to set up a rematch and was confident he would beat his opponent. Coming up the ranks from where he had, Ram had hardly ever come face to face with the term ‘expectations’. He had no idea of the big stage and missed out as a result.

Twenty five years down the line and the story has not fully changed. Only a handful of Indian athletes making it to the Olympics are a product of the University system with college degrees and formal academic training. With no sports university in the country, the mesh between sports and education is still a far cry. Men and women good in sport can have a career independent of academia is the accepted notion and that the two can co-exist is still considered alien by most.

The American, Canadian and British systems, however, are profoundly different. Olympic athletes come out of the University system in these countries and D1 scholarships continue to grow in demand in the United States. Loughborough University is the most well equipped training ground for British athletes and sports science at Loughborough is well acknowledged the world over.

In India, however, the HRD and Sports ministries hardly talk. Despite having a sports scientist as the Secretary of the UGC, we don’t see much happening in the academic realm to ignite hope. We send just one Indian representative in Annesha Ghosh to the FISU Games as a journalist and are happy that the ministries have their own independent fiefdoms.

As a result of this apathy, which isn’t a new thing in India, sports scholarships in schools and colleges continue to be misused and abused. While in some cities they are now confined to being party quotas, in others these are mostly filled by recommendations.

The sports-academia disconnect was integral to my growing up years as a student in Presidency College (now University), Calcutta. The elected Games secretary, who incidentally was a good friend, was once asked how many bails there are in cricket. In full confidence he had answered three wickets and hence three bails. And went on to say with a bluster what a silly question he had been asked!

Tickets to international matches at Eden Gardens were used to win votes at the college election, a practice no different to what happens in the BCCI with state association heads offered junkets as managers to keep the flock together.

Colonial India, however, presented a very different story. University cricket was particularly well developed and the first athletes from India to the Paris Olympics in 1924 (not to mention Norman Pritchard in 1900) were members of St Xavier’s College, Calcutta. Jaipal Singh, the first captain of the Indian hockey team at the 1928 Amsterdam Games had a degree from St John’s College, Oxford and some of his papers continue to be there at the College library.

If we wish to transform ourselves into a sporting nation in the next decade and want to win Olympic medals by the dozen, we need to marry sports with education.

We keep talking of systems and structures and the only way a system can be put in place is if the British and American realities are appreciated and implemented in India. Vijay Goel needs to talk to Prakash Javdekar at the cost of sounding flippant and only then can a sporting revolution be underway. We keep hearing of the need for sports science. All we need to do is ask where are we to look out for our future sports scientists? If it is somewhere beyond the University sector….I really need to rest my case."

Swami Vivekanda's 15 Golden Rules for Life,"Those who’ve got the chance to read Swami Vivekananda’s ideologies on Life, Death and Hinduism, can only imagine the goose bumping experience of those, who’ve had the honor to see & hear him live during his lectures.

Sometime back, I got my hands on one of Swami Vivekananda’s lectures that he gave in Oakland, back in March 1900 (in his final years), and couldn’t stop myself from sharing the brilliant insight on how a man must live his life by these 15 Golden Rules…

#1. Love Is The Law Of Life:

All love is expansion, all selfishness is contraction. Love is therefore the only law of life. He who loves, lives; he who is selfish, is dying. Therefore, love for love's sake, because it is law of life, just as you breathe to live.

#2. It's Your Outlook That Matters:

It is our own mental attitude that makes the world what it is for us. Our thoughts make things beautiful; our thoughts make things ugly. The whole world is in our own minds. Learn to see things in the proper light.

#3. Life is Beautiful:

First, believe in this world--that there is meaning behind everything. Everything in the world is good, is holy and beautiful.



If you see something evil, interpret it to mean that you do not yet understand it in the right light. Throw the burden on yourselves!

#4. It's The Way You Feel:

Feel like Christ and you will be a Christ; feel like Buddha and you will be a Buddha. It is feeling that is the life, the strength, the vitality--without which no amount of intellectual activity can reach God.

#5. Set Yourself Free:

The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in him--that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds vanishes, and I am free.

#6. Don't Play The Blame Game: Condemn none:

If you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless your brothers and let them go their own way.

#7. Help Others:

If money helps a man to do good to others, it is of some value; but if not, it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the better.

#8. Uphold Your Ideals:

Our duty is to encourage every one in his struggle to live up to his own highest ideal, and strive at the same time to make the ideal as near as possible to the Truth.

#9. Listen To Your Soul:

You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul.

#10. Be Yourself:

The greatest religion is to be true to your own nature. Have faith in yourselves!

#11. Nothing Is Impossible:

Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only sin--to say that you are weak, or others are weak.

#12. You Have The Power:

All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.

#13. Learn Every Day:

The goal of mankind is knowledge. . . now this knowledge is inherent in man. No knowledge comes from outside: it is all inside. What we say a man 'knows,' should, in strict psychological language, be what he 'discovers' or 'unveils;' what man 'learns' is really what he discovers by taking the cover off his own soul, which is a mine of infinite knowledge.

#14. Be Truthful:

Everything can be sacrificed for truth, but truth cannot be sacrificed for anything.

#15. Think Different:

All differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because oneness is the secret of everything.

A molehill out of a mountain,"For some strange reason people in India seem to think that India is somehow on the backfoot in its latest showdown with China over the Dokalam trijunction. Some feel that should the situation continue or deteriorate, ‘strategic defiance’ may be the only option. This, however, is not the impression in Beijing. In private, the Chinese feel that they, rather than India, are caught in a bind, unable to resort to the use of force for fear of destroying the myth of nuclear deterrence, but still supremely confident that strategic defiance by India, on the other hand, will be economically and diplomatically disastrous for India.

As a dear friend in Beijing summed it up rather rudely, “India is a dog. Whatever we do to you, you will first bark and snarl, but then accept and come back wagging your tail. The problem now is what we can do to you is also very limited.” This raises the question as to why India feels it is losing control of the situation. And second, if this idea that India will somehow finally turn on China is based on reality or plain wishful thinking.

Let us be clear about one thing — far from losing control, this has, in fact, been one of the best managed crises by India’s ministry of external affairs. India’s tone has been persistently calm, not threatening action, but sticking to its guns. And for the first time in decades, it is standing up to Chinese bullying and staring it down. The ‘losing control’ and ‘escalating crisis’ narratives seem to be emerging only from a set of strategic commentators whose window seems to be limited to Xinhua and Global Times, and completely devoid of primary research.

No Escalation

Having toured the area over the last seven days, there seems to be no escalation in troop numbers whatsoever. Landing in Lhasa, one could count about 12-14 Sukhoi family aircraft. And driving past the Shigatse airbase, given the difficulties of observing the tarmac, one could count between three and seven J-10 fighters. The entire Lhasa to Shigatse stretch also showed no signs of increased infantry activity, no spurt in military logistics and only some parade/TV optimised artillery lined up in Lhasa’s marshalling yards along the Lhasa-Beijing railway.

Clearly then, the only real ‘escalation’ that can happen is unarmed Chinese border troops coming into and squatting in Indian territory, as suggested by the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs earlier this week — a major ‘climb-down’, if one can call it that — from previous threats, which were ominous simply because of the lack of specificity.

We also have a pattern of similar action across the South China Sea to judge China by. It has resorted to similar ‘sea grabs’ there, depending purely on the fear of the other parties to the dispute to avoid escalating the situation to fatalities. That fear simply doesn’t work with India, for the simple reason that both sides are nuclear-armed. This is particularly important as the situation thus far indicates that while India’s doctrine of deterrence may have failed on the western front (in all fairness, it was never directed against Pakistan), it has had a clear success in the east (where it was directed all along) by putting hard limits on how far China can escalate.

Stuck in Limbo

The diplomatic and strategic costs of escalation for China now are severe, even if Indian warheads can’t reach the Chinese eastern seaboard, taking China down several pegs equating it with rogue revisionist states like Pakistan and destroying the image of it being a more or less ‘responsible’ player on the world stage. All indicators then are that short of an extremely serious miscalculation by the Chinese leadership, the situation has plateaued. The only spikes will be verbal, and that too from the Chinese side.

Which also complicates things for the Chinese leadership when it chooses to de-escalate. It, however, seems to have realised its mistake after its first attempt to do so — claiming that India had reduced the number of troops. The furious denial by India caught it off guard with colleagues in Beijing admitting that they had miscalculated, and not factored in how this would be perceived in India domestically.

All up, we seem stuck in limbo. Escalation is not an option for China. But de-escalation also seems impossible, till public attention is shifted elsewhere. On the other hand, it is high time the Indian media also realise what the MEA and PMO seemed to have long back — that Indian strategic defiance is a non-starter.

China’s massive infusion of finished goods, such as mobile phones, are the core drivers of the Indian economy and impossible to substitute. Equally, if we choose to go against China, we might as well kiss goodbye to any chance of UN Security Council and Nuclear Suppliers’ Group (NSG) membership. In this situation, Dokalam is a win, an emphatic win, the best possible under the circumstances, marking the first serious Indian (and arguably global) pushback to Chinese salami tactics."

Chandigarh stalking case: The horrors women face today,"By Rajyasree Sen

We’ve known for a while now that this is no country for women. Especially in North India. First, you’re lucky if your parents actually allow you to live once they discover that you are a girl. And if you survive female infanticide, there are other horrors to follow.

Last week, women’s plaits were being mysteriously lopped off by ‘ghosts’ and ‘shape-shifting cats’ in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan. Plait-cutters aside, on Saturday morning, a video surfaced of a crowd in the driveway of what turned out to be a gated condominium in Gurugram, Essel Towers. A man was shouting in English, “You are supporting prostitution in the society!” Because why else would a single woman want a male visitor to come to her home? Aap hi bataiyen! On Friday night, around the same time that unmarried women tenants were being accused of being prostitutes, Varnika Kundu was driving home at midnight in Chandigarh. Her car was chased for over 7km by Vikas Barala and his friend, Ashish Kumar. Both were drunk. They tried to block the car’s path with their SUV. Kundu managed to drive away and filed an FIR. But then it gets interesting. Barala is the son of Subhash Barala, the Haryana BJP president. Both Vikas and Ashish are law students, which is, if you’re the sort you gets ironies, is quite ironic.

What followed in the Kundu case explains why the lot of urban women is not going to change in this country in a hurry. The police dropped the charge of abduction. The charges were reduced to ‘stalking’ and ‘wrongful restraint’ — two crimes that are bailable. Yes, Barala and his friend were released on bail and an ‘investigation’ is now on. I would request you to not hold your breath.

It’s bad enough that the law seems to think that stalkers and men who chase women in cars to accost them on empty streets should be let off with a rap on their knuckles. What’s worse is the Barala family — and some members of the BJP — defending Barala’s behaviour. Because what else could Kundu be but a woman of ‘loose morals’ — an unmarried woman who was out on her own at night. That was so obvious.

On Monday, Chandigarh BJP vice president Ramveer Bhatti stated, “Such cases tend to occur… and the probability is higher for girls being stalked if they are out at odd hours.” And parents must ensure “girls should not be seen roaming on roads after a certain hour in the evening”. Yes, locking up men out to harass and worse is such an impractical thing to do. ‘At odd hours’.

Subhash Barala’s nephew, Kuldeep Barala, posted an image on social media of Kundu standing between two male friends from 2012. Why? Because any woman with male friends is a woman who deserves unwanted sexual attention from men. Kuldeep’s lack of understanding of women’s safety or free will is not perplexing. After all, he himself has abduction charges against him in an ongoing case. Baralas of a feather flock together.

Subhash Barala, after maintaining a studied silence, said on Tuesday that Kundu is “like my daughter”. God help us from people ‘like our fathers’ then. The next evening, BJP spokesperson Shaina NC, who happens to be a woman, posted the same picture of Kundu with her two friends on Twitter and Facebook. After a backlash on Twitter, Shaina claimed her Twitter account had been hacked.

The hacker, it seems, had kindly deleted the ‘mischievous’ tweet before handing the account back to her. Shaina seemed to have forgotten that the same picture had been posted on her Facebook account as well. Perhaps, the hacker is the same person chopping off people’s braids.

Sad Day For Indian Sport As National-Level Wrestler Vishal Kumar Verma Dies Of Electrocution At A Flooded Stadium,"Vishal Kumar Verma, a national-level wrestler, died in a freak incident at the Jaipal Singh Stadium in Ranchi on Tuesday. The 25-year-old was electrocuted due to a short circuit at the inundated and dilapidated stadium building which houses the office of the Jharkhand State Wrestling Association (JSWA). The indoor stadium, built in 1978, has been flooded with rainwater since the beginning of monsoon and its condition has worsened due to heavy rains in the past couple of weeks.

BCCL/Representational Image

Bholanath Singh, general secretary and coach of the Jharkhand State Wrestling Association, said: ""Vishal had stood fourth in the last senior national wrestling championship.""

""Preliminary investigation has revealed that death was due to electrocution. Vishal was using a water pump to clear out the water when the incident took place. Faulty wiring seems to be main cause for this incident,"" officer in-charge of Kotwali police station, Shyamanand Mandal, said.

BCCL/Representational Image

Ganesh Jha, general manager of Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam (JBVNL), told TOI: ""An executive engineer visited the site and reported that there is no fault in the power connection provided by JBVNL. However, there could be a loose connection in the building's internal electrical wiring.""

Why Sleeping With Someone Else In Your Bed Is Healthier Than Napping Solo,"While sleeping with someone else can be a learning experience or challenging at times, especially you haven’t had much experience in the past of doing so; it could be the remedy for someone who struggles with dosing off!

teemix.aufeminin.com

A collective research combined by The Wall Street Journal stated that sleeping with another in the same provided a sense of safety and security.

Sleeping intimately with a partner is probably the reason why that people in committed relationships had a happier and healthier lifespan. That’s probably because the sharing of the feelings of safety and security can help lower the levels of cortisol, a stress hormone.

diaforetiko.gr

Sharing a bed may also reduce cytokines, involved in inflammation, and boost oxytocin, the so-called love hormone that is known to ease anxiety and is produced in the same part of the brain responsible for the sleep-wake cycle. So even though sharing a bed may make people move more, ""the psychological benefits we get having closeness at night trump the objective costs of sleeping with a partner,"" states Wendy M. Troxel, an assistant professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pittsburgh.

Another recent smaller study published in the Behaviour Of Sleep Medicine stated noted that sleeping improved a couple’s perceived sleep quality. Men, in particular, slept longer and woke up later when they slept with a partner.

This characteristic is in sync with the study mentioned that also revealed that women in stable relationships fall asleep faster and wake up less frequently than single women.

"Delhi Traffic Cop Comes To The Rescue Of A Driver With Car Trouble In Heavy Rain, Steals Hearts","Most of us have been coerced into believing that cops across the country are avaricious and perennially lazy, as a result, we've often jumped into 'bashing' debates without giving the situation a second thought.

But that's not entirely true.

Just last month a cop in Bengaluru stopped President's convoy to let an ambulance pass and a cop helped a pregnant woman deliver a healthy baby. If you're unaware of the aforementioned, we're sure that you'd know about Rekha Mishra - the cop who saved over 434 children runaway children in one year.

There's no dearth of talent of humanity in the cop business and just that has been proved by another one in the service fraternity.



A Facebook user, Mankan Bammi , shared his personal experience while he was driving by Delhi's Paschim Vihar. The user was stuck in the jam in front of Radisson hotel since it was raining heavily, which is when he noticed a cop helping everyone.

The cop was performing his duties and was helping everyone who on the way. Mankan uploaded two videos on his Facebook account where the cop can be seen pushing a car that broke down.

In his post, he urged everyone to mellow down on the cop-bashing and appreciate them for the good work they put out on daily basis.

Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."
Movement in the mountains: Gorkhaland agitation is marked by a new sense of urgency. Someone will have to take note,"Sometime in the late ’80s, three boys barely in their teens headed towards a gushing mountain stream that goes by the name of Dhobikhola just outside Kurseong, an unassuming town overshadowed by the glamorous beauty of Darjeeling to its north and the pivotal importance of Siliguri to its south. The fog had lifted in the morning and there was promise that the sun would be out. Tiny ponds used to form in the crevices of kholas then – all dried up now – and young men would clamber up the slippery rocks to take a dip in the cold, clear pools.

The boys, on a break from school, had packed sandwiches and tea in a flask. They were excited about their little excursion. Suddenly a vehicle with CRPF jawans screeched to a halt in front of them and all three were bundled in. An officer asked for information on local leaders active during the agitation for a separate state of Gorkhaland that had erupted with Subhash Ghisingh in 1986. The jawans were cursing and hitting the boys.

One of the kids remembered advice he had been given by elders: if you are caught by CRPF, speak in English. “Sir,” he said in English, “I go to school and live in a hostel. My father is with the SBI. These are my friends and we don’t know the people you are talking about.” The beatings stopped and the officer asked if the statement could be verified. Then he said something that both terrified and relieved the boys. “Run home, don’t turn back. If you do, you will be shot.”

The boys ran and ran, like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. But unlike in the movie, the shackles never really came off. They don’t, if you belong to any of the communities on India’s margins. However hard one tries to integrate, osmosis remains difficult in a country that thwarts its own people.

It is that, apart from a sense of other injustices, which is fuelling the agitation for Gorkhaland this time in the hills of Darjeeling. If there is a difference in the nature of protests from those in the 1980s, it is that hundreds of thousands of young men and women have travelled out of the region in the past decades – some have returned, many have not – and all of them have grown up to ask one question: where do we belong? Where is home?

It is not the Darjeeling of Bengal, where they feel discriminated against, where at the best of times they are left to fend for themselves. The inquiry has become urgent – and articulate – with the new generation not content anymore just to join the army and unquestioningly serve a nation that doesn’t seem to care for or notice them.

The Gorkha, call him Nepalese if you will, has gone beyond the condescending stereotype that has forever defined him. He is a software engineer in Bangalore now, an actor in Mumbai, doctor in Delhi, fashion designer in New York and writer in London. And he’s had enough of it. Today he wants his space in the sun, he demands recognition.

There is another crucial change in the passionate voices coming from the hills. They no more belong to the leaders. The movement has passed into the hands of students, housewives, professionals, senior citizens.

In street meetings and town rallies, warnings openly go out from the public to local legislators and administrators. This time, you will not cheat us or mislead us, they say. You will not make contracts behind our back. In fact, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader Bimal Gurung, who snatched the baton from Ghisingh, has begun to look marginalised.

Though it was Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who lit the fire when she said Bengali would be compulsory even in the schools of Darjeeling where a majority speak Nepali – language, she should have known, is an intrinsic part of identity – and Gurung, battling shrinking political space and anti-incumbency, stoked it, the latest round of calls for a Gorkha homeland has taken a life of its own. It hasn’t mattered that BJP, which sent SS Ahluwalia to Parliament from Darjeeling with support from the Morcha, has turned its back on the people, looking as it does to make inroads into Bengal.

The party knows that its endorsement of Gorkhaland may backfire during the next elections, what with Mamata reiterating that she will not allow a division of her beloved state, however far the hills might be from Kolkata – ethnically, culturally, linguistically.

The indefinite bandh in Darjeeling is now its longest ever at 47 days and shows no sign of ending. Smartphone in hand and talking to a diaspora that has spread to every corner of India and the globe, never before has there been such communication of resolve, commitment to cause.

Solidarity videos are being streamed from Hong Kong and Manchester, marches are out in Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and all the 15 million estimated Indian Gorkhas seem to be sharing a common anguish, a hope that the shackles may finally be coming loose, a conviction that Gorkhaland is an idea whose time has come."
"In A First, Pune Man Watching Jab Harry Met Sejal Tweets To Sushma Swaraj To 'Rescue' Him!","If there is one person who is doing Twitter right, it has to be External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. The way she and her team have been using Twitter is inspiring. With the following of approximately nine million, she is also globally the most followed leaders.

Just to jog your memory a little, in the past, we have seen instances where her prompt response on social media platforms has resulted in positive results. From helping people with passport and visa issues to addressing and acting on their humanitarian concerns, the way she is taking over Twitter speaks a lot about her administrative powers.

But something really funny happened a few days ago. In a first, a Pune man, who was watching Jab Harry Met Sejal (Yes, the film that is receiving scathing and brutal reviews on social media sites) tweeted to Sushma Swaraj for help.

Yes. In order to be rescued from his 'plight' of watching Imtiaz Ali's film, he was fed up to an extent that he tweeted,

Jonty Rhodes Hails Virat Kohli But Rates Suresh Raina As The Best Fielder In The Indian Team,"Jonty Rhodes, when asked who was his favourite Indian fielder, said, ""Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif were some of the better fielders around. Virat Kohli, he is ok. But Suresh Raina for me is the best fielder in India.”

bccl

""He goes for the ball, regardless of whether he thinks he can get it or not. He reminds me a lot of a much younger Jonty Rhodes.""

On the comparison question of Sachin Tendulkar and current India captain, Virat Kohli were both great in their own way and it was wrong to compare the duo.

""I am not a great believer in records and I don't like to compare players from different eras. They are wonderful players. Both are great in their own way. Tendulkar is Tendulkar and Virat (Kohli) is Virat,"" he said at a function organised by Velammal Vidyalaya here to felicitate the school's achievers in the field of sports.

bccl

Asked if Kohli could break Tendulkar's records, he said, ""Tendulkar started at the age of 16 and played until the age of nearly 40, for almost 24 years and set several benchmarks. I don't know if Kohli can play for such a long time, given the demands of a modern-day cricketer.""

On Kohli, he said, ""Virat has started his career very well. His prolific run scoring is incredible. He has made a lot of runs at a young age. Kohli must be just Kohli and should not be compared with Tendulkar.""

To a question, if the future of Test cricket was at stake, Rhodes said, ""In my opinion, it is not Test cricket, but 50-overs cricket that is in trouble. T20 has changed the way the game is played now and Test cricket has become more exciting.""

bccl

He said T20 cricket has improved the skills of the players in all three departments of the game.

""T20 has brought a change in the manner cricket is played these days. In Test cricket, they play with a lot of freedom now, there is no fear of failure,"" he said.

""When I was playing in the last century, batsmen used to struggle in the 90s. The nervous nineties they called it. There were several batsmen who got out in the 90s. Now, that is not the case. Sometimes, batsmen reach 100 from 94 with a single shot, a six. The players are very confident these days. I don't think Test cricket is in trouble. In reality, 50 over cricket is in trouble,"" Rhodes added.

Junk today’s secularism: India needs a reinvented secularism 2.0 rooted in separation of religion and state,"India’s ambitious experiment with freedom of religion has failed. Our insipid brand of secularism, based on states’ active engagement amid stated religious neutrality, has led to the appeasement of a few, but empowers none and brings injustice for all. Instead of uniting our society, it has fomented fragmentation and alienation among our diverse religious communities.

The Hindu majority has now risen against years of over-accommodation of the Muslim minority. This puts the country at risk of losing its tolerant and pluralistic democracy. India today desperately needs a new definition of secularism, one based on freedom of religion, equality before law, and separation of religion and state.

All of these requirements are essential for secularism to work in any country. Indian secularism fails because it allows governments to grant religious freedoms, but not to treat religions equally. The biggest failure in this regard began in the early years of the republic, when the government codified Hindu social customs into law but allowed Muslims to continue practising Sharia law. For seven decades, the requirement of a uniform civil code has remained a Directive Principle in India’s Constitution.

This lack of separation of religion and state has eaten away at India’s religious amity. Governments engage in all sorts of religious activities and play favourites. They own and operate places of worship, fund religious schools, grant tax exemptions to religious outfits, award them government contracts, allot them public lands, and take people on religious pilgrimages. Both central and state governments are engaged in this free-for-all because the Constitution places “religious institutions” in the Concurrent List.

Many of India’s founding fathers opposed such government involvement. They wanted to place separation of religion and state provisions in the Constitution, but were ignored. HV Kamath suggested in the Constituent Assembly that a clause be added, stating, “The State shall not establish, endow, or patronise any particular religion.” KT Shah wanted to add that “the State in India being secular shall have no concern with any religion.” But BR Ambedkar refused their amendments outright, saying he had “nothing to add”. When Kamath objected to being so summarily rejected the Speaker responded “we cannot compel Dr Ambedkar to give reasons.”

Without constitutional restrictions on state sponsorship of religious activities, Indian secularism turned into a carte blanche for governments to do as they pleased. They began exploiting religious communities with special treatment, sops and populist slogans.

Nehru saw secularism as a tool for bringing about socialism. The word “secular”, he wrote in a 1952 letter to Congress chief ministers, meant more than the “free play of all religions … [and] conveys the idea of social and political equality. Thus a caste-ridden society is not properly secular.” Granville Austin, famous chronicler of India’s Constitution, wrote, “Nehru’s inclusive definitions of ‘communalism’, and of ‘secularism’ as its remedy, were widely shared, which made their semantic trap all the more insidious. They created more difficulties than they resolved.”

Today, the Modi wave among the Hindu majority has shattered the Nehruvian concept of secularism. And for good reasons; Nehru’s approach was impractical in its denial of all communal identities, and it was open to abuse by governments. Now the majority is flexing its muscle and taking revenge for years of minority appeasement. This makes it all the more necessary that India adopt real secularism, lest the pendulum swing too far, and allow Hindu chauvinism to take over India’s democracy.

But this time we must adopt genuine secularism, with all three essential ingredients: freedom, equality and separation. Freedom of religion is already enshrined in India’s Constitution. Work is needed on the other two, and they must be enacted through legislation.

For religious equality before law, we must pass a uniform civil code. India can make progress by persuading the Muslim minority in two ways. First, ensure that all government benefits (subsidies, aid, welfare, etc) are distributed under uniform rules. For example, subsidised ration is made available to each household on the basis of one husband/ one wife.

Second, repeal all religious privileges granted under the Criminal Procedures Code of the country. This would ensure that states’ police powers and assistance are applied on a uniform basis. So if a Muslim woman seeks assistance in a divorce, she is treated the same as a woman from any other community.

As for the separation of religion and state, India should pass a constitutional amendment along the lines of the First Amendment of the US Constitution: that Parliament “shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

Any attempt by the Hindu majority to say that separation of religion and state is not needed because their religion is secular by nature, is disingenuous. And even if that were true, the community would have nothing to lose or fear if the law of the land reaffirms its secular credentials. If Hindutva is Bhartiyata and is inclusive and plural, as they say, then let it be expressed in statute.

Religion is surely a personal matter, in which politicians, legislators, and bureaucrats do not belong. Our current variety of insipid secularism has only led to abuse by our politicians, violence on our streets, and mischief in our courts. It is time for India to join the league of great nations, and adopt true secularism."

5 Times Humans Predicted That The World Was Coming To An End,"Why is it so hard to believe that things are worse now than they’ve ever been?

Humans have been as close to the idea of doomsday as they have been to life. Every single 'full of life' day has birthed the burden of 'the end of the world'. And despite multiple beliefs, prediction theories, and logic, no one can really say for sure what it is that will lead to our descent into the black hole.

Where Javadekar errs: Research must be promoted for both teachers and students from college level itself,"Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar has announced, at a higher education conference, that research would soon be optional for college teachers. This announcement threatens to blow the culture of research and teaching in India to smithereens.

It is well known that research both in colleges and universities is already in a shambles. The existing mandatory research clause for promotion of college and university teachers has contributed only to the mushrooming of dubious academic journals and overnight publishing houses. As academics were left with the option of ‘publish or perish’, many came up with the solution of ‘pay and publish’.

The goddess of fortune smiled on sycophants with little academic credentials, and those allergic to libraries and books got enough publications to become professors, principals and vice-chancellors. Consequently, research increasingly became a term of abuse and the international rankings of our universities dipped further.

The solution to this academic malady does not lie in separating research from teaching at the undergraduate level and reducing it to a matter of choice, but in putting into place certain regulatory and quality control mechanisms. UGC approved list of journals is one such recent step towards weeding out the spurious publications.

A good starting point to initiate, nurture and improve the culture of research in colleges both for faculty and students would be to ask some fundamental questions, such as, what are the objectives of research; how does good research contribute to class room teaching? Until we answer these rudimentary questions, we cannot appreciate the invaluable role that research plays in teaching and thus see it as an added frill, a tendency exemplified in the minister’s recent announcement.

To illustrate the inextricable relation between research and classroom teaching, my experience of teaching Homer’s Iliad in a Delhi University college can serve as an example. The Iliad was supposedly composed in the 8th century BC when Greeks reinvented alphabet, forgotten a couple of centuries ago. Prior to this, the songs of Homer’s tour de force were circulated orally. To grasp the overwhelming phenomenon of transition from orality to writing, and its outcome on any culture, i read a wide range of books such as Milman Parry’s The Making of Homeric Verse, Walter J Ong’s Orality and Literacy, and various others during my doctoral research on Maithili print culture at Delhi University’s English department. I was able to help students appreciate what appeared merely redundant and repetitive in Homer as essential components of an oral culture.

If thoughtful research will not be incentivised and linked to promotion and adequate salary increment, the day is not far off when a teacher will no longer be able to come up with probing answers to the simplest of questions. The aim of education in general and research in particular is to cultivate a spirit of enquiry in students, to enable them to ask pertinent and uncomfortable questions related to their discipline, society, identity and nation.

Good research offers a solution to a problem, an answer to a good question and contributes to our knowledge of the world. As liberal spaces, universities and colleges must inculcate the spirit of questioning in young minds, and the job of good teachers-cum-researchers should be to provide gratifying answers.

The culture of enquiry, the ability to frame questions, cannot develop overnight once a student leaves college and joins the university. If we will not orient our students towards research and original ideas during graduate and post-graduate levels and suddenly exhort them to come up with new ideas and perspectives for their MPhil and PhD, they are bound to fail miserably.

The need of the hour, therefore, is to promote research both for students and teachers from the college level itself so as to orient them gradually towards knowledge production. In the absence of orientation to research and enquiry, we may well just have netizens keen to imitate and reproduce without creative and critical impulses. And, who will care about quest for knowledge and speaking truth to power then?"

Mindful Plunge,"In water, PRIYA M MENON manages to do what she couldn’t do on land — tune out everything else and withdraw into her inner Self



As I sat in the orthopaedist’s office, I smiled.Along with the prescription was a note for the physiotherapist and the exercise recommended — swimming. Maybe my bad knee will ensure I am third time lucky, I thought, before heading back to work. My first two attempts at learning swimming had ended in disaster.Growing up close to the Kochi backwaters and spending summer vacations at my grandma’s home by the seaside, I loved the sight, smell and sound of water. When I was eight,my father took me to a small pool that had opened in the children’s traffic park in Kochi. Clad in my bright new swimsuit, I was asked to get into the shallow side of the pool and wait for the instructor. As I clung to the edge, peering eagerly up at the adults hovering close by, a man with bloodshot eyes leaned over. “Let go, turn around and just kick with your hands and feet.That’s all you need to do,” he barked. I obediently let go, flailed around and promptly sank. As I went down for the third time, my father, in his crisp white shirt and mundu, jumped into the pool and fished me out. It turned out that the man was not the instructor but an alcoholic wandering around the park.Anyway, my swimming classes ended and the pool also closed not much later.



A couple of decades later,along with my colleagues at the newspaper I then worked for, I signed up for a summer swimming camp at a small hotel in Chennai.The pool was small, dirty and filled with people of all age groups.The blazing heat, shrieking kids with dripping noses, and leering men who gargled into the pool’s gutter ensured I soon came down with an infection.And thus my second attempt was also thwarted, but not before I had learnt to float. So, this time round, I scouted out the cleanest pool I could find, and signed up for adult swimming classes.The first day went well.I arrived at 7:30am sharp to find a group of middle-aged and elderly men and women — each one at various stages of learning — in the pool, while three young coaches kept vigil.The instructor,an elderly man, soon appeared.Thanks to my earlier classes,I managed to float across the pool with ease. The second day, the coach began teaching me the breast stroke — first the arm movement,then the frog kick. Over the next few days, I struggled to master it, gulping air greedily as I surfaced, trying to get the coordination right.The more I struggled, the more energy I spent, and by the time I reached midway through the 25m pool, I gave up. Till the granny who was learning swimming to enjoy her Bali holiday with family spoke words of encouragement. Three months of classes later, she was still struggling to swim a lap.



The women in their 50s, freed from household chores with the advent of their daughters-in-law, had been there for two months floundering but delighting in their new-found freedom. And they were not ready to give up. Ten classes later, exhausted by my attempts, I decided to let go and simply float.After a few seconds, lulled by the rhythm of the water, I slowly began the strokes — stretching out my arms, pulling the water back, coming up for air,kicking out. Again and again, concentrating on the feel of the water, the rhythm of my breath.And even Phelps couldn’t have felt prouder when the cheers broke out as I finally finished the lap. The succeeding laps were much easier. The trick, I realised is to let yourself go,tune everything out,take it slow and not worry about reaching the other end of the pool. At the end of the hour, I found myself tired but elated, and strangely peaceful and calm. For a person who had tried yoga and meditation in vain — the former I managed to do for a month, the latter has always eluded me — it was the closest I got to experience the benefits of either. Bringing it up in conversation with a friend and yoga enthusiast, I realised that swimming is in fact considered by many to be moving meditation. Breaststroke or freestyle,swimming blends most of the principles of yoga and meditation. In water, I manage to do what I never can on land — focus on my breath, tune out everything else and withdraw into my inner self,a place where there are no deadlines or chores; and simply concentrate.



It’s the closest I have got to mindfulness — all I am aware of is the way my body glides through water, and the breath that fills my lungs. And with it comes a certain peace.Even as the physical exertion helps the body, the mental calm rejuvenates me.And the happy hormones released keep me smiling through the day. I had looked to heal my aching knee but the pool had healed my inner self. The classes did come to an end but the learning hasn’t stopped.The seniors I met showed age is no barrier where learning is concerned.The granny’s Bali vacation turned out to be memorable, as she snorkelled with her grandchildren. The women in their 50s have moved on to a dancing class.As for me, I am joining my 78-year-old swimming buddy next weekend so we can learn how to tread water in the deep. ■

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Mandal’s children: Maratha reservation agitation must spur political class to look beyond quotas,"The assertion of Maratha power culminating in a massive rally that paralysed Mumbai, India’s financial capital, is a warning sign that India’s growth story is in danger of veering off course. When dominant groups like Marathas and Jats vie for reservation, originally conceived as an instrument of social justice to uplift those who suffered under the caste system, it calls for a comprehensive review of this policy. The original plan was to progressively end reservations but now more groups wish to enjoy its benefits. Legal challenges over Maratha reservation exceeding Supreme Court’s 50% cap on quotas constrains the state government, but that has not stopped protesters from pressing their demands.

To mollify them chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has announced sops that extend to Marathas educational benefits like fee concessions available to OBC students. But it is unlikely that perceptions relating to denial of opportunities will recede with these new sops. Land-owning communities like Marathas and Jats have been hit hard by the slowing rural economy. That has been exacerbated by the Mandal effect, following which it has become fashionable for powerful caste groups to carve out their own quota of jobs and education regardless of merit. But there is no end to this cycle, as each sop to each caste group will result in other castes feeling aggrieved.

This hankering for reservation militates against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s exhortation to make common cause against corruption, poverty and illiteracy for the next five years. Society remains divided on caste lines and opposition to reservation is being supplanted with collective bargaining and muscle flexing for reservation. As social tensions increase, it is time to look beyond quotas for solutions that can emancipate and empower the greatest number.

Investing in school education, improving quality of education, and facilitating access to quality education gives all young people, irrespective of caste or religion, a better shot at professional success in later life. It must be noted that young Marathas have spearheaded the 58 muk morchas or silent rallies. Their worries about the future are legitimate but hitting the streets may not yield solutions to their problems. The focus must shift away from hiving up existing jobs to creating new ones and expanding the pie. A new political and social consensus is needed. But who is there to bell the cat?"
Harmanpreet Kaur Names The Actress Who Can Play Her In The Biopic. It’s Deepika Padukone!,"India won the 2011 World Cup and soon plans of making an MS Dhoni biopic were hatched. Then Dhoni's biopic came and rocked the box office. Now the Indian women's team reached the 2017 World Cup final and made us proud. Despite their loss to England, several players got intense adulation from Indian fans. And biopic plans were again hatched. This time around the female cricketer in the spotlight is Harmanpreet Kaur.

Twitter

Considering a biopic is made, who will be the right actress to portray Harmanpreet on the silver screen? If you have listen to what Harmanpreet says, it should be Deepika Padukone. In an interview, she said, “Deepika is a good actor. She’d be the right choice [for the biopic], she’d able portray me well on-screen.""

Twitter

So what's up with Indian team these days? “Right now, we’re focused on winning the next World Cup. There’s so much more that, I need to achieve.""

Prompt police action — key to end violence against women,"Nirbhaya gangrape case and brutal murder that shook the whole country is still fresh in our memories. The Hon’ble Supreme Court pronounced the judgment only a few months ago wherein the court has expressed deep concern on rising crimes against women. “Increased crime rate against women is an area of concern for law–makers and there is an emergent need to study in depth the root of the problem and remedy the same through a strict law and order regime. Public at large, in particular, men are to be sensitised on gender justice”, the Court noted. The judgment called for strict action by police and secondly, changing the mindset of the society.

Ms Vernika Kundu was driving her car at midnight in Chandigarh and was chased by the goons in their vehicle. They chased her for about 20 kms in different directions. At one point, they overtook and stopped her car, got down and started banging at the car door trying to open it. The lady took a reverse and sped. In the meanwhile , she had called the cops who nabbed the culprits. The action of police so far is commendable. However, the police bungled up the registration of FIR. Ms Vernika had given a complaint saying that she was stalked and there was an intention to kidnap. The fact that she was chased for 20 minutes not allowing her to reach her destination shows an intention to kidnap. This should have been thoroughly investigated. Instead, there was an attempt to tamper with the complaint itself. Law is very clear on the registration of complaints. In the famous Lalithakumari Vs State of Uttar pradesh, Supreme Court pronounced judgment in 2012 and said – “If a cognizable offence is made out in the complaint, the police have no option but to register FIR” . This is further upheld by the Supreme Court judgment in Ramdev Foods Vs State of Gujarat, pronounced in 2015. In both the verdicts, Court has made it clear that “there cannot be a preliminary inquiry in an offence against a person/body prior to registering FIR” Because, preliminary inquiry gives scope to the accused to destroy the evidence and this means denying justice to the victim. The Court has said that only in five categories of offences-(1) Matrimonial family disputes (2) Commercial offences (3) Medical negligence cases (4) Corruption cases (5) Delays in giving prosecution sanction – only in these, there can be a preliminary inquiry. This essentially means that FIR is the starting point of investigation. Sections of law in FIR has to be as per the complaint only. There is no scope to omit the sections contrary to the complaint.

In an offence of stalking, attempt to kidnap as the case of Ms. Vernika, omitting the section of law in FIR is not only ‘Contempt of Court’ but also punishable under section 166A(c) IPC, wherein rigorous imprisonment upto 6 months extendable upto 2 years is attracted.

Data furnished by National Crime Records Bureau shows that there is an increase in crime against women inspite of women making advancement in education and in various fields. Supreme Court noted in Nirbhaya case that “Offences against women are not women’s issue alone but a human rights issue.” It is important to ensure that gender justice does not remain only on paper. Respect for woman and her dignity is the key to end violence against women. This has to start from home. Schools, textbooks, media also have a pivotal role in changing the mindset. When I narrated Vernika incident to my ten-year old child, the answer was – “If the girl was questioned why she was on roads at night the same has to be asked from the boys too.” What is sauce for the goose shall be sauce for the gander as well.

When will the age old police habit of doubting and questioning the victim, and further victimisation end? Will there ever be a time when police are sensitised enough to be empathetic and put oneself in the victim’s shoes? Leave alone being sensitised, if the police acts strictly as per law, most of the problems would be solved. Do the police also get biased in favour of social norms? Yes, very much likely. In India, women drinking alcohol, coming home late night are scorned at. Probably, this is the reason why Vernika lost sympathy from certain sections of society. But police can’t act as a moral-science instructor. There is no law in India that bans women from going out in the night or drinking alcohol. Hence, whether we like it or not, allowing our prejudices/biases to come in the way of implementation of law is unfair to the victim.

Even when Nirbhaya case was reported at first in the media, fingers were pointed at the girl questioning her being on roads at ungodly hours at night. The same is repeated in Ms. Vernika’s case. Many more will ensue in future unless societal attitude on gender role and social expectations change. How-so-ever progress our country could be making in various fields, it is disheartening to note that there is a huge lag between societal norms/traditions on one hand and law on the other. Law of the land ensures equality and justice. But the spirit of law will become effective only when we develop scientific temper."
"Goodbye, Cassini! NASA's Saturn-Bound Spacecraft Enters The Final Chapter Of Its 20-YO Journey","NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has begun the final chapter of its iconic 20-year-journey, where it will conduct a series of daring dives between Saturn and its rings. The probe will finally take a plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere to meet an explosive end, burning like an asteroid.

NASA

Following a final close flyby of Saturn’s moon Titan, Cassini will leap over the planet’s icy rings and begin a series of 22 weekly dives between the planet and the rings between April and September.

On the final orbit, Cassini will plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere, sending back new and unique science to the very end. After losing contact with Earth, the spacecraft will burn up like a meteor, becoming part of the planet itself.

REUTERS/NASA

That dramatic event is the capstone of six months of daring exploration and scientific discovery. Cassini’s final images will have been sent to Earth several hours before its final plunge, but even as the spacecraft makes its fateful dive into the planet’s atmosphere, it will be sending home new data in real time.

From its launch in 1997 to the unique Grand Finale science of 2017, the Cassini-Huygens mission has racked up a remarkable list of achievements, NASA said.

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
Burdening Indian exporters: Current GST provisions ratchet up costs and deter small firms from exporting,"Exporters loved the core promise of GST. They would export more as the product cost comes down through lower taxes and reduction in tax on tax incidences. But specific GST provisions nullify these gains, making exporting high cost and complex. Worse, most small firms would not qualify to export. This will upset manufacturing, employment, exports and other economic parameters. The GST provisions on exports need an urgent review.

Firms have to pay GST at every stage. This is ironic as exports are zero rated under GST, implying no tax burden. An exporter has to pay GST at the time of buying inputs and exporting the finished goods. He can seek a GST refund after the exports. The refund may take place after 3 to 12 months of payment of taxes. This gap makes exports expensive. Firms will have to borrow money not only to buy inputs but also to pay taxes and interest.

Let us say a firm adds 30% value to inputs, it would then need to buy raw material of value Rs 77 for exports worth Rs 100. If the GST rate is 18%, he would need to borrow Rs 13.80 from the bank to pay the GST.

The capital lock up at the country level would be staggering. If the time between buying of raw material and refund is 6 months, Rs 95,000 crore of exporters’ money will remain blocked. For a longer cycle of 12 months, as is the case for many sectors, the money will exceed Rs 200,000 crore. This will remain blocked forever as the firms will use the refund obtained from the government for paying taxes for the next cycle. We have no information if banks are geared up to lend this much money. Most SMEs will have a tough time getting money even at 12% annual interest.

The working capital lock up will increase export product cost by 1-2%. Exporters from the engineering, electronics, automobile, chemical and pharmaceuticals sectors have longer processing time. So they will suffer most.

Pre-GST, exporters were free from this burden. They used export schemes to buy duty-free raw material or machinery needed for making an export product. Exporters had expected exemption from GST as exports were zero rated. But, this was not granted. This has disrupted the export promotion architecture used by exporters for the past three decades.

Many other provisions affect exports. Firms supplying goods to international projects located in India face a rough time as GST does not recognise such supplies. Pre-GST such supplies were eligible for deemed export benefits. Merchant firms that buy goods and export will have to pay tax at the time of buying the export goods. Pre-GST, they paid no taxes.

GST has made an exception for SEZs where the tax exemption continues. But this will have limited impact as only 3-4 firms account for more than half SEZ goods exports.

Several options are available for resolving the working capital issue. The government can extend the ab initio duty exemption facility like the one accepted for SEZs, to all exporters. Such exemptions are available in many countries.

Life for over one lakh active small exporters has become difficult. They cannot export anymore unless they register as regular GST firms. The exemption from GST registration available to small firms is not applicable if they export. Taking registration as a regular dealer means high compliance cost without adequate business. Compliance includes the filing of three monthly and one annual return for each state and each business vertical.

Most small exporters come from the tier II and III cities like Jaipur, Moradabad, Ludhiana, Coimbatore, Surat. Placing onerous conditions on them is disastrous especially when jobs in the formal sector are shrinking. GST on air freight at 18% makes vegetables and other low-value perishable products expensive. A vegetable exporter pays Rs 36 as GST on freight for an export value of Rs 100. Changes in export procedures, documents required or the refund rules are not clear. Exporters worry as delayed shipments would result in cancellation of export orders.

Charging tax on supplies on which no tax is due just to refund it later makes products expensive and blunts competitiveness. Exporters work on lean margins as they compete internationally. Resolving the working capital issue and allowing small firms to export is crucial for India’s exports to stay on the growth track."

"Cassini Gets Ready To Die In Space, 20 Years After It Set Off For Saturn & Unearthed Wonders","It's the beginning of the end for one of the most insightful spacecraft ever launched in space, the final chapter of a epic story spanning across two decades.

We don't have words to describe how amazing this shot of Saturn is!

After revealing absolutely breathtaking, never-before-seen images of Saturn, NASA's Cassini spacecraft is scheduled to enter the final phase of its mission around the second largest planet in our solar system.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a $3.2 billion project involving NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency and was kicked off in October 1997. The spacecraft only arrived in orbit around Saturn in July 2004. Huygens landed on Titan, Saturn's satellite, in July 2005.

Cassini's Grand Finale

Dubbed as the Grand Finale, as it gets ready to perform a set of ultra-close fly-by around Saturn's upper atmosphere, Cassini will eventually complete its final five orbits around the planet starting on August 14 (IST).

During this last hurrah, Cassini will get as close to 1,630 km from Saturn's cloud tops, where it's expected to encounter atmosphere dense enough to require rocket thrusters for stability -- just like Cassini's flight across Saturn's moon Titan, which has similar conditions.

An artist's impression of Cassini

Even in its death spiral, Cassini will collect data on the atmosphere close to Saturn's cloud tops -- which is still uncharted territory -- make detailed, high-resolution observations of Saturn's auroras, temperature, and the vortexes at the planet's poles. Its radar will peer deep into the atmosphere to reveal small-scale features as fine as 25 kilometres wide - nearly 100 times smaller than the spacecraft could observe prior to its final mission phase, the Grand Finale.

Even though it's been flying for two decades, it only flirted with Saturn's mesmerizing rings for the first time in December last year, flying close to and through them. After analyzing the planet and its satellites in great detail, NASA announced in last April that Cassini needs to be destroyed to avoid damaging any alien life in the vicinity. Towards the end of April 2017, Cassini dived between Saturn and its innermost ring for the very first time, sending back truly spectacular images of that journey.

""As it makes these five dips into Saturn, followed by its final plunge, Cassini will become the first Saturn atmospheric probe,"" Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at JPL, said.

On September 11, a distant encounter with Saturn's moon, Titan, will slow Cassini's orbit around Saturn and bend its path slightly to send the spacecraft headlong into a deep plunge and crash on September 15, ending its long and rewarding journey.

How an inept finance ministry pushes up India’s food subsidy bill,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on 4th August tabled in parliament a compliance audit report on Food Corporation of India. One of the striking features of the report is that it shows up India’s finance ministry as an inept body. Its management of finances is poor and the consequence is that India’s subsidy bill is bigger than it should be.

FCI, which was created by legislation in 1964, is central to India’s food security programme. It handles procurement and storage of food grains. FCI’s operations are primarily funded by the food subsidy provided by finance ministry.

CAG’s report- covering the period between 2011-12 and 2015-16- shows that over time the gap between the subsidy claimed by FCI and the amount released by finance ministry has widened.

As FCI needs the money to keep its operations going, it has begun to borrow an increasing amount of money from commercial sources. The largest source of borrowing is cash credit extended to it by a consortium of banks. It also happens to be a relatively expensive source of borrowing.

The consequence of this chain of events is that FCI’s subsidy requirement keeps increasing partly on account of the interest it pays for its commercial borrowing.

CAG’s report shows that FCI paid an interest of Rs 35,701.81 crore over five years to make up for the shortfall of subsidy.

This, among other factors, makes FCI’s operations more expensive than it should be. All of this feeds into the food subsidy bill.

“The main reason for indebtedness of FCI was delayed/insufficient release of subsidy by ministry,” says the CAG report.

The next time finance ministers and ministry officials claim to have skillfully managed the fiscal situation, it is best to be skeptical. Fiscal prudence may be the result of unpaid bills or short release of subsidy."
Why we must not give up the freedom to think,"“August is the month of revolution,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his monthly radio talk a few days ago. Wednesday was the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement against British colonial rule, and Modi talked about the five-year journey from sankalp (intention) to siddhi (achievement), independence in August 1947.

Modi, India’s first prime minister to be born in independent India, is very good at observing anniversaries. We have a well-stocked pantheon of heroes and heroines to commemorate, more numerous than the red-letter festival days on our calendars, and Modi has invoked many of them. “We have to make 2017 a year of resolve,” he said in his Mann ki Baat talk, calling for a movement to rid a New India of dirt, poverty, corruption, terrorism, casteism, communalism, and religious intolerance over the next five years to the next milestone: the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.

Why are we making so much of India at 70 going on 75? Is it more significant than India at 60, or India at 50, or looking ahead at India at 100? This is a fair question, and I remembered that Tuesday was the 76th birth anniversary of C.K. Prahalad, the management guru who first spelled out the India@75 vision in a New York speech in 2007. “As we celebrate India@60, let us remember that all our accomplishments are in the past. Leadership, however, is about the future and it is about change. Leadership is about hope,” Prahalad said.

He said India would need economic strength and technological vitality. We required at least 200 million college graduates, 500 million certified and skilled technicians, and universal education. Prahalad, who died in 2010, listed several audacious goals for 2022. Among them were: at least ten Indian companies in the Fortune 100 list (the last time I checked we had only seven in the Fortune 500 list, with Indian Oil at 161); and that India must account for at least 10% of global trade (government figures show India accounted for 2% in 2015).

Among other big goals was the wish that India should become a world leader in innovation and new technology. This would be great, but do we realistically think we are going to be home to the next Google or Facebook or WhatsApp within the next five years? Our start-ups seem to be content with copying or adapting existing models. It is well-nigh impossible to carry out a national audit of the research our universities and institutions produce; my guess is that a considerable proportion will turn out to be unoriginal or plagiarised. The University Grants Commission urged universities last year to use anti-plagiarism software to catch fraudulent scholars, but you don’t hear any naming and shaming.

Four days before he retired, Vice President Hamid Ansari told law graduates in Bangalore that pluralism and secularism were essential for India’s democracy. Religious minorities constitute 19.4% of the population, Ansari noted. In his thought-provoking speech, peppered with citations, Ansari argued strongly for tolerance, compassion, and inclusiveness. The alternative was unpalatable, he added: “There is evidence to suggest that we are a polity at war with itself in which the process of emotional integration has faltered and is in dire need of reinvigoration. On one plane is the question of our commitment to Rule of Law that seems to be under serious threat arising out of the noticeable decline in the efficacy of the institutions of the State, lapses into arbitrary decision-making and even ‘ochlocracy’ or mob rule, and the resultant public disillusionment”. If our prime minister believes we have five more years to erase communalism, casteism and religious intolerance and become the world’s benchmark on how to cope with diversity, do you have high hopes we will succeed?

Ansari, who more than Pranab Mukherjee was an occasional voice of conscience, will be missed. We can look forward now to some hagiography: Modi released a book of Venkaiah Naidu’s speeches and articles just as the new vice president was elected. Two months ago Naidu, a relentless cheerleader for the prime minister, spoke about MODI, the Making of Developed India. Last October he released a book on Modi’s ‘Midas touch’ in foreign policy.

Couched in careful language, Ansari’s farewell speech was an indictment of our political class. It is possible to be depressed by the depths to which this class can descend in its pursuit of power – whether it is a Nitish Kumar, who has shredded the last vestige of political morality the opposition could pretend to believe in, or it is the sordid shenanigans that ended in the early hours of the Quit India anniversary with Ahmed Patel’s re-election to a sixth term as a Congress member of the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat.

And yet, both Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi stood up in the Lok Sabha later that day to speak about the freedom movement and the ideals that fired men and women three-quarters of a century ago. Modi stuck to the script from his Mann ki Baat talk and ended with a series of pledges he said every citizen should take, which were emblazoned in full-page newspaper advertisements that morning. Sonia Gandhi dwelt at some length on the sufferings of Congress leaders from Jawaharlal Nehru on during the agitation. She added that the ‘powers of darkness’ that were out to destroy secularism and freedom of speech must be defeated. This was two days after Jairam Ramesh said in an interview that the Congress party faced an existential crisis (“The sultanate has gone but we behave as if we were sultans still”) and must re-invent itself. Many of us have been saying this for three years.

Forget the nitpicks: next week, we will be celebrating 70 years of democracy. This is no mean feat, although Western Europe, which rose from the ruins of war a couple of years before the Union Jack was taken off our flagpoles, has also had enduring democracies, however flawed they may sometimes appear. Our neighbours in South Asia have fared much worse; no prime minister in Pakistan has lasted a full term, and coups, monarchies, uprisings and civil wars have bucked and heaved around our borders.

These seven decades have been marked, elsewhere in the world and at least once in India, by an overall distaste for totalitarianism, although North Korea has survived as an exemplar and now looms monstrously on the horizon with its nuclear arsenal.

Across the world, we have fared less well against authoritarianism, which the dictionary defines as “the enforcement or advocacy of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom”. We will forget this at our own peril. In his 2007 speech, Prof. Prahalad put this in stark terms: “Just economic strength and technological maturity is not enough. We know that the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had economic and technological muscle. They failed. Morality is an integral part of leadership.”"

"Bhutan Stands With India, Rejects Beijing's Claim That Doklam Belongs To China","The Government of Bhutan on Thursday refuted Chinese foreign ministry claims about Thimpu telling Beijing that the trilateral border stand-off area in Doklam in the Sikkim sector is not Bhutan's territory.

A top Chinese diplomat Wang Wenli had claimed that Bhutan had conveyed to Beijing through diplomatic channels that the area of the standoff is not its territory.

BCCL

Wang, who is the deputy director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs in China's foreign ministry, reportedly conveyed this information to a visiting Indian media delegation on Wednesday.

She, however, did not provide any evidence to back her claim, which has been strongly denied by Bhutan.

Official sources in the Bhutanese Government told ANI over phone, ""Our position on the border issue of Doklam is very clear. Please refer to our statement which has been published on the web site of Bhutan's foreign ministry on June 29, 2017.""

Reacting to the developments in Doklam, Bhutan had on June 29 issued a press release in which it clearly stated that the construction of the road inside Bhutanese territory is a direct violation of the agreements and affects the process of demarcating the boundary between the two countries.

In the press release, Bhutan said that the Chinese Army started constructing a motorable road from Dokola in the Doklam area towards the Bhutan Army camp at Zompelri on June 16, 2017.

It further said that the boundary talks between Bhutan and China were under way and the two countries had written agreements of 1988 and 1998 stating that they agree to maintain peace and tranquility in their border areas pending a final settlement on the boundary question. The two countries have also agreed to maintain status quo on the boundary as before March 1959 and refrain from taking unilateral action, or use of force, to change the status quo of the boundary.

Bhutan has hoped that the status quo in the Doklam area would be maintained by China as before 16 June 2017.

The Chinese diplomat, while acknowledging that Bhutan had intially protested about Beijing's violation in the Doklam area, was quoted as saying, ""After the incident, the Bhutanese made it very clear to us that the place where the trespassing happened is not Bhutan's territory.""

De Villiers wanted to retire from Tests while back: Rhodes

Bagawati Prasad • Last updated on Thu, 10 Aug, 2017, 12:21 PM

""Fitness [Indian team] has certainly improved and so is the athletic ability"" - Rhodes © Getty

Former South African cricketer and fielding legend Jonty Rhodes is in city and this time it's not just for surfing. Rhodes, fielding coach of Mumbai Indians, has taken up the the role of a mentor with TNPL franchise Ruby Trichy Warriors. In an interaction, the 48-year-old opened up on the talk surrounding AB de Villiers's Test retirement, India's progress as a fielding unit and more. Excerpts:

What's your take on de Villiers missing out on the England Test series?

Actually, I spoke to de Villiers on Tuesday with regard to the Global T20 that's going to happen in South Africa. And certainly he didn't ask my opinion about his career. Every player knows when their time is right. The frustrating part from the South African context is that when you are waiting for somebody to come back in, you are almost trying to plug the gaps with options. And you play that guy [who replaces de Villiers] in and out of a side.

How do you view all the talks around de Villiers's probable Test retirement?

I think he wanted to retire a while back from Test cricket, but Cricket South Africa persuaded him to stay on. Before 2016, he was talking to people about his Test future. In South Africa, people are critical because they don't see the IPL mechanism.

They think cricketers are trying to make as much money as possible and it's often at the expense of national call-ups. The BCCI is the only cricket board that doesn't allow their players to play in other competitions. But our guys go from IPL to CPL to England to Big Bash. And they play Tests and ODIs whenever they can. There is so much workload and the guys work hard.

How do you see India's progress as a fielding unit?

When we used to play against India, Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh were outstanding and Harbhajan Singh was probably the third best. Dhoni and Virat Kohli are physically strong. Fitness has certainly improved and so is the athletic ability. It was well evident in the last World Cup when de Villiers was run out from the boundary by a fast bowler [Mohit Sharma]. It's because of T20 cricket. The key elements in Kohli's team selection are fitness and fielding. He is leaving players out who he deems not fit enough, no matter how good they are.

How is Kohli's leadership style different from that of de Villiers and Rohit Sharma?

I have only seen skipper Kohli as part of Mumbai Indians' coach on a couple of occasions. Rohit looks like a laidback guy. But he is like a duck on the water. All you see is the duck above. Underneath the feet are going like crazy, paddling to stay there. You watch him bat, looks like he is about to sleep and he cracks a six.

His captaincy is quite similar. He is not a firebrand like Kohli, which sometimes you need. But you got to be yourself. From a captaincy perspective, de Villiers is just another nice guy. He hasn't done anything different.

A lot has been spoken about women's cricket after the World Cup. How do you see its progress in the future?

The great thing is you are now watching women play before men in international events at the same venue. Before India won the World T20 in 2007, they were saying T20 is pyjama cricket. Suddenly, India won T20 and they say let's have it here! From that perspective, seeing the success of the Indian ladies will go a long way in the growth of the game.

Who inspired you to become the 'greatest fielder'?

Peter Kirsten. We didn't have any televised international cricket when I was at school during apartheid era. Dean Jones was good on the outfield, had strong arm and ran well between the wickets.

But, I played against Kirsten and I respected him on the field. I haven't heard or seen former South African fielding great Colin Bland. There wasn't much footage of him.

The American dancer is one of the few tutters in the world! Known for her arobotting, popping, finger tutting and break dance, Dytto became a sensation when she performed break dance on the track ‘I’m a Barbie Girl’ in San Francisco. It was this gig that earned her an invite to The Ellen Show.

She hypnotized the Indian audience and the show’s judges when she showed her clean robotic moves on the track Tip Tip Barsa Pani. Not just Remo D’Souza but Dytto floored the contestants as well.

We guarantee that once you start watching her dance you won’t feel like stopping! Don’t believe us, watch it for yourself:

Why the breakdown of consensus in Monetary Policy Committee is good,"The outcome of the sixth meeting of Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee, or MPC, was a surprise. It was not on account of a reduction in the repo rate (rate at which RBI lends money to banks), but on account of the lack of unanimity in the six-member committee.

The first four meetings of MPC resulted in unanimity of decision making. The first sign of diversity of views came in the last meeting held in June. Ravindra H. Dholakia, an external member of MPC, differed and felt that the repo rate should be lowered by half-a-percentage point, which was a larger cut when compared to what the MPC finally chose to do.

He stuck to the position in August.

That leads to the question: what was surprising about the lack of unanimity in August meeting?

Michael Debabrata Patra, executive director in RBI, which makes him the junior most of RBI’s three nominees, differed from the rest of the committee. He wanted to maintain status quo.

It will take a couple of weeks for the minutes of the meeting to be published. But in the meantime it worth looking at why Patra’s position is a positive development.

When there were public debates on the best possible composition of MPC, it was often assumed that RBI’s nominees would vote in the same way. There were arguments that RBI’s nominees were unlikely to publicly differ from the governor on the matter of policy rates.

Patra just did that which can’t be a bad thing when seen in the context of the need for diversity of views in MPC.

It is tempting to second guess Patra’s reasoning based on the minutes of the last MPC. He states that the aim under a flexible inflation targeting framework is to steer the trajectory of inflation towards the target in the medium-term and deal with risks around it.

He seemed to anticipate some of the criticism that would come MPC’s way as he stated that it would not do to change the framework of inflation targeting on the basis of past data or forecast errors of MPC.

It was the equivalent to anticipatory bail as Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic advisor in finance ministry, later tweeted:

“Policymakers should follow real data rather than error prone forecasting models.”

On the basis of the last two MPC meetings, it may be reasonable to say that there is evidence that MPC’s minutes will in future be a more insightful document."
Goa Elections 2017 Analysis Times of India,
Congress gets Patel face saver: But BJP still sits pretty while Congress desperately searches for a new narrative and identity,"There are three kinds of Patels in Gujarat, goes an old joke oft-repeated by Ahmed Patel’s detractors in the state. Kadva Patels, Leuva Patels and Ahmed Patel. Laced with the irony and exaggeration that is the hallmark of sharp political innuendo, it was meant both as a dig at his vote catching abilities and, equally, as a backhanded compliment to his formidable soft skills as the master mover and shaker behind Sonia Gandhi’s Congress throne.

It’s not for nothing that Patel, the primary instrument and shaper of the Congress president’s politics since at least 2001, has kept his seat in Parliament almost continuously for three decades (1977-1989 in Lok Sabha; 1993-present in Rajya Sabha). BJP’s failure to prevent him from winning his fifth Rajya Sabha (RS) term, despite throwing everything it had into the contest, has certainly given Congress a face saving and temporary reprieve after a string of recent reverses.

The question is: can this victory mark the beginning of a possible Congress revival or is it simply the last gasp of the old order? Was elevating a mundane RS election that few, except the most avid political junkies, would even have noticed in the past, into a high stakes battle for prestige at the highest levels of both parties worth it?

First, in an election that reduced the pursuit of power on both sides to a ruthlessly simple victory-loss calculus, the only real winner in terms of systemic morality was the Election Commission. At a time when allegations of Rs 15 crore being the supposed going-rate for MLAs were vitiating Gandhinagar’s air, Congress chose to respond to Shankersinh Vaghela’s second political rebellion in Gujarat with tactics that ironically, he himself had pioneered in his first rebellion 22 years ago (against BJP). If Congress’s gambit of flying 44 of its MLAs to Bengaluru’s Eagleton resort – like Vaghela’s 1995 flight to Khajuraho – raised questions of strong-arm tactics, the sheer timing of IT raids against a Congress Karnataka minister raised troubling questions about the possible misuse of state power.

In the end, only EC came out with its reputation further enhanced. By rejecting legal arguments presented by a battery of senior ministers and accepting the P Chidambaram-fronted Congress delegation’s argument that two of its MLAs had indeed violated election rules, EC has risen further in stature in the eyes of the average Indian. From Arvind Kejriwal after the Delhi MCD poll to Mayawati after BJP’s UP sweep, opposition leaders have been making a habit of taking potshots at EC. This decision should put a stop to all that.

It also definitively ends all scurrilous speculation about EC’s impartiality based on the premise that both election commissioners were appointed in the current NDA government’s tenure and chief election commissioner A K Joti once served as Narendra Modi’s chief secretary in Gujarat. The EC decision has once again underscored the robustness of our constitutional system of checks and balances.

Second, in a country where Rajya Sabha contests have long been in the nature of fixed matches, BJP can’t be faulted for ending the practice of underhand deals between opposing parties for contests involving key leaders. BJP’s electoral ruthlessness under the Modi-Shah regime is not new. At least one mathematical analysis of the RS poll’s fiendishly complex system of voter-weightage shows that Patel may still have ended up carrying the day even if the two MLAs had not been disqualified. Yet, the fact that BJP came so close to defeating Patel in what should have otherwise been a safe contest is a portent for the future.

Third, while the result is definitely a reprieve for Congress, this may have very little impact on upcoming state assembly elections. Theoretically speaking, 2017 should be Congress’s best chance to regain power in Gujarat after two decades. Even at the height of Modi’s Gujarat hegemony, Congress consistently polled a vote-share around the 40% mark in every assembly poll from 2002 onwards to 2012. Since 2014 though, bereft of Modi’s teflon hand in Gandhinagar, BJP’s traditional Patel constituency, as symbolised by the Hardik Patel agitation, has been up in arms over reservation.

Disparate caste-based opposition movements led by Jignesh Mevani (Dalits) and Alpesh Thakore (OBCs) have flowered. Yet, while BJP has consistently been making important political course corrections on the ground, Congress in Gujarat 2017 looks almost exactly like Congress in 2002. Its top state leadership has basically remained a closed and ossified group of five leaders – Vaghela, Bharatsinh Solanki, Sidharth Patel, Arjun Modwadia and Shaktisinh Gohil. Vaghela’s rebellion has only weakened the party further. It remains a divided house and the absence of a new and energetic leadership means it is still rudderless.

BJP, conversely, has been ruthless about winnability. It switched Anandiben Patel with Vijay Rupani in the CM’s chair in August 2016 and has had three state party presidents in the last 2 years alone: RC Faldu, Rupani himself and now Jitu Vaghani. It is this kind of nimble footedness that allowed the party to recover in gram panchayat elections in December 2016, where its candidate even won in Una, last in the spotlight over atrocities against Dalits.

Fourth, Rahul Gandhi’s absence from action at a time when the prestige stakes were so high was glaring. Congress’s old guard has got a fillip with the Patel result but its older leaders are not vote magnets. Rahul’s leadership has been unable to deliver so far and the party is still desperately searching for a new narrative and identity. The Rajya Sabha result does not change this basic reality."
"19-YO From Kolhapur Makes Country Proud, Becomes Second Indian To Win The British Formula 3 Championship","Krishnaraaj Mahadik was barely an infant when Narain Karthikeyan won the BRDC Formula 3 Championship 19 years ago. Now, Krishnaraj's life has come a full circle. He's become the second India to win the championship. And that's no mean feat because that's a pretty prestigious motor racing championship.

Twitter

The race was held at the Brands Hatch Grand Prix Circuit in Kent, England, where now the Indian flag flies high after nearly two decades. Son of Kolhapur Member of Parliament Dhananjay Mahadik, Krishnaraj said, “It was very challenging because the championship has drivers competing from all around the globe and the competition is a very close one… when you are leading the race… you come under a lot of pressure. I would like to believe that I handled that very well.”

Twitter

Krishnaraj started the second race from pole position and dominated throughout to win the race by a very convincing margin. “It was a very exciting experience and I am very happy to have taken my first win in British F3,” he said.

India’s gender chasm retards the economy,"Women hold up half the sky. This is not a moral or social argument — it is essentially an economic fact. But women are largely absent from India’s workforce. With a gender gap of 52.1%, the International Labour Organization has ranked India 121st among 131 countries on the basis of female labour force participation. Multiple reports and studies point to the positive impact that increased participation of women in the labour force would have on the economy. If India could close the wide gender gap in employment by 2025, the economy could gain by as much as $1 trillion. Women are central to making growth more inclusive, to reducing income inequality, thereby making growth more sustainable. Women can be game changers.

To actualise this potential, the focus must be on empowering women in general, education, easing entry into the workforce and providing support to balance work and family. While schooling is a fundamental right for all, more must be done to reduce the dropout rate among girls and help them complete full 12 years of schooling. Improved access to schools, and better sanitation are essential to achieve this goal. Labour markets should be more flexible — easing the move from the informal to the formal sector. Financial inclusion and improved access to credit will allow women to pursue economic opportunities.

The gendered privileging of women in raising families must give way to participative effort by both parents, who should both be eligible for childcare leave. Government, policymakers and workplaces must work together to provide affordable and high quality childcare. The government’s “beti bachao, beti padhao” campaign must move beyond slogans to empowerment in practice. Popular culture must change, not just state policy."

Will Ahmed Patel’s Rajya Sabha victory change equations within the Congress?,"By Neeraj Chowdhury

Never in recent times has an election to the Rajya Sabha seen so much drama and political parties in a state of convulsion as this week’s re-election of Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, to the Rajya Sabha. The reason for such excitement was that it was made into a prestige issue by both the BJP and the Congress.

In normal due course, the seat from Gujarat, held by the Congress, should have gone to Patel, given that till three weeks ago, the party was comfortably placed with 57 MLAs. When voting took on Wednesday, it was left with 42 MLAs, 15 having jumped ship, not a very happy omen for the Grand Old Party.

Patel has to thank JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav for ensuring him the support of the party’s lone MLA, despite Nitish Kumar’s recent return to the NDA fold. That shows that Kumar’s writ runs in Bihar, but not in other states. The other Sharad, Pawar, of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), in his inimitable style, managed to strike the ‘middle path’, with one MLA voting for the BJP and the other for Patel.

It was a do-or-die battle for Patel. A defeat meant walking into the sunset for a man who was the UPA’s mover and shaker for ten years and ran the Congress system for Sonia Gandhi. It would have led to the collapse of an already demoralised Congress, particularly in assembly poll-going Gujarat later this year and beyond.

BJP president Amit Shah walking into the Rajya Sabha and Patel walking out would have had its own message: an unstoppable BJP on the ascent and the sun setting on the Congress empire. This would have hastened the rush of fence-sitters into the BJP all over the country.

Patel scraped through, thanks only to the disqualification of two Congress MLAs by the Election Commission (EC). The Congress demonstrated its old deft touch in raising a procedural issue, which could not be ignored by the EC.

Celebrations

It is understandable for the Congress wanting to celebrate, given that this is the first piece of good news the party has had in three years apart from the Punjab assembly polls victory in March. And yet, it is also symptomatic of the Congress’ current crisis — of clutching at straws without addressing the core issues.

The party still has to squarely face the reasons for its successive defeats, and why it hasn’t put correctives in place. Senior Congressman Jairam Ramesh’s critique a day before the poll was dead on: the Congress is facing ‘existentialist’, as opposed to ’electoral’ crises — even as the timing of his interview was curious.

But the points Ramesh raised warrant brainstorming, instead of the usual attempt by other Congressmen to push the issue under the carpet, especially now after Patel’s win.

The Gujarat Rajya Sabha poll has demonstrated that senior Congressmen and state satraps can fight, and even win, battles — when they set their minds to it, particularly if pushed to the wall — be it Ahmed Patel, Amarinder Singh, Siddharamaiah, or BS Hooda.

Power Balance

The Patel victory will change the power balance in the Congress, with the old guard reasserting its authority.

The empire can be expected to strike back. Will it lead to the continuation of Sonia Gandhi as the party chief till 2019, instead of Rahul Gandhi taking over in October?

Whether or not he takes over as party president, it will be that much more difficult for Rahul now to sideline Patel — and the system he represents.

The Patel victory also shows that the Congress still retains (at least the remnants of) the killer instinct for which it was once known. And that it has not completely lost its old touch, for which it was known as the party of ‘Raj kaaj’, to manage things even in adverse situations.

It would be premature to conclude that this result could make a difference to the outcome of the forthcoming assembly polls in the state in December. But it can give new heart to Congress workers, particularly in Gujarat.

While it is true that Rajya Sabha elections are about MLAs voting, and need not reflect sentiments on the ground, it is a fact that in the last ten years, the Congress has shown a lack of will to pluck the low-hanging fruit called Gujarat. Patel’s victory may trigger a will to fight and win.

Will it dent the infallible image that BJP president Amit Shah has come to acquire, since the party and the man put everything in winning this contest? His ‘defeat’ may make some people in the BJP happy. But Shah, given his track record, has shown a tendency to bounce back with greater vigour after setbacks, something that was evident in the way he set about winning elections after the BJP’s Bihar defeat.

‘Operation Rajya Sabha’ will go on to strengthen Ahmed Patel, and the Congress’ old guard. To that extent it will contain Rahul Gandhi.

But the party’s turnaround will take a lot more than a Rajya Sabha victory, no matter how high profile the candidate and how bitterly it was fought — and won."

CPL's greatest challenge - commercial viability

The upshot is that, in each of its four years, the CPL has made a loss. The league expects to make one this year too, although the deficit is closing. Picture credit: CPL. © WICB

The heaving stadiums, which many feared were obsolete, have returned to the West Indies: the Caribbean Premier League's great gift to West Indies cricket. But what it has not yet translated into is a league that is economically viable.

In its fifth season, the CPL's greatest challenge remains commercial. Of all the T20 franchise leagues in the world, the CPL is uniquely encumbered with a small and economically deprived market. The time difference means that night matches take place in the early hours in both England and India; when the CPL experimented with matches starting in the morning, to suit these markets, the result was disastrous - in the working week, even free tickets could not fill the ground, and the atmosphere was utterly out of kilter with the CPL's mantra of being ""the biggest party in sport"". The sheer logistical difficulties of getting between different Caribbean islands - often the only flights between islands are via Miami - are a further complication. And then there is the international schedule, which not merely restricts the overseas talent available but also deprives the league of some of the best Caribbean cricketers: 15 players are currently in England preparing for the Test series.

The upshot is that, in each of its four years, the CPL has made a loss. The league expects to make one this year too, although the deficit is closing. The CPL has used new media - like streaming games live on Facebook in the UK and, perhaps more importantly given the time difference, pushing smaller clips to be absorbed around the world during and after games. But ultimately perhaps the most compelling answer for the CPL to become profit-making lies in expansion: not within the Caribbean itself, but beyond it.

All of which explains why a sultry Wednesday night in south Florida brought the incongruous sight of Kane Williamson delivering the ceremonial first pitch at a Miami Marlins baseball game: part of the CPL's attempts, along with a children's coaching clinic held by the Jamaica Tallawahs, to grow the American market, and build interest ahead of four CPL matches over the weekend.

Yet the games were no triumph. After a vibrant atmosphere on Saturday - 5,200, more than attended the Marlins game earlier in the week - Sunday brought a distantly underwhelming crowd barely into four figures. It was too hot for most fans to sit outside all day - and floodlights were too costly to hire, so the games could not be played at night, as they were last year. The pitch was too stodgy, so they were barely more runs over each day's double-header than the 489 when India played West Indies in a T20I in Lauderhill last year. Jamaican Independence Day, on Sunday, provided another competition attraction. And having the same teams playing each other at the same time in consecutive days, while Trinidad & Tobago's side, the biggest draw, did not visit the US (they did not want to lose a home game) added to the underwhelming feel.

At $65 for a day, the tickets were far too expensive, as CPL organisers privately admitted. When added to an exorbitant parking fee of $25, the lingering impression it created was an event designed to monetise existing cricket fans in the US rather than engage new ones, in the way that the NFL has done to great effect in the UK.

""We were let down,"" said Renny, a Guyanese IT consultant from New Jersey. ""People who are diehards will accept bullshit. But I'm not a diehard cricket fan. I'm used to going to an event that's elevated. To me it's like a scam. It shouldn't happen. I don't think I'll come back next year - and I'm the fan you want, somebody who's just getting into the game that really liked what they saw last time, and was hoping for the same or better this time. I'm not willing to pay a ticket to get let down again. It's supposed to get better, not worse. And this is general consensus - everybody I spoke to said they felt like they got robbed. It was done poorly on so many levels.""

While the trip to Florida was far less successful than last year, it still felt like a harbinger of the league's future: not so much the Caribbean Premier League, as the Americas League. The CPL mandates that each franchise drafts an ICC Americas player, a development initiative for Associate cricketers unmatched by any other other men's league. When the CPL was launched, the number of teams was kept at six - intentionally creating room to expand, to eight, in the future. The small Caribbean market does not offer any great scope for growth. But the possibilities in North America - both in the US and Canada - are tantalising, as long as the mistakes of 2017's CPL matches are not repeated.

In a cut-throat sporting world, mid-sized leagues are swiftly embracing how international expansionism, across not just countries but continents, offers the best chance of remaining relevant against the behemoth competitions. Super Rugby, the southern hemisphere rugby union league, expanded to include teams from Argentina and Japan last year. Already in 2017, a side from Toronto has joined the English rugby league pyramid - with others from Montreal and Philadelphia being lined up. Pro12, the European rugby competition which has existed in the shadow of the English and French leagues, is about to welcome two new teams from South Africa, with two more from the USA mooted to join in 2018.

Perhaps this points to the future for T20 leagues existing in the shadows of the Big Bash and IPL. And so, for the CPL, playing regular season matches in Florida for a loss can really be considered a downpayment on the league getting a team in the US too. Exactly where it would get one remains unclear: Lauderhill has the facilities but is not ideally located; New York is ideally located but does not have the facilities; a team travelling around the US, playing at a mixture of Lauderhill and grounds leased from elsewhere, could be another option. In Canada, Toronto has both the facilities and the location.

In 2020, the CPL hopes to welcome two new teams - one from the US, and another in Toronto - which might offer it the best prospects of being commercially viable. The ICC believe there are 15 million cricket fans in the US alone, three times the number in the West Indies; if a reasonable proportion of these can engage in the CPL, its commercial viability would be transformed - not only would the league organisers make money, but franchises would have more cash to afford the globe's best talent.

The market for T20 leagues already appears saturated; whether it is really possible to sustain leagues in 11 months a year - in 2017, only June will lack a competition - let alone with each making money, is a question that the sport will grapple with in the coming years. For the CPL ultimate success will rest on whether it can shift from being a Caribbean league to an international one, and do so without losing its distinctiveness. Other sports leagues expanding into North America provide inspiration - but the struggles of the weekend emphasises the extent of the challenge ahead.

"This Shotputter Has Nerves Of Steel, Wins World Championship Despite Having A Groin Tear","Newly crowned world shotput champion Tomas Walsh won the title in London despite a large tear in his groin. The injury will limit his outings for the rest of the season. Walsh's World Championships gold medal was the first ever for a man from New Zealand and the 25-year-old said he had been battling the groin injury when he threw 22.03 metres to clinch it on Monday.

afp

""I've got a seven centimetre tear in my groin, and that pretty much means some time off from competing to rehab and repair,"" Walsh told Fairfax Media on Thursday.

afp

""I've got some training to do in the next wee while to test out if it's any good or not, and we'll go from there.""

The Rio Olympics bronze medallist suffered the injury in his final training session before he went out to top qualifying with a season best throw of 22.14m.

The Christchurch-based builder was limping noticeably after winning the title and said he would need a scan to determine the extent of the injury.

afp

He had the scan in Britain on Wednesday and said he would now have to adjust his schedule as he sought a lucrative payday in the Diamond League.

""I'm meant to be doing five comps, but I will now not be able to do all five,"" he added.

""My first competition may be touch and go for the Birmingham Diamond League on August 20 but I will definitely be able to compete in Zagreb (Aug. 29) and the Diamond League final in Brussels (Sept. 1).""

Walsh is second in the Diamond League on 14 points behind American Olympic champion Ryan Crouser, who leads on 24, with the overall winner of the series pocketing $50,000.

Walsh earned $60,000 by winning the world title and said any additional prize money would be a big factor in keeping him going throughout the year.

""There is a long time between drinks, so to speak,"" he said.

""It is a costly business I'm in. I'm lucky that I get supported by the government pretty well and by Athletics NZ.

"WhatsApp Will Soon Let You Send & Receive Money From Within The App, With UPI Support Built In","The next time your buddy has to send you a chat reminding you to pay him for the drinks he covered the other night, you'll be able to do that without even exiting the app. That’s because WhatsApp is introducing an online payment feature built right into the app.

WABetaInfo first spotted that the new beta version of WhatsApp contains a hidden mention for a payment feature implementation. What’s more, the message screenshot indicates the platform will actually be using UPI, India’s Unified Payment Interface.

If the information is correct, transactions through WhatsApp will be some of the easiest ever. UPI works instantaneously, like IMPS protocol, and uses a virtual payment address linked through your Aadhaar-registered bank account. That means you’ll just need your unique code, and not your account number and IFSC.

Additionally, Ajay Kumar, the additional secretary for the Ministry of Electronics and IT, tweeted a few days ago what seems to be confirmation of this news.

Proposed @WhatsApp payment system in India to be powered by @NPCI_BHIM app. — Ajay Kumar (@drajaykumar_ias) August 6, 2017

Other messaging apps have already introduced their own forms of in-app payments, but WhatsApp is by far the most popular choice in India. Additionally, using the home-grown UPI platform will not only draw users proud to use the system, but may also turn out to be convenient. Of course, we’ll only know for sure whether it’s actually better than current payment methods, if and when the feature launches.

Lessons from Gujarat Rajya Sabha results,"One would think that it was not a Rajya Sabha election, the stuff that Upper House seats are made of, but a presidential style war. And yet there it was: Congressman Ahmed Patel contesting the Gujarat seat with the BJP’s Balwant Singh Rajput. One can be forgiven for not really recognising Rajput’s name. But that was exactly the point: pitting ‘VIP Congress’ Patel, not political advisor to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, but her political secretary against just any other name — and winning. What was a pocket borough walkover for Patel, ended up being a Usain Bolt-Justin Gatlin spectator sport that the nation forced itself to watch because so much was at stake.

Why so much was at stake, of course, has to do with BJP president Amit Shah’s decision to make practice of that adage, ‘The personal is political’. Stopping Patel’s reentry into Rajya Sabha was going to be a sub-plot in the ‘Congress-Mukht Bharat’ narrative. Which, frankly, boils down to ridding national politics, for starters, of dynastic rule. But technicalities have always been the Congress’ strong point, a genuine political virtue that comes with being the Grand Old Party of India, and something that the Grand New Party can, and will, learn from. Two disqualifications, and no matter how much the BJP leadership huffed and puffed at the door of the Election Commission, Patel saved face.

It is not so much important as to what we learnt from this Gujarati version of the Gunfight at OK Corall. It is important to know what the two gunslingers learnt. For the BJP, the defeat is a reminder that smugness can make the ball of wool tightly knit unravel and create knots that aparty, even in such a position in both Houses and the lay of the land, cannot afford to ignore. For the Congress, the lesson is trickier. After its rightful celebration, the truth must sink in that even pocket boroughs are liable to be picked. That means not taking ‘legacy’ for granted. If this contest was a mountain made out of a molehill, then it is a molehill worth observing for the lessons it imparts. Assembly elections in Gujarat are coming."

Sanjay Dutt Doesn’t Want To Hide Anything But Hopes His Biopic Doesn’t Display His Love Life,"The trailer of Sanjay Dutt’s comeback film Bhoomi is out and the actor is, for sure, back with a thunder in his Khalnayak avatar. The spellbinding trailer is already giving goosebumps to his fans, amid the excitement for his biopic which will reveal the life story of the actor.

Ranbir Kapoor, who is playing the titular role in the biopic had admitted in the past that the movie is not an attempt to show him as a god, but will reveal all the highs as well as the lows of his life.

Now, Sanjay has also made a confession about the Rajkumar Hirani directorial. He says that he doesn’t fear that his life story will be shown to people and the whole world will know it. He says he has nothing to hide. But at the same time, he hopes that his love life is not shown in the movie.

""I was not skeptical at all because Raju, me and Abhijaat sat for many many hours and I played the cards right out in front of them. I've got nothing to hide and I have never had nothing to hide.""

MacGill confirmed as Bangladesh spin coach,"NEW JOB

MacGill confirmed as Bangladesh spin coach

Atif Azam • Last updated on Thu, 10 Aug, 2017, 03:38 PM

Bangladesh Cricket Board have confirmed roping in former Australia legspinner Stuart MacGill as their spin coach and now they are waiting for his arrival, subject to him obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Cricket Australia.

BCB president Nazmul Hasan earlier had said that they have chosen Macgill as their spin consultant for a period of three months and was keen to see him working with the boys before the start of the two-match Test series against Australia, scheduled to start from August 27.

Nazmul had announced the decision after the meeting of board of directors at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on July 30 as they scrutinised the shortlist of spin coaches who showed willingness to work with the Bangladesh national side. MacGill will replace Ruwan Kalpage.

Kalpage was sacked last year as he refused to arrive on time and from then onwards BCB was working to rope in someone to work with the slow bowlers. According to BCB cricket operation chairman Akram Khan they are not sure whether they can have the services of Macgill before the start of the upcoming series against Australia but are confident it won't take too long for him to arrive.

""We have confirmed MacGill,"" Akram told Cricbuzz, on Wednesday (August 9), when he was asked about the development regarding MacGill's appointment. ""We are waiting for him to get his NOC from CA.

""Even if we don't get him before the series against Australia we are sure we will have him in our dressing as soon as he obtains the required documents to work here.""

MacGill has been regarded as one of the unluckiest players that the world of cricket has seen so far. Despite having enormous talent he could never become a regular in the Australian team because of the presence of legendary leg-spinner Shane Warne in the same era. As a coach, MacGill has no experience till date apart from mentoring some spinners in Australia.

BCB said that they would give MacGill a long term contract after observing the team's progress under his supervision and after consulting for how long he is willing to continue with the team.

ET Now,"Sorry, this content is not available in your country"
The Eternal Quest,"Many aspirants begin their spiritual journey with great enthusiasm but somewhere along the way, they slow down or get confused. GURUDEVSHRI RAKESHBHAI says the pause helps you scrutinise your religious activities and understand your true intentions



Pursuit of liberation begins with a desire for it.However, one wonders if man has the genuine desire for it.He is easily satisfied doing a few religious activities, and although he expects liberation, he lacks a genuine desire for it. Generally, one eats food when one feels hungry. But in our modern-day pseudo-lifestyle, meal times are fixed. You never ask the body whether it is hungry or not.You know it is time to eat, so you eat. Such ‘hunger’ can be false. Mere thinking about mealtimes can make you falsely believe that you are hungry. Try this experiment.Ask someone at home to turn the clock to make it an hour early so it shows 1 pm, your regular mealtime, when it is actually noon. Looking at the clock, you will spontaneously feel hungry! Now, try making it an hour late so it shows noon when it is actually 1 pm. On that day, you will feel hungry later! If looking at the clock determines your hunger,your hunger is artificial;it is not real.It is only a mental need,not physical.In the same way,religious activities without a yearning for liberation are only mental demands, not the need of the soul; they are emotional outbursts triggered by external circumstances.



You Want Both



Dig a little deeper into your desire for light and you will realise that you want both, the illumination of enlightenment and the darkness of worldliness. On the one hand, you say you don’t need the world, that you want only the bliss of the soul.Yet, for happiness, you run towards the world. In short, you don’t wish to become free from darkness, yet you wait for illumination to happen. Don’t you realise that without wanting to remove the darkness,you cannot light your lamp? First, realise that you actually want darkness alone.You have always hoped to acquire joy from darkness alone and fear that illumination will shatter your dream world.You love worldliness alone, yet you believe, and make others believe that you want liberation. You speak of liberation but to become happy, instead of bringing changes in yourself, you try changing the world.You speak of liberation only to comfortably live in the world. How will you light the lamp if you are so attached to darkness? Even if someone tries to light it for you, you soon blow it out.Even when someone shows compassion towards you, it does not make a difference.You are in love with darkness and wish to live in that alone. Enlightened ones have showered compassion upon you in the past.The sun itself has come knocking at your door, but you choose to hide in your darkness.You know that with light,your desire and hope from darkness will be destroyed. So you fear light.As long as you have even a bit of inclination to acquire from darkness,you will not let the lamp be illumined. You are so dishonest that you are not ready to accept the way you are.You do not want to accept that, ‘I want to live in darkness alone. I want happiness from worldly objects and events.’You join those who speak about light and show how interested you are in it, but you want to live in darkness alone. If you accept that you are merely talking about light and are not really interested in it,one can find a way out.You love darkness but you want to show that you are a lover of light.You can’t give up your attraction of being called religious for there is reputation and honour associated with it. Your attraction for this honour linked with religiousness makes you start pretending to be religious.You actually use religion to hide your flaws.Showing aspiration for illumination,you continue to hide your delusion. Your cry for light is merely to hide your passion for darkness.There is no inner transformation. You still want to make changes in the outside to gain joy and peace. There were two friends fishing on the banks of a lake. Seeing the lake-supervisor approach, one of the friends started running.The supervisor chased him, caught him after a mile and a half and said,“You will be prosecuted for fishing without a fishing licence.”The man immediately took out his licence from his pocket and showed it to the supervisor.The supervisor was surprised and said, “If you had the licence, why did you run?”The man said,“I had the licence, but my friend didn’t!” This man ran far away from the spot so that his friend could escape and hide.The same thing happens in your mental world.To conceal your wrong inclinations,you act pious.This is the ‘benefit’ of being ‘religious’ without truly yearning for liberation! No one will doubt you. If you want transformation, catch your desires. Go to their roots. Start accepting your flaws.That is the first step towards liberation.



Stop Self-deception



Many approach me for learning how to meditate because they want inner peace. But they show no enthusiasm in fulfilling the conditions necessary for meditation. Only a true customer is ready to pay the price, for he knows the real value of liberation.If you want liberation without paying its price, you are a beggar asking,‘teach me meditation, give me satsang, show me the means.’ But when it comes to putting anything at stake, you withdraw. You complain that ‘I have a lot of difficulties.Once everything is set,I will begin the pursuit of liberation.’Amidst the chase for wealth,power, family, status, reputation, you are stranded. Stop deceiving yourself — if you genuinely desired liberation,you would have given up everything and worked for liberation alone.



Turn Within



Only when you turn within, you experience bliss. A mind wandering outside can never be happy or peaceful. It gets sorrow wherever it goes. In spite of wealth,status,relations you have remained unhappy and wounded within. As long as you are living with the belief that,‘I will get happiness from the other’,you will remain sorrowful.Happiness is your nature, so by focusing within and staying steady within, you will experience it. If happiness were to come from the other,why haven’t you found it till now? Many times you have extended your begging bowl in front of others, and sometimes had some good fortune too,yet,why have you not been happy? Don’t you realise that those you beg from are beggars themselves, begging from you and others? If indeed they had happiness,why would they demand from you? All in the world are asking for happiness, yet no one is seen receiving it because asking itself is a mistake. By asking,you continue being outside. You forget that what you are asking is your own inherent nature.What is missing is identification with it. Turn towards the Source,your true Self, for happiness is religion; to turn outwards for happiness is being irreligious. None have ever gained happiness from outside, and those who have turned within have never failed to experience bliss.Even though their ways have been different — some by dancing, some by sitting in meditation,some through devotion and some through knowledge, but the direction was the same,for their destination was the same, the Self.Where there is forgetfulness of the Self, there is suffering.Where there is awareness of the Self, there is bliss. By remaining outside, you will gain nothing, and by turning within, nothing will remain to gain.

"How to kiss so that it leads to hot, steamy sex","A kiss works as a precursor to sex. A hot, steamy, make-your-knees-weak, make-you-dissolve-like-Klimt’s-famed-The Kiss-painting kiss is the precursor to some oh-my-gawd-there-there-there-ooooooooooh kind of sex.

Without tantalising you further, here’s how to kiss so that he knows there’s going to be some seriously sizzling sex coming up next:



Be the initiator: There is nothing that turns a guy on more than a woman who takes control and has her way with him. Initiate the kiss by pressing your lips onto his and making him respond to you. While your lips get busy, let your hands rove over his body. And moan. You’ll activate an arousal in milliseconds.



Open wide: Your goal is a long, wet French kiss, but tease him before you get there. Open your mouth gradually. Get him hot and bothered before you open wide and let his tongue in. Sit in his lap in cowgirl position, so you’re on top of him and he’s at your mercy. Kiss his lower lip and move to his upper before opening your mouth and letting your tongue meet his more-than-eager one.



Be aggressive (with your tongue): Let your tongue be in the thick of the action. Do all the talking by slipping it into his mouth and letting it roll over his, clockwise, then counter-clockwise. Play tongue hockey and tease him by withdrawing and starting over. Nibble on his lip, preferably the juicier, thicker one, before you slip your tongue in again. By now, all his signals will be green and he’ll be raring to have rip-your-clothes-off, all-night-long sex.

What Does Halle Berry Do To Look 30 At The Age Of 50? She Follows A Ketogenic Diet,"Halle Berry has always been a sight for sore eyes because of her elegance, grace and good looks; both on and off the screen. Over 50 years old now, she still doesn’t look a day older than 30!

iskandarx.blogspot.in

So what’s Berry’s secret? She swears by a ketogenic diet!

This essentially means she’s learnt to live without carbs and sugar and live off healthy fats, like the ones you get in avocados, coconut oil and eggs. Your body learns to burn fat instead of sugar or carbs and eventually your fat burns off your body, according to Madamenoire.

Me when someone says ""I'm coming over and I've got snacks."" A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry) on Mar 30, 2017 at 2:12pm PDT

""I try to eat four small meals a day. I like to feel strong and healthy,"" Berry tells Women & Home South Africa. ""I started to eat loads of wonderful fresh vegetables, chicken, fresh fish, and pasta. I cut out red meat and cut back on fruit because it can contain quite a lot of sugar,"" she tells Daily Mail UK.

She also talks about how sugar is like poison for your system and your skin and how avoiding it helps as a natural anti-aging secret!

“I use Xylitol as a sugar substitute and give it to my daughter. It’s rough though because she’s at a friend’s birthday party every other month and there are all these wonderful birthday cakes so I don’t deprive her of that. I strongly believe in talking about nutrition at an early age and setting a good example,” believes Berry as stated in Marie Claire UK.

“It's a lot harder than it used to be [she laughs]. As I get older, I am more conscious of what I eat. That's not to say I won't have a glass of red wine occasionally—it's my guilty pleasure. [If I do], I make sure the rest of my meals that day are clean and healthy: lots of vegetables; no bread … and lots of water,” she tells L.A. Times.

She doesn’t usually work out with a trainer but trains religiously every day, no matter what!

“When my work schedule permits, sometimes I work out with a female trainer. No matter what, every day I exercise for at least 30 minutes,” she tells L.A. Times. “I have never worked out with a lot of weights unless I had to for a film role. Left to my own devices, I just do cardio. I do exercises that involve my own body weight because I never want to get too muscly,” adds Berry.

She focuses on bodyweight style training and not weight training and mixes it with yoga and pilates to maintain a lean and tender muscle tone. She also mixes it up her routine every three to six months in order to trick her body so her workouts continue to remain effective, according to Madamenoire.

“Her abs look amazing,” says Nat Bardonet her trainer who focuses on training her abs three times a week during their 30-minute training sessions, as stated in People.

“The way I push Halle, not many people would be able to last,” says Bardonnet. “She always has great energy and a great smile,” adds Bardonet. “She always stuns me how beautiful and sexy she looks. Whatever curveball I throw at her, she can take.”

But her transformation is not a recent on, as she made some dramatic changes as a 19 years old when she was diagnosed with diabetes.

“I try to do my part as a role model, by openly talking about it, what I’ve gone through, how I handle it in my life…I hope I’m getting the message out there—that it’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Berry tells the Inquirer.

“I got diagnosed with diabetes at 19. I just have a healthy diet, and I always exercise. As I’m getting older, that kind of attention to my health is paying off. I only work out three times a week, 30 minutes a pop,” adds Berry. “I am diabetic, so exercising has always been a part of managing my disease and keeping my sugars under control,” she tells L.A.

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."

Inputs From Reuters"
Is It Time For RBI To Do An Operation Twist?,"Dr Y V Reddy as Reserve Bank of India governor had many run-ins with the government. One such prominent event was when he articulated the usefulness of Tobin Tax to temper overseas fund flows.

In an unprecedented move, the then Finance Minister, P Chidambaram, forced the governor to recall his speech and clarify that no such proposal was on the horizon. That was January 12, 2005.

The flow of US dollars fuelled asset prices across the board – from real estate, to stocks, to commodities, to precious metals. That lulled corporates into believing easy money is forever. When the tide turned those with dollar liabilities were whipsawed.

Within a few years of tackling the problem of plenty with the Greenback during Reddy’s tenure, the country quickly moved to scarcity under Governor Duvvuri Subbarao in 2013. Subbarao and his successor, Raghuram Rajan, worked overtime to arrest the collapse of the rupee and come up with yet another special scheme to bring in US dollars.

Come 2017, life at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appears to have come a full circle. Yet again, it is a problem of plenty. The foreign exchange reserves are at a record high of $393 billion. The RBI has purchased about $50 billion from the market this year — both from the spot as well as the forward markets — to slow currency appreciation.

But that’s not helping.

Despite the Federal Reserve’s U-turn to normalisation, the US dollar tide doesn’t appear to be turning anytime soon. Contrary to textbook economics, which says that a reduction in interest rate will lead to a fall in the value of a currency, the Indian rupee rose to a two-year high when the Monetary Policy Committee cut the benchmark interest rate last week.

Something is amiss. India’s current high real interest rate of about 4 per cent along with its prudent policies of inflation targeting, and a tight fiscal policy, are drawing yieldhungry global investors.

Overseas investors net bought Indian stocks and bonds worth a record Rs 1.75 lakh crore in 2017. The fact that global investors have almost exhausted their limits of Rs 4.32 lakh crore in both sovereign and corporate debt indicate how lucrative it is to own Indian fixed-income instruments.

The trust of global investors may be a matter of pride for an emerging economy like India, but it may be sowing the seeds of financial instability that poses challenges to Governor Urjit Patel, and make importers complacent, while creating anxious moments for exporters.

“An independent inflation targeting monetary policy does have implications for the FX market and capital flows,” says Ananth Narayan, head of markets for ASEAN and South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.

“Among other reasons, perceived high rupee returns may be one of the reasons for the current rupee outperformance. Foreign portfolio flows are coming in, and looking at the perceived high interest-rate differentials, more exporters may be hedging than importers.”

When the currency surges 6.2 per cent and capital flow is liberal, being a central banker with a mandate to control inflation with interest rate alone, is like getting thrown into the boxing ring with hands tied.

Economists in general call it the impossible trinity – an autonomous monetary policy, free capital movement, and exchange rate management.

The current record low inflation of 1.54 per cent is abnormal for an emerging country like India. RBI’s inflation mandate is forcing it to keep interest rate high with uncertainties like global financial risks when the impact of slow tightening by the Fed begins to pinch and commodity prices and crude turn.

The RBI can lower short-term rates, but keep longer term rates high to face uncertainties.

While the limits on bond holdings may stop the flow into fixed-income instruments as we know, trust the market to find a way to circumvent it. The RBI may have to get bring down short-term interest rates, but keep the long tenor high to match its fear of uncertainties — from revival of price pressures, to global financial market turmoil.

Dr Reddy may not be the ideal guide here for Patel, but he can borrow from former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke’s book. To help Main Street benefit from his loose monetary policy, Bernanke launched his ‘Operation Twist’. He lowered yield on long-tenor securities by buying them with the sale proceeds of short-term notes. Patel can conduct an ‘Operation Twist’ in reverse."
Are white lies okay for your relationship?,"It goes without saying that honesty is a cornerstone of any relationship. Ideally, there should be no secrets between partners. But white lies can be acceptable too. By definition, white lies are generally told out of politeness or to prevent someone from getting hurt by the truth. Of course care must be taken that you are lying for the right reason, depending on the situation. Here are some reasons why white lies might be permissible in the following cases:

"Korean flashpoint: Avoid dangerous escalation of rhetoric, manage Pyongyang through talks and containment","With the war of words sharpening between North Korea and the US – Pyongyang has threatened to launch pre-emptive strikes against the American territory of Guam, while President Donald Trump has vowed to rain fire and fury if the North doesn’t stop threatening his country – tensions in East Asia have risen several notches. This comes in the wake of the UN Security Council imposing new sanctions on North Korea that could slash its $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. North Korea and the US are caught in a classic security dilemma, where each side sees the other as a threat and mutually feeds anxieties.

It’s a mistake to see the North Korean side as totally irrational: given its one-party Stalinist system with a supreme leader, and having very few resources, it’s easy to see why such a regime would fear being overrun by superior South Korean and American forces. North’s Kim Jong-un has seen what happened to other dictators like Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi. Therefore it’s extremely unlikely that Pyongyang will abandon its nuclear programme, which it sees as its only guarantor of security.

However, this doesn’t mean its nuclear and missile programmes can’t be capped through sanctions and incentives. After all Islamabad behaves much worse than Pyongyang does, yet the world responds to it with forbearance and aid: it not only engages in nuclear sabre rattling (like North Korea), it also exports terror to neighbouring countries (which North Korea doesn’t). In North Korea’s case, US secretary of state Rex Tillerson has said that dialogue is possible if Pyongyang halts missile launches. China should be persuaded to pressure Kim to take up the offer. Pyongyang must be managed through a mix of talks and containment, without escalating rhetoric that might spiral into war and all-out destruction."
Indian Railways is headed towards a bleak future,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a soft corner for Indian Railways. His early association with railways is well known. What is perhaps not widely known is that when he visits his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, he opts to stay in the Railway Guest House.

“As the Prime Minister, I can stay somewhere else but I prefer the Railway Guest House as it gives a feel of belonging,” he told a group of railway officials last year.

This sense of belonging, however, stops short of extending support for railways in one of its most challenging phases.

A look at a parliamentary standing committee report on railways, which was finalized by BJP’s Ganesh Singh, shows that railways may have a bleak future.

For long, railways has suffered on account of incoherent policies. The incoherence in policymaking remains intact in the Modi era too.

Freight remains the mainstay of railways’ revenue. Within freight, coal is the most important commodity that is moved around the country.

According to the parliamentary standing committee report, on average railways runs up a cost of Rs 0.99 per 10 kilometers but charges its customers Rs 1.60. This surplus is used to cross-subsidize passenger traffic where the average cost is Rs 0.73 per 10 kilometers against a charge of Rs 0.36.

This economic model rests on railways’ being able to protect its freight business.

Last year, railways’ performance in freight business was below par. Not only is it pricing itself out of business in order to meet its obligations to transport passengers, recent changes in government policy have not helped.

This is where the incoherence which characterizes economic policy makes matters worse. Power plants, which are the main consumers of coal, are now encouraged to locate themselves close to coal mines to reduce their costs. It certainly makes sense from the standpoint of a power plant, but what does it do to the railways?

Here, another recent development harms railways.

After 93 years, the railway budget was merged with the main budget this year. One of the consequences, as pointed out in standing committee report, is that operating losses incurred by railways on strategic lines and lines in hilly, coastal and backward areas will not be reimbursed to them.

This is very odd. Railways will not be allowed to conduct operations that make sense from a commercial standpoint. That is fair enough if their role is seen as something that goes beyond narrow commercial considerations. This automatically means that government should reimburse them for some of their work. However, it appears that the government is disinclined to do so which makes for a bleak future.

Prime Minister Modi should therefore consider the following suggestion from the parliamentary standing committee:

“Sufficient gross budgetary support should be provided to railways every year keeping in view their various socio-economic commitments including strategic lines.”"

"Apple's iPhone 8 May Cost You Over 1 Lac, But That's Good News Even If You Can't Buy It","If you’ve seen any of the leaks surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8, you know it sounds like a one heck of a device. No bezels, face scan unlock, better cameras, wireless charging, and the standard sexy lines and curves you’ve come to expect from an iPhone. Of course, if you want to actually buy the device, you may be in for a rude awakening.

In the past, the latest iPhone has always been priced starting at around $650 in the US, including the last iPhone 7. That translated to a launch price of Rs 60,000 in India, once the device crossed the ocean. Instead, if rumours are to be believed, the iPhone 8 is more likely to be priced somewhere in the range of $1,200 (approximately Rs 76,500) That means, if you're sitting here in India and expect to grab the new flagship on launch day, you can expect to fork over more than a lakh for Apple's device. Yes, that’s a heck of a lot more. However, it may not be all gloom and doom for you Apple fans.

Think about all the stuff you’ve seen in iPhones over the years. Apple was the first to develop a touchscreen device that was music player, mobile phone and Internet device rolled into one. It’s camera innovations like True Tone flash and Live Photos have driven forward smartphone imaging, and it pioneered the concept of an app store, as did Android, in 2008. For all of that innovation to happen, companies need to have the resources necessary, and be at the top of their game.

Apple is already there, a multi-billion dollar corporation that’s clearly a luxury brand. By pricing the iPhone 8 at over a thousand dollars or more than a lakh -- as it's rumoured to do, it clearly becomes a premium product, a device for only the elite. And yet, it’s still just about within reach for some of you willing to pay the EMIs. That way, you feel a sense of pride in being a part of this elite club. You may want the latest iPhone, and there’s nothing wrong with that. And even if you could upgrade to the still desirable iPhone 7s or 7s Plus strongly rumoured to be released alongside the iPhone 8, that's still great.

But even if you don’t buy the new iPhone, you should be glad knowing someone’s willing to shell out that amount. Because when that happens, Apple’s sales continue, and it receives the profit margin it’s looking for in order to continue to innovate. I know what some of you are thinking and yes, there are a lot of things Apple has done second to Google’s Android. But sometimes they’ve done it better, and other times even done it first.

Here's why the next iPhone matters very much even for Android users

It's crucial that Apple keeps building what's perceived to be expensive smartphones with fancy features. It's been doing that since Steve Jobs first introduced the original iPhone back in 2007, a pivotal moment in shaping the modern smartphone industry. Because of Apple's allure and the iPhone's perception, it spurs other manufacturers to bring you phones with similar or better features within your budget faster than ever.

After all, your budget phone might be perfect for most people’s needs, but the thirst for the latest features is relentless. That’s why the competition in the premium sphere is fierce, that’s why it’s where the most innovation happens, often at a high initial price. Dual cameras started out in the premium segment, and ever since Apple debuted the iPhone 7 Plus with that feature, competing Android manufacturers rushed out of the block to sell phones with similar feature. That's why now you can get smartphones with that capability for under Rs 20,000.

So take a deep breath, stow away your outrage at the ridiculous price, and remember you’ll eventually benefit from the next Apple iPhone.

India and Pakistan: They got the generals Part 2,"My last blog post argued that while Pakistan got its generals as a ruling class, India got its bureaucrats who overly complicate and mess up things for the rest of us. Look, for example, at India’s new GST structure that was supposed to simplify things. But even sweets can be taxed four ways — from 5% all the way upto 28% — and it’s hard to figure out what tax rate might apply to the particular dessert you have confected.

Plain barfi is taxed at the lowest rate of 5%, but if it happens to have a chocolate layer on top the tax could be 28% (at least that’s what a reading of the rules indicates, although no one knows for sure at this point – see this TOI article). Dhokla makers are quaking lest their product be identified as ‘cake’, and thereby heavily taxed. This is way beyond ridiculous. Layered sweets may be delicious, but a GST this layered ends up as counter-productive.

Our bureaucrats and politicians (like the Brahmins of yore) excel in separating out things into multiple grades, so that they can retain their paramount role in the system (and make a bit of money too) by being the arbiters of what fits into which pigeon-hole. This tendency has prevented India from developing rapidly.

Is there any icing (or chocolate) on this barfi? Since the 1991 reforms India has, in general, been growing faster than rival Pakistan. But Indian per capita income crossed Pakistan’s only about a decade ago; even today it is only 15% above Pakistan’s. India is 141st and Pakistan 147th among 186 countries in terms of per capita income – this is hardly a great lead, particularly given Pakistan’s dire (and self-inflicted) security situation.

Given 70 years of bad history between India and Pakistan, which nobody has been able to resolve so far, the best solution may simply be if the Indian economy does way better than Pakistan’s – in a manner which will make the fruits of cooperation evident even to Pakistani generals (who, after all, have large business interests of their own).

Of course, China is a complicating factor here as it is likely to get in the way of any India-Pakistan rapprochement. But that makes it even more imperative for India to succeed, because China worships GDP growth, and a large part of the reason China looks down on India and refuses to take its concerns seriously is how far ahead it is of India in economic terms."
At Least 100 Million Black Holes Are Hiding Across Our Galaxy & No Scientists Aren't Punking Us,"As astronomers continue to study black holes and their interaction with our universe, a new research paper indicates they may get the chance to do a lot of that in future.

A study by scientists at the University of California, Irvine, suggests there may be many more black holes in our universe than we originally thought; and probably proportionately as many in our own galaxy.

Published by researchers Oliver D Elbert, James S Bullock and Manoj Kaplinghat, the study uses new data on black hole mergers to construct a formula that links the size of a galaxy to the number of black holes it hides. “Based on what we know about star formation in galaxies of different types, we can infer when and how many black holes formed in each galaxy. Big galaxies are home to older stars, and they host older black holes too,” Dr. Elbert said in a press release.

Black holes are usually created as a result of a star collapsing, so it’s only logical that larger galaxies with more high-mass stars would statistically have more black holes than smaller ones. When one star dies and explodes, the nebula it leaves often leads to new stars being formed. However, only stars of a certain minimum size will form a black hole when they die, and our Sun isn’t one of them.

The new model theorised indicates the Milky Way may hold “as many as 100 million black holes,” says Dr Bullock. There are an estimated 100 billion stars in the Milky Way alone, so about one in a thousand of those are black holes.

Think about that the next time you watch Interstellar."

"No acche din soon: Three years into Modi government, economic outlook is still cloudy","There is an important parallel in the challenges faced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government two years before the general election and Narendra Modi’s. In both cases, growth has been sluggish, though formal growth numbers on Modi’s watch have been higher, possibly due to a change in the methodology of calculating GDP. In the Vajpayee era, growth was partly affected by a political decision he took in 1998 to conduct nuclear tests. This led to global sanctions and the economy bore the consequences.

In Modi’s case, the growth retarding political moves involved lighting fires under tax evaders. He demonetised high value notes in November 2016, then pushed GST. We don’t know if tax evaders got singed, but the first measure slowed down an already slowing economy.

The jury is out on ongoing implementation of GST but there is little doubt it will be a huge disruption, with consequences for short term growth. If we assume that the new tax regime will take most of the remaining nine months of fiscal 2017-18 to settle into a fine rhythm – and we are assuming it won’t create a blowout, either politically or economically – we are left with just one year before general elections are held in 2019.

The big question is whether growth can revive even in 2018-19. The bigger question is whether reviving growth in the last year of a government’s tenure will be enough to remind voters that ‘acche din’ are finally here.

That’s another parallel with the Vajpayee years. After struggling with growth from 1998 to 2003 growth took off vertically only in 2003-04, but voters didn’t start experiencing the gains at that point. As a result, the India Shining story didn’t sell. Will the same happen for Modi, with the benefits of growth not being felt till it is too late for the voter to acknowledge it?

The Modi juggernaut has rolled across India largely on the political goodwill and brand power of the prime minister himself, with minor hiccups in 2015 when BJP lost Delhi and Bihar. But the Vajpayee brand was as strong in 2004 as in 1998. That he stood head and shoulders above every other leader didn’t matter when the economy failed to take off for four years.

Will Modi’s charisma, which now looms larger than that of Vajpayee, succeed where Vajpayee’s failed?

There is always a close connection between a voter’s sense of whether her lot is improving and how she votes in general elections. The bad news for Modi and party chief Amit Shah is that there is little possibility of an economic pick-up before 2018-19, and even then one cannot be sure it will be visible to the average voter.

Here’s why the economic outlook looks cloudy even three years after Modi took over.

First, the NDA government’s political focus on going after black money has impacted growth. Two disclosure schemes, one for illegal foreign assets and another for domestic undisclosed incomes, have not yielded any great tax bonanza. Nor has demonetisation. Additionally, the government has closed tax loopholes by renegotiating treaties with Mauritius, Cyprus and Singapore. This has had the net effect of crimping clandestine black money flows. While this is ethically laudable, it has made economic revival slower.

The negative effects of the clampdown on black money are front loaded, while the benefits, in the form of higher tax collections, will be backloaded. The price of a high focus on black money is slower short term growth.

Second, Modi has changed between Gujarat and now. In his previous avatar as chief minister, he was happy to be seen with business and lauded for being business friendly. Not anymore. This is perhaps where Rahul Gandhi’s “suit boot ki sarkar” jibe has had an impact. It has had consequences for growth.

The government has been wary of reviving bank lending by quickly recapitalising them after writing off unrecoverable loans, for fear of being seen as favouring big business. If around Rs 1 lakh crore had been provided for banks in the initial two years, by now bank lending would have been roaring, bringing back the animal spirits of India Inc. Instead, the government has opted for the longer term remedy of forcing the liquidation of bad businesses and seeking a slower resolution of bad loans, now in excess of Rs 7 lakh crore and set to rise even further in 2017-18.

Since the bulk of the recapitalisation will need to be done this year, it means government will have less fiscal muscle to invest in infrastructure and social spending. And if we assume that GST’s first year will involve compensating states for revenue losses, Arun Jaitley’s fiscal math is going to go for a toss. There will be very little headroom for a stimulus.

Third, while the central government itself will be standing firm on not announcing farm loan waivers the states are under no such restraint. Already UP, Punjab, Karnataka and Maharashtra have succumbed to pressure. Chhattisgarh has waived interest on farm loans, and in 2018 (another big election year) one can expect more bounties from MP and Rajasthan.

Put together, the Centre-state fiscal math is set to go out of control once more unless GST delivers an unexpected bonanza. This leaves little room for raising minimum support prices for farmers, making even a limited farm stimulus difficult in 2018-19.

It will need an economic miracle of sorts for the economy to be kicking in favour of a Modi wave in 2019. Growth is unlikely to revive early enough to give him a tailwind."
‘You need to develop relationships across bureaucracy and with private sector to be trusted and effective in India’,"Rakesh Mohan, Distinguished Fellow at Brookings India, has been deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India and secretary in the ministry of finance. He is the editor of ‘India Transformed: 25 Years of Economic Reforms’ and spoke to Sanjiv Shankaran on the debate around expat economists in Indian policymaking, RBI’s inflation targeting regime and economic reform processes:

You believe the push for change in India’s economy came from the bureaucracy and not academia. Why?

That is a remarkable feature of our reform process. In the early 1980s there was little call for change from Indian academics, except for the prescient book by Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai in the 1970s. It is interesting that much of the technocratic call for change came from within. There has been a very interesting interaction between regular IAS civil servants and long-serving economic advisers who have been lateral hires and who then served the government for 20-30 years. They then developed relationships with the rest of the bureaucracy and got trusted. Illustrious examples include IG Patel, Bimal Jalan, Manmohan Singh and Montek Ahluwalia who served many different governments.

How would you distinguish an earlier generation of technocrats hired laterally with the current generation?

They are bright, dedicated economists whether it is Kaushik Basu, Raghuram Rajan, Arvind Panagariya or Arvind Subramanian. They brought in new ideas. The issue that I would have is that it takes time for anyone to become effective in terms of getting to know the system, the issues and also all the personnel in government and outside. You need to develop relationships across bureaucracy and with the private sector as well to be trusted and to be effective.

On one hand, it is a great idea to get such people at the highest levels as advisers. But if they had come at a younger age and served the country for 25-30 years they would have been that much more effective. It seems to me that you need a combination of getting lateral hires who then work their way and contribute on a continuous basis, and others who come as senior advisers at the highest levels for temporary periods.

Didn’t the changeover to inflation targeting happen over an unusually short period in the Indian context?

Raghuram Rajan came (as RBI governor), appointed the Urjit Patel committee which recommended it, as did the FSLRC (Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Committee). The government then implemented it. It didn’t take very long. This was relatively easy to do. It was too technical a subject for public debate.

I don’t agree with inflation targeting as a monetary policy mechanism, not just in India but generally. There is one target, that is, inflation, and one instrument, the policy interest rate. It makes macroeconomics and understanding of macro economy and inflation too simplistic. It almost makes it a hydraulic system. It can also take your sight away from other things that may be happening in the economy. To my mind it also contaminates public discussion. Once there is a simple target and instrument, public discussion becomes about questions of will or won’t they [cut interest rates] as we observe in the frenzied media discussion before every monetary policy meeting now.

Was it any different in your time?

It was totally different. We were not inflation targeting. I think RBI under Governor Bimal Jalan had indeed made a significant innovation in articulating an explicit multiple indicator policy. The point is that given the way an economy works you have to look at a number of different variables at the same time, including growth and financial stability. Remember that this approach delivered low inflation from the mid-1990s till around 2008, along with high growth, financial development and financial stability.

Can economic change in India be only a gradual process?

The answer is yes and no. Look to the precursors of the 1991 reforms. There was a whole set of committees in the 1960s and 1970, particularly to do with the functioning of the licensing system, which were good at identifying problems in the functioning of the system, but they invariably ended up recommending further tightening rather than liberalising the malfunctioning system.

Also, the global backdrop of development thinking right upto the mid-1960s was to do with planning, import substitution etc. Today, when we think of examples of high growth we think of East Asia; in the 1950s it was socialist countries. We were completely, in that sense, consistent with the rest of the world.

The change in global thinking came in the late 1960s and 70s, starting with South Korea and Taiwan. We took much longer and started thinking of change only in the 1980s."

Weed Weddings Are A Thing And Couples Have Started Serving Marijuana Instead Of Booze!,"Here’s a real time-saver if you want your special day to go off as spectacularly as you have imagined, but you don’t have the time to plan every minute detail. You can opt for a weed wedding that can save you a lot of time, money and energy!

herb.co

The legalisation of marijuana in a handful of states and a few countries have paved the way for a new cannabis-laden money making avenue at weddings. The alcoholic beverages and wedding cakes aside, couples are now serving up different strains of cannabis at marijuana bars setups instead of alcohol!

Serving marijuana at wedding receptions is due to become as normal as offering alcoholic. ""It's actually cheaper than liquor,"" says Adrian Sedlin, chief executive officer of Canndescent, a California grower that has put on bud bars for weddings, states a report in Bloomberg.

From bud bouquets to cannabis open bars, legal weed is now a part of weddings https://t.co/wZ5VPEXKJ9 pic.twitter.com/n2o5kVPSv9 — Bloomberg (@business) August 1, 2017

""There's a lot more buzz for the buck in cannabis than in alcohol,"" adds Sedlin. A bud bar typically includes pre-rolled joints, vaporizers and glass pipes. Depending on the couple’s choices they may even end up adding elements like cannabis cocktails to the mix.

nationalviral.com

Specialised businesses, such as Bec Koop have sprung up to cater to the ever-growing demand of weed-weddings in states like Colorado where marijuana has been legally sold since 2014.

Wedding planners Bec Koop who run a cannabis-friendly setup out of Colorado called Irie Wedding & Events and is one of the founding members of the Cannabis Wedding Expo offer a variety of services. These include: day-of coordination, overall planning, floral arrangements, and cannabis open bars, according to Bloomberg.

thedailybeast.com

Koop planned five weed weddings in her first year of business and twice as many in her second year. This year she expects at least two dozen weed-wedding requests this year. ""We have people who are already outreaching to us for 2020,"" she says. ""A lot of foresight coming from these so-called lazy stoners,"" says Koop.

The Cannabis Wedding Expo was setup to give couples ideas about cannabis-themed wedding ideas. The ideas included marijuana-infused edibles, hemp-themed décor, cannabis wedding flavours and much more!

With several states and countries, the latest on being Uruguay, to legalize the consumption of recreational marijuana, it won’t be long before you start spotting folks at wedding donning weed on their lapels and hair!

‘I’m very aggressive on the field … if people think I play like Viv Richards or Kapil then it’s a big compliment for me’,"Harmanpreet Kaur’s swashbuckling 171 not out, which helped India defeat Australia by 36 runs in the World Cup semi-final, made her a household name. But well before that she broke a barrier by becoming the first Indian cricketer, male or female, to play as a professional in Australia’s Big Bash League. Following her exploits in the recent World Cup held in UK, she spoke to Rohit E David on where India lost its way in the World Cup final, her idols, her journey as a cricketer and the future of women’s cricket.

You are known as a big hitter. Do you emulate anyone? Who’s your hero?

Big hitting comes naturally to me. I don’t emulate anyone. I do admire Virender Sehwag’s batting.

Do you feel that your stint in the Big Bash helped take your game up to another level?

Yeah, I think so. The league matches in the Big Bash helped me a lot. The chance to interact with other international cricketers helped me in my game. This opportunity helped me build my confidence. I feel the turning point of my life in cricket came when I got selected for Big Bash.

People are comparing you with Viv Richards. What do you have to say about that?

There have been people who have compared me with Kapil Dev too. I can’t compare myself with anyone. They are big cricketers who have achieved a lot. But if people think I play like Viv Richards or Kapil then it’s a big compliment for me.

Did the team receive the support it always wanted during the World Cup?

Yes of course. We were looking for the type of support we got during the World Cup for a long time. This year we won the T20 series. After the World Cup the media has been following us.

Is there anything you would like to improve in women’s cricket?

Women cricketers need to work on their fitness and fielding. We need some more fielding camps. When it comes to infrastructure, whatever BCCI is giving us is good. We need more telecast of our games. Most of the time, when we are playing a series the matches are not telecast.

How is Mithali Raj as a captain?

She is a great captain. She always helps the players whenever we need her, whether it’s on or off the field. I have learnt a lot from her. With her experience, Mithali is the best captain in the world.

Is there anything you would like to change about yourself?

I feel I am very aggressive on the field. I want to control my emotions.

Can you tell us about your journey as a cricketer?

Initially, when I started playing cricket, I faced a lot of problems. I was not getting the right amount of practice. Now, I have a good setup in Pune. I am getting quality training which is helping me in my game. Also, I was not part of a good academy when I started out. Luckily my school supported me with my game.

How do you handle drawbacks?

They are part of life. Sometimes your graph will go down and another day it will come up. I simply show some patience. I speak to my family and my father, so that they can help me out with my game.

Did you always want to become a cricketer?

Yes of course. I got the opportunity to play other sports as well, but cricket was the one thing I excelled at.

The team was so near to the World Cup yet it couldn’t put it across England. Why did the team come under pressure?

I think these things happen in cricket. It is part of the game. After losing two or three early wickets, everyone came under pressure. I feel the last batters were not able to handle the pressure. This happened because most players didn’t get a chance to play in a big final."
"Bengaluru Broker Offers Rs 88 Lakh In A Pooja, Invites Trouble By Showing Off His Wealth On FB!","Social irritability is at its all time high because of distant relatives and family members who sabotage your cool in front of your friends and question your swag. A lot of Facebook videos, memes and articles surface over the plight of having family and relatives on your Facebook profile and basically the inability of not being able to hide your personal life from them.

thefriendz

But as a matter of fact, it's just not them you should be worried about. Facebook now has everyone, including IT department, police and government.

A Bengaluru-based real estate broker landed himself in a lot of trouble after he posted pictures from a ceremony he conducted.

Suryanarayana/Facebook

K Suryanarayana organized a pooja at his place where he adorned the podium with enormous cash and gold pots. Soon after the ceremony, the photos from the event landed on social media and spur eyes of the storm on him.

The photos that show Suryanarayana along with his wife standing next a pile of cash and gold instigated debates and concerns about his income and the amount of tax he was paying.

But Suryanarayana carried on his post and said that he's made this fortune the hard way. He went on to add that he withdrew Rs. 88 lakh from the bank especially for the pooja and used 1.23Kg gold to decorate the pooja room.

Suryanarayana/Facebook

Anyway, his pleas and explanation are tone deaf; people are stating that at a time when Congress leaders are being raided relentlessly, how come people like Suryanarayana are kept away from the raids.

Suryanarayana further stated that he has gained all his earnings in the most humble ways and that he initially started as an auto driver. He also claims that this year he's paid over Rs. 13 lakh as taxes and maintains assets worth Rs. 15 crore.

"Democracy rides, even as horses trade amidst race","Ahmed Patel won his Rajya Sabha seat, by the skin of his teeth, at the level of numbers, but spectacularly, in terms of the politics at play.

After its splendid victory in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in March this year, the BJP has added Goa, Manipur and, recently, Bihar, to the list of states where it has become the ruling party, albeit without the people’s mandate. The party had come to believe that political morality is some sort of a loser’s lament, while might is the only thing right for those who can get away with it.

So long as you could ‘persuade’ elected members of the legislature to cross over to your side, that is all that mattered, along with power at the Centre, the ruthless ability to wield it against the Opposition and very deep pockets for tempting legislators. People would applaud and praise your strategic sagacity and skill in realpolitik – provided you got away with it. And there seemed to be little to prevent the party from getting away with what it wanted. Till it decided to deny Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary yet another term in the Rajya Sabha.

By luring Vaghela back to the BJP fold, the BJP actually did the Congress a favour. He was a claimant to the party’s chief ministerial candidacy, while granting that claim would have done real damage to the Congress. Ideally, the Congress should reach out to the Patels and Dalits of the state, who have good reason to be miffed with the BJP-led state government, and probably project a Patel leader as its chief ministerial face in the forthcoming assembly elections.

But the Congress has not had the time to see the bright side to Vaghela’s departure. They were worried about his ability to take away half a dozen other MLAs with him, and give credence to the BJP’s boast that it would beat Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections. It herded its remaining flock of MLAs out of Gujarat and brought them back only the day before voting. Even then, one of the 44 who had been taken away to Bengaluru came back and voted for the BJP. Patel got 43 Congress votes, and probably from one from the NCP, although the lone JD(U) MLA and a rebel from the BJP claimed to have voted for Patel as well.

One of the two NCP MLAs who were supposed to vote for Ahmed did not, and joined the 14 legislators who had got elected on a Congress platform in defying the people’s mandate. Only the disqualification of votes by the two Congress rebel MLAs, who showed their votes to the BJP leadership and were conveniently caught on camera performing this act that predictably would get their votes invalidated, finally helped Ahmed Patel win.

Patel not only survived the BJP’s skulduggery but outsmarted its leadership in the end.

This is a morale booster for the Congress, a warning against Hubris for the BJP and a call to the Election Commission to bring in electronic voting for Rajya Sabha elections as well.

It is good for Indian democracy, not so much because the Election Commission stuck to the rules in the face of extreme pressure from ruling party ministers, as because the cynical disconnect between legislators and the political mandate that got them elected in the first place has been proved to not work like a charm in every case."

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

The 1st Smartphone Camera In The World Capable Of Clicking Unmatched Low Light Pics Is Incoming,"LG may be launching its next smartphone on August 31, but it’s more than happy to put out details regarding the device itself, in an attempt to drum up hype. That might just work this time around for one simple reason.

The upcoming V30 flagship, set to be launched at IFA in Berlin, is all about the camera. In fact, it may even top the shooter on the iPhone 7 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S8.

The V30 will be the first smartphone ever to have an f/1.6 aperture, which will let in around 25 percent more light than the f/1.8 used in the iPhone 7, better even than the f/1.7 aperture of the Samsung Galaxy S8 -- which is arguably the best smartphone camera launched this year. Additionally, the device will include a glass lens in the camera, which LG says will deliver sharper images much closer to the original scene.

Aperture in a camera assembly is the width of the hole through which light enters the camera lens -- more light generally means better image visibility, as a thumb rule. The higher the aperture number indicates lower aperture size. So for instance, f/2.0 is worse than f/1.8, and f/1.8 is bad compared to f/1.6.

The other specs look pretty great too; the smartphone will pack a 6-inch QHD (1440x2560) OLED display. It’s the same size as that of its predecessor the V20, despite being physically smaller. The V30 will also feature a dual camera system, though it’s not yet clear whether that means both lenses will benefit from the improvements being detailed today. There’s also been an upgrade to the front camera, with lessened edge distortion on the wide-angle lens.

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."

Influential men need to step up beside women to help promote gender equality,"By Elizabeth Broderick

Gender diversity is attracting increasing attention from India Inc. Companies are competing for industry diversity awards, increasing their parental leave provisions and setting gender equality targets for recruitment to attract and retain female workers.

This attention is well deserved. The economic and business case for gender equality in the world of work is clear. Evidence shows that more women on boards and in senior management is associated with better performance, including higher financial returns and stronger innovation outcomes. Increasing India’s low rate of women participation in formal paid work would also drive GDP growth upwards.

Australia, like India, is reaching gender parity in educational attainment, and in some cases girls are overtaking boys. But we are not seeing this translate into equal outcomes in the workplace in either of our countries.

There are three points in the talent pipeline where women are affected disproportionately. They fail to enter, are stuck in the middle or locked out of the top. Just as in India, Australian women remain under-represented in leadership positions and are much more likely to be in insecure jobs in low-paid industries.

The slow pace of change means that equality remains a distant goal. The World Economic Forum estimates that at the current rate of incremental change, it will take decades to reach parity in all economic participation. Accelerating the pace of change, in all countries, will require innovative and disruptive solutions.

For too long the responsibility for making progress on gender equality has sat exclusively on the shoulders of women. Yet, the reality is that in most countries men largely occupy the seats of power and, therefore, are a critical part of the solution. We need influential men to step up beside women so that promoting gender equality and women leadership becomes everyone’s business.

In 2010, I started the Male Champions of Change initiative. The importance of leadership from the top in achieving organisational change is well established. We formed a group of powerful male leaders from the private and public sectors to take practical action and to be accountable for making progress on gender equality in their own companies and beyond.

These leaders commit publicly to real, disruptive action to change the status quo. They challenge each other to be accountable for their commitments. They take a listening, learning and ‘leading through action’ approach. This means that they listen within their organisations and partner with leading women’s organisations to ensure they are deepening their understanding of gender equality issues. They experiment, learn, set targets and measure progress.

Today, the Male Champions of Change are a group of 160 men, including the heads of iconic Australian companies such as Telstra, Rio Tinto, Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, and of major sporting leagues, the army and federal police. Together these organisations employ around 600,000 people, or 5% of Australia’s workforce.

The UN has highlighted the initiative as worth global scaling, and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe led the establishment of a similar group in 2014, now numbering over 100 Japanese CEOs and companies.

Big businesses in India, especially in sectors such as IT and finance, are increasingly displaying leadership in addressing gender inequality. I look forward to hearing about innovative solutions such as women-only factory floors, opening supply chains to women micro-entrepreneurs and customising leadership development programmes.

Gender equality and women’s representation in leadership are not women’s issues to be addressed by women alone. They are key economic and societal issues. We all benefit from a more gender equal world.

"With focus and fire, Hardik Pandya takes a step up","THE BIG ROLE

With focus and fire, Hardik Pandya takes a step up

• Last updated on Thu, 10 Aug, 2017, 03:21 PM Vishaal Loganathan in Pallekele

Virat Kohli has said Hardik Pandya can do the job for India that Ben Stokes does for England. © AFP

Hardik Pandya has had to endure a topsy-turvy start to his international career. He was fast-tracked into the T20I set-up in Australia last year, and played a barrage of T20s, including the World T20 semi-final against West Indies. Soon he saw himself in the ODI squads as well. And finally, after injuries had robbed him of chances of a Test debut in India, he turned up in whites for his country in Sri Lanka.

Pandya is from the IPL bloodline, a product of a tournament that is as used to throwing people into the spotlight as it is to chucking them into oblivion. He has been part of Mumbai Indians since 2015, and has grown up being part of a side full of superstars. He would party as hard as he would play, with West Indians for company. He had the absolute best in the business to guide him, and was marked as one with potential - a hard hitter, good fielder and a useful bowler.

With India too, he made quite an impact. It helped further that India were on the lookout for just that kind of a player. He was erratic, underlined by his 11-ball first over in international cricket, but was also mostly apt for the job at hand. Pandya was the bits-and-pieces cricketer for India, a jack of many trades, but his influence in each of the departments were slowly growing.

Now pushed into Tests, Pandya continues to prove that he is more than capable of holding on to his spot. So much so that Virat Kohli even said Pandya can do the job that Ben Stokes does for England. There may have been giggles under the breath at the statement, because Pandya still has a long way to go and in all formats, but it showed how much the Indian management thinks of him.

And Pandya has repaid that with not only sound performances, but also with great discipline. Often tagged happy-go-lucky, party-goer and with his head in the clouds, Pandya has shifted all his focuses on cricket. The parties, the glitz and the glamour have taken a back seat, and cricket drives his life now.

The results are showing too. In the two Tests he's played so far, Pandya played small but significant roles. In Galle, he cracked a 50 on debut to help India scale the 600-run mark in their first innings and further deflate the hosts. He returned to take a wicket later in the game. He was also full of energy in the field, showing clearly that he's capable of altering match situations with moments of brilliance. But this was expected off Pandya. His big hitting exploits are well known, and have been on display regularly. The same can be said about his fielding. It was about how he would shape up for India with the ball that would define him.

In limited overs cricket, Pandya looks like the bowler who only has two lengths. His go to length is the short of length delivery, with an attempted bouncer thrown in-between, while as a change up he uses a full ball that is much slower. Resting hopes on a bowler with such limited ingredients would have been a folly. But Pandya showed in his second Test, that there is more to him.

At the SSC, Pandya repaid his captain's faith. In the second innings, as India were struggling for a breakthrough, the allrounder fashioned one with some clever bowling. Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis had sent India on a leather hunt with a superb counter-attack, and with India desperate for a break, Pandya answered his team's desperate call.

He had Mendis out with an off-cutter. The pitch at the SSC was slow and was taking turn, and Pandya was able to adapt quickly to the conditions and get the danger man out. Later on in the game, he had Niroshan Dickwella out caught at gully with a full wide ball. The previous over to the batsman, Pandya had stuck to bowling cutters on a good length, even beating the bat twice, but in the next over, he surprised Dickwella with a full, fast delivery. The batsman's late adjustment meant he was out caught at gully.

You could swat away both wickets as luck, or perhaps give some credit where due and tip your hat at Pandya. He may have to prove himself time and time again, against tougher opposition, in tougher conditions and during tougher situations before he gets close to doing what Ben Stokes does for England. But Pandya is doing his own reputation and future no harm with the kind of performances and commitment he's showing.

Ottis Gibson preferred candidate for South Africa head coach post, confirms Faf du Plessis

Tristan Holme • Last updated on Thu, 10 Aug, 2017, 06:23 PM

South Africa captain Faf du Plessis has confirmed that Ottis Gibson is the preferred candidate of a Cricket South Africa panel to take over as head coach, and said he has been discussing the West Indian's credentials with players from other countries.

While Gibson's recommendation by the five-man panel was reported in the English media last Friday (August 4), du Plessis' comments upon his return to South Africa on Thursday served as the first official confirmation. The recommendation still needs to be approved by the CSA board and financial details hammered out with both Gibson and the ECB, who may demand compensation for the loss of their bowling coach. Cricbuzz understands that discussions are ongoing.

In the meantime, du Plessis has been consulting with players that have experience working with Gibson. ""I don't know Ottis; I've never worked with him,"" du Plessis said at an arrival media conference in Cape Town. ""I actually spoke to a few of the West Indian guys because he coached there. I spoke to the English guys and there were a few different opinions, but the comments were positive. I spoke to Ben Stokes and he said he's a really good bowling coach, but I'm not sure what he'll be like as a head coach. Eoin Morgan said he's good at what he does and that he's a good guy, and that's the most important thing.""

After South Africa's 3-1 series defeat was sewn up in Manchester on Monday, du Plessis confirmed that the five-man panel, which includes former South Africa coaches Eric Simons and Gary Kirsten, had consulted with him during the process. Although du Plessis told the panel that he would like to see Russell Domingo stay on, he admitted that reports about Gibson suggested the panel wanted someone new.

While du Plessis appeared willing to accept that decision, he said it would bring some challenges. ""The team knows Russell well and he's established good relationships with the players. To lose that won't be nice,"" he said in Cape Town.

""But on the other side, it might be a good time for someone new with some fresh ideas. As long as the person in place is someone who understands South African cricket and understands our culture, it should make it easy to come in.""

Gibson spent six years playing domestic cricket in South Africa, where he represented Border, Griqualand West and Gauteng. Should he take over as head coach, his first assignment will be the two-Test series against Bangladesh, which starts in Potchefstroom on September 28.

The show that stars Tejaswi Prakash and Afaan Khan in the lead roles, has caused controversy for the makers of the show due to the offensive nature of the subject matter portrayed by this serial.

Yes, the new show has been receiving a lot of criticism as they show romance between a 9-year old little boy and a 19-year old girl and their marriage.

Ever since the show got aired, it has been getting a lot of negative reviews on social media stating the entire plot as bizarre and misleading the concept of child marriage.

After the illogical presentation of child marriage, the makers went more creepy by putting a honeymoon sequence in the show. Also, there are not so comfortable dialogues in the show like ""He is a kid, and we don't know when he will be big enough to satisfy you.""

youtube/screengrab



So after few episodes got aired on TV shocking the viewers, they decided to start a campaign to ban this weird show. One of the viewers started a campaign on change.org to ban this show as this obnoxious and perverted series can severely impact impressionable minds of children.

Till now 75 people have signed the petition and more are counting. The show has been promoted as an unusual eternal love story but this is where pedophilia and child marriage come in which are celebrated in the show.

11 Surprising Reasons Women Want To Have Sex With You,"While the media and all the scoop on the internet might lead you into believing that women only engage in sexual intercourse in order to procreate, it only qualifies as one of the reasons out of 237 why people hook up; at least that what a recent study from the University of Texas has to say.

themodernman.com

While your reasons to love sex are not rocket science, her reasons often seem mysterious and sometimes inexplicable!

Fortunately, over time women have inadvertently revealed some of the sure-fire reasons they would want to get it on with you:

You strive to communicate with her more than try to get her to orgasm

thoughtcatalog.com

Talking outside the bedroom and connecting with her mentally; even if it's about your sexual likes and dislikes or having candid discussions intimate details will make her comfortable and desire you more.

You pick up cues from her questions

maribor24.si

If a woman starts asking you questions about your schedule and what your routine looks like, she’s most likely thinking about being intimate with you. She may also enquire about the privacy in your personal life to check if she can squeeze in some alone time with you.

Staying connected with her outside the bedroom

womenspotential.com.mx

Your foreplay needs to start during the day when you share details about your day and yourself. Speaking and listening to her (this includes venting) helps maintain emotional intimacy, which in turn increases her desire for you.

She thinks you're fun to hang out with

shape.com

The Journal of Psychology found that women were 25 per cent more likely to find a man attractive if he had a good sense of humour and 31 more likely to date him. Try joking around as well when sharing details of your day with her.

You prefer playing smart than being a tough guy

You make her feel attractive, especially about things she is insecure about

lifestyle.okezone.com

Look out for her reaction when you touch certain parts of her body and watch out for clues when she lets you know which part of her body she’s self-conscious about. Make sure you don’t go overboard but compliment her in a universal manner.

You are physically less beefed-up and more athletic

xn--m-bttre-7wag.se

The musclehead at the gym might be a real head turner, but women prefer an athletic looking dude. A study conducted by UCLA revealed that woman preferred athletic looking bodies over bulky or skinny physiques any day.

You ease into her to get her fully into the act

enkirelations.com

One the biggest turn-off for a woman is a guy that is too eager from the get-go to get into her pants. You’re better off having an on going conversation allowing her to give you permission to get frisky every step of the way. As long as she comes to that decision by herself she’ll be ready to take the plunge with you before you are.

You commit to her

femina.co.id

The Journal of Sexual Medicine states that committing to a woman is the key to sexually motivating any woman. This might include sharing your intimate details, which might indicate to her that you’re not just another fling.

You’re sealed the deal with your kissing skills

apester.com

According to a study published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, women are less likely to get to the next level with a bad kisser. A good kiss, which includes smelling fresh, caressing her while kissing and tasting good, can earn you the pass to the main event.

Why T20 leagues need to be longer

The magic number of games to be played by each team for IPL to mitigate the influence of luck is 56! © BCCI

The role of luck in sport is significantly undervalued. Fundamental to the appeal of sport is its perceived fairness - the belief in the idea that the best team will win. The possibility that luck, as random as the flip of a coin or the roll of a dice, can influence and sometimes even determine results corrupts the meritocracy of sport that makes it so appealing in the first place.

Fascinatingly, psychologists believe that the human brain understates the influence of luck on events. This can be explained by the theory of hindsight bias - or creeping determinism - in which, once something has happened, our brains naturally create a narrative to explain it. Since the brain is seeking to ascribe causality - cause and effect - it undervalues the abstract role of luck and instead ascribes disproportionate value to actual events.

The presence of this phenomenon can be more discernible among those who have a vested interest in the outcome or the drama of the narrative. This is why sports fans of teams who have won are less likely to claim their team was ""lucky"" than fans of teams who have lost are to claim their team was ""unlucky"" - likewise the backpages of newspapers will rarely cite the role of luck in a result - if skill doesn't matter then why read the analysis?

Yet, as unnatural and unpalatable as it may be to accept, luck plays a significant role in most major sports. Luck is the product of randomness - the more opportunities a game has for random events, the more a game is determined by luck. Hence, chess is a game of pure skill while roulette is a game of pure luck; sports exist somewhere between these two extremes.

The influence of luck on a sport is determined by structural variables such as the number of players, their respective ability to influence the game, the opportunities to score and the way the game is scored and by random variables such as the weather and pitch conditions.

The way sports can manage the influence of luck across a season is through the number of matches played. It is a basic rule of probability that smaller sample sizes have greater variance than larger sample sizes of the same system. The larger the sample size, the more information there is, and so uncertainty reduces. The more matches there are, the narrower the margin of error between the actual results and the true variance of the teams, and the fairer the league becomes.

Using a brilliant methodology created by the sabermetrician Tom Tango, it is possible to estimate the role of luck in different sporting leagues. The equation upon which this method is built states that the observed variance between teams in a league is the product of variance explained by skill and variance explained by luck. [observed variance = skill variance + luck variance].

We can calculate the observed variance between teams [the standard deviation of win-loss records for each team] (a figure which represents the variance inherent to the sport and league) and, by imagining an ""all-luck world"" we can estimate the contribution of luck based on the number of matches per team per season [0.5*0.5/number of matches per season].

By dividing the observed variance by the variance explained by luck we can estimate the extent to which the observed variance is influenced by luck. As the number of matches played in a league increases, the variance explained by luck decreases. (For further explanation of this method watch this video).

The findings of this calculation are a product of the luck inherent to the sport itself and the product of the luck facilitated by the number of matches per team per season.

The results of applying Tango's methodology to recent seasons in major sports are fascinating - and for T20 cricket - significant, although not necessarily surprising.

League Variance explained by luck Matches Per Team per Season EPL (2014-2016) 27% 38 NBA (2014-2016) 13% 82 NFL (2014-2016) 46% 16 MLB (2014-2016) 40% 162

League Variance explained by luck Matches Per Team per Season IPL (2014-2016) 80% 14 T20 Blast (2014-2016) 72% 14 BBL (2012-2017) 75% 8

Due to the way T20 cricket is scored, the scale of the game and its vulnerability to conditions, results are highly susceptible to luck. Given the number of matches played per team in domestic T20 leagues - comparatively few by global sporting standards - it so follows that T20 leagues are also highly susceptible to luck. The small number of teams in T20 leagues -- comparatively few by global sporting standards -- concentrates talent and narrows the range of win-loss records, therefore increasing the influence of luck further still.

The consequences of the inability of T20's league tables to effectively reflect true talent are significant for the sport. T20 is a young game changing at a rapid rate but the efficiency of that change is compromised by the brevity and size of T20's leagues. Winning teams drive evolution, establish trends and pedal media narratives but the capricious nature of T20 makes it difficult to differentiate the white noise from the signals in such a short season.

Modern T20 leagues showcase phenomenal skill under intense pressure but in their current form they are sadly little more than exhibition events masquerading as elite competitions. This does a disservice to the brilliance of the sport and the reputation of T20. The ability, technique and strategising in T20 deserve better.

Using Tango's method it is possible to deduce the variation explained by skill in a sporting league and from this it is possible to estimate the number of matches per team required by a league for the influence of luck to be less than that of the influence of skill. The magic number for the IPL is 56, for the T20 Blast it is 36, for the BBL it is 25. To cricket these are big numbers, but teams in the MLB play 162 matches each and in the NBA they play 82 each. Whatever the precise figure, if T20 is cricket's future, as many imagine it will be, T20 leagues are going to have to become considerably longer for the sport to retain its competitive integrity.

Cassini Surfaces From Its Dive And Sends The Best Close Up Images Of Saturn Ever Seen,"NASA regained contact with its Cassini spacecraft yesterday, after the probe came out of its first dive through Saturn’s rings. Now, we can feast our eyes on some of the best close up images ever taken of the planet.

As Cassini dived through a previously unexplored region between the rings, it was using it’s dish-shaped antenna as a shield to prevent damage from microparticles, which is why NASA was out of touch with the probe for a few hours. As soon as it came back online the afternoon of April 27, the agency began harvesting the data the spacecraft had gathered, publishing it online late last night.

“In the grandest tradition of exploration, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has once again blazed a trail, showing us new wonders and demonstrating where our curiosity can take us if we dare,” said Jim Green, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

As it plunged through the gap, Cassini came within about 3,000 kilometers of Saturn's cloud tops, where the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar (almost the same as that of Earth’s sea level air pressure) and within about 300 kilometers from the innermost visible edge of the rings. “No spacecraft has ever been this close to Saturn before. We could only rely on predictions, based on our experience with Saturn's other rings, of what we thought this gap between the rings and Saturn would be like,” said Cassini Project Manager Earl Maize of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “I am delighted to report that Cassini shot through the gap just as we planned and has come out the other side in excellent shape.”

The Cassini spacecraft zipped through the 2,000 kilometer-wide space between the rings at speeds of about 124,000 kph, capturing data every step of the way. The next dive through the gap is scheduled for May 2.

During this final phase, Cassini loops Saturn approximately once per week, making a total of 22 dives between the rings and the planet. Data from this first dive will help engineers understand if and how they will need to protect the spacecraft on its future ring-plane crossings. The spacecraft is on a trajectory that will eventually plunge into Saturn's atmosphere, and end Cassini's mission, on Sept 15, 2017.

Saha's 'immeasurable' brilliance leaves the world gasping,"Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp with his wicketkeeping skills in the Colombo Test © Getty

When pitches start to wither, when the bounce gets fickle, when a ball throws up dust on hitting the turf, it is the batsmen you worry about. ""Oooh"" we go when one takes off past the shoulder of the bat or hurtles through at ankle height. The spinner has a mischievous grin, the batsman the look of a condemned man.

You don't think too much about the wicketkeeper though. The byes that result from a wicked surface go against his name and if he keeps a clean sheet, it doesn't stare at you from a scorecard a fortnight later. And yet, as much as the batsman almost, he has to combat the surface. If the batsman is beaten, he lives another day, if the 'keeper is beaten, it is four byes and slip looks at short leg with a twisted smile and a raised eyebrow.

I thought of that over the last couple of days of the Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. Normally, the batsmen are on the guest list there. Hundreds are strewn around and if you are Mahela Jayawardene, you only count the runs after the mandatory hundred has appeared. But this track was different. It was powdery to start off and by the third morning, the ball was spitting and bouncing. By the fourth morning, the odd one was taking off almost vertically as Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews discovered.

And yet, every time the ball beat the bat, at varying heights, it found a comforting glove. Every time it acquired a mind of its own after pitching, it was arrested and returned to the bowler. There were no oohs and aahs, no exaggerated reactions, just a calm gather and a crouch for the next ball. Keeping was hazardous but Wriddhiman Saha made it look like just another balance-sheet to be put together and filed away.

I have very rarely seen wicket-keeping like this. Maybe Nayan Mongia standing up to Anil Kumble's rockets on a pitch of variable bounce. Maybe Syed Kirmani at his peak. Kiran More was good and MS Dhoni brought his own style to a difficult job and rarely had a bad day. But Saha, so understated, was a treat to watch. Only once in the second innings was he beaten and he would have needed a fisherman's net to catch that one. And when he caught Mathews off another Jadeja sortie that bombed the pitch, we gasped.

Jadeja was bowling in the high nineties, more than ten kmph faster than Ashwin who was going past the outside edge for fun himself, more than 15 kmph faster than Herath on average and a good 20 kmph quicker than the debutant Pushpakumara. When he felt like it, he crossed 100 kmph. After he faced the first ball, Mathews asked for an arm-guard because the first one hissed at him violently.

But Saha seemed unperturbed. Indeed, amusing as it seems, taking a DRS call seemed to fluster him more. He couldn't have known where the ball was headed and yet it seemed he did. In our commentary box, Vijay Dahiya, no mean 'keeper himself, was rejoicing. Ajay Jadeja wanted to make him the Man of the Match.

In time to come, there will be nothing to measure Saha's brilliance, no scorecard will be read in reverence, no highlights packages will be preserved, no accolades offered on awards nights.

But the eyes saw it. And left imprints behind. Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp in Colombo.

Time to end the worst subsidy of all: kerosene,"Of India’s many subsidies, the kerosene subsidy is the worst. Yet it has been such a sacred cow that no government has dared tackle it for decades. Different states levy different taxes, but in most cities subsidised kerosene retails at around Rs 23/litre (it is just Rs 13.50 in Chennai, because of the state’s additional subsidy). The open-market price of kerosene (used for commercial purposes) is far higher, around Rs 57/litre.

The government has announced that the price of subsidised kerosene will be raised by 25 paise per fortnight until the subsidy goes. At this speed, the losses suffered by refiners could end in a little over a year. However, the retail price (including taxes) needs to be raised to equal the diesel price. That alone will end the adulteration of diesel with kerosene.

Studies show that up to 40% of subsidised kerosene is diverted from poor beneficiaries to the adulteration of diesel, which is more than twice as costly. Adulterated diesel produces massive pollution, much more than ordinary diesel, and the additional truck fumes sicken and kill poor people living on roadsides. The extra pollution hits cities where shopkeepers and industries use diesel gensets to overcome power shortages. Villages using diesel for tractors and pumps also suffer. Subsidising kerosene means subsidising disease and death for millions through pollution.

Besides, kerosene-adulterated diesel damages the engines it is used in. Trucks, gensets, tractors and diesel pumps wear out much faster than they should. The subsidy kills machines as well as humans. The major beneficiaries are crooked adulterators. That’s why it is the worst subsidy.

Many left-wing critics have said on TV that the poor will not survive if kerosene becomes costly. Really?

In 2014, Delhi was declared kerosene-free — all sales, subsidised or not, were banned — with consumers having to shift to cooking gas. Chandigarh became kerosene-free in 2016. Did the poor in these cities cease to live? Did they flee to areas where cheap kerosene was available? Not at all.

Indeed, thousands kept migrating from kerosene-available to kerosene-free areas. Haryana has just become kerosene-free last April. All such areas have reduced pollution and hit adulterators, without causing mass distress.

What matters for the poor is not the price of this or that item but overall inflation. But consumer price inflation is now down to 1.54%, the lowest for decades. The gradual upward price drift of kerosene will impact the index only marginally. There will never be a better time to decontrol the price. The needy can be given a free solar lamp for lighting, or a direct cash transfer.

Subsidies are palliatives. Only rapid economic growth accompanied by rising wages can cure poverty. Subsidies are nevertheless warranted for the needy. But, as Swaminomics has argued for decades, the right approach is to give cash to the needy, instead of subsidising goods that may well be used by the rich or crooks. The subsidy on urea, for instance, goes mainly to richer farmers with large holdings, while some is smuggled into Bangladesh. Ultra-cheap urea discourages the use of green manure which is environment friendly. It also means farmers use an excess of urea and not enough potassic or phosphatic fertilisers (which are not subsidised), and this ruins soil quality. Just as subsidising kerosene benefits the wrong people and activities, so too does subsidising urea, or rural power, or almost anything else.

Narendra Modi can no longer be called just an incremental reformer. True, he has moved in baby steps in many areas. But cumulatively they are adding up to a substantial change. When the price of oil was at its height, explicit and implicit subsidies on petroleum products were 2% of GDP. The UPA government devised the strategy of raising the price of petrol in baby steps. The Modi government has extended this to all petroleum products, and buttressed the change with direct cash transfers to the needy. Soon oil subsidies may be down to zero, freeing lakhs of crores to be spent on improving infrastructure, health and skills.

The risk is that new subsidies will take the place of the old. The farm loan waiver that started in UP has spread to other states, and looks certain to be announced in all states going to the polls in the next 18 months. UP, Rajasthan and other states are starting subsidised canteens along the lines of Tamil Nadu’s “Amma Canteens”. Ending the kerosene subsidy is a step forward, but the battle for sensible government spending is nowhere near won."
Punjab’s water stress foregrounds tough policy trade-offs,"A reply by Water Resources minister Uma Bharti to a Lok Sabha question on groundwater depletion foregrounds tough trade-offs facing India’s policymakers.

According to Bharti, an assessment of groundwater resources and usage showed that 16% of 6,584 assessment units in India are “overexploited.”

A table which accompanies her reply provides state-wise data. Here, Punjab stands out for the magnitude of overexploitation. If 16% of assessed units in India are overexploited, the figure rises to 76% in case of Punjab. It is the most water stressed Indian state.

Punjab also happens to be India’s most important state in providing food security. It is a massive contributor to the cereal-dependent public distribution system.

One way of looking at it is India’s food security is heavily dependent on a state which is perhaps the worst placed in terms of water stress. Punjab’s impressive agricultural production is partly an outcome of its irrigation coverage. About 98.5% of Punjab’s crop area is irrigated, mainly on account of groundwater irrigation. Without this supply of water, Punjab will surely not be a large contributor to rice procurement by state agencies.

It is not just quantity where Punjab’s farmers score. According to Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Punjab has the highest yield in paddy among states.

This is where a policy maker will face difficult trade-offs.

The easy solution will be to dramatically bring down electricity subsidies which will force farmers to divert to a crop which consumes less water than paddy. While this process takes place, how is it possible to guarantee that other states will offset the loss of rice procurement in Punjab?

Without a simultaneous offset in rice procurement, there will be other complications such as a revival of cereal inflation. Introducing a rational pricing policy to preserve groundwater is essential. But the sequence of steps needed to get there without collateral damage is very difficult."
"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India’s freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat – today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected – political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians’ narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department’s 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations – which included Nathuram Godse’s Hindu Rashtra Sena – viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn’t ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province’s chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh’s decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government’s delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police’s fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar’s participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year’s rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh’s anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, “Of late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation’s activities.”

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman’s query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh’s mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh’s growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had “infiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes”. It further stated “the organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.”

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government’s real intention: “the holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.” Subsequently, the Sangh’s training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh’s weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists’ privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation’s history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."

The inside story of how Ahmed Patel won his RS seat in Gujarat,"There has been a lot of speculation on how Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmed Patel managed to beat the best-laid plans of BJP President Amit Shah. Here is what really happened:

1) Congress had 57 out of 182 MLAs in the Gujarat assembly and all Patel needed was 46 votes to sail through into Rajya Sabha for the fifth time. Vaghela’s 77th birthday drew first blood as the senior leader announced he is quitting all party posts in Congress. Six MLAs resigned and more defections followed leaving Congress with just 44 MLAs who were shepherded to Bengaluru. The game was still evenly balanced as Patel had the required 44 votes in a house of 176.

2) When the 44 Congress MLAs were brought back to Gujarat, Patel spent some time alone with one of them, Karamshi Makwana, to gauge his mood. Even though the Sanand MLA assured Patel about his support, the wily Congressman knew something was amiss and immediately went into damage control mode.

3) Patel knew he couldn’t rely on Makwana and now needed to arrange one more elusive vote as a replacement. He had to somehow wean away one among the four NCP, JDU and GPP MLAs to break BJP’s advantage just hours before polling.

4) So, Patel turned to JDU MLA Chhotu Vasava who has been winning the Jhagadia assembly seat since 1990. The tribal strongman was known to be upset with Nitish Kumar’s sudden U-turn in joining hands with BJP. Vasava and Patel go back a long way in politics and all efforts were made to convince the six-time MLA about voting for the Congress cause.

5) Shah’s team knew if there was any chink in their armour, it had to be Vasava who was seen to be immune from any kind of pressure. BJP made his choice easy by exerting pressure to the extent of escorting him inside the hall where votes were to be cast. In the end, it was Patel who had the last laugh and he was seen sitting at Vasava’s house shortly after polling got over.

BJP’s calculation went awry in its assumption that Congress would not draw any other votes outside of its own MLAs. This was where Patel turned the tables on BJP. Even if the two rebel Congress MLAs had not been disqualified, Patel would have eventually won. Election Commission declaring the two votes invalid came as icing on the cake for Congress’ top strategist."
Here's What Cassini Is Up To As It Dives Into Saturn's Inner Atmosphere For One Last Hurrah,"Launched from Earth in 1997, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft took close to nine years to reach its destination, Saturn, where it’s spent years observing the planet and transmitting back data. Now, the space agency is giving the probe an explosive send off - literally.

An illustration of NASA’s Cassini spacecraft above Saturn

Nearly 20 years after being sent off on a solo voyage to the ringed planet, Cassini is nearly out of fuel reserves. NASA is now ready to decommission the $3.26 billion probe in a most unusual way, by blowing it up in space.

According to the agency, Cassini needs to be destroyed to avoid damaging any alien life in the vicinity. See, while other probes in the past have been left to orbit around heavenly bodies long after they’ve gone dormant, Cassini is a little different. According to the space agency, leaving it in its current course around Saturn could be catastrophic. The gravity from the planet and its many moons could wreak havoc on the defunct probe’s unsupervised orbit, possibly sending it plunging into the moons Titan or Enceladus, both of which may be capable of supporting alien life.

In fact, Cassini sealed its own fate back in 2015, when it discovered a saltwater ocean buried beneath the ice on Enceladus. Since then, the space agency has also discovered plumes of icy material ejecting from the surface, which host the perfect conditions for microbes to survive. According to Earl Maize, an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the agency can’t risk damaging or contaminating any microscopic alien life in a crash.

“Cassini has got to be put safely away,” he said. “And since we wanted to stay at Saturn, the only choice was to destroy it in some controlled fashion.”

Cassini will brave 22 dives between Saturn and its rings during the next few months, transmitting back data to Earth the likes of which we haven’t seen before. Now, during its final run which began April 26, Cassini is diving towards Saturn’s surface at over 122,000 kph approximately once per week. Because that gap between the rings is a region no spacecraft has ever explored, Cassini was using its dish-shaped high-gain antenna as a protective shield while passing through the ring plane, which is why NASA temporarily lost contact with the probe on its first dive yesterday. Now, Earth has re-established contact with Cassini from the giant 70-meter Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California.

This time, there’s no coming back around the planet for the probe. Instead, NASA will use the remainder of Cassini's days to harvest all the data it gathers through these last few dives. Eventually, as it completes the final dive on September 15, the pioneering probe will struggle to keep its antennae pointed upward as it transmits the last data from its final run back to Earth, before it burns up in the atmosphere.

All good things must end, and it looks like after 20 exciting years, Cassini is going out for one last ride.

Diving Into The Spirit World,"Many great 20th century scientists have been drawn to the spirit world, writes MUKUL SHARMA



The end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth saw some extremely radical and revolutionary developments in modern science in the form of electromagnetism, relativity and quantum mechanics. In the light of this, one would imagine that the age of superstition, irrationality and old wives’ tales — not to mention ghosts — would technically come to an end. But nothing of the kind actually happened.On the contrary, a lot of well-known scientists (including a few Nobel laureates), rational thinkers and eminent statesmen almost immediately dived deeply into the spirit world. From both sides of the Atlantic, from recognisably advanced nations of the time like England, France and the United States, reports started steadily streaming in that some ‘gifted’ people were being able to go into a trance and summon up or even speak directly to the spirits of the dead.Others were apparently able to enter into an altered state of consciousness and write things dictated by remote entities in what was then fashionably known as ‘automatic writing’ or as it’s still called today, ‘channelling’.



Some of these outpourings were touted to be the latest works of deceased writers and musicians describing new works of theirs such as unknown plays of Shakespeare and Bacon or new compositions by Mozart and Beethoven. In India too in the early 1900s, a Sanskrit manuscript surfaced called Vaimanika Shastra or ‘Science of Aeronautics’ which was purportedly dictated to a ‘seer’ by the name of Pandit Subbaraya Shastry who claimed it was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu sage Bhardwaj and contained mention of advanced aerodynamic flying vehicles in use in Vedic times. Bizarre as it may sound though, a lot of men of science and other research streams began flocking in droves to these séances apparently to study their veridicality, thinking it might be the next great breakthrough in their respective fields. Parapsychologists came to check out instances of telepathy and clairvoyance, reincarnation researchers wanted to see if disincarnate souls could exist and people who believed in flying saucers and ancient alien astronauts thought they might find evidence for their theories. Everything ultimately came to nothing. Either the mediums were exposed as hoaxes who cleverly fooled the gullible — including J J Thompson, the discoverer of the electron,physicist Oliver Lodge, and Balfour, the later prime minister of England — or they themselves admitted their chicanery.



For instance, the famous Fox sister mediums publicly acknowledged they were faking the whole thing while Leonora Piper was exposed by a professional magician. In which connection, the so-called Vaimanika Shastra manuscript along with the various sketches in it was also investigated by the aeronautical and mechanical engineering researchers at the Indian Institute of Science,Bangalore in 1974. Their conclusion was simple: it was nonsense. They said that the aircrafts described in the text were ‘poor concoctions’ and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics. Of one particular flying machine, the Rukma Vimana, the study noted: “If the craft is taken to mean what the drawing and the text say,it can be stated that the craft is a decided impossibility.” However, having said that and, hopefully, in the process defrocking the occult ilk, let’s skip a few decades to 1930.That was the year the Pulitzer Prize winning American author Upton Sinclair wrote Mental Radio: Does it work, and how? It documents Sinclair’s test of the psychic abilities of Mary Craig, his second wife, while she was in a state of profound depression with a heightened interest in the occult. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her brother. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 ‘partial successes’ and 70 failures. Yet what’s the bet most of us would never guess — Albert Einstein wrote the preface to this book. ¦"

Woakes returns; Stoneman, Crane earn Test call-ups

Mark Stoneman and Mason Crane have earned call-ups to the England squad for the first Test against Windies to be played at Edgbaston, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Thursday (August 10). Keaton Jennings, Steven Finn and Liam Dawson have been dropped from the squad for the historic Day-Night fixture while Chris Woakes has returned after making a full recovery from a side strain.

Stoneman is set to debut in the first Test of the three-match series and will partner Alastair Cook at the top of England's batting order. The opportunity for the Surrey opener comes after Jennings endured a tough time against South Africa in the four-match series, registering scores of 8, 33, 0, 3, 0, 48, 17 and 18 across the eight innings of the series.

The 30-year-old Stoneman, when picked, will become Cook's 12th different opening partner since Andrew Strauss's retirement as England look to solve their opening conundrum ahead of the Ashes in Australia later this year. The left-hander has been in prolific form in the first class season so far, scoring 1033 runs at an average of 57.38 with three centuries.

Crane, 20, has played two Twenty20 Internationals and made his debut against South Africa in the three-match series in June. The legspinner has played five first class games in this season so far, picking up 16 wickets at an average of 40.31 and will look to push is his case for an inclusion in the Ashes squad. He replaces Liam Dawson, his Hampshire teammate, who picked up just five wickets in the first two Tests against South Africa.

Meanwhile, Woakes returns to the side after proving his fitness to the selectors. The allrounder sustained the side strain in the opening encounter of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 against Bangladesh and was forced out of action. He made a successful return for Warwickshire against Middlesex and proved his fitness with five wickets and a half-century to lead his side to a 190-run win. Woakes's inclusion means Finn will have to return to Middlesex and try and earn his place back in the national side.

""The selectors would like to offer their congratulations to Mark Stoneman and Mason Crane who thoroughly deserve their opportunity in the squad,"" James Whitaker, the National Selector, said.

""Keaton Jennings will return to Durham and will look to recapture the form that earned him selection in the first place. I am sure he will find his confidence and look to score runs in the remaining matches of this season.

""Chris Woakes has proved his fitness and returns to the squad having missed most of the summer through injury. He was impressive in his return game at Lord's this week and if selected in the final line-up, he will be relishing the prospect of playing on his home ground.""

After the pink-ball Test in Birmingham, the two teams will travel to Leeds and then Leicester for the remaining two games before playing a one-off T20I and five One-Day Internationals.

Full Squad: Joe Root (c), Ben Stokes, Alastair Cook, Tom Westley, Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Toby Roland-Jones, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Chris Woakes, Mark Stoneman, Mason Crane

Uttarakhand Elections 2017 Analysis Times of India,
Captain Amarinder is going to turn around Punjab,"Amarinder Singh got back into power after ten years of Akali rule. In his first tenure as CM from 2002-2007, he tried to bring biggest infrastructure reforms and agricultural revolution in state with his visionary insights. He was successful to larger extent but lost his interest towards the end of his span because of too much infighting in Congress party and opposition of his visionary approach. It gave advantage to Akalis.

Akalis came to power with lots of expectations from people in 2007. But when they started functioning, vindictiveness was visible everywhere. They almost stopped the ongoing development projects which was going to play the crucial balancing act between rural-urban populations. They started controlling most of the economic activities of state. Akalis high commands were more interested in empowering themselves at the cost of state exchequer, like transport activity, farmer negligence etc.

Mainly four challenges are in front of new CM—–

1: Rate of agricultural growth has declined in last 10 years for which Punjab is known all over country. Its robust agriculture and agri based industries are a major source of employment for labours from across the country. GDP was 10 percent in 2005-2006, has now come down to 5.96 in 2015-2016. It has gone below the national average.

2: Health and Education sector is in bad shape, it’s not got the due importance by previous government. There is severe problem of rising school drop-out rate all over the state.

3: Youth of Punjab was diverted to drugs, they were opposing the rise of feudal system in every sector which had started flourishing under the shadow of government. Drug was the deadliest blow for the state, its addiction can be seen by the fact that Aam Admi Party AAP fought assembly election on this issue only. Government after seeing its expansion in whole of state, started big awareness program for helping people to come out of it but for no avail because of nearing assembly elections.

Revival of health,education and drugs rehabilitation were seen in govt ads but not very effective on ground levels.

Amarinder Singh has seen all this growing in the last 7,8 years. Slowly and gradually convincing Congress high command for giving him full authority to overcome first on infighting in party, he started working on ground level and was requesting people to come out for regaining the glory of Punjab.

He is facing tough situations at ground level but he is determined to bring metamorphic change mostly in the above discussed sectors. He knows it very well that people are having high expectations from him and he is the only hope for them now. He is going to turn around Punjab with his hard work and bringing back transparency in system."

"From Lala Amarnath to Virat Kohli, each captain has tried to carve out an identity of his own","By Boria Majumdar

For a newly independent India grappling with the trauma of a bloody partition, Lala Amarnath was an ideal leader. Having grown up in Lahore, he was sensitive to the happenings around him and did much to promote people to people contact when the two countries, India and Pakistan, first played against each other in 1951-52. And it was only fair that the mantle of captaincy passed on from Amaranth to Vijay Hazare, the son of a school teacher from Sangli in the Bombay Presidency. Hazare, much like 1950s India, was a hesitant captain. A newly independent nation was still searching for direction and Hazare too showed the same uncertainty in his captaincy.

Indian captains across time have been an extension off the larger projection of India as a country and viceversa. Sunil Gavaskar, for example, was very late 1970s and 80s India. Traditional and conservative in his approach, Gavaskar, much like the Indian ideology of the time, would go on the attack only after he had readied his defence. He was methodical and calculative and orthodox, in sharp contrast to Sourav Ganguly, who perfectly epitomised the turn-of-themillennium India.

For Sourav, it wasn’t a big deal to have Steve Waugh wait for 30 minutes at the toss at Eden Gardens in 2001. So what if Waugh had to wait. The Indians had been forced to do many such things in the past. Now the roll of the dice had changed. It was giveback time and it was best if Waugh, Nasser Hussain and others did not make much fuss about it. Hussain showed his opposing number his shirt number when he reached his century in the Natwest final in 2002. Sourav responded by opening his shirt at the Lord’s balcony.

Sourav with shirt in hand while exposing the many threads he wears for religious reasons round his neck presented a peculiar paradox. Here was a very typical god-fearing Bengali willing to shed all his conservatism to convey to the world that this was a very different Indian team that he was leading, one that was willing to give it back to the opposition if there was provocation.

It was only proper that the baton, a few years later, was passed on to MS Dhoni, arguably the best white ball captain India has produced. In an India which was trying to go digital and sought instant gratification in most things, it came as no surprise that Dhoni’s record as captain in white ball cricket was far better than his Test record. He won the World T20 in 2007, 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the Champions Trophy in 2013. Around the same time India lost eight straight Test matches under him on foreign soil in 2011-2012. That Dhoni came from Ranchi was yet again the story of India, a country that had started to look beyond the metropolitan cities and markets.

Finally to captain Kohli. A tattooed fitness freak with limitless ambition and a voracious penchant for runs, Virat is the India of the future. Having already amassed serious wealth and one with a beautiful film actor partner, Kohli perfectly captures the complexities of modern India. On the one hand he presents his father’s threads to his idol Sachin Tendulkar, a gesture very much in sync with the Guru-Shishya paramparaya and on the other he doesn’t stop short of calling Steve Smith’s brain fade an act of cheating or take on Anil Kumble for not sharing his vision in taking the team forward.

None of these men can be labelled as either right or wrong. Just like the current Indian state seeking to achieve super power status, each of them strove to carve out an identity in their chosen realm. That this realm is considered religion in India is no accident."
Thank Your God Gamers! Esports May Be An Official Medal Event At The 2024 Paris Olympics,"The Olympics are always a grand affair, at the crossroad of sporting excellence and human endeavour. But it’s always the outdoor events that draw more crowds than the indoor ones.

Well, if recent news is true, all that may be about to change by within the next eight years.

In a statement to the Associated Press, Tony Estanguet, the co-president for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games committee, said they’re considering including esports as a medal event. Yes, no kidding. This is serious. This is a huge acknowledgement of esports all over the world!

Estanguet reportedly told AP that the committee has scheduled talks with the International Olympic Committee, as well as representatives of esports competition, “to better understand what the process is and why it is such a success.”

Gamers need to be told why this is such awesome news, but Estanguet had a few words for others out there who might be skeptical about the idea. “We have to look at it because we can’t say, ‘It’s not us. It’s not about Olympics.’ The youth, yes they are interested in esports and this kind of thing. Let’s look at it. Let’s meet them. Let’s try if we can find some bridges.”

“There is some time to look at it, to interact, to engage,” Estanguet added. “The IOC will have the last say, if they want esports on the program.”

On behalf of all gamers, all around the world and in India, we certainly hope the IOC recognizes esports as a legitimate medal event!"
"Tattooing Makes You Sweat Less And Changes The Way You Sweat, Not In A Good Way","Get tattooed still remains one of the most popular ways Millennials like to express a monumental occasion or belief or just something they find cool. The decision to get permanently labelled with whatever it is that you want to express is a very personal choice.

Time.com

But what are the implications of getting one on your health? A recent study published by the National Center for Biotechnology revealed that tattooing can interfere with how you sweat; more importantly, it may be causing you sweat less!

“The tattooed skin produced about half as much sweat as the non-tattooed skin,” says study co-author Mauri Luetkemeier, professor of integrative physiology and health science at Alma College in Michigan. “In addition, sweat from the tattooed skin was significantly saltier than the non-tattooed skin,” says Luetkemeir.

healthline.com

Saltier sweat meant that your skin tends to reabsorb less sodium and other electrolytes from your perspiration, which may be partially blocked by the tattooing.

The good news is that this phenomenon applies mostly to people who get excessive tattooing done to their body; not people who get a single tattoo or even a few scattered ones, reports Time.

onbitv.com

This is true especially for people who have an extensive coverage on their back, arms, or other areas that heavily covered with sweat glands. The tattoos can interfere with your skin’s ability to cool your body and retain important nutrients.

In particular, it could be more problematic for athletes, fire fighters, soldiers and the likes, states Dr Angela D. Smith a former president of the American College of Sports Medicine.

metro.us

“This could well be a problem. There is a maximum sweat rate that can be obtained,” Smith told Healthline. “The endurance athlete is already exercising at maximal capacity and that maximal capacity usually is going to include that they’re sweating at their maximal rate so if they now reduce their ability to produce sweat, say by tattooing 10 percent of their body, they can no longer achieve their same maximum,” added Smith.

“To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to document alterations in sweating function associated with tattooing,” says Luetkemeier. “However, we are somewhat cautious about our results. The process we used for stimulating sweat glands differs from the normal process, which involves cooling yourself following a rise in body temperature."
Trending down: A cut in RBI policy rate is welcome but more must be done to boost the economy,"Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee (MPC) yesterday lowered its policy interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first change in 10 months. The current rate, 6%, has now been brought down to the level that existed over six years ago. The change signals two things. One, MPC is now more sanguine about the trajectory of inflation. Two, the reduction in interest rate has come amidst signs that industrial performance remains lacklustre. Given this context, MPC’s decision is welcome but it is unlikely to make a meaningful difference to the economy.

Interest rates have been trending down for a while. In the backdrop of slowing growth of bank credit, deposit rates have been constantly lowered. Recently, State Bank of India lowered even savings rates for most of its deposit holders. On the other side, interest rates for borrowers have not declined proportionately on account of the bad loans plaguing banks. But there has been more activity from non-banking financial intermediaries and India’s top companies have been able to benefit from the current environment. It is the smaller companies, the ones most dependent on banks, which have missed out.

The benign environment for borrowers has not translated into a revival of investment demand. MPC’s statement pointed out that the number of new investment announcements fell to a 12-year low in April-June quarter. Part of the problem can be traced to the collapse in global trade following the financial crisis, but there are levers the government can use to improve the situation. The immediate need is to carry through with the resolution process of bad loans following the promulgation of an ordinance in May. This must be supplemented with measures to ease doing business, which would substantially improve the investment climate."

Uthappa joins Saurashtra for 2017-18 season,"RANJI TROPHY NEWS

Uthappa joins Saurashtra for 2017-18 season

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Thu, 10 Aug, 2017, 06:23 PM

In a major boost to Saurashtra, Robin Uthappa has signed up with the Jaydev Shah-led side for the upcoming Indian domestic season, after ending his 15-year association with Karnataka earlier in June.

With Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja mostly unavailable due to national commitments, Uthappa's presence, coupled with his experience, will add steel to the Saurashtra side.

""Robin Uthappa has completed all necessary formalities to BCCI [Board of Control for Cricket in India], Saurashtra Cricket Association [SCA] and Karnataka State Cricket Association [KSCA],"" SCA media manager Himanshu Shah said in a statement, confirming the switch on Thursday (August 10). ""Saurashtra Cricket Association welcomes Robin Uthappa. SCA feels confident that Robin will add up strength to strong Ranji Team of Saurashtra with his vast experience and commendable performance.""

Uthappa was a long time servant of Karnataka, having made his debut for them in the 2002-03 season. But a below par 2016-17 Ranji season, where he was left out of the side for the last league game and the quarterfinal, seemed to have been the final straw as he opted to move out of his home state.

Even though the KSCA tried their best to retain Uthappa, all efforts proved futile. Consequently, the NOC was granted on June 17. ""I had a long chat with Robin and he had his reasons for moving out,"" R Sudhakar Rao, the KSCA secretary, had said at the time. ""We tried to hold him back but couldn't, so we had to issue the NOC as per his request.""

As soon as Uthappa made up his mind to leave, there were a couple of states interested in the Coorgi lad. Kerala and Vidarbha were linked to him, but the wicketkeeper-batsman has decided to play for Saurashtra, thereby becoming their professional recruitment for the 2017-18 season.

Uthappa, who has played for India in both ODIs and T20Is, was an integral member of the 2007 World Cup winning side led by MS Dhoni. But inconsistent performances post that forced the selectors to drop him. Uthappa last played for India during the limited-overs tour of Zimbabwe in July-August 2015 and didn't do enough there to warrant another recall.

Despite not being a part of the recent Indian setup, Uthappa has been a key member of the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise. His partnership with Gautam Gambhir at the top proved productive as he helped KKR win the IPL after joining them in 2014. He was the leading run-scorer in the season and also notched up 10 consecutive scores of 40 or more.

In a career spanning 15 years for Karnataka, Uthappa played many roles for his side, including taking the gloves back again for the 2015-16 season, in an attempt to return to the national team. Uthappa had even stated his desire to be a backup to Dhoni back then.

Some of Uthappa's memorable moments with Karnataka involve him leading the side to Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai in 2009-10, only to lose a thriller by six runs. He was a member of the winning team in the 2013-14 season, and the following season, along with becoming the only domestic team to win the treble. Uthappa was also a key member of the side that returned to defend all three titles next season.

This Is How Brave Kashmiris And Indian Army Chased Away Pakistan In 1965 To Keep Kashmir A Part Of India!,"August brings back the memory of a time when the Kashmiri locals joined hands with the Indian army to chase away the Pakistan-backed terrorists who came to Indian territory with an induced imagination of capturing Kashmir, in 1965. Although the Pakistani advancement led to a full fledged war, the brave Indian soldiers along with the fearless locals made sure that the plans of the enemy are buried in the valley forever. Pakistan called it 'Operation Gibralter' to replicate the success of Muslim army in south of Spain centuries ago.

defencePK

What was 'Operation Gibraltar'?

Operation Gibraltar was the code-name given to the operation, Pakistan armed forces especially army launched to infiltrate Jammu and Kashmir in August 1965 in the garb of locals and start a rebellion against Indian rule.

Pakistan sought to cash on the growing discontent of Kashmiris and thus infiltrated Kashmir in hope that once instigated, Kashmiris would do rebellion against India and while taking benefit of chaos, Pakistani army regulars would defeat Indian Army and capture the valley.

madrasregiment-.org

Pakistani General Akhtar Hussain Malik described Operation as ""to defreeze the Kashmir problem, weaken Indian resolve, and bring India to the conference table without provoking general war.""

What led to this Operation?

Post India's China debacle in 1962, Indian army was going through massive changes both in personnel and equipment.

Pakistan army despite being way smaller than Indian army got a qualitative edge in air power and armour for brief period of time which Pakistan's military establishment wanted to utilise before India could recover from Chinese drubbing.

thehindu

Moreover, an event of disappearance of a holy relic from Srinagar's Hazratbal shrine in 1963 created turmoil and intense Islamic feeling among Muslims in the valley, which was viewed by Pakistan as ideal opportunity to instigate the sentiment of revolt in Kashmiris.

How the operation began?

In August 1965, Pakistan Army's 50th Airborne paratroopers and Pakistan Army's guerrillas, disguised as locals, entered Jammu and Kashmir with an objective of fomenting an insurgency among Kashmiri Muslims.

Pakistan's plan was that after instigating Kashmiris for rebellion, the 40,000 strong well armed army of Pakistanis garbed as locals would launch offensive against Indian Army.

Indian Army broken by the Chinese thrashing wouldn't be able to cope with this sudden attack and since rebellion will be led by Kashmiris themselves, it would be hard for Indians to launch a counter attack.

theweek

Though Pakistan President Ayub Khan wasn't fully convinced with the plan, but Pakistani generals went ahead with it. In first week of August 1965, Pakistani troops especially of Azad Kashmir Regimental Force (Now Azad Kashmir regiment) who looked like locals infiltrated Kashmir. The troops were divided into 10 forces (5 companies each) and were given different code names, mostly after historically significant Muslim rulers.

voiceofnation

Initially Pakistani troops got some success and without even encountering with Indian Army, they got hold of key positions. Pakistani-held Kashmir across the Pir Panjal Range into Gulmarg, Uri and Baramulla. They planned to encourage a general revolt, which would be followed by direct combat with Indian army.

How Kashmiris failed Pakistan's plans?

Despite initial success, the law of averages did Pakistanis in and poor coordination between Pakistan forces resulted in discovery of infiltrators.

adityaaryaarchive

Kashmiris instead of taking the bait from Pakistanis refused to revolt and many of them became informers for Indian Army who helped Indians to throw Pakistanis out of Kashmir.

Pakistani forces had to retreat in haste. Fearing the massive killing of their soldier due to half baked plan, the Pakistan Army had to Open front in Punjab to divide the engagement of Indian army which further led to first full-fledged war between the two neighbours."
An Engineer-Turned-Farmer Grew 51 Types Of Mangoes On One Tree To Save Endangered Varieties,"The real magic of life lies with the extraordinary ideas of ordinary people! Don't believe us? Meet Ravi Marshetwar, an engineer turned farmer who used his knowledge and skills to grow 51 varieties of mangoes in one tree.

thebetterindia

Ravi took inspiration from his father, who was always keen to work for the society and hence looked forward to a life where he could do something for the world.

After working for 10 years in Muscat, Ravi came back to India and became a farmer. With his endearment for farmers intact, Ravi couldn't bear the sight of various suicide-prone villages, where farmers succumbed to death because of miseries in agriculture.

kalkionline

The growing tension forced him to work for the welfare of these distraught people and educate them about the government schemes and subsidies they were entitled to.

With his tiny steps and bright ideas, he began approaching farmers in the areas nearby and addressed their problems. He educated them about new techniques, especially grafting with which he created his miracle, on his 5 acres of ancestral land.

kalkionline

One of his most lauded works, the mango tree grows 51 varieties of mangoes on one single tree. It's 50 years old and has been grafted 1,350 times to get these varieties.

The tree, which was old and only gave sour mangoes earned him close to 1,000 is now a loaded gem of varieties and earns Ravi over INR 30,000.

Hundreds of farmers now visit Ravi in the month of July, August, and September to learn the best technique to execute grafting.

He learned all these skills from fellow farmers, agricultural institutes and colleges in the nearby vicinities. He met several farmers who were good at what they were doing and educated himself. He then rooted his knowledge in his work and when successful, taught others as well."
"India must lower, not raise, tariff walls","In an interview to this newspaper, Niti Aayog’s outgoing vicechairman Arvind Panagariya has rightly pitched for lowering India’s peak Customs duty to 7% from 10%. Restarting the reform, that began in 1991but got stalled after 2007-08, will enhance the quality of our domestic produce, make our products more competitive in the international market. The ideal goal is a uniform import duty on raw materials, intermediates and final products, to give all lines of value addition the same effective rate of protection. But there is a slide towards protection now with the government imposing anti-dumping duties on as many as 93 products — steel, metals, chemicals and petro chemicals, electric and electronic items and consumer goods.

True, a strong rupee makes imports relatively cheap. But raising tariff walls would breed domestic inefficiency and trigger retaliation by trading partners. Similarly, other moves such as levying an import duty on mobile phones to protect domestic phone-makers or on 4G equipment imported by telecom firms in the GST regime is unlikely to advance Digital India. The government’s position that 4G equipment does not fall within the ITA-I agreement where India has committed to waive duties is technically correct, but poses a challenge in implementation. Continuing with zero import duties on all telecom and IT products while treating local production as deemed exports and reimbursing the GST they pay is a superior way to protect domestic manufacturers as compared to raising tariff walls.

India has welcomed the WTO’s trade facilitation agreement for cross-border commerce in goods, and rightly pressed for a similar agreement of services, given its comparative advantage in services. However, to press home this advantage, India should be accommodative in the goods market."
Misogynist minister: Babul Supriyo’s take on Chandigarh stalking is an embarrassment for BJP,"The Chandigarh stalking and attempted kidnapping case has exposed yet another BJP leader for harbouring a sexist, patriarchal mindset. This time it is Union minister Babul Supriyo who has embarrassed the party. Taking to social media to make light of the stalking incident where Vikas Barala – son of Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala – is an accused, Supriyo first questioned why a kidnapping charge should be raised in the case. This despite the fact survivor Varnika Kundu mentioned that the perpetrators tried to abduct her. Supriyo then questioned the logic of highlighting the political credentials of the accused’s father – as if he is entirely oblivious about politicians influencing police cases in this country.

But what really took the cake was Supriyo’s tweet, “We all went to college and know, like reel, ‘Boy chase Girl’ exists in real life too”. Justifying a serious case of stalking and attempted abduction by comparing it to how college romances are depicted in movies is gross and downright deplorable. It’s precisely this dreadful mindset that percolates down to administration and police, loading the system against women in general and victims of sexual crimes in particular. That in turn enables more such crimes to be committed.

Supriyo ought to know that stalking is a serious offence. And the Chandigarh incident was very far from a filmy lovelorn boy chasing a girl. Had the Chandigarh police not intervened in a timely manner, there’s no telling what Varnika would have had to face. At a time when the top echelon of the BJP leadership is emphasising the need to empower women, Supriyo should know better than to be utterly insensitive and callous about sex crimes. More so as a Union minister, from whom a bare minimum of social responsibility and basic courtesy is called for."

Dalai On Doklam: India and China have to live side by side,"In an interesting statement, the Dalai Lama has said that the Doklam standoff between India and China is not very serious and the two countries have to live side by side in the spirit of ‘Hindi-Chini bhai bhai’. Needless to say Beijing is no fan of the Tibetan spiritual leader. Yet, the latter’s assessment of the Doklam issue – which has already shown some signs of thawing at the ground level – could be accurate. Some friction has been created between New Delhi and Beijing after Indian troops stopped Chinese road-building activity in what it considers to be the Bhutanese territory of Doklam. However, China disputes this and maintains that the Doklam region is part of Chinese terrain.

Subsequently, Beijing has told New Delhi to withdraw its troops to the Indian side of the border unconditionally. However, New Delhi is in favour of a mutual withdrawal to de-escalate the situation. With the standoff entering its seventh week, there are concerns in some quarters that the possibility of action to break the impasse is rising. However, let’s be clear that conflict over the Doklam issue will be really silly. India-China relations are too important to be allowed to be damaged by such a small incident. Plus, for the sake of Asian prosperity India and China need to get along and find ways to manage their differences peacefully.

In fact, it’s my understanding that neither India nor China wants the Doklam issue to get out of hand, notwithstanding the sharp rhetoric around the issue. In this respect, I agree with the Dalai Lama’s assessment that the Doklam standoff is not serious. However, the problem is that with strong, nationalist governments in New Delhi and Beijing, neither side can afford to appear weak. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been winning elections in India based on his ‘Iron Man’ image, President Xi Jinping is effecting stringent reforms in China to realise the ‘Great Chinese Dream’ of national rejuvenation. Besides, Modi is already working towards his 2019 re-election, while Xi has to contend with an important Chinese Communist Party congress later this year.

Hence, both leaders can’t appear to be soft to their domestic constituencies on matters of national interest. The only way out of this situation is through greater engagement between the two sides, sagacious diplomacy and quiet de-escalation on the ground. Meanwhile, the rhetoric around Doklam, while not always controllable, needs to be kept within limits. Both sides would do well to remind themselves that they have bigger issues to deal with. The Indian government needs to create more jobs. For the Chinese government North Korea is a bigger security challenge right now. New Delhi and Beijing have the capacity to peacefully resolve Doklam. Let’s not blow the issue out of proportion."
"For Shikha Pandey, Being An Inspiration To Young Girls For Taking Up Cricket Is The Best Reward After World Cup","Shikha Pandey was one of the mainstays of the team which did India proud at the Women's World Cup.

ICC

Mithali Raj's girls finished as finalists and despite not winning the trophy, certainly made the country sit up and take notice.

While many rewards have been bestowed on the ladies, for Pandey, the best reward is being an inspiration for girls to take up the game.

ICC

""I am really excited by the brand of cricket that we played this World Cup. It was aggressive and confident. We have spoken a lot about how we want to play with a positive intent and improve with every game and it was great that we were able to execute it in a big tournament like the World Cup. I certainly hope that our performances have inspired many young girls to play cricket, and most importantly, I hope their parents support them,"" she said in an exclusive interview to DNA.

She has come a long way since her days as an Air Traffic Controller. The woman has no regrets over her career choice and one hopes cricket develops a following among the girls too.

ICC

It's still early days, but a good show on the biggest stage is the perfect base to build this dream on."
Gujarat cliffhanger: Ahmed Patel wins prestige battle but Congress must revamp immediately to stay afloat,"Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections witnessed a high-voltage contest that went down to the wire. Counting of votes was held up multiple times due to technical issues. While BJP president Amit Shah and Union textile minister Smriti Irani sailed through, Congress’s top strategist Ahmed Patel benefited from the final counting of votes and just about managed to scrape into Rajya Sabha. In the process, Congress displayed it is capable of putting up a fight against the might of BJP, particularly since some of its own legislators had jumped camp earlier.

After Patel won the battle of nerves, Congress leaders are describing it as a historic win which will change fortunes of the party. This, however, is premature given the flight of its legislators and partymen in Gujarat, including the formidable Shankersinh Vaghela. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh pointed out recently that the party is facing an existential crisis that’s deeper than an electoral crisis, and that party leaders are behaving like sultans despite having lost their sultanate.

Congress needs to reboot immediately if it wants to remain relevant in today’s politics. The leadership space needs to open beyond a select coterie of individuals like Patel or Rahul Gandhi. BJP changed two chief ministers and as many state presidents in Gujarat in the past three years, while Congress restricted its top leadership positions to very few over the past 15 years.

On BJP’s part, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani has indicated the party is exploring legal options to challenge EC’s decision to invalidate two votes. This is entirely unnecessary and sets an unhealthy precedent. After all, the same BJP was happy to abide by EC’s decision to invalidate 14 Congress votes on similar technical grounds in Haryana last year, which resulted in a BJP-backed candidate winning the Rajya Sabha election. BJP on its part should respect the Gujarat verdict, and take solace in the fact that it managed to reduce its principal opposition party from 57 to just 43 MLAs just a few months before the assembly elections. If the electoral watchdog is challenged at every turn, it is equivalent to challenging the umpire at a cricket match for every decision he takes, paving the way for anarchy. The battle was hard fought. But an end must be declared now."
