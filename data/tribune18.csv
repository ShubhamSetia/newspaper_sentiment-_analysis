Devendra Jhajharia’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing ever since his name was recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. While there is a deluge of congratulatory messages on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, his native home in Rajasthan is being frequented by politicians and bureaucrats.

The award has suddenly brought the focus on this two-time Paralympics gold medalist. “It’s been a surreal few days,” said an elated Jhajharia over the phone from his village Jhajharian ki Dhani in Churu district.

“It’s like a dream come true. I waited 12 years for this honour, since winning the gold at 2004 Athens Paralympics. The award has given a ray of hope to other para athletes in the country,” said the javelin thrower and Rio Paralympics gold medalist.

August 29 would, indeed be, a watershed moment in para-athletics, as Jhajharia will become the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Each day a new fight

For para-athletes, such moments of joy during their professional career are far and few between. Instead, they have an everyday fight on their hand for recognition, equality and, more importantly, against bureaucratic red-tapism.

Last month, para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande was forced to beg in Berlin, Germany, after she apparently ran out of money to meet her expenses while competing in a week-long tournament.

Recently, a 62-member Indian contingent of hearing-impaired athletes, returning after its best-ever performance at the Deaf Olympic Games in Turkey, protested when no official from the Sports Ministry or the Sports Authority of India came to receive them at the Delhi International Airport. “Time and again, we have been failed by the system,” said Haryana’s Paralympian and Arjuna awardee discus thrower Amit Saroha.

Spurred by taunts

Recalling his struggle, Saroha said the fight was not about coming out of the hospital following a horrific car accident in 2007 but being able to find acceptance in the society.

“I wanted encouragement, not sympathy. I wanted the Tri-colour wrapped around my body, not a consoling hand on my shoulder,” said Saroha, a gold medallist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Para Games and a silver medalist at 2015 and 2017 editions of the World Championships.

“My lower body had become paralysed after the accident. I didn’t want to sit idle at home. Since I had been a National-level hockey player until 2003, I decided to participate in throw ball and discus throw events. But, the Paralympic Committee of Haryana (PCH) refused to accept my candidature,” said Saroha.

“The accident had left me quadriplegic (with paralysis of all four limbs). The PCH officials were convinced that my upper body wouldn’t be able to generate the strength required to throw the discus. I had to run from pillar-to-post for my selection in the Indian team. It was only when I won my first international medal (a silver in discus throw) at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Para Games that the attitude of people changed,” added the 32-year-old from Sonepat.

Jhajharia had his own poignant tale to share.

“Since childhood, I was considered physically weak. My classmates would make fun of my thin frame. To become physically stronger, I started participating in sports. But things took a turn for the worse. At eight, while climbing a tree, I was electrocuted after accidently touching a live wire. This led to the amputation of my left arm. I would be taunted with comments like “tundla ho gaya hai” (his hand has become disabled). It was a nightmare.”

“In 1995, I participated in a district-level championship for students. All other participants were able-bodied. I became district champion after winning the tournament. That was the turning point of my life. Later, when I won gold medal at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2002 and at the Athens Paralympic Games in 2004, I shut the mouth of all those who had told my parents that I wouldn’t be able to do anything in my life,” added the 36-year-old.

What keeps them going

“Simple, to see the Tricolour rise and hear the National Anthem during the medal ceremony. People who have never experienced it won’t understand. You can’t describe the feeling of pride in words,” said high-jumper Sharad Kumar, who won a silver medal at the recent World Para-athletics in London.

“It’s also our way of living with dignity. We para-athletes feel ignored and discriminated. But, we have found solace in sports. I only have problem with my leg but the able-bodied have problem with their mind and heart. They are more disabled than us,” added the 2014 Incheon Para Asian Games gold medalist, who suffered paralysis of his left leg after being administered wrong medicine for polio at the age of two.

Tragedy struck Sundar Singh Gurjar when he lost his left hand in a car accident in 2015. He created history by becoming the first Indian to win gold in men’s javelin throw event at the Worlds recently.

“I had been competing as a javelin thrower till that fateful evening. But, before anybody could point a finger at me, I made sure to continue pursuing my sports career. I didn’t want people to make fun of my disability.”

The gold at the Worlds was a redemption for Gurjar, who missed an announcement call for his name at the Rio Paralympics as he failed to understand the accent of the announcer. He reached the arena a minute late to find that he’d been disqualified.

“This shows the indifferent attitude of the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI). What exactly was the official attached to our contingent doing when my name was called? The PCI official should have ensured my participation. I was left to fend for myself,” Gurjar said.

Giving back to the game

In spite of the hardships faced by them, these shining lights of para-athletics are a role model for other differently abled athletes. Saroha spends his entire salary of Rs 40,000 per month — which he earns as a coach at the SAI’s Sonepat centre — on providing training and arranging for exposure trips abroad of some of his protégés like Dharambir Nain, Amit Balwan, Sunil, Rampal Chahar, Rinku Hooda and Ekta, among others. At present, Saroha is funding 17 para-athletes.

“If I’ll help others, only then God will help me,” said Saroha.

“Whatever cash award I receive from the Haryana government, I spend the amount on funding my trainees. I don’t want other para-athletes to go through the same struggle I was subjected to.”

Both Jhajharia and Deepa Malik, Rio Paralympics silver medallists from Haryana, have written to their respective state governments to provide them land to open a sports academy for para-athletes in Jaipur and Gurugram, respectively."
SC seeks Centre’s reply on compensating 10-year-old rape victim,"Satya Prakash

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 18

A day after a 10-year-old rape survivor from Chandigarh delivered a baby, the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and the Chandigarh Administration on a petition seeking a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for her.

The notices were issued on a plea by senior counsel Indira Jaising, who was appointed as amicus curiae by the top court on March 27, 2015, and asked her to file a brief detailing the position of law and suggestions on the issue of non-payment of victim compensation in a timely manner.

“A 10-year-old mother cannot look after the child. Nothing has been paid to her so far,” Jaising told a Bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur, which also asked National Legal Services Authority and the Chandigarh District Legal Services Authority to respond to her plea.

As she said the authorities insisted that compensation would be given only after filing of a chargesheet in the case, the Bench said: “That is no answer ... What they say is absurd.”

Jaising pointed out that another Bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra on Thursday ordered the Bihar Government to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to a 35-year-old HIV+ve rape survivor whose unwanted pregnancy could not be terminated due to inordinate delay in the decision making process.

“It is just and necessary that the victim girl is rehabilitated with change of identity, her education be completed, and she is rehabilitated and be integrated with the society for which adequate compensation is required to achieve this aim,” read the plea filed by Jaising.

She said the compensation given to the rape victim should be for all means including, but not restricted to, her education, post therapeutic care, vocation and rehabilitation.

“It is therefore necessary that the girl child be provided with an amount of Rs 10 lakh, of which Rs 3 lakh may be directed to be deposited forthwith; whereas the balance amount of Rs 7 lakh may be deposited in an interest-bearing fixed deposit amount that may be utilised for the welfare of the minor girl,” it further read.

“Although in rape cases, the Union Territory of Chandigarh provides for a compensatory amount of Rs 3 lakh towards the medical expenses, therapeutic care, rehabilitation and post-surgical treatment, in the instant case, a paltry amount of Rs. 10,000 has been given to the family of the minor rape survivor,” read the plea.

In her plea, Jaising said the minor’s parents wanted to give the child away in adoption “so that they do not live with the trauma of rape of their ten-year-old daughter”.

She demanded a fast track trial under POCSO on a priority basis and a competent support person for her during the trial.

Jaising also requested the court to ensure that identity of the child and her parents was protected from all publication and that there was no media reporting of the trial.

The top court had on July 28 dismissed the plea for permission for terminating the 32-week-old pregnancy of the 10-year-old rape survivor, after a medical board of doctors from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, opined against it. The minor had become pregnant after being allegedly raped by her uncle.

Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, a woman is not permitted to abort her foetus after the pregnancy crosses 20 weeks, unless the mother’s life is at risk. It’s for this reason that often pregnant women move the top court for permission to terminate pregnancy that has crossed 20 weeks."

"Dry spell persists, farmers worried","State receives 15% less rainfall compared with last year

Varinder Singh

Tribune News Service

Bathinda/Ferozepur, Aug 17

The prolonged dry spell in the state is a cause for concern for farmers. And there seems to be no respite in sight, for the forecast indicates “increased rain deficiency” till August-end. Experts say rain deficiency is not only going to increase the cost of production, but will also put pressure on the already over-stressed water table. “There can be occasional thunderstorms coupled with slight rainfall, but there seems no possibility of incessant rainfall in the near future,” Surinder Pal Singh, Director, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Chandigarh, told The Tribune. The state has witnessed a rainfall deficiency 15 per cent between June 1 and August 17. Against the average expected rainfall of 336.2 mm during this period, the state has received 284.8 mm this season — a shortfall of 15.2 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Farm experts say that humid weather minus rains is likely to increase pest attacks on paddy. “In Jalandhar and other parts of Doaba, paddy has already been damaged,” an expert says and adds “the impact of the whitefly attack could have been less severe if the Malwa region had received adequate rainfall. The pest larvae get washed away by rains, but it hasn’t happened this time because of lack of showers”. Dr Lakhbir Kaur Dhaliwal, a professor of agricultural meteorology at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, says: “The prevailing weather conditions can wreak havoc with the farm economy if it doesn’t rain in the coming week.” Dr BS Sidhu, Commissioner (Agriculture), says that at the surface, there seems to be no problem as farmers are getting eight hours of free power supply every day for irrigating their paddy fields. But he adds, “The lack of rains is forcing farmers to concentrate only on watering the paddy during eight hours of power supply. They hardly pay attention to the irrigation of other crops such as cotton.” As for basmati and vegetable growers of Ferozepur and Fazilka districts, they have incurred a loss of loss of up to 20 per cent. Basmati has been damaged fully or partially in Kammikhera, Sainian, Muthianwali and Kabool Shah villages of Fazilka district, while vegetables such as bitter gourd and green chillis have been damaged by virus and pests. “My bitter gourd was devastated by virus and pests, which thrive during high temperature and humid conditions,” said Ravi Kant, a progressive farmer from Fazilka’s Nihalkhera village."
Indian-American among scientists to identify new potential breast cancer drug,"Houston, August 18

Scientists, including an Indian-American researcher, have identified a molecule that can help treat breast cancer, giving hope to patients who have become resistant to traditional therapies.

The first-in-class molecule shuts down oestrogen- sensitive breast cancer in a new way, researchers said.

First-in-class drugs are those that work by a unique mechanism - in this case a molecule that targets a protein on the oestrogen receptor of tumour cells.

The potential drug offers hope for patients whose breast cancer has become resistant to traditional therapies.

""This is a fundamentally different, new class of agents for oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer,"" said Ganesh Raj, professor at the University of Texas Southwestern (UT Southwestern) Simmons Cancer Center.

""Its unique mechanism of action overcomes the limitations of current therapies,"" Raj said.

All breast cancers are tested to determine if they require oestrogen to grow and about 80 per cent are found to be oestrogen-sensitive, researchers said.

These cancers can often be effectively treated with hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen, but as many as a third of these cancers eventually become resistant, they said.

The new compound is a potential highly effective, next- line treatment for these patients, said Raj.

Traditional hormonal drugs, such as tamoxifen, work by attaching to a molecule called the oestrogen receptor in cancer cells, preventing oestrogen from binding to the receptor, a necessary step for cancer cells to multiply.

However, the oestrogen receptor can mutate and change its shape over time so that the treatment drug no longer fits neatly with the receptor. When this happens, the cancer cells start multiplying again.

""There has been intense interest in developing drugs that block the ability of the oestrogen receptor - the prime target in most breast cancers - from interacting with the co- regulator proteins that cause a tumour's growth,"" said David Mangelsdorf, professor at UT Southwestern.

Blocking such ""protein-protein interactions"" has been a dream of cancer researchers for decades.

The drug works by blocking other molecules - proteins called co-factors - that also must attach to the oestrogen receptor for cancer cells to multiply.

The new molecule, dubbed ERX-11, mimics a peptide, or protein building block.

So far, it has been tested in mice and in cancer cells removed from patients and works well in both models, and there have been no signs of toxicity in the tests.

If successfully translated to a human therapy, another advantage of ERX-11 is that it could be taken orally by patients, rather than as an infusion.

The researchers are hoping to get a clinical trial under way in about a year. The notion of blocking protein co-factors has implications for treatment of other cancers as well. —PTI"

LONDON: Scientists have created sperm cells from small pieces of ear tissue to help genetically infertile male mice produce healthy offspring, an advance that may pave the way for novel therapies to treat human infertility.

London

Scientists have created sperm cells from small pieces of ear tissue to help genetically infertile male mice produce healthy offspring, an advance that may pave the way for novel therapies to treat human infertility.

Our sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes, researchers said. Usually, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y (XY), but about one in 500 men are born with an extra X or Y.

Having three rather than two sex chromosomes can disrupt formation of mature sperm and cause infertility.

In a study published in the journal Science, researchers at the Francis Crick Institute in the UK have found a way to remove the extra sex chromosome to produce fertile offspring.

If the findings can be safely transferred into humans, it might eventually be possible for men with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Double Y syndrome (XYY) that are infertile to have children through assisted reproduction using this technique.

The team took small pieces of ear tissue from XXY and XYY mice, cultured them and collected connective tissue cells known as fibroblasts.

They turned the fibroblasts into stem cells and noticed that in the process, some of the cells lost the extra sex chromosome.

With an existing method, they used specific chemical signals to 'guide' the stem cells into becoming cells that have the potential to become sperm. These cells developed into mature sperm when injected into the testes of a host mouse.

The researchers then harvested these mature sperm and used them through assisted reproduction to create healthy, fertile offspring.

""Our approach allowed us to create offspring from sterile XXY and XYY mice,"" said Takayuki Hirota from the Francis Crick Institute.

""It would be interesting to see whether the same approach could one day be used as a fertility treatment for men with three sex chromosomes,"" said Hirota.

In a preliminary experiment, the team found that stem cells produced from fibroblasts of men with Klinefelter syndrome also lost the extra sex chromosome.

""There is currently no way to make mature sperm outside of the body. In our mouse experiments we have to inject cells that have the potential to become sperm back into the testes to help them finish developing,"" said James Turner, Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute.

""But we found that this caused tumours in some of the mouse recipients. So reducing the risk of tumour formation or discovering a way to produce mature sperm in a test tube will have to be developed before we can even consider this in humans,"" said Turner. —PTI"

Virat Kohli continues to top ICC ODI rankings for batsmen,"Dubai, August 18

India captain Virat Kohli continued to be the world’s top-ranked One-day batsman in the latest ICC ODI rankings, released here on Friday.

Having 873 points in his kitty, Kohli will have a chance to increase the 12-point lead over second-placed Australian David Warner at the upcoming five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting in Dambulla on Sunday.

Other Indian batsmen in the top-15 are former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (12th), Shikhar Dhawan (13th) and vice-captain Rohit Sharma (14th).

However, no Indian bowler figures in the top-10 list. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (13th) is the lone Indian in top 15.

As for the ICC ODI Team Rankings, India are currently at number three and they would have to win the upcoming series at least by a 4-1 margin to ensure that they stay at that position, ahead of England.

At 114 points, India, even if they win the series 3-2, will slip to 113 points and behind England on decimal points.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will by eyeing the chance to seal direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 during the upcoming series.

The 1996 World Champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a place in the pinnacle 50-over competition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies.

The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30. Sri Lanka are placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies team, which has an unenviable task in its aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain direct qualification.

The bottom four sides on the ICC ODI Team Rankings will need to play a qualifying event, also featuring the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League.

The top two teams from this event will get to play in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

Winning two matches will take Sri Lanka to 90 points, while the Windies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.

However, a 4-1 win for India will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and the Caribbean side could edge it on decimal points if they win all their upcoming six matches.

The West Indies side will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka lose 0-5 to India. — PTI"

Chandigarh, August 18

In a major relief for the residents, the Chandigarh Administration has decided to allow conversion of residential leasehold properties into freehold.

This was announced by MP Kirron Kher on Friday amidst the presence of large numbers of the BJP workers at the UT guest house.

Addressing a press conference, Kher said while the administration has allowed the conversion of the residential properties the demand for the conversion of the commercial and the industrial properties will also be fulfilled soon.

All the commercial and industrial properties are on leasehold in comparison to the residential properties which are mostly already converted into freehold.

The administration has kept the policy at abeyance since 2013 after the matter was referred to MHA for re-fixation of conversion charges.

Kher said Ministry of Urban Development has clarified in July 2017 that the power to fix the land rates for conversion of leasehold residential properties to freehold has been delegated to the administrator at the time of sanction given to original scheme in 1996.

Accordingly decision has been taken to fix collector rates to be used as land rates in the formula for calculation of conversion charges.

She said that a new fund “Urban Development Fund” is being created into which the conversion charges shall be deposited.

This fund shall be utilised in accordance with guidelines of the ministry. The projects related to development of urban infrastructure shall be funded from this.

Commissioner Municipal Corporation shall be administrative in-charge and shall be custodian on behalf of Chandigarh Administration.

He shall release the funds to the projects sanctioned and given approval by Chandigarh Administration.

Kher said that it has also been decided to calculate conversion charges for LIG/MIG/HIG/EWS/Cheap Houses on pro-rata increase done in land rates.

These rates shall be notified within a week’s time and after that residents can apply for conversion of their leasehold properties into freehold properties."

Chandigarh, August 17

The 10-year-old-girl who was raped by her uncle gave birth to a girl child through C-section at Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 here today. The child was born after 35 weeks of pregnancy, which was discovered last month. The Supreme Court had last month turned down a plea by the victim’s parents for the termination of pregnancy following a report by a medical board, set up by the PGIMER, which observed this was not possible as the pregnancy was at an advance stage. A similar PIL was refused by a district court in Chandigarh on July 18.A team of doctors, including senior gynaecologists Dr Poonam Goel and Dr Bharti Goel, performed a caesarean operation at 9.20 am. The victim was told a huge stone in her belly had been removed surgically. After the operation, she spent the day watching her favourite cartoon show on the TV. She was later shifted to a private ward. The newborn was kept in an incubator at the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU). None from the girl’s family visited the newborn, who will remain in the custody of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Chandigarh, till she is adopted. Dr Ravi Gupta, Medical Superintendent, GMCH, congratulated the team. “We were under tremendous pressure. it was a sensitive case and the entire nation was watching us. Both the girl and the child are doing well,” he said. The doctors, who met yesterday, had decided on the C-section as the victim’s pelvic bone and muscles were too weak to endure labour pain at full term."

"West Bengal, Kerala oppose centralised selection of subordinate judges","Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 18

The proposal to install a centralised examination system for the selection of subordinate court judges on Friday met with vehement opposition from certain states, including West Bengal and Kerala, which said the move was against the basic structure of the Constitution. During hearing on a PIL seeking streamlining of judicial appointments in subordinate courts, senior counsel Rakesh Dwivedi told a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar that any such centralised system would “dislocate” the scheme for appointment of subordinate court judges provided under Article 233 of the Constitution. According to Article 233, appointments, postings and promotions of district judges in any state have to be made by the Governor in consultation with the High Court having jurisdiction in relation to the in question. He said the term ‘appointment’ appearing in Article 233 was a comprehensive expression which included the entire process and it has to be construed like that only. “There should be a detailed discussion. Let it go to a Constitution Bench. There should be no hurry…You can hold that Article 233 does not exist,” Dwivedi told the Bench. As the court talked about a large number of vacancies in subordinate courts, Dwivedi said there were huge vacancies even in high courts. “Should we change the collegium system?” he wondered. “What you are proposing is a fundamental revolution…In such a system states may not have a voice…It will affect the federal structure,” the state’s counsel had told the Bench last month. Dwivedi’s submissions were supported by senior counsel Joydeep Gupta, representing Kerala, who said any centralized system of appointment for subordinate judiciary would violate basic structure of the Constitution. Gupta said such a system would not only go against federalism and independence of state judiciary and would make a mockery of the process envisaged under Article 233. Opposing the proposed system which would not be under the control of any state of high court and there would be people from outside the state, he said the governor can’t consult anybody except the high court concerned. As arguments remained inconclusive, the Bench said it would hear the matter on Monday and Tuesday in the post-lunch session. A decision can be expected before August 27 when CJI Khehar is due to retire. While most of the states and high courts agreed to the proposal, many of them have opposed the proposal to install a centralised examination system for selection of subordinate court judges, saying it went against federal structure of the Constitution and curtailed high courts’ autonomy. Some southern states have raised concern about language and implementation of their state specific reservation policy in any such centralised system of selection of subordinate court judges. The Bench has repeatedly clarified that all state-specific rules and reservation policy would continue to be adhered to even after coming into effect of the centralised examination system. The new system was primarily aimed at doing away with the inordinate delay in judicial appointments in subordinate courts, it said. The top court had on May 9 issued notices to the Centre and all the state governments on a PIL seeking streamlining of judicial appointments in subordinate courts and ensuring timely filling up of vacancies to deal with backlog of millions of cases. Under the proposed centralised exam system, a candidate would be able to apply for more than one state, if he/she fulfilled the eligibility requirements of the states he/she wanted to be considered for, the Bench said. The Bench had converted a letter written by Justice Secretary Snehlata Shrivastava to Supreme Court Secretary General Ravindra Maithani highlighting the problem of unfilled judicial vacancies in subordinate courts into a PIL in order to deal with the problem. The government has been highlighting that most of the judicial vacancies were in the subordinate courts where bulk of the cases were pending, it had noted. The majority of around three crore cases pending in various courts, over 2.30 crore cases are pending in district courts which have a sanctioned strength of over 21,000 judges. But there are only around 17,000 judges working in subordinate courts across India, leaving a vacancy of around 4,000 judges. The Justice Secretary’s letter dated May 1, 2017, referred to a discussion held in the Supreme Court under the chairmanship of Justice AK Goel in his capacity as Chairman of Arrears Committee on April 8 in which members of the Judiciary and the Government “explored areas of Judicial Reforms to accomplish constitutional goal of speedy justice and access to justice for all”."
The Tribune,"LONDON: An Indian-origin mother whose daughter committed suicide last year after suffering physical and emotional abuse at the hands of an ex-boyfriend has written to a UK police force to disclose evidence linked to the death and take action against the culprit.

London, August 18

An Indian-origin mother whose daughter committed suicide last year after suffering physical and emotional abuse at the hands of an ex-boyfriend has written to a UK police force to disclose evidence linked to the death and take action against the culprit.

Daksha Dalal wants Leicestershire Police to hand over any evidence they hold so her family can consider a private prosecution over the death of 25-year-old Meera Dalal in February last year.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting suicide on the day Meera Dalal died but was released with no further action.

An inquest into her death in May this year was told that she took her own life as a result of domestic violence.

“I seriously felt as if I would get some justice from the police but I didn’t. A loss of a child is an intense grief that you will never, ever be able to overcome. If I could help one girl, one child or somebody’s daughter, that would make me happy,” Daksha Dalal told the BBC.

She is trying to obtain copies of her daughter’s medical records, along with other evidence held by police and has written to Leicestershire Police asking for hospital and doctors’ reports, an audio recording of a call her daughter made to police, CCTV footage of the former boyfriend at her daughter’s workplace and all police reports in relation to the investigation.

A general physician report read out at the inquest earlier this year said Dalal was given treatment in hospital on one occasion, “having been the subject of domestic violence”.

The inquest had concluded that the former liaison officer for Nuffield Health, a private hospital in Leicester, died as a result of suicide.

The family had made a complaint to Leicestershire Police following Dalal’s death and the force was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

The 50-page investigation report contains a catalogue of police incidents involving Dalal and her then boyfriend dating back to December 2013.

The conduct of four police officers was investigated by the IPCC, but the investigator found there was no case to answer for misconduct.

Leicestershire Police said: “Following a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Meera Dalal who died on 15 February 2016, police found no evidence to warrant a prosecution being brought by the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service).

“As a result of her death, and previous contact between Leicestershire Police and Meera, an inquiry was conducted by the IPCC, which concluded there was insufficient evidence to consider misconduct proceedings and there was no case to answer for the officers involved.”

The IPCC said: “On the basis of the evidence available, and at the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator formed the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable misconduct meeting could find that any of the officers had breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour, Duties and Responsibilities.”

Dalal killed herself at her family home at Syston in Leicestershire and was discovered by her father Ashok Dalal.

Her mother has since been raising awareness of domestic abuse through a Facebook page in her daughter’s memory. — PTI"
"Repression can’t resolve Kashmir problem, compassion can: Mirwaiz","Srinagar, August 18

Senior separatist leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq on Friday warned that repression can never resolve the Kashmir problem and killing one militant will only produce 10 more.

Delivering a fiery speech at the Friday congressional prayers inside the Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta area, Mirwaiz Umer said: “Aggression and repression can never resolve issues but only aggravate them.

“As long as there is repression and force as the State response, you may kill one (militant) but 10 more will stand up. Killing them (militants) is no solution as is evident from the huge attendance at their funerals.

“Those who think the Kashmir problem can be resolved by killing militants must understand that militancy is a reaction to repression,” he added.

The leader of the moderate wing of Hurriyat Conference said the people of Jammu and Kashmir were waiting for a final resolution of their political problem which alone, he added, will end their suffering.

He said a resolution of the issue was possible provided there was willingness to accept facts with “compassion, humanity and mutual respect”.

The crowd roared with pro-freedom slogans when the Mirwaiz said repression cannot stop people from seeking their right of self-determination as guaranteed by the resolutions of the UN Security Council on Kashmir.

Immediately after the Friday prayers, dozens of stone-pelting youths clashed with security forces in Nowhatta.

Security forces used tear smoke shells to disperse the protesters, who kept re-grouping from the lanes and bylanes of the densely populated area.

Several people were injured in the clashes, police said.

The statement from Mirwaiz Umer assumes significance as it comes three days after he welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech where Modi said that neither ‘goli’ (bullet) nor ‘gaali’ (abuse) would resolve the Kashmir problem.

Modi then said that there can be peace only by “embracing the people of Kashmir”.

Authorities on Friday lifted the six-week-long house arrest restrictions on the Mirwaiz following which he offered Friday prayers at Jama Masjid and also delivered the traditional Friday sermon.

The hardline senior separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, continues to undergo treatment in the super specialty Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences in Srinagar where he was admitted after he complained of abdominal pain and weakness.

Another separatist leader, Muhammad Yasin Malik, who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), was released from detention last week. IANS"
"The Tribune, India news","NEW DELHI: The proposal to install a centralised examination system for the selection of subordinate court judges on Friday met with vehement opposition from certain states, including West Bengal and Kerala, which said the move was against the basic structure of the Constitution.

New Delhi, August 18

The proposal to install a centralised examination system for the selection of subordinate court judges on Friday met with vehement opposition from certain states, including West Bengal and Kerala, which said the move was against the basic structure of the Constitution.

During hearing on a PIL seeking streamlining of judicial appointments in subordinate courts, senior counsel Rakesh Dwivedi told a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar that any such centralised system would “dislocate” the scheme for appointment of subordinate court judges provided under Article 233 of the Constitution.

According to Article 233, appointments, postings and promotions of district judges in any state have to be made by the Governor in consultation with the High Court having jurisdiction in relation to the in question.

He said the term ‘appointment’ appearing in Article 233 was a comprehensive expression which included the entire process and it has to be construed like that only.

“There should be a detailed discussion. Let it go to a Constitution Bench. There should be no hurry…You can hold that Article 233 does not exist,” Dwivedi told the Bench.

As the court talked about a large number of vacancies in subordinate courts, Dwivedi said there were huge vacancies even in high courts. “Should we change the collegium system?” he wondered.

“What you are proposing is a fundamental revolution…In such a system states may not have a voice…It will affect the federal structure,” the state’s counsel had told the Bench last month.

Dwivedi’s submissions were supported by senior counsel Joydeep Gupta, representing Kerala, who said any centralized system of appointment for subordinate judiciary would violate basic structure of the Constitution.

Gupta said such a system would not only go against federalism and independence of state judiciary and would make a mockery of the process envisaged under Article 233.

Opposing the proposed system which would not be under the control of any state of high court and there would be people from outside the state, he said the governor can’t consult anybody except the high court concerned.

As arguments remained inconclusive, the Bench said it would hear the matter on Monday and Tuesday in the post-lunch session. A decision can be expected before August 27 when CJI Khehar is due to retire.

While most of the states and high courts agreed to the proposal, many of them have opposed the proposal to install a centralised examination system for selection of subordinate court judges, saying it went against federal structure of the Constitution and curtailed high courts’ autonomy.

Some southern states have raised concern about language and implementation of their state specific reservation policy in any such centralised system of selection of subordinate court judges.

The Bench has repeatedly clarified that all state-specific rules and reservation policy would continue to be adhered to even after coming into effect of the centralised examination system. The new system was primarily aimed at doing away with the inordinate delay in judicial appointments in subordinate courts, it said.

The top court had on May 9 issued notices to the Centre and all the state governments on a PIL seeking streamlining of judicial appointments in subordinate courts and ensuring timely filling up of vacancies to deal with backlog of millions of cases.

Under the proposed centralised exam system, a candidate would be able to apply for more than one state, if he/she fulfilled the eligibility requirements of the states he/she wanted to be considered for, the Bench said.

The Bench had converted a letter written by Justice Secretary Snehlata Shrivastava to Supreme Court Secretary General Ravindra Maithani highlighting the problem of unfilled judicial vacancies in subordinate courts into a PIL in order to deal with the problem.

The government has been highlighting that most of the judicial vacancies were in the subordinate courts where bulk of the cases were pending, it had noted.

The majority of around three crore cases pending in various courts, over 2.30 crore cases are pending in district courts which have a sanctioned strength of over 21,000 judges. But there are only around 17,000 judges working in subordinate courts across India, leaving a vacancy of around 4,000 judges.

The Justice Secretary’s letter dated May 1, 2017, referred to a discussion held in the Supreme Court under the chairmanship of Justice AK Goel in his capacity as Chairman of Arrears Committee on April 8 in which members of the Judiciary and the Government “explored areas of Judicial Reforms to accomplish constitutional goal of speedy justice and access to justice for all”."

Sushil on comeback trail,"The two-time Olympics medalllist is returning to action with PWL after three years

Sabi Hussain

Tribune News Service

New delhi, august 17

Here’s some good news for the Indian wrestling fans. Double Olympics medallist Sushil Kumar is returning to the mat after a hiatus of three years. India’s most celebrated amateur grappler has decided to participate in the third edition of the Pro Wrestling League (PWL), which is tentatively scheduled for November-December this year. And if the London Olympics silver medallist finds his fitness and energy good enough to compete at the international level, he could consider throwing his hat in the ring for next year’s Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. “Yes, I will make a comeback with PWL. Just wait for another three months, and you will see Sushil’s 2.0 version,” Kumar told The Tribune in an exclusive chat. “This league will tell me where I stand in terms of skills and fitness. I’ll take the league as a fitness test. If everything goes right, then the CWG and the Asian Games are well within my sight.” “As for my weight category, I’ll discuss it with my coaches and then take a call. Ideally, I would like to compete in the 74kg category,” said the 34-year-old. Kumar was last seen in action at the 2014 Glasgow CWG, where he won gold in the 74kg category. Thereafter, he didn’t participate in any major championships, primarily owing to a shoulder injury and his acrimonious relationship with the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) following a bitter drama over selection for the Rio Olympics.

Tinge of Irony

Kumar’s return to action through PWL is quite ironical — the wrestler and WFI had fallen out with each other ahead of the inaugural edition of the league in 2015. After listing his name in the auction pool, Kumar had pulled out at the last minute, citing lack of fitness. However, many observers felt Kumar wasn’t happy with the way auction panned out. In the auction, Yogeshwar Dutt had emerged as the costliest buy ahead of him. Some felt Kumar was scared of fighting fellow grappler Narsingh Yadav, who had won a quota place for the Rio Games after securing a bronze at the Las Vegas Worlds, an Olympics qualification event which Kumar had skipped. Miffed over the last-minute pull-out, WFI termed it an act of indiscipline. Kumar’s no-show ruffled quite a few feathers in WFI, including federation president Brij Bhushan Singh. Things took turn for the worse when Singh rejected Kumar’s request for a selection trial against Yadav for a berth in the squad for Rio. The bickering soon reached the Delhi High Court, which ruled in Yadav’s favour, shattering Kumar’s dream of featuring in a record fourth Olympics. Although Yadav was later caught in dope net and was subsequently banned following a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), the murky saga damaged the relationship between Kumar and WFI. It also led to Kumar skipping PWL’s second edition. However, with Kumar confirming his participation in PWL’s upcoming season, it could be assumed that both the parties have buried the hatchet. “You know the kind of man I am. I don’t hold grudges against people for long. Everything is heading in a positive direction. If WFI is ready to welcome me, then why should I hold back,” he said.

Benefiting from Yadav’s absence

Sushil is also benefitting from Narsingh’s absence to some extent. With Narsingh banned for four years, the 74kg category is up for grabs, and there’s no other wrestler in this category at the moment who can challenge Kumar."

Doklam and beyond,"Gen VP Malik (retd)

India must stand its ground

Gen VP Malik (retd)

THE ongoing China-Bhutan-India confrontation at the Doklam grazing ground is characterised less by soldiers sitting eyeball to eyeball and more with bullying, threatening and disparaging language being used by China against India. With soldiers from both sides digging in, the consequences of this confrontation remain unpredictable. On China’s India-specific attitude, I will start with the Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China Border Areas signed in1993. As a senior Army officer then, I was involved in discussions regarding military confidence-building measures with China, as well as advising Bhutan on the India-Bhutan-China border issues. Para 2 of the agreement stated: ‘The two sides agree to reduce their military forces along the LAC in conformity with the requirements of the principle of mutual and equal security to ceilings to be mutually agreed. The extent, depth, timing and nature of the reduction of the military along the LAC shall be determined through mutual consultations between the two countries. The reduction of military forces shall be carried out by stages in mutually agreed geographical locations sector-wise within the areas along the LAC.’ However, after the agreement, despite our best efforts, China backed out on the delineation or disclosure of its perception of the LAC, which had to be the start point for any troop reduction or relocation by either side. In 1996, during an official visit to China, I called on Gen Chi Haotian, then defence minister, and raised this issue. He not only brushed it aside, but also displayed his annoyance. I felt then — and do so now — that China wants to settle India-China boundary issue on its own terms, at some opportune time. China’s aggressive approach towards India began in the late 2000. It opposed nuclear exemption for India at the NSG, as it opposes India’s membership of the NSG now. Despite the political acceptance of Sikkim’s status within India, China has made attempt to create ambiguity on this issue. It started issuing ‘paper visa’ to travellers from J&K and Arunachal Pradesh. In the recent past, several incursions have been attempted in Ladakh. The Chumar incident took place when Chinese President Xi Jinping was being feted in India. China has refused to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist despite near unanimity in the UN on this issue. Beijing stopped bothering about India’s sensitivities when it began to use its economic and military clout to influence and wean away India’s South Asian neighbours. Its embrace of Pakistan has got tighter. China is now an integral part of India-Pakistan disputes. It took no notice when India objected to CPEC passing through the disputed territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, but felt insulted when India did not attend the OBOR jambooree in Beijing. With its string of pearls strategy, and CPEC entry to the Arabian Sea, its influence in the Indian Ocean and its littorals is expected to rise sharply. Doklam has been an ‘accepted’ disputed area between Bhutan and China since the 1980s. When China started road construction — a unilateral attempt to change the status quo in the area — Bhutan called for India’s help under the purview of India-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007. India’s action is also in its own national interest. If allowed to be completed, this road would not only extinguish Bhutan’s claim over Doklam, but also improve Chinese reach to India’s narrow Siliguri corridor. Yet another obvious purpose is to dent the good relations between India and Bhutan. Now to the larger, global perspective of China. Paul Kennedy in his book The Rise and Fall of Great Powers stated that ‘Long-term shifts in economic productivity of nations are co-terminus with the increase or decrease of their global influence’. After developing its economy and military power, China is now emerging as a revisionist, expansionist and a combative power; its ‘peaceful rise’ stage seems to be over. Under Jinping, it is pursuing a strong domestic national identity and the dream of once again becoming the Middle Kingdom. China has running territorial disputes with many countries, including India, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines and Vietnam. In the process, it has started asserting dubious claims, bullying smaller nations and adopting a defiant attitude like the one on the International Tribunal award over the South China Sea. In redrawing borders and expanding spheres of influence, China is indulging in cartographic subjectivity. History and selective interpretation of colonial-era decisions are quoted in accordance with its own prerogatives — China rejects McMahon Line with India as a colonial era accord, but accepts this line as a boundary with Myanmar. And now it cites the 1890 Anglo-Sikkim Convention in the case of India-China-Bhutan tri-junction in Chumbi Valley. India has displayed accommodation and timidity in dealing with China’s numerous provocations — its territorial claims, encroachments, nexus with Pakistan, supporting insurgencies inside India, trade imbalance, violation of bilateral agreements and opposing India’s vital interests in multilateral forums. After Doklam, this attitude may change. Any display of weakness will not only encourage Chinese coercion and bluster, but also impact India’s relations and credibility in South, Southeast and East Asia. India will need to carry out a holistic review of its China policy. In the last two months, China has made several military threats. Keeping in view the nuclear status of both countries and geopolitical sensitivities involved, I doubt if there can be a high intensity India-China armed conflict. A major armed skirmish in Chumbi Valley is also unlikely. The geography here places serious operational disadvantage to China. The scope of any limited conflict/skirmish can be expected to shift to the less accessible areas in Ladakh, Central Sector or Arunachal Pradesh, where it has better mobility and logistic advantages. Yet, another option China could adopt is to restart helping India’s secessionist elements in the North-East and along the Siliguri corridor. Or to use its cyber capabilities to damage any national-level IT-enabled systems. It would then be able to cause greater intimidation without going to war. While preferring a solution through a dialogue on equal terms, India must be prepared for all eventualities. There is considerable asymmetry in power potential between China and India. Without getting into an arms race, India must start thinking strategically to cope with China’s power. Doklam is a wakeup call to look at our defence capabilities and infrastructure along the LAC and to review the long comatose military transformation."
The Tribune: Jammu & Kashmir news,"SRINAGAR: National Conference working president Omar Abdullah on Friday sought a special session of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislature before August 29 to frame an appropriate response to counter the narrative on Article 35A of the Constitution.

Srinagar, August 18

National Conference working president Omar Abdullah on Friday sought a special session of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislature before August 29 to frame an appropriate response to counter the narrative on Article 35A of the Constitution.

The issue is of vital importance for the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh as abrogation of Article 35A will have serious ramifications, Omar said in a statement issued by the National Conference here.

The former chief minister expressed grave concern over the reported “unsatisfactory response” of the central and state governments in putting up a strong case before the Supreme Court, hearing a plea against the constitutional provision empowering the state to determine the issues with regard to permanent residence.

The observation of the Centre’s attorney that the issue needs wider discussions has created apprehension in the public mind about intentions of the BJP-led NDA government, he added.

In such a situation, the state legislature will have to take a call on this fundamental issue, especially as the Constitution empowers the Legislative Assembly to determine the issues with regard to permanent residence, Omar said.

He appreciated general consensus across the state, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or region, with regard to preserving of this significant constitutional guarantee bestowed upon Jammu and Kashmir by the Constitution of India.

Omar hoped that the people of Jammu and Kashmir would rise above party politics and fight every “overt or covert attempts to trample with Article 35A”, which is regional neutral, religious neutral and ethnic neutral.

He said abrogation of Article 35A would be detrimental to every segment of society in Jammu and Kashmir. — PTI"

Kareena Kapoor Khan says she is proud and happy that Bollywood filmmakers are now showing women in a progressive way.

The actor attributes this change to the influx of young writers in films.

In an interview to PTI, Kareena says, “One can definitely see a change in the way women have been portrayed on screen in the Hindi film industry.

“The roles are now written by young directors, who have been successful in highlighting the personality of women who are hardworking and successful. Films have now been portraying women in a more progressive manner.”

The 36-year-old actor, who was last seen in ‘Udta Punjab’, welcomed her first child, Taimur Ali Khan, in December last year.

Talking about balancing her work and motherhood, the actor says, “I have always maintained a personal and professional life but now it’s more difficult as Taimur is too young. I try to strike a balance. I have a great support system with (husband) Saif and my family.”

Kareena believes a modern Indian woman plays diverse roles in her life and she considers herself to be one.

“She is a multifaceted woman, lives her life to the fullest and fulfils her choices with confidence and style. I am proud to be a married, independent and working woman. I carry that with great honour and pride. Despite being married, I work and have my own identity.”

Kareena is all charged up to begin work on her next project ‘Veere Di Wedding’ alongside Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar.

However, she did not comment on the reports of her signing a biopic by Omung Kumar, another movie with Salman Khan and Karan Johar’s next.

Meanwhile, the ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ star is the muse of designer Anita Dongre’s autumn winter campaign #IamAND, which celebrates the multifaceted personality of the modern Indian woman.

“AND is one brand that has changed the fashion scenario in the country. With its new campaign, the brand conveys a very strong message of celebrating the multifaceted personality of the modern Indian woman, which I truly identify with,” says Kareena. PTI"

Devendra Jhajharia’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing ever since his name was recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. While there is a deluge of congratulatory messages on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, his native home in Rajasthan is being frequented by politicians and bureaucrats.

The award has suddenly brought the focus on this two-time Paralympics gold medalist. “It’s been a surreal few days,” said an elated Jhajharia over the phone from his village Jhajharian ki Dhani in Churu district.

“It’s like a dream come true. I waited 12 years for this honour, since winning the gold at 2004 Athens Paralympics. The award has given a ray of hope to other para athletes in the country,” said the javelin thrower and Rio Paralympics gold medalist.

August 29 would, indeed be, a watershed moment in para-athletics, as Jhajharia will become the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Each day a new fight

For para-athletes, such moments of joy during their professional career are far and few between. Instead, they have an everyday fight on their hand for recognition, equality and, more importantly, against bureaucratic red-tapism.

Last month, para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande was forced to beg in Berlin, Germany, after she apparently ran out of money to meet her expenses while competing in a week-long tournament.

Recently, a 62-member Indian contingent of hearing-impaired athletes, returning after its best-ever performance at the Deaf Olympic Games in Turkey, protested when no official from the Sports Ministry or the Sports Authority of India came to receive them at the Delhi International Airport. “Time and again, we have been failed by the system,” said Haryana’s Paralympian and Arjuna awardee discus thrower Amit Saroha.

Spurred by taunts

Recalling his struggle, Saroha said the fight was not about coming out of the hospital following a horrific car accident in 2007 but being able to find acceptance in the society.

“I wanted encouragement, not sympathy. I wanted the Tri-colour wrapped around my body, not a consoling hand on my shoulder,” said Saroha, a gold medallist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Para Games and a silver medalist at 2015 and 2017 editions of the World Championships.

“My lower body had become paralysed after the accident. I didn’t want to sit idle at home. Since I had been a National-level hockey player until 2003, I decided to participate in throw ball and discus throw events. But, the Paralympic Committee of Haryana (PCH) refused to accept my candidature,” said Saroha.

“The accident had left me quadriplegic (with paralysis of all four limbs). The PCH officials were convinced that my upper body wouldn’t be able to generate the strength required to throw the discus. I had to run from pillar-to-post for my selection in the Indian team. It was only when I won my first international medal (a silver in discus throw) at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Para Games that the attitude of people changed,” added the 32-year-old from Sonepat.

Jhajharia had his own poignant tale to share.

“Since childhood, I was considered physically weak. My classmates would make fun of my thin frame. To become physically stronger, I started participating in sports. But things took a turn for the worse. At eight, while climbing a tree, I was electrocuted after accidently touching a live wire. This led to the amputation of my left arm. I would be taunted with comments like “tundla ho gaya hai” (his hand has become disabled). It was a nightmare.”

“In 1995, I participated in a district-level championship for students. All other participants were able-bodied. I became district champion after winning the tournament. That was the turning point of my life. Later, when I won gold medal at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2002 and at the Athens Paralympic Games in 2004, I shut the mouth of all those who had told my parents that I wouldn’t be able to do anything in my life,” added the 36-year-old.

What keeps them going

“Simple, to see the Tricolour rise and hear the National Anthem during the medal ceremony. People who have never experienced it won’t understand. You can’t describe the feeling of pride in words,” said high-jumper Sharad Kumar, who won a silver medal at the recent World Para-athletics in London.

“It’s also our way of living with dignity. We para-athletes feel ignored and discriminated. But, we have found solace in sports. I only have problem with my leg but the able-bodied have problem with their mind and heart. They are more disabled than us,” added the 2014 Incheon Para Asian Games gold medalist, who suffered paralysis of his left leg after being administered wrong medicine for polio at the age of two.

Tragedy struck Sundar Singh Gurjar when he lost his left hand in a car accident in 2015. He created history by becoming the first Indian to win gold in men’s javelin throw event at the Worlds recently.

“I had been competing as a javelin thrower till that fateful evening. But, before anybody could point a finger at me, I made sure to continue pursuing my sports career. I didn’t want people to make fun of my disability.”

The gold at the Worlds was a redemption for Gurjar, who missed an announcement call for his name at the Rio Paralympics as he failed to understand the accent of the announcer. He reached the arena a minute late to find that he’d been disqualified.

“This shows the indifferent attitude of the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI). What exactly was the official attached to our contingent doing when my name was called? The PCI official should have ensured my participation. I was left to fend for myself,” Gurjar said.

Giving back to the game

In spite of the hardships faced by them, these shining lights of para-athletics are a role model for other differently abled athletes. Saroha spends his entire salary of Rs 40,000 per month — which he earns as a coach at the SAI’s Sonepat centre — on providing training and arranging for exposure trips abroad of some of his protégés like Dharambir Nain, Amit Balwan, Sunil, Rampal Chahar, Rinku Hooda and Ekta, among others. At present, Saroha is funding 17 para-athletes.

“If I’ll help others, only then God will help me,” said Saroha.

“Whatever cash award I receive from the Haryana government, I spend the amount on funding my trainees. I don’t want other para-athletes to go through the same struggle I was subjected to.”

Both Jhajharia and Deepa Malik, Rio Paralympics silver medallists from Haryana, have written to their respective state governments to provide them land to open a sports academy for para-athletes in Jaipur and Gurugram, respectively."
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula news","CHANDIGARH: In a major relief for the residents, the Chandigarh Administration has decided to allow conversion of residential leasehold properties into freehold.

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 18

In a major relief for the residents, the Chandigarh Administration has decided to allow conversion of residential leasehold properties into freehold.

This was announced by MP Kirron Kher on Friday amidst the presence of large numbers of the BJP workers at the UT guest house.

Addressing a press conference, Kher said while the administration has allowed the conversion of the residential properties the demand for the conversion of the commercial and the industrial properties will also be fulfilled soon.

All the commercial and industrial properties are on leasehold in comparison to the residential properties which are mostly already converted into freehold.

The administration has kept the policy at abeyance since 2013 after the matter was referred to MHA for re-fixation of conversion charges.

Kher said Ministry of Urban Development has clarified in July 2017 that the power to fix the land rates for conversion of leasehold residential properties to freehold has been delegated to the administrator at the time of sanction given to original scheme in 1996.

Accordingly decision has been taken to fix collector rates to be used as land rates in the formula for calculation of conversion charges.

She said that a new fund “Urban Development Fund” is being created into which the conversion charges shall be deposited.

This fund shall be utilised in accordance with guidelines of the ministry. The projects related to development of urban infrastructure shall be funded from this.

Commissioner Municipal Corporation shall be administrative in-charge and shall be custodian on behalf of Chandigarh Administration.

He shall release the funds to the projects sanctioned and given approval by Chandigarh Administration.

Kher said that it has also been decided to calculate conversion charges for LIG/MIG/HIG/EWS/Cheap Houses on pro-rata increase done in land rates.

These rates shall be notified within a week’s time and after that residents can apply for conversion of their leasehold properties into freehold properties."

LONDON: Whisky connoisseurs have long thought that mixing a few drops of water could enhance the taste of the drink, and now a study has revealed a scientific explanation for why that may be true.

Researchers at Linnaeus University in Sweden have found that adding water to whisky alters the drink’s molecules to make it taste better.

Whisky is a chemically complicated beverage. After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled.

However, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 per cent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly.

Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky.

“The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,” said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University.

“One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,” Karlsson said.

Researchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions.

They found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid.

“This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,” said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University.

“Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface.

“An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,” Friedman said.

These findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass.

“How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual.

Some people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,” Karlsson added.

Building on a safe turf,"Arjun Kamal

The recent collapse of a five-storey building in Mumbai is yet another example of the careless attitude adopted in the construction of buildings in India. The news of building collapse or the collapse of balcony, chhajja, canopy, etc are very common in our country. Such disasters occur often during rains, storms, earthquakes or even due to overloading in marriage or religious celebrations. An eye for the right site Unsafe construction practices and wrong selection of site are the main culprits in such accidents as was seen in the case of collapse of buildings in Chennai a few years ago. Site selection, thus, is one of the foremost factors when it comes to creating a safe built environment. It is also one of the most neglected aspects. Every building needs a flat surface to transfer its overall load, as well as the load that it carries in the form of its occupants, the furniture and the equipment that it houses. If the water table of a site is high then suitable measures should be taken in the structural design to make a building safe for the occupants. Actually it is better to avoid construction, especially of high-rises in such locations. Another factor related to site is its topographic analysis. This analysis comprises studying the type of soil at a particular site and its slopes. With the help of these studies we come to know about the natural drainage and buildable and non-buildable slopes. Areas of natural drainage should be strictly avoided for construction. Ridge lines (lines of intersection of two sloping planes of a site) are best for building roads as the water moves away from them. On the other hand valley lines (lines joining inclined surfaces, down which water flows), are the areas for natural drainage. On any site, water has a tendency to flow through these valley lines. These areas are best suitable for water channels and agriculture since they will get a ready flow of water and rich sediment deposition. Soil survey also comprises a crucial part of topographic analyses. Such surveys give vital information about erodability of soils and the dangers connected with its cutting and filling. During this analysis, information about the type of rock is also recorded. In the case of soft and unstable rocks even a slight disturbance can cause vibration thereby causing landslides which often result in loss of life and property. Analysis for topography should be conducted so that such instances don’t occur. The only thing that can make this possible in our country is the awareness, initiative and enforcement. Often, authorities are active in alerting the residents about unsafe buildings but indifference of the latter results in loss of lives like it happened in the case of Vakola building in Santa Cruz, Mumbai. Many sites are wetlands, that is, they remain saturated with water either temporarily or forever. Wetlands are, in fact, the best defence that Nature has provided us against flooding. Often referred to as natural sponges, these slow down rainwater, absorb it and let it percolate in ground leading to groundwater recharge. They also clean water by removing harmful pollutants like residual metals and organic materials. The Chennai building was built on a wetland, hence there was no solid strata for its effective load transfer. Many countries have made stringent laws for wetland protection.

Bad beams and slabs

Another dangerous practice that is rampant in India is the use of “flat beams”. These have longer surface as their horizontal face and the shorter surface as the vertical one. Surprisingly, for structural stability this should be vice versa. Today, most of the buildings are being constructed from Reinforced Cement Concrete popularly known as RCC. Concrete can handle compressive stresses but can’t handle tensile stresses. That’s why steel reinforcement bars are used to resist these tensile forces. While designing beams, the depth should be more than the width. Beams with more depth than their width distribute loads more effectively as compared to the wrongly designed beams having more width than their depth, which results in their cracking as seen in the figure. Another factor while designing RCC structures is the quality of the cement and steel. Cement has a expiry date beyond which it starts losing its strength. Often unscrupulous builders use cement that has crossed its expiry date of use, which results in poor effective strength of structure resulting in building collapse. Another component of RCC is that the steel used should be free from impurities. Unscrupulous manufacturers use steel scrap, to manufacture reinforcement bars, which has low strength as compared to fresh steel which is free from impurities. The result is, again, an unsafe structure made of weak steel reinforcements which can collapse any time. One dangerous reason for the overconfidence of these builders is that such structures stay intact for many years because they are designed for an “ultimate load”. This means the maximum load which they can bear doesn’t get imposed on them for a long time. However, whenever such load is encountered in the form of a crowd, collapses happen.

Regulating expert feed

Another reason for such rampant unsafe construction is that there is “no minimum qualification” required to become a builder. Anyone having enough contacts and money can buy a piece of land and start building a project on it. The system required for registration of civil engineers is also lacking. Structures are designed by civil engineers only and expert engineers can ensure safe and solid buildings by making accurate calculation of structural members viz. how much concrete and what type of reinforcement would be used for a safe and economical design. This absence of registration has resulted in unqualified people doing the job of “structural design” and municipal bodies have no control over them. Ironically, when India encountered one of the worst earthquakes in its history — the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 — the government announced that it would start mandatory registration for all civil engineers in order to end the practice of unsafe structural designs. But till date no such thing has happened.

Pitfalls of profit

Many times in their greed to make more profit builders deviate from the building plans approved from the development authority. Recently after the Chennai building collapse, a survey for multi-storeyed and special buildings was conducted by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. The results were shocking. The authority found that over 50 per cent of the structures under survey had deviated from the approved plan. People responsible for such unsafe buildings, however, are yet to be brought to book.

Lax fire safety

Another major factor which is responsible for deaths in buildings in India is fire. A key thing to note here is that a majority of casualities in fire accidents are due to choking rather than burn injuries. This is due to incompetent planning of fire-escape routes in building design. In order to achieve more saleable area, a lot of builders ignore the planning of fire escape routes resulting in a design which becomes a death trap for its users, in case of a fire accident. The National Building Code (2005) clearly states that fire safety certificate is compulsory for handing over a multi-storey building for public use. Builders cross the line of law while giving possession to the buyers when they don’t get a fire clearance for such buildings.Better monitoring and law enforcement is the only way to stop this menace of unsafe buildings. Registration should be made mandatory for all civil engineers like it is for all architects in India. Only, architects having valid license should be allowed to submit a building plan. Stringent monitoring of builders should be done for completion certificates of buildings. Moreover landscape architects should be made a core part of team while carrying out constructions in hilly or large areas. Topographic analyses must become an integral part of any architectural design. — The writer is an architect. and interior designer"
Bopanna-Dodig pair reaches quarters of Cincinnati Masters,"New Delhi, August 18

Rohan Bopanna and his Croatian partner Ivan Dodig reached the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters after edging past Juan Sebastian Cabal and Fabio Fognini in a tight contest. The seventh seeds Bopanna and Dodig, who ended finalists at the Rogers Cup last week in Montreal, rallied to humble the Colombian-Italian combo 5-7, 7-5, 10-8 in a second-round match. In the WTA event, being run simultaneously, Sania Mizra and Shuai Peng have reached the semifinals with a 6-3, 6-7(1), 10-3 win over Irina-Camelia Begu and Raluca Olaru. In their fiercely fought match, which lasted an hour and 41 minutes, Bopanna and Dodig broke their rivals once but also dropped serve one time. To Cabal and Fognini’s credit, they saved as many as seven breakpoints to make it as tough for Bopanna and Dodig as possible. Bopanna and Dodig next face second-seeds Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo, who beat Diego Schwartzman and Mischa Zverev 7-5, 6-2. Bopanna is the only Indian left in the tournaments after Ramkumar Ramanathan’s second round defeat in the singles and Leander Paes’ first-round defeat with Alexander Zverev in the doubles first round.

"Some felt Kumble was strict but not me, says Wriddhiman Saha","Kolkata, August 18

Some of his teammates may have considered Anil Kumble “strict” but India’s Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha never felt that about the former coach, who quit after a bitter fallout with skipper Virat Kohli.

Kumble was forced to resign in June this year, after difference of opinion with Kohli.

Kumble, a former captain, had gone to the extent of calling his relationship with Kohli “untenable”.

Saha was asked about the perception of Kumble being strict but he had a different take to offer.

“I did not feel that (strict) way. As a coach, he had to be strict in some way or the other. Some have felt he is strict, some have not. I have never felt that way under Anil bhai,” Saha told reporters today on his return from Sri Lanka, where he was a part of the team that won 3-0 in the recently-concluded series.

He then compared Ravi Shastri’s style of coaching with that of Anil Kumble.

“Anil bhai always wanted us to score big — 400,500 and 600 and felt that the opponent can be bowled out within 150-200. That’s not always possible,” he smiled and said.

“Ravi bhai, on the other hand, always tells us to go for the kill. Go out there and hit the opponent out of the park. This is the only difference I could see. Rest, both spoke positive stuff. When Ravi bhai was director, he was aggressive. In his new stint, he seems to have become more involved,” said the 32-year-old.

Saha, on his part, also praised skipper Kohli, who remains involved with the players even off the field.

“He is improving with time and his association with players has increased. We dine together and go for outings together. He is always mingling with us, which I see as a plus point in him,” the Bengal stumper said.

Saha admitted that Sri Lankan team’s temperament was weak.

“Their temperament was weak from the batting point of view, which helped us. One session they held fort but we knew they would run out of patience in the next session, that helped,” he said.

He is not ready to look too far ahead and skirted queries on the home Test series against Sri Lanka, where he would again don the India whites.

“That is still three months away. They will prepare well and we have to hold on to our form.” — PTI"

Car taken away at gunpoint in Mohali,"Mohali, August 17

Just a week after an incident of carjacking at gunpoint was reported from Sector 80 here, another such incident occurred at Sector 77 on the night intervening Tuesday and Wednesday. Four persons took away a Mahindra Verito car from a Sector 77 resident, Parampreet Singh (26), at gunpoint around 12.30 am when he was on his way home from his workplace. The miscreants also forced the victim to sit in the car and took him along for some distance. Later, they let him go and fled in the car towards the Kharar side. The victim alleged that the miscreants also took along his mobile phone, a purse and documents. The phone has been found switched off. According to Swarn Kaur, mother of the victim, her son came out of the car to answer the call of nature when four persons, who had covered their faces, took away the vehicle at gunpoint and forced Parampreet to sit in the car.

New artificial womb may help save premature babies,"Melbourne

Scientists have developed an artificial womb that has been successfully used to incubate healthy baby lambs for a week, an advance that may one day be able to save the lives of extremely premature human babies.

Researchers from the University of Western Australia and Tohoku University Hospital in Japan sought to develop an effective treatment strategy for extremely preterm infants born at the border of viability (22-23 weeks).

The research, published in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, showed that preterm lambs were successfully maintained in a healthy, infection-free condition with significant growth, for a period of one week using ex- vivo uterine environment (EVE) therapy.

With further development, EVE therapy could prevent the severe morbidity suffered by extremely premature infants by potentially offering a medical technology that does not currently exist, said Matt Kemp, associate professor at the University of Western Australia.

""Designing treatment strategies for extremely preterm infants is a challenge,"" Kemp said.

""At this gestational age the lungs are often too structurally and functionally under-developed for the baby to breathe easily,"" he said.

Researchers hypothesised that one means of improving outcomes for this group would be to treat them as a foetus rather than a small infant.

""Our equipment is essentially is a high-tech amniotic fluid bath combined with an artificial placenta. Put those together, and with careful maintenance what you've got is an artificial womb,"" Kemp said.

""By providing an alternative means of gas exchange for the foetus, we hoped to spare the extremely preterm cardiopulmonary system from ventilation-derived injury, and save the lives of those babies whose lungs are too immature to breathe properly,"" he said.

""The end goal is to provide preterm babies the chance to better develop their lungs and other important organs before being brought into the world,"" he added. —PTI"
Promoters have no say after leaving company: Reddy on Sikka exit,"Hyderabad, August 18

Former Nasscom chairman BVR Mohan Reddy on Friday said it was very “sad” to see a “good CEO” like Vishal Sikka stepping down as the CEO of Infosys, and added that promoters have no say after leaving a company.

The company said Sikka, the first non-founder CEO of Infosys, has abruptly resigned due to the “continuous assault” and “campaign” by founder and ex-chairman NR Narayana Murthy.

Reacting to this, Murthy said he is not seeking “any money, position for children, or power”, while expressing anguish over the board’s allegations that his “continuous assault” led to Sikka’s exit.

Reddy said: “It is very sad to see a good CEO leaving a great company for avoidable reasons. The promoters have no locus standi (right to interfere or have say in the matter) once they leave the company.”

If something similar had happened in a Western country, shareholders would file class action suits against the company, said Reddy, founder and Executive Chairman of Cyient.

“Even assuming that the 12.5 per cent create trouble, who suffers is the other 87.5 per cent,” he said.

As of June 2017, the founders of Infosys are holding 12.75 per cent shares in the company.

Sikka resigned amid heightened acrimony between the board and the high-profile founders led by Murthy. PTI"

Harish Khare

With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

Admittedly, the British decision to grant India independence was principally driven by the simple fact that the four-year-long World War II had totally exhausted the imperial will to rule; in fact, the British desire to hold on to India had already been tested morally and ethically by the Indian National Congress, which under the Mahatma’s leadership had waged a unique peaceful freedom struggle. The British middle classes, with their pretensions to liberal values, had no answer to the Mahatma’s saintly leadership. The Union Jack had to be lowered from Red Fort, sooner than later.

But by the time the British came to the conclusion that they could no longer stay in India, they had already instigated mischief among the Indian leadership. The colonial rulers had cynically worked on the Indian society’s religious fault lines, encouraged and cultivated sectarian agendas which ultimately coalesced into the demand for a separate nation.

The Muslim League, under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had already legitimised use of violence in pursuit of its demands. The League’s call for ‘Direct Action’ was an invitation to chaos and the mobs. Once a society develops a taste for violence, its leaders are rarely able to calibrate and control the streets. By the time August 15, 1947, came the Muslim League’s leadership skills were already over-extended even in what came to be known as East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In India, the Congress leadership was barely able to push the mobs back.

Still, a monumental tragedy was destined to take place. The sheer scale of the number of Hindus and Sikhs, who found themselves forced to migrate out to India and of the Muslims in India who had to leave for Pakistan, was maddeningly benumbing. Grand statistics simply cannot convey the trauma and the tragedy that engulfed this part of the world soon after August 1947.

A sympathetic American reporter and an eye-witness described the post-Partition days as “one of the great convulsions of modern history.” On December 12, 1947, he tried to convey the nature of disaster that overtook the two nascent nations: “Consider what has happened. In an orgy of religious-communal madness, some 10 million citizens of the north-western provinces had been routed from their homes. An unknown total, probably between 2,00,000 and 5,00,000 (compared to 2,95,000 American war-dead in World War II), had been put to sword, machine-gunned, or roasted alive. The splintered Punjab administrations were quickly swamped and there even appeared danger that the infant central governments of India and Pakistan Dominions might succumb.” Phillips Talbot (An American Witness to India’s Partition).

The frenzy in the East was no less violent, no less gory, no less bloody than it was in the West. The Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs joyfully discovered their capacity for inflicting violence and death on their erstwhile neighbours as well as total strangers. The massacres, the mayhem and the madness outpaced humanity and all known civic-minded virtues; the trauma and tragedy touched nearly every home, every life. No one was unaffected; no one could remain emotionally unmolested by this continental turbulence.

After a few months the mobs could be rolled back and blood could be washed off the streets, but the memory of Partition-centric violence was now etched on the soul of an entire generation on both sides. The two successive states had entrenched habits and protocols of acrimony and suspicion and political leaders and sectarian interests saw to it that India and Pakistan would not settle down to a peaceful co-existence.

The raw memories of Partition also impacted on how the two states went about the business of creating an internal political order. Once Jinnah was gone, Pakistan hastily abandoned his ideas of an inclusive society and nation. In India, the Mahatma was assassinated. The murder was planned by those who wanted to make India a Hindu State and they thought the Old Man was an obstacle. Ironically, the assassination settled, once for all, how India would grant equal protection and equal citizenship to all its minorities.

Perhaps some in India would argue that Partition’s unfinished agenda still remains unattended. May be, after 70 years, we should simply revisit those horrible, horrible days of chaos and disorder before we embark on another self-defeating journey…"

Bathinda, August 17

To check the records of various developmental works undertaken during the SAD-BJP government, a three-member team from the Local Bodies Department, Chandigarh, today reached the office of the Municipal Corporation, Bathinda.

The team led by superintendent Jaspal Singh began their day by holding a meeting with Municipal Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal.

Thereafter, the officials started inspecting and scrutinising the records of the MCB.

The team members reasoned that the Local Bodies Department was initiating a probe into the proper documentation and record of bills for the projects undertaken by the corporations.

In case any of the corporations are found to be lacking on that front, action will be taken against them by the department, they said.

Meanwhile, sources in the MCB claimed that the real motive of the inspection was to ascertain the embezzlement of funds in the name of development projects.

Sources said such a detailed inquiry into the records of all the branches of the corporation pointed to the government’s intention to unearth cases of fraud and scams.

On the first day, the team focused on checking the records of the building branch and general works branch of the MCB.

The team also sought records of the proposals sent by the MCB for the works undertaken during the SAD-BJP term in the state.

The team members collected information about the original proposals sent by the MCB, rectifications done at later stages, response given by the government, funds released and the utilisation of the funds.

The building branch officials were made to make available records of the maps submitted with the branch and the approvals which were granted.

The team also looked into the details of utilisation of grants, which were released by the former state government and the Central Government.

The account branch records were also checked to collect details about the revenue and expenditure of the MCB.

This is possibly the first time that a special team has been constituted to look into the records of the MCB.

Before this, such scrutiny was conducted by the Local Bodies Department through CAG or the Audit Department.

The team will continue to check the records of the MCB tomorrow as well and submit a report to the department by September 15."
6 injured as part of under-construction tunnel collapses,"Jammu, August 18

Six labourers were injured when a part of an under-construction tunnel of Parnai Hydel Power project collapsed in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district on Friday. The 37.5 MW Parnai Hydel Power project is expected to be completed by January end next year. Police said a part of the tunnel collapsed at Surankote belt and six labourers came under the debris. While two critically injured labourers were shifted to the Government Medical College hospital in Jammu, the rest have been admitted in hospital there. The Rs 604-crore hydro electric project (HEP) has been conceived as a multi-purpose one, keeping in mind its potential to cater to both power and irrigation-related needs of the district. The work on the Parnai project, a run-of-the-river (RoR) scheme with an installed capacity of 37.5 MW, began in April 2014.

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning.

Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides.

Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability.

During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop.

These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery.

Time to take a call

Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer.

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"
The cross of debt,"Satyawan Malik

Satyawan Malik

NOTHING irked my father as much as smoking, lies and unscrupulous loans. A headmaster in the 1970s, he would quote Pt Lakhmi Chand’s verse: ‘Le ke dede kar ke khale, us tae kon jabbar ho se; Nugra manas aankh badal ja, samajhdar ki maer ho se’ (If you work hard and honestly pay back what you borrow from others, no one can be stronger than you. If an ungrateful liar turns hostile, it will be a tough time for the sane). My father, a postgraduate in maths from Panjab University, read a lot, wrote a lot, taught a lot, and yet loved agriculture work. I wonder if the days were longer or life was slower, or both — such was his efficacy in whatever he undertook. One Sunday afternoon we were returning home from our fields, when we saw our neighbour in the village riding a punctured bicycle with unusual speed. He was panting hard, making it difficult for him to tell us what was the matter. ‘Jeep’ is all he managed to utter and dashed away. My father, giving me ‘walk the sum’, began his algorithms about the neighbour, Mr M. ‘Half of the eight acres have already been pledged, at no rates, to pay off only the interest to one of three moneylenders. Total pendency is nightmarish. Still the hubristic drunkard defies penitence. The eldest son has gone awry...the anaemic wife is never short of breath in wanting him to mend his ways. They have two young daughters to marry off. His land-and-house distribution dispute with the elder brother knows no resolution. The fields have been left unattended...no books for the youngest son... the house is crumbling. Yet he thinks no one wiser...no compunction, no scruples.’ My father would add that studies and agriculture demanded austerity and discipline. Soon we found a bank jeep stopping near Mr M’s house. Four bank officials were holding loan-ledgers; accompanying them were two policemen. But the jeep would bring no surprise to Mrs M, who didn’t know how to hold her tongue. The bank men stood no chance against her. When they proposed the auctioning of a buffalo and a cow, she pounced on them, warning:‘Gau ko haath mat laga dena, mere bhai ne di thi!’ The eldest son, when asked about his father, defiantly retorted that he was away for a week. It didn’t work as my father’s over-simplistic view of the truth came out. The son and the mother instantly coalesced into a laconic grudge: ‘Aap to sarkari naukri mein ho, aap kya jaano garibi ki maar’ (You have a government job, so you cannot know the curse of poverty). Unimaginably, some people have suffered so much hunger, depression, defeat and the burden of debt that it is hard to live without succumbing to the temptation of becoming a fugitive. Wouldn’t the Shakespeare of Haryana, Pt Lakhmi Chand, choke on the elegy written on the fight, plight and flight of the not-so-simplistic agro-sociologists?"

Failed mechanics,"MOVIE REVIEW: ANNABELLE: CREATION

Set in the 1940’s, “Annabelle: Creation” the prequel to “Annabelle,” which was in turn a spinoff of “The Conjuring,” is the third cinematic outing for the demon-host, a wooden doll made by the doll-maker Sam Mullins( Anthony La Paglia), who lost his daughter in an accident(the only strikingly shocking scene in the entire movie).

His wife Esther (Miranda Otto) has already become a victim of the demonic doll and is now living a secluded mysterious life within the confines of her own bedroom.

The Doll has been cloistered within a closet papered with Bible readings, in their sprawling California farm house for a few years now. And into this set-up they introduce a bunch of six orphans - Prepubescent Polio-stricken and wearing a leg-brace, young Janice (Talitha Bateman), her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), a motley group of pre-teens and their caretaker Nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman).

Could be they thought that inviting strictly catholic folk would absolve them of their descent into evil? But what about the young ones who have basically been set-up for scare-happy voyeuristic entertainment? That the religious Church going Mullins’ put young helpless children in harm’s way is a little hard to stomach.

Returning ‘Annabelle’ screenwriter Gary Dauberman contrives to have Janice curious enough to overcome her fears and investigate the mysteries of the old house, thus laying out the plot points that would eventually lead to her victimisation. Linda is also drawn in while the Nun and her other four wards have their own scary encounters to deal with. And there’s really nothing new to keep you absorbed here.

The fright tactics employed here are not effective enough even though they have old school generic effects written all over them. No doubt Sandberg’s narration follows the genre ritual of terrorising its female characters, but this time they are a little too young to be validated by such impunity!"
Tips for becoming a co-applicant in home loan,"Ravindra Rao

A home is the most popular, and will be the most enduring of all earthly establishments, said the late great American magician, Channing Pollock, about his abode. A home is perhaps the most prized possession for most of us and aspirational in every sense; the best address, important neighbours and all facilities that we would ever need in life. That costs a small fortune in many Indian cities but if you have a robust source of income and an impressive credit score, such dreams can be realised without much strain. However, for those who do not fulfil the income criteria for a substantial loan, a simple way to hone your overall financial prowess is to borrow jointly with your spouse or someone who can be designated as a co-borrower. Let’s understand the basics of this advantageous concept.A co-borrower can be an immediate family member, salaried or self-employed, who is an Indian or even an NRI. Depending on their discretion, lending institutions can allow up to six co-applicants which may include spouse, siblings and blood relatives like parents. Nevertheless, married couples get the highest preference as banks even assign a longer loan repayment tenure subject to the retirement age of the older applicant.Prospects of a bigger loan at a better rate brighten when an applicant adds co-applicants with a good credit score and an independent income source. It helps lenders consider the joint income of the applicants to assess their repayment capacity. But banks may insist that all co-owners of the property must be the co-applicants as well.A joint home loan bestows tax deduction benefits for both co-applicants separately, provided they are co-owners of the property and each of them is contributing to the home loan repayment. As per existing provisions, principal repayments are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act for up to a maximum limit of Rs 1.50 lakh. In the case of interest payments, there is a tax deduction available under Section 24 up to Rs 2 lakh if the property is self-occupied (If the property is let out, then the entire interest becomes eligible for tax deduction). For a joint home loan, this takes the combined limit to Rs 3 lakh under Section 80C and Rs 4 lakh under Section 24(b) – which helps reduce a significant burden on the family.

Advantage for married applicants

Few important tips can enhance the overall benefit to married applicants. A couple must mutually work out the ownership share between themselves as co-borrowers to optimise tax benefits; either this can be in the ratio of 50:50 for claiming deductions in equal proportion or 60:40 or 70:30 depending on which co-borrower falls into what tax bracket – if he or she has a higher income, a bigger share of the property can help avail greater benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit given to each co-applicant would be in proportion to their contribution in repayment of principal and interest. Thus, it is even possible for co-applicants to decide how much tax benefit they would want, and at what proportion, each applicant would pay. In case of a woman applicant, many lenders would provide a differentiated interest rate - usually a few basis points below the normal home loan rates. For this, the applicant must be the sole or joint owner of the property and an applicant or co-applicant for the home loan. Joint home loan applicants can make payments from a single or joint account by way of cheques or ECS. Some institutions even allow co-borrowers to share the number of EMIs between them, depending on which they could decide the number of EMI cheques to be issued by each applicant. One borrower can pay all instalments while the other can refund his or her share by way of cheque or fund transfer to that account.A key factor that decides one’s loan eligibility is the credit worthiness of borrowers. When one applies for a loan or credit, a lender seeks the individual’s credit risk, evaluated by a credit score maintained by agencies. A credit report is the holistic sum of the applicant’s financial dealings in every sphere of life, interpreted as a number that is critical for getting not just loans or other means of credit, but even to qualify for them (banks can judge not just the applicant’s primary eligibility but even his/her ability and propensity to repay). It is prudent to keep a check on the credit report/credit score of an applicant as well as a co-applicant; as lower scores could impact one’s chances of obtaining finance for a home.Besides home loan documents, individual details such as KYC (proof of identity and address), income and property documents are required to avail the housing loan. Detailed documentation helps a lender to decide faster and beneficially in your favour. Income documents can be supported by other assets created by the applicants to show their prudent financial behaviour. Though there would be multiple borrowers, the documentation process for joint home loans remains much like that of individual home loans. Despite its enormous benefits, one may avoid applying for a joint home loan if the credit score of the co-owner is low due to a poor credit history or if he/she is already repaying an ongoing loan that has consumed maximum loan eligibility or if he/she is intending to buy a bigger property in the future for self-occupancy or if he/she is about to retire.

Managing loan and finances

A joint home loan is not only about saving in terms of principal and interest payment to a great extent, but also about sharing an honorable and real responsibility towards a home. Many couples would agree that such a joint move has instilled a sense of discipline – especially financial prudence – in them where both partners feel proud for contributing towards mutual benefit. Yet, one must not take hasty decisions in terms of finalising a house or taking a huge loan (it may turn out expensive over the tenure with fewer benefits). Couples must undertake basic financial planning before committing to a huge monthly payout which may hamstring regular needs or individual desire to acquire something personal. As TS Elliot said, “Home is where one starts from.” Home loan is where one could learn much from – as co-borrowers.

Omar for special session of J-K legislature on Article 35A,"Srinagar, August 18

National Conference working president Omar Abdullah on Friday sought a special session of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislature before August 29 to frame an appropriate response to counter the narrative on Article 35A of the Constitution.

The issue is of vital importance for the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh as abrogation of Article 35A will have serious ramifications, Omar said in a statement issued by the National Conference here.

The former chief minister expressed grave concern over the reported “unsatisfactory response” of the central and state governments in putting up a strong case before the Supreme Court, hearing a plea against the constitutional provision empowering the state to determine the issues with regard to permanent residence.

The observation of the Centre’s attorney that the issue needs wider discussions has created apprehension in the public mind about intentions of the BJP-led NDA government, he added.

In such a situation, the state legislature will have to take a call on this fundamental issue, especially as the Constitution empowers the Legislative Assembly to determine the issues with regard to permanent residence, Omar said.

He appreciated general consensus across the state, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or region, with regard to preserving of this significant constitutional guarantee bestowed upon Jammu and Kashmir by the Constitution of India.

Omar hoped that the people of Jammu and Kashmir would rise above party politics and fight every “overt or covert attempts to trample with Article 35A”, which is regional neutral, religious neutral and ethnic neutral.

He said abrogation of Article 35A would be detrimental to every segment of society in Jammu and Kashmir. — PTI"
New way to prevent spread of deadly fungus to brain identified,"London, August 18

Scientists have discovered a way to stop a deadly fungal infection from hijacking the body’s immune system and spreading to the brain. Researchers, including those from Universities of Sheffield in the UK and Harvard Medical School in the US, studied Cryptococcosis, a disease that infects humans and animals after breathing in airborne fungi. The disease can result in a lung infection that may subsequently spread to the brain by hitching a lift inside the white blood cells. Researchers identified signals that white blood cells use to control their behaviour and found that a molecule called ERK5 could be manipulated to encourage white blood cells to throw out the pathogens. “When an infection starts, the first white blood cell to respond is called a macrophage,” said Robin May, from University of Birmingham in the UK. “This identifies the invading bacteria or fungus, destroys it and then alerts the rest of the immune system,” said May. “However, in the case of some diseases like Cryptococcosis, the invading organism has evolved to be able to survive inside that white blood cell and then use them like a transport system to help move around the body,” he said. Many white blood cells overcome this by throwing those hijackers out, using a mechanism called vomocytosis. However, researchers do not know how vomocytosis is controlled. There are many diseases apart from Cryptococcosis in which pathogens--bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites that can cause disease--survive by hijacking the immune system. Researchers wanted to identify the mechanism that allows white blood cells to recognise and expel these hijackers. “If we can develop ways to manipulate this and encourage the white blood cells to recognise and expel organisms like this, we might be able to limit the spread of infection not only for Cryptococcosis but for other invasive pathogens that are a significant threat to human health worldwide,” researchers said. They identified signals that white blood cells use to control their behaviour and disabled those signals one by one. In the process, the researchers discovered that a molecule called ERK5 could be manipulated to encourage white blood cells either to throw out pathogens better or to keep them inside and try to kill them for longer. “We found that by blocking ERK5 in zebrafish, we were able to increase vomocytosis rates in their white blood cells and so prevent a deadly fungal infection from spreading to the brain,” said May. “Our hope is that we will be able to develop therapies that target this process, such as drugs that would be able to limit an infection and prevent it from spreading from the initial site of attack,” he said. The findings were published in the journal Science Advances. PTI"

As many as 54 IAS officers in Uttarakhand have been served showcause notices for not attending the flag-hoisting event here on Independence Day, official sources said on Friday.

The list of officers who have been given showcause notices includes those of the rank of principal and additional secretaries, sources said.

It is for the first time after the creation of Uttarakhand that such a drastic step has been taken against officials for not attending flag-hoisting ceremonies on Independence Day, sources said.

The notices issued by Chief Secretary S Ramaswamy on Thursday ask the officials concerned to explain at the earliest why they skipped the flag-hoisting function held here on Independence Day.

The move comes after Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat took strong exception to the absence of a number of senior officers from the main event addressed by him at the Parade Ground here on the occasion.

The Chief Minister had asked the Chief Secretary to seek an explanation from the officials for not attending the flag-hoisting events and act against those who had absented themselves without satisfactory reasons.

The district magistrates have also been asked to issue similar notices to officials under them who chose to skip the flag-hoisting events in their area.

Haryana cops harassed students just as the goons did: JNUSU,"Haryana cops harassed students just as the goons did: JNUSU

New Delhi, August 18 The JNU Students Union on Friday condemned Haryana Police for allegedly harassing students who wanted to file a complaint against a mob that they said had attacked them near the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary on August 14. The group of seven, including a woman, alleged that they were abused and beaten by a mob of 10 people when they were returning from the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary on the evening of August 14. The student alleged that she was threatened with rape. When the students went to the Surajkund Police Station--that falls in Haryana--they were allegedly harassed by police personnel who refused to file their complaint. They questioned the woman’s character and asked why she went with the male students. JNUSU president Mohit Kumar Pandey said the union would approach the Faridabad commissioner of police seeking action against the Surajkund police and the mob. “This reflects the environment of fear that is being created in the country. The goons openly threatened the girl and abused the boys. Now see the pathetic condition of Haryana Police that instead of helping victims, behaved the same way as these goons behaved,” Pandey said. A zero FIR (as the incident happened in a different jurisdiction) was registered in Vasant Kunj Police Station and a probe is on. According to the FIR, the woman said the police personnel at the Surajkund police station “questioned her attire” and taunted her. Recounting her horror in the FIR, she said they were made to write an apology letter. The woman student quoted a police official as telling them, “Yeh free sex ka culture tumhara jail mein karvate hain. (We’ll show you about free sex in jail).” Of the seven students, three are from the JNU, three are ex-students of the university and one is from St Stephen’s College. PTI"
UT allows conversion of leasehold residential properties into freehold,"Chandigarh, August 18

In a major relief for the residents, the Chandigarh Administration has decided to allow conversion of residential leasehold properties into freehold.

This was announced by MP Kirron Kher on Friday amidst the presence of large numbers of the BJP workers at the UT guest house.

Addressing a press conference, Kher said while the administration has allowed the conversion of the residential properties the demand for the conversion of the commercial and the industrial properties will also be fulfilled soon.

All the commercial and industrial properties are on leasehold in comparison to the residential properties which are mostly already converted into freehold.

The administration has kept the policy at abeyance since 2013 after the matter was referred to MHA for re-fixation of conversion charges.

Kher said Ministry of Urban Development has clarified in July 2017 that the power to fix the land rates for conversion of leasehold residential properties to freehold has been delegated to the administrator at the time of sanction given to original scheme in 1996.

Accordingly decision has been taken to fix collector rates to be used as land rates in the formula for calculation of conversion charges.

She said that a new fund “Urban Development Fund” is being created into which the conversion charges shall be deposited.

This fund shall be utilised in accordance with guidelines of the ministry. The projects related to development of urban infrastructure shall be funded from this.

Commissioner Municipal Corporation shall be administrative in-charge and shall be custodian on behalf of Chandigarh Administration.

He shall release the funds to the projects sanctioned and given approval by Chandigarh Administration.

Kher said that it has also been decided to calculate conversion charges for LIG/MIG/HIG/EWS/Cheap Houses on pro-rata increase done in land rates.

These rates shall be notified within a week’s time and after that residents can apply for conversion of their leasehold properties into freehold properties."
"Blade Runner, autoencoded","The strange film that sums up our fears of AI and the future

Andrew Griffin

Terence Broad’s Blade Runner sometimes looks a lot like the classic 1982 film. Sometimes it looks completely different. His autoencoded version of Blade Runner is the film as a computer sees it — or, more specifically, as a computer sees it, remembers it, and then regurgitates it. The film is being shown as part of the Barbican’s science fiction exhibition-meets-festival, Into The Unknown. And it’s perhaps the most cutting edge of all the work featured there — not only being about science fiction, but being created in a way that sounds like it comes straight out of the work of Philip K Dick. Broad’s project works by analogy with memory, and uses cutting edge artificial intelligence to do so. It uses an autoencoder — that encodes a big data sample, in this case individual frames of films, into a tiny representation of itself which it can then reconstruct later on. When it does so, a great deal has been lost in the shrinking. But strange things can be found in that reconstruction, too — the technology looks to make up for what it can’t remember by filling in the gaps. “The reconstructions are in no way perfect, but the project was more of a creative exploration of both the capacity and limitations of this approach,” wrote Broad in an introduction to his work that would later go viral. In that way, it seems remarkably and uncannily similar to human memory. It shrinks everything down and stores it away, so that it can be opened back up and relived with the gaps filled in at a later date. And the idea was inspired by strange experiments with humans, too. One of the first inspirations was a talk by scientists who had managed to make an MRI machine reconstruct things that people were looking at, simply by looking at the patterns showing in their brains. It could literally see through other people’s eyes, by looking right into their heads. But all of those human inspirations and influences are taken and turned into a work that is undeniably technological. If the MRI experiment showed us what people are watching from inside their heads, the autoencoded Blade Runner almost allows us to watch how a computer sees, peering inside its own brain in the same way. It definitely remembers in a different way to how humans do. It’s terrible at recalling and reconstituting faces, for instance, and can’t recognise that the same face belongs to the same person and so needs to move in a straight line. And it also appears to find it impossible to remember a black frame; because there are so few in the film, there’s no point storing the black and instead remembers it as an average of all the other parts of the film, throwing out a beautiful but decidedly unblank green image. For now the limits of the project are where the interest is found, and the imperfections of the reconstruction make it a work of art. But theoretically computers could eventually become perfect at the work — watching, shrinking and then reconstituting the film as it actually is. It all sounds eerily like a question that would plague the noir world of Blade Runner. But Blade Runner wasn’t always the aim. The film began as a project for a university course, and required learning techniques that are at the very forefront of AI and visual technology. “Originally it was really just an experiment; the whole thing started out as a research project,” says Broad. “For a long time I was training it on these videos of really long train journeys. After a couple of months I got really bored and thought it would be interesting to do it with Blade Runner.” The choice of film happened by a kind of intentional coincidence but fits perfectly into the film because the themes seem to mesh so well. Blade Runner explores the edge of artificial intelligence, the beginnings of humanity and how to know the difference between the two; the autoencoded Blade Runner does the same thing but with the film itself. “I’d always had the idea [of Blade Runner] in the back of my mind. But I didn’t think it would work. But then as soon as we did it we saw that it obviously should be the sole focus for the project.” Because the computer processes things over time — and takes a while to do it — the process of actually finding that it would work well was one that revealed itself gradually. “When you’re training it, you would give it a batch of images of random frames. Then it would start giving you the output. So I was just looking at this output while it was training. “I saw this image and saw you could recognise some of the scenes. But this was a really small resolution. So we saw this and then it was like, right we need to kind of do this in order and remake the video. “Then we did a little 10 minute sample. And it was kind of mind blowing, for me and my supervisor. I’ve got the original 10 minute — it’s really noisy and really grainy. You can see what’s going on and it’s kind of mind-blowing. Then I thought — let’s just remake Blade Runner, the whole thing.” That decision put the film squarely in the realm of science fiction — a decision that would see it sit among the greatest work of the genre in the Barbican exhibition. Not simply because it took such a seminal science fiction film, but also because it was a kind of science fiction itself, using brand new techniques to reprocess a film in a way that would be unimaginable and inexplicable to people even 10 or 20 years ago.— The Independent"

WhatsApp status: Have you tried it yet?,"It launched earlier this year as a clone of Snapchat Stories, and is proving more popular than expected

Aatif Sulleyman

WhatsApp’s biggest new feature is proving surprisingly popular, and has already eclipsed Snapchat. WhatsApp Status launched in February as an imitation of Snapchat Stories, letting you post customised photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. It now has 175 million daily users, significantly more than Snapchat’s 161 million, despite widespread bemusement when it was introduced earlier this year. Here’s how to use WhatsApp Status.

Where to find Status

WhatsApp tweaked its user interface with the launch of Status, which has been treated to its own dedicated tab above the conversation list. To access Status, you can either tap the tab or swipe left from the WhatsApp home screen. How to view someone’s status You’ll find a list of statuses on the Status screen in the app – simply tap to watch them. To provide a little feedback on one of your friend’s updates, tap Reply at the bottom of the screen while viewing their status.

Adding yours

To post your own status, hit the My Status button at the top of the Status screen or the circular green icon in the bottom right corner. You can then take a picture, record a video or choose an existing file from your camera roll. Once you’ve made your choice, you can personalise it by adding a caption, emoji, text or drawings to it. You can resize and rotate the emoji with a pinch, and resize and rotate the text, as well as change its colour and font. When you’re happy, tap Send.

Who can view yours?

Nobody that isn’t saved to your phone’s address book can access your statuses. However, you can control which of your contacts can and can’t view them by tinkering with your privacy settings. One the Status screen, tap the menu button in the top right corner, select Status Privacy and choose between the My Contacts Except… and Only Share With... options. You can also see a list of exactly who has viewed your status, unless you’ve disabled Read Receipts for messages in WhatsApp. To re-enable Read Receipts, navigate to Settings > Account > Privacy and check the Read Receipts box. Been there, done that? Delete it Though status updates automatically disappear after 24 hours, you can delete yours early if you want to. On the Status screen, tap the three dots next to the My Status button, tap and hold the update you want to get rid of and hit the delete icon.

Or else, mute

You can easily mute a status too, in order to stop it from appearing at the top of the list on your Status screen. Just tap and hold the update you want to mute and select Mute when the option appears. In order to unmute any statuses you’ve muted, head to the Status screen, scroll down the page to the Muted Statuses section and tap and hold the update you’d like to unmute.— The Independent"
2008 Olympic champ cyclist Sanchez tests positive,"Madrid, August 18

Spanish cyclist Samuel Sanchez, who won the gold medal in the men’s road race in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has been suspended after testing positive for drugs, the International Union of Cycling (UCI) has announced. The UCI on Thursday confirmed the test result in a press communique explaining Sanchez “was notified of an Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF) of GHRP-2” in a sample collected in the scope of out-of-competition control on August 9, 2017, reports Xinhua news agency. “The doping control was planned and carried out by the Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation (CADF), the independent body mandated by the UCI, in charge of defining and implementing the anti-doping strategy in cycling.” “In accordance with UCI Anti-Doping Rules, the rider has been provisionally suspended until the adjudication of the affair,” meaning 39-year-old Sanchez will not compete for the BMC team in the Vuelta de Espana (Tour of Spain) cycling race due to start on Saturday. Sanchez has denied drug-taking, saying his lawyers had told him “not to make declarations because we have to wait for the tests on the B sample.” “This is an adverse result, not a positive,” he said, adding, “I am 39. I have been cycling for 19 years, why would I do that?” IANS"
Get to the root of aerial appeal,"GREEN HOUSE

Immature aerial roots.

Roots that do not get anchored to the ground are brittle and can break off with careless handling.

Maj Gen C S Bewli Aerial roots are adventitious roots that have the unique ability to develop and grow above the ground-level; while growing some of these reach the ground to eventually anchor and get transformed into active roots; others keep drawing moisture and nutrients from air to survive. Aerial roots have a striking and conspicuous appearance; they emerge only under high humidity conditions and shade. Therefore, species with aerial roots are mainly found in rain forests and areas within tropics and sub tropics. It is not that all plant species in such areas have the ability to develop aerial roots; only a handful of species reserve the right to show off the grandeur of their aerial roots. Aerial roots absorb moisture and nutrients from air just like underground roots. n Some of the house plant species of Philodendron, Monstera, Epipremnum, Ivy (Hedera), Euonymus, etc. have aerial roots that function as anchors. The roots cling to the supporting structures such as trellises, rocks and walls and draw nutrients from air. n Aerial roots in Epiphytic orchids and Anthurium function to cling tightly on another plant or rock outcrop to survive. These are mainly found in rain forests because the habitat provides most of their growing requirements. They derive moisture and nutrients from air to keep them hydrated. They can be acclimatised to grow under local conditions by providing a sort of similar environment. n Aerial roots on some of the tree species of Ficus and Schefflera continue to grow until they touch the ground and get entrenched. Initially, they draw moisture and nutrients from the air, but once they get embedded in the ground they derive their nutrition from the soil. Amid the numerous aerial roots that spring, only a few succeed in reaching the ground and getting through the soil. While the aerial roots embed to the ground and grow, they thicken considerably and form secondary trunks. A classic bonsai can be created with species whose aerial roots eventually get deep-rooted into the ground. Ficus benghalensis, F. virens, F. religiosa, F. panda, F. salicifolia, F. microcarpa, F. longisland, Schefflera actinophylla, S. arboricola are some of the awesome species with aerial roots. Bonsais of these species, when created in non-tropical regions, normally do not develop aerial roots. However, by facilitating favourable environment aerial roots can be formed. Irrespective of the style of bonsai, aerial roots need to be trained, harmonised and fused to enlarge the trunk and enrich its appeal. The trunk of bonsai gives an impressive and a dramatic appearance when multiple secondary trunks grow from the canopy and get seated in the soil-mix. Extraordinary and singular characteristic of these plants having secondary trunks has generated interest in bonsai artists' world-over. There is a burgeoning interest to create such bonsais as they make breathtaking and unusual additions to bonsai collections.

Bathinda, August 17

To check the records of various developmental works undertaken during the SAD-BJP government, a three-member team from the Local Bodies Department, Chandigarh, today reached the office of the Municipal Corporation, Bathinda.

The team led by superintendent Jaspal Singh began their day by holding a meeting with Municipal Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal.

Thereafter, the officials started inspecting and scrutinising the records of the MCB.

The team members reasoned that the Local Bodies Department was initiating a probe into the proper documentation and record of bills for the projects undertaken by the corporations.

In case any of the corporations are found to be lacking on that front, action will be taken against them by the department, they said.

Meanwhile, sources in the MCB claimed that the real motive of the inspection was to ascertain the embezzlement of funds in the name of development projects.

Sources said such a detailed inquiry into the records of all the branches of the corporation pointed to the government’s intention to unearth cases of fraud and scams.

On the first day, the team focused on checking the records of the building branch and general works branch of the MCB.

The team also sought records of the proposals sent by the MCB for the works undertaken during the SAD-BJP term in the state.

The team members collected information about the original proposals sent by the MCB, rectifications done at later stages, response given by the government, funds released and the utilisation of the funds.

The building branch officials were made to make available records of the maps submitted with the branch and the approvals which were granted.

The team also looked into the details of utilisation of grants, which were released by the former state government and the Central Government.

The account branch records were also checked to collect details about the revenue and expenditure of the MCB.

This is possibly the first time that a special team has been constituted to look into the records of the MCB.

Before this, such scrutiny was conducted by the Local Bodies Department through CAG or the Audit Department.

The team will continue to check the records of the MCB tomorrow as well and submit a report to the department by September 15."

Mumbai, August 18

Kareena Kapoor Khan says she is proud and happy that Bollywood filmmakers are now showing women in a progressive way.

The actor attributes this change to the influx of young writers in films.

In an interview to PTI, Kareena says, “One can definitely see a change in the way women have been portrayed on screen in the Hindi film industry.

“The roles are now written by young directors, who have been successful in highlighting the personality of women who are hardworking and successful. Films have now been portraying women in a more progressive manner.”

The 36-year-old actor, who was last seen in ‘Udta Punjab’, welcomed her first child, Taimur Ali Khan, in December last year.

Talking about balancing her work and motherhood, the actor says, “I have always maintained a personal and professional life but now it’s more difficult as Taimur is too young. I try to strike a balance. I have a great support system with (husband) Saif and my family.”

Kareena believes a modern Indian woman plays diverse roles in her life and she considers herself to be one.

“She is a multifaceted woman, lives her life to the fullest and fulfils her choices with confidence and style. I am proud to be a married, independent and working woman. I carry that with great honour and pride. Despite being married, I work and have my own identity.”

Kareena is all charged up to begin work on her next project ‘Veere Di Wedding’ alongside Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar.

However, she did not comment on the reports of her signing a biopic by Omung Kumar, another movie with Salman Khan and Karan Johar’s next.

Meanwhile, the ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ star is the muse of designer Anita Dongre’s autumn winter campaign #IamAND, which celebrates the multifaceted personality of the modern Indian woman.

“AND is one brand that has changed the fashion scenario in the country. With its new campaign, the brand conveys a very strong message of celebrating the multifaceted personality of the modern Indian woman, which I truly identify with,” says Kareena. PTI"

Tribune News Service

Amritsar, August 17

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh inaugurated the Partition Museum here today, over nine months after the then Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal had opened the memorial. Amarinder also unveiled a plaque to commemorate Partition Remembrance Day. It was on August 17, 1947, that the Radcliffe Award, named after Sir Cyril Radcliffe — “the man who divided India” — was made public. The CM recalled the work done by his mother, Rajmata Mohinder Kaur, who died recently, to help refugee girls return home during Partition. The occasion witnessed a poetry recital by eminent poet-filmmaker Gulzar, who launched his newly translated book, “Footprints on Zero Line: Writings on the Partition”. Housed in the century-old Town Hall’s refurbished building near the Golden Temple, the museum draws inspiration from the stories of Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto, whose family residence in Gali Vakilan here was among the houses destroyed during the communal violence of 1947. Kishwar Desai, noted author and the museum’s chief trustee, said, “We remember the spirit, courage and resilience of those millions of refugees who were uprooted overnight, and yet dedicated themselves to rebuilding the newly independent India.” In 2015, Desai, Dipali Khanna, Bindu Manchanda and Mallika Ahluwalia, the museum’s chief executive, came together to form The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust (TAACHT). A panel discussion featuring publisher Urvashi Butalia, journalist Nirupama Dutt, writers Rakshanda Jalil and Khushwant Singh, poetry by Surjit Patar were also held today."

Insure your assets against natural calamities,"KG Krishnamoorthy Rao

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning. Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides. Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability. During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop. These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery. Time to take a call Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer. The writer is Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited.

"Capt protests incentives for hill states, to take up Punjab’s case","Tribune news service

Chandigarh, August 18

Opposing the Centre’s decision to extend special incentives to the hill states, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday said he would pursue Punjab’s demand for extending similar incentives to the border areas and Kandi belt. Talking to mediapersons at the Punjab Kala Bhawan here after inaugurating a Photo Journalists Welfare Association exhibition, the Chief Minister said Punjab’s Kandi and border areas also had special problems and deserved to be put on par with the hill states in terms of the incentives. He said his government had earlier also raised the issue with the Centre and would pursue the case even more aggressively now that the decision on the hill states had been taken.

In response to a question on the upcoming verdict on Dera Sacha Sauda sect chief Ram Rahim, the Chief Minister made it clear that nobody would be allowed to disturb the state’s law and order. He said he had directed the police department to remain alert against any attempt to disrupt peace in Punjab. Peace had to be maintained at all costs in order to ensure the state’s progress, he added. To a question on the T Haq Committee findings and recommendations on the crop loan waiver issue, the Chief Minister said he had received the report and would study it and take appropriate decisions in the interest of the farmers. The additional loan liability his government would need to incur in order to repay the loans of the farmers was a necessity for helping the beleaguered farming community, said the Chief Minister, in response to another question. He clarified that no second committee had been formed to examine Justice Narang’s report on the sand mining auctions and the allegations against Power and Irrigation Minister Rana Gurjit. “I’ve marked the report to the Chief Secretary, who may have involved other officials for studying its findings,” he said. On the speculation of the expelled AAP leader Sucha Singh Chhotepur joining the Congress, the Chief Minister said while Chhotepur was a good friend they had not met for two months. n the occasion, the Chief Minister also condoled the death of veteran photographer S Paul, who passed away in New Delhi on Wednesday. A two-minute silence was observed in memory of the award-winning photojournalist. Amarinder also announced a running trophy for the Best Photographer of the Year, to be presented in December every year."

Ludhiana, August 17

The building branch of the Municipal Corporation has served a notice on the owners of Grand Walk (Gurdeep Jujhar, who is said to be close to the Badal family) regarding the “illegal” sixth floor of the mall. The notice was served on the owner by the ATP, Zone D, yesterday.

Three days’ time has been given to the owners to remove the illegally constructed floor on their own or else the MC will be forced to take action as per law, and during action, if there are any damages, the owners will be held responsible for the same. The notice says the floor construction was non-compoundable, for which no permission was sought by the owners. A leading pub is being run on the floor.

It was also learnt that the MC has filed a caveat in the case, so one-sided orders are not issued. It was filed with the Civil Judge, Senior Division.

Meanwhile, some tenants, including Brighteous Education Pvt Limited and Jasbir Singh, owner of R2P, who also have their establishments on the sixth floor of mall, have pleaded that they should not be made to suffer on account of a dispute between the owner of the mall and the MC. The case has been adjourned till August 22 for hearing arguments. Law Officer of MC Ashok Bajaj has filed a reply in the case.

After the removal of inter-locking tiles from a chunk of land (allegedly a green belt) by the MC, work to plant samplings on the land has been started by the civic body officials.

Earlier, the issue of alleged encroachment on MC-designated green belt measuring 3,000 square yard was highlighted by the Lok Insaf Party leader, Simarjit Singh Bains, around five days ago. Officials of the MC had gone to take “action” against the violation but they had to return without doing anything as SAD leaders objected to the move. The leaders had said action could not be taken without notice, and secondly, the MC staff had come to take action on a holiday, which was against law."
India can take on China under any circumstances: Ramdev,"Ludhiana, August 18

Yoga guru Ramdev on Friday criticised China over the ongoing military impasse on the Doklam Plateau and described India as content and contained country that could take on China under any circumstances. He said, “India is today a self-contented country with sufficient arms, ammunitions and army to fight against China.” “Let China accumulate blood, dollars, weapons and whatsoever, but they cannot threaten or harm our nation under any circumstances,” he added. He said how could China threaten the nation when the world knew that India had one of the largest markets and the fact that China could generate almost Rs 20 lakh crore of business and earn a profit of approximately Rs 5 lakh crore, which is almost half of the revenue earned by the Centre. “I think India must strongly take on China and compel them to bend at their knees. It can suppress weak countries of the globe, but a country like India is not going to be suppressed by these threats, and neither can China compete with India at any level,” Ramdev said. Earlier, he described China as the epitome of “promoting war and hatred” in the world, and reiterated his demand for a boycott of Chinese goods. “All Indians who feel for their country should boycott Chinese goods immediately,” he said. “Indians should strictly ban the purchase of Chinese products. This will reduce their market in our country and they would be compelled to step back,” he added. ANI"

Mars 2020 rover to use smart techniques to find signs of life,"London

NASA's Mars 2020 rover — which will look for signs of past life on the red planet — will use smart X-ray techniques originally developed to find the oldest life on Earth, according to a mission scientist.

The Mars Exploration Program with a planned launch in 2020 builds on the success of prior rovers, to make coordinated measurements that could detect signs of ancient life — or bio-signatures — in their original spatial context.

These techniques, known as ""spatially resolved bio- signature analysis"" derive from geochemical analysis of early life on Earth.

""Previous missions to Mars have used a relatively broad brush — analysing average chemistry over roughly the size of a postage stamp — to 'follow the water' and seek ancient habitable environments,"" said the mission's Deputy Project Scientist Ken Williford, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

""Mars 2020 takes the next natural step in its direct search for evidence of ancient microbial life, focusing measurements to the microbial scale and producing high- resolution maps over similarly postage stamp-sized analytical areas,"" said Williford, while speaking at the Goldschmidt conference in Paris.

He said that new scientific methods for searching for the most ancient evidence for life on Earth have led to a leap forward in capabilities for bio-signature detection.

Rather than using ""bulk"" geochemistry techniques that measure the average composition of a rock, Mars 2020 is developing new capabilities including X-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy to map the elemental, mineral, and organic composition of rocks at high spatial resolution, with analytical spot sizes about the width of a human hair, said Williford.

""Understanding the spatial distribution of chemical features preserved in ancient rocks is key to determining whether or not they were formed by life.

""Beyond astrobiology, these new techniques enable exploration of the planet Mars at telescopic to microscopic scales — from a mountain to a grain of sand,"" said Williford.

The instruments in development for Mars 2020 have roots in the search for the earliest signs of life on Earth, as well as life in extreme environments — deep underground, or in hydrothermal settings along ocean-floor ridges.

When these methods have been applied on Earth they have enabled scientists to lower limits of detection or to better understand formerly ambiguous observations.

In addition, the Mars 2020 mission will use the knowledge gained from its scientific exploration to select and collect key samples that could one day be examined in laboratories back on Earth.

Thirty to forty rock and sediment core samples, each about 15 grammes, will be sealed in titanium tubes and deposited in a safe location on the surface of Mars for possible retrieval by a future mission, said Williford.

He also discussed the three remaining candidate-landing sites for the Mars 2020 mission.

One site at Columbia Hills in Gusev crater, was visited previously by the Spirit rover and features silica deposits interpreted by some as analogous to hydrothermal springs known to be inhabited on Earth.

The two other sites are located close together on the edge of Isidis Planitia, one of the largest and oldest impact craters in the solar system. PTI"
In mission mode,"MOVIE REVIEW: TOILET EK PREM KATHA

Nonika Singh

How one feared that this would be no more than an audiovisual requiem for Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan! Surely, Toilet Ek Prem Katha does more to the cause than the television commercial featuring Vidya Balan. But the film that brings out the problem of open defecation out in the open is much more than a promotional advert.

Yes, as the subtitle says, it’s very much a love story inspired by true events. Set in a small town-like-village in UP where men ride motorbikes, wear fake Rayban glasses, are kicking and alive on Facebook, but have orthodox, almost archaic, views when it comes to making a toilet in their homes/villages.

But before the film’s real mission can unfurl, there is bitter-sweet love story of Shekhar (Akshay Kumar) and Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar). He falls for her and even though Jaya is cut from a different cloth, what makes her reciprocate his feelings is his earnestness. Trust Akshay to infuse sincerity and dignity to a character that could well be a caricature. Far removed from our urban sensibilities and far different from the superstar that he is, Akshay makes you care for this reel person Shekhar.

Indeed, it’s not easy to pass off an actor pushing 50 as a lover boy. So he is shown as a rather mature 36-year-old man whose ‘manglik’ status demands a marriage to a buffalo and a wife with two thumbs, a la Hrithik Roshan. But the real villain in this love story “har love story mein villain toh hona chaaheye” is a genuine problem that plagues a vast majority of India. Expectedly, love follows a different route and tails a husband’s resolve to first find and then make a toilet for his wife. But before you dismiss the film as a government mouthpiece on its most publicized programme, well it actually exposes a scam and informs how thousands of crores have been siphoned off in the name of bringing toilets to rural India. Of course, the Prime Minister (no names please) gets a clean chit, rather an emphatic pat on the back and there is even a reference to ‘notebandi’ in glowing terms.

Amidst all this, as the couple’s story threatens to turn into a half-baked revolution, their love shines and sparkles. Bhumi, who has walked the simple rustic path in her first film as well, comes out a ‘toper’ once more. With a desi accent in place, a woman with a heart and a resolve of steel, she is both believable and relatable. Even though modern urban India may not be able to fully comprehend the seriousness of the issue, both Akshay and Bhumi make you feel for them.

Besides, despite the gravity of the problem at hand, the first half packs mirth. With amusing dialogues in tow and a refreshing cameo by Divyendu Sharma as Akshay’s younger brother, the plot gets rolling.

Sure enough a film, that too cause-driven, can’t be without few sermon-laced melodramatic moments and second half does come riding with many in abundance. At more than one point the message becomes louder than the film’s entertainment value. Still the director does attempt the balancing act and navigates the film through its bumps to finally arrive at the expected finale. But as they say, “all is well that ends well” moreso when the intention too is right from the beginning. If you can ignore the motive to be on the right side of powers that be, the film does power a real cause and brings some genuine emotions on the table."
Exports to Nepal: Refund of IGST permissible,"TAX ADVICE

SC Vasudeva

The goods and services can be exported either on payment of IGST which can be claimed as refund after the goods have been exported, or under bond or Letter of Understanding (LUT) without payment of IGST.

In case of goods and services exported under bond or LUT, the exporter can claim refund of accumulated ITC on account of exports.

In case of goods, the shipping bill is the only document required to be filed with the Customs for making exports. Requirement of filing ARE 1/ARE 2 has been done away with.

The supplies made for export are to be made under self-sealing and self-certification without any intervention of the departmental officer.

The shipping bill filed with the Customs is treated as an application for refund of IGST and shall be deemed to have been filed after submission of export general manifest and furnishing of a valid return in Form GSTR-3 by the applicant.

n Export of goods to Nepal or Bhutan fulfils the condition of GST Law regarding taking goods out of India. Hence, export of goods to Nepal or Bhutan will be treated as zero rated and consequently will also qualify for all the benefits available to zero rated supplies under the GST regime. However, the definition of ‘export of services’ in the GST Law requires that the payment for such services should have been received by the supplier of services in convertible foreign exchange.

I have an issue related to export of goods to Nepal. We purchase goods from Delhi and sell in India as well as in Nepal. Earlier when GST was not implemented, there was no VAT/other tax applicable when we used to sell our goods to Nepal. But after July 1 with the GST implementation, what is the applicability of taxes? Is IGST applicable on goods sold to Nepal? Is benefit of Para No. 2.52 (a) of FTP (2015-2020) available? If we charge IGST on goods sold in Nepal, is the refund for that IGST available?

Security manager 'molests' woman staff member at Delhi's 5-star hotel,"New Delhi, August 18

A security manager of a five-star hotel was on Friday arrested for allegedly molesting a 33-year-old woman employee and attempting to disrobe her.

The arrest in the July 30 complaint filed by the woman came as a CCTV footage of the alleged incident was aired by TV channels in which the accused is purportedly seen trying to pull the woman’s sari.

Dependra Pathak, chief spokesperson of Delhi Police, said that the accused had been examined and the statement of the woman was taken after she approached the police with a complaint.

“Prima facie, the culpability on the part of the accused was found and he was arrested today. Further investigation has been taken up,” said Pathak, special commissioner of police (Operations).

The woman alleged that the man had pressured her to have physical relations with him and she was resisting his advances.

On July 29, he called her for a birthday party to his room, offered to get her gifts and then tried to disrobe her, she alleged.

The woman told the police that she complained to the HR of the hotel but was sacked.

After the complaint was filed, the police questioned both the sides and following a probe, the accused was arrested today, the officer said.

“After the woman lodged a complaint, a case was registered and the evidence she gave was being cross-checked. She also submitted some CCTV footages that were put under verification,” Pathak said.

The accused said certain things to counter what the woman said and they were also examined.

Another officer privy to the investigation said that the accused claimed that the woman had a boyfriend at the workplace and he was abusive towards her. Their conduct was improper, the accused alleged.

The accused claimed that one of the cameras installed at the hotel had captured her boyfriend assaulting her, following which he was sacked, said the officer.

The woman wanted her boyfriend to be hired again and on that day, she had come to the security manager’s room to plead for her boyfriend’s job, the accused told the police.

He alleged that the CCTV footage was concocted and doctored.

Char Dham all-weather road gets green clearance,"Neena Sharma

Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 17

Project deadline: 2019

The Ministry of Environment and Forests has given clearance to 370 km (5 hectare) all-weather Char Dham road network in Uttarakhand. The project envisages an 889 km all-weather road network covering eight districts in the state to be built at a cost of Rs 12,000 crore in two years. “ In all, 10 (from five places in Uttarakhand) proposals have been cleared by the Ministry and we are hopeful that the work on the prestigious project will start soon,” said Om Prakash, Additional Chief Secretary, PWD. In early August this year, the Union Minister for Highways, Nitin Gadkari, had urged the officials of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and other ministries to speed up the work. Uttarakhand PWD officials claim around 40 per cent of the land acquisition work is complete and the remaining work is expected to be completed in the coming months. The Central Government has already kept 2019 as the deadline for completing the entire project. The all-weather char Dham road network was inaugurated by Prime minister Narendra Modi in 2016. In the project, there is construction of two tunnels, 15 flyovers, 13 alignments at the landslide zone, 25 large bridges and 18 passenger service centres and 13 bypass. “The existing road network in the Chardham area of Uttarakhand and towns had been constructed along the river valley and close to big rivers like Alaknanda, Mandakini and Bhagirathi. However, this alignment is most vulnerable to floods, landslides and subsidence. These roads are lifeline of the people of the Garhwal division. These roads are also very strategic because of the China border,” said Om Prakash. Significantly, the project also entails felling of trees in several areas including, the Narendranagar forest division. According to one estimate, around 30,000 trees comprising of deodhar and spruce falling under the dense forest area are expected to be felled during the completion of the project. However, the Uttarakhand Government is of the opinion that the costs in the form of human safety far outweigh the losses in the form of felling of trees. “The Department of Forest undertakes plantation drive every year, their target is between one lakh trees to two lakh trees, we think this tempo will be maintained in these areas as well,” said Chief Secretary S Ramaswamy. Further, as the project is being funded by the Central Government, the Uttarakhand Government will benefit from the payment of GST calculated on the total cost of the project, which comes to around 12 per cent of the total cost of the project.Uttarakhand PWD officials claim around 40 per cent of the land acquisition work is complete and the remaining work is expected to be completed in the coming months.

High debt holds back India’s growth,"Jayshree Sengupta

Behind the hype of India’s high economic growth and its being the fastest growing emerging economy is a tale of average performance in various economic sectors

Jayshree Sengupta

BOTH the RBI and the recently released Economic Survey do not seem very upbeat about the economy in their reports. The biggest cheerer, however, has been the normal south-westerly monsoon this year. Otherwise the economy’s prospects would have looked gloomier. The grain output has been at a record level of 36.1 million tons in April-June 2017. With a good agricultural output, rural demand is likely to pick up which will hopefully give a boost to industry. Because on the industrial front there is nothing much to cheer about and industrial output has shrunk by 0.1 per cent instead of growing at a fast rate. Both manufacturing and mining growth has slackened due to excessive inventories and there has been a near stagnant output of oil and oil refineries’ products. Behind the hype of high economic growth and the fastest growing emerging economy today is a tale of average performance in various economic sectors. It means that jobs are not growing at the promised or desired pace and the job-seeking youth are likely to be disappointed badly. There is good news on the inflation front, however, as it has been at a record low of 1.54 per cent in June. Yet the overcautious RBI did not loosen its monetary policy stance and reduced the key rates only by 0.25 per cent in August. The Economic Survey does not seem to agree on this small rate cut. It would not give the right stimulus to demand in the coming months. Demand has been slack in many sectors. The Survey says there are deflationary impulses that will limit the economic growth. The slackness of growth is evident from another important indicator—electricity demand. There has been a deficiency of demand in electricity which tells a lot about the pace of industrial activity. Only consumer non-durables sector -- ordinary everyday use items like toothpaste, soap, washing powder etc.-- is growing on the back of resilient rural demand but consumer durables like appliances and white goods production has contracted due to sluggish urban demand. Commercial vehicle sales, however, have risen after two months of contraction and motorcycles demand rose for three consecutive months. It shows that the rural demand is still not subdued in this subsector. Core sector growth involving industries like coal, steel, fertilizers, power is down and has contracted. This sector has been bogged down by excessive inventories of coal and tepid demand. Only natural gas and steel output have risen in June-July. An increase in steel consumption can be encouraging news for the construction sector but cement output is falling which is a contradictory signal. What is very worrying is that new investment announcements have fallen to a 12-year low in the first quarter of the current financial year. Capital goods production, so important for the GDP growth through the multiplier effect, has slowed down over time. There is low capacity utilisation and that is why machinery does not get replaced or refurbished. It is also alarming to see from the RBI Industrial Survey that business optimism is waning regarding the pick-up of demand conditions across all sectors, capacity utilisation, profit margins and increase in employment. The number of stalled infrastructure projects is another sore point and this has resulted in the slowdown of output of infrastructure goods. Export growth was down in May and June but import growth has been in double digits due to a surge in oil imports and stockpiling of gold ahead of the GST. The trade deficit in Q1 was high at $40.1 billion, more than double of what it was one year ago. On the whole, the service sector is not looking too bad. The transportation subsector and freight carriage by air both rose on an annual basis. The hospitality sector has picked up with the help of more tourist arrivals and there has been an increase in passenger air traffic. The telecommunication subsector has been doing well and has shown sustained growth in the subscriber base and voice and data services. Internationally, foreign investors seem to be upbeat about India’s growth potential. Perhaps they are betting on a stable reformist government at the Centre to remain in charge of the economy for a while. Net FDI inflow doubled in April-May and went mainly to manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade and business services. FIIs have made net purchases of $15.2 billion in domestic debt and equity (July 31) and Forex reserves are higher at $392.9 billion. And the rupee has hardened against the dollar which is not good for exports. So what is the main prognosis? Something is holding back India’s growth and is leading to a lack of confidence in the business minds that is coming in the way of their undertaking new investments. There is global uncertainty for sure-- regarding the new policies that President Trump might unleash and there is a lack of robustness in global demand. But the main factors affecting the mood seem to be the two balance-sheet problems of banks and corporations. Both need immediate remedial action. The NPAs have to be reduced to make public sector banks healthy again. There is much corporate deleveraging going on and corporations are selling assets to reduce their debt ratios but it only shows the degree of stress and pile-up of unpaid debt that is stressing the corporate sector. Unless the mountain of banks’ NPAs (at Rs. 10 trillion now) is removed, the economy would not pick up and GDP growth would suffer. According to the former Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog, Arvind Panagariya, a solution to the NPAs will lead to faster credit expansion. In February 2017, non-food bank credit growth declined to a record low of 3.3 per cent as compared with an increase in credit of 9.9 per cent in February 2016. The Economic Survey has also pointed out that the UP government’s capital expenditure has fallen by 13 per cent to accommodate the Rs 36, 359 crore loan waiver. Other states will also be similarly hit and will be compelled to cut back on capital expenditure which will accentuate the problem of low capital goods growth in the country. The BSE Sensex, however, keeps on rising despite all the gloomy news—that is something to cheer about!"
2 new species of earthworm discovered in Kerala,"Kochi, August 18

Scientists have discovered two new species of earthworm belonging to the primitive family Moniligastridae in the Western Ghats mountain ranges in Kerala. The two new species, named Drawida polydiverticulata and Drawida thomasi, were described in the journal ZooKeys. The discovery was made by scientists S Prasanth Narayanan, S Sathrumithra, G Christopher, all affiliated with Kerala’s Mahatma Gandhi University, and JM Julka of the Shoolini University, Himachal Pradesh. The new earthworms are distinguished by a set of characters, according to the scientists. It turned out that Drawida polydiverticulata’s multiple lobes, also called diverticulums, an organ located in the front of its body, are unique amongst the members of the genus. This species was found to be widespread in the protected shola grasslands of the Munnar region, including Eravikulam National Park, Pampadun Shola National Park and Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. The second new earthworm, Drawida thomasi, was collected at the Kozhippara Waterfalls near Kakkadampoyil, at the border between Malappuram and Kozhikode. To date, there are 73 species of the genus Drawida confirmed to be living in the Indian subcontinent. However, the greatest concentration (43 species) is found in the Western Ghats. The genus has an important centre of speciation in Kerala, the study said. IANS"
"US, Japan vow to boost defence cooperation with India, S Korea, Australia","Washington, August 18

The US and Japan have agreed to advance their multilateral security and defence cooperation with countries like India, South Korea and Australia, amidst China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region. “We will cooperate to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defence cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and other southeast Asian countries,” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a news conference here with Defence Secretary James Mattis.

The news conference was also jointly addressed by Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera. “(With) ROK (South Korea), Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries, we will promote more than ever before cooperation in security and defence,” Kono said in Japanese which was translated into English. The four top officials were interacting with reporters after the newly launched US-Japan Two Plus Two dialogue. During the meeting held on Thursday at the headquarters of the State Department, the four leaders among other issues discussed the increasing challenge posed by China in the region and the need to enhance multilateral cooperation with other countries, including India, in the region. “The ministers highlighted ongoing Alliance efforts to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defence cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries,” a joint statement issued after the meeting said. “The ministers underscored the importance of cooperating to promote a rules-based international order, taking note of the United States’ continued commitment to maintain a strong presence in the region and Japan’s initiatives demonstrated by its ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy’,” the statement said. According to the joint statement, the ministers strongly encouraged China to take decisive measures to urge North Korea to change its course of action. Expressing continuing concerns about the security environment in the East China Sea, they reaffirmed the importance of working together to safeguard the peace and stability of the East China Sea. Expressing serious concern about the situation in the South China Sea, they reaffirmed their opposition to unilateral coercive actions by claimants, including the reclamation and militarisation of disputed features, that alter the status quo and increase tensions. Reiterating the importance of the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes through full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, including arbitration, they emphasised the importance of compliance with the international law of the sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including respect for freedom of navigation and over-flight and other lawful uses of the sea. “The Ministers underlined the significance of continued engagement in the South China Sea, including through respective activities to support freedom of navigation, bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, and coordinated capacity building assistance,” the statement said. Tillerson said they discussed their concern about the security environment in the East China Sea and South China Sea. “The United States and Japan oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands, and we reaffirmed that Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty covers these islands. We also oppose militarisation activity in the South China Sea,” he said. “Maritime disputes should be settled peacefully and maintain the freedom of navigation in accordance with the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. We maintain our unwavering commitment to the 2015 guidelines for US-Japan defence cooperation, and we have instructed our staff to accelerate their implementation,” he said. Kono echoed Tillerson’s views, saying Japan shared its concerns regarding the situation surrounding East and South China Sea. “We reaffirmed that the Senkaku Islands are within the scope of Article 5 of the Japan-US Security Treaty, and that we would oppose any unilateral behaviour attempting to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands,” he said. “For the peace and stability of East Asia and East China Sea, we will continue to cooperate with the United States. On the South China Sea, we have confirmed that we need to continue to engage ourselves and watch for any acts which would impede freedom of navigation,” Kono said. “Under this severe security environment, under all situations, the alliance must secure seamless response, and it’s extremely important. And we agreed that we would properly examine ways to strengthen the alliance,” he said."

Donald Trump fires adviser Steve Bannon,"Washington, August 18

President Donald Trump fired chief strategist Steve Bannon on Friday, the White House announced, ending the turbulent tenure of a rabble-rousing conservative media entrepreneur and political activist who was a darling of Trump's base. ""White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. ""We are grateful for his service and wish him the best."" A source familiar with the decision, which had been under consideration for a while, said Bannon had been given an opportunity to depart on his own terms. ""The president made up his mind on it over the past couple of weeks,"" the source said. Kelly had been evaluating Bannon's role within the White House. ""They gave him an opportunity to step down knowing that he was going to be forced to,"" the source said. Bannon damaged his standing by giving an interview to the liberal American Prospect this week in which he was seen to be undercutting Trump's position on North Korea.

He said he would still welcome if a commission headed by a Judge of a High Court took adequate steps to check corruption in the state. He reiterated that all issues of corruption from the time of inception of the state till date needed to be probed. He also held that the provision should also be made that corruption in future was full proof.

Spanish Police kill 5 suspects linked to Barcelona attack,"Barcelona, August 18

Drivers ploughed into pedestrians in two quick-succession, separate attacks in Barcelona and another popular Spanish seaside city, killing 14 people and injuring more than 100 others.

The emergency services said a woman injured in the Cambrils attack has died, bringing the total to 14 in both attacks.

In the first incident, which police qualified as a ""terrorist attack,"" the driver of a white van sped into a street packed full of tourists in central Barcelona yesterday afternoon, knocking people out of the way and leaving 13 dead.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Some eight hours later in Cambrils, a city 120 kilometres south of Barcelona, an Audi A3 car hit pedestrians, injuring six civilians -- one of them in a critical condition -- and one police officer, said the government of the Spanish region of Catalonia where both cities are located.

Police shot dead four of the Cambrils attackers and a fifth later died of his injuries.

They said they were ""working on the hypothesis that the terrorists shot dead in Cambrils are linked to what happened in Barcelona"".

While little more was known about the attack in Cambrils in the early hours of today morning, witnesses in Barcelona told of scenes of chaos and horror.

They recounted how bodies were strewn along the famous Las Ramblas boulevard where the driver went on a rampage as other people fled for their lives, screaming in panic.

The carnage in a city hugely popular with tourists from around the world is the latest in a wave of attacks in Europe where vehicles have been used as weapons of terror.

As world leaders united in condemning the carnage, the IS propaganda agency Amaq claimed that it was carried out by ""soldiers"" from the jihadist group.

Police announced the arrest of two suspects, identified as a Spaniard and a Moroccan, but said the driver was still on the run.

""We're united in grief,"" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in a televised address after rushing to Barcelona, the biggest city in Catalonia, a region in Spain's northeast whose separatist government is defying Madrid with a drive for independence.

""Above all we're united in the firm intention to defeat those who want to take our values and way of life from us.""

There were at least 18 nationalities among the Barcelona victims who came from countries as varied as France, Venezuela, Australia, Ireland, Peru, Algeria and China, according to Spain's civil protection agency.

Belgium said one of its citizens had died in the Las Ramblas assault, while The Hague said three Dutch were injured and a Greek diplomat reported three nationals had been wounded -- a woman and her two children.

Las Ramblas is one of Barcelona's busiest streets, lined with shops and restaurants and normally packed with tourists and street performers until well into the night.

""When it happened I ran out and saw the damage,"" local shop worker Xavi Perez told AFP.

""There were bodies on the ground with people crowding round them. People were crying. There were lots of foreigners.""

Footage broadcast on Spanish television showed a white van, its front crushed, abandoned by its driver on a road surrounded by police cars.

Tom Gueller, who lives on a road next to Las Ramblas said he saw the vehicle speeding along the boulevard.

""It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas,"" he told BBC radio.

Spain had until now been spared the kind of extremist violence that has rocked nearby France, Belgium and Germany.

But it was hit by what is still Europe's deadliest jihadist attack in March 2004, when bombs exploded on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people in an attack claimed by Al Qaeda-inspired extremists.

Police said yesterday that one of the arrested suspects in the Barcelona attack was a Spaniard born in Melilla, a Spanish territory on Morocco's north coast, and the other a Moroccan named as Driss Oukabir.

The Spaniard was arrested in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres south of Barcelona, the scene of an explosion in a house late Wednesday that left one person dead and seven wounded and is believed to be linked to Thursday's assault.

""We suspect that they (the occupants) were preparing an explosive device,"" Josep Lluis Trapero of the regional Catalonia police told reporters.

Thursday's attack drew condemnation from across the globe.

US President Donald Trump condemned the ""terror attack"" and said the United States ""will do whatever is necessary to help"", adding: ""Be tough & strong, we love you!""

France's President Emmanuel Macron -- whose country has witnessed a series of bloody jihadist atrocities including a truck rampage in Nice in July 2016 that killed 86 people -- said his thoughts were with the victims of the ""tragic attack"".

The Nice carnage and other assaults including the 2015 shootings and bombings on Paris nightspots were claimed by the Islamic State, but it is believed to be the first IS claim of an attack in Spain.

Catalonia has the highest concentration of radicalised Islamists in the country along with Madrid and the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Morocco.

According to the interior ministry, more than 190 ""jihadist terrorists"" have been arrested since 2015, most of them for propaganda, recruitment for extremist groups or ""glorifying terrorism"". —AFP"

Kotkhai rape-murder: CBI wants lie-detector test on accused,"Kotkhai rape-murder: CBI wants lie-detector test on accused





Meanwhile, the agency has examined over 100 people in connection with the rape and killing that triggered massive public outrage against the state government, the sources said.

Among those quizzed by the Central probe agency were kin of some influential officials of the state government, they said.

The case was handed over to the CBI by the Himachal Pradesh High Court on July 19 on the state government’s plea amid public outburst against the state police. The CBI filed two FIRs on July 22.

The 16-year-old girl had gone missing after school hours on July 4 from Haliala forest in Kotkhai area of Shimla district.

Her naked body was found in the forest on July 6 and the post-mortem report confirmed rape.

The DGP constituted the SIT headed by an officer of IG rank, which arrested six persons. One of the accused was killed in police custody in Kotkhai Police Station.

The CBI had also registered the case of custodial death of one of the suspects who was a Nepalese citizen, it said. PTI"

Lucknow, August 18

The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court on Friday directed the Uttar Pradesh government and Director General Medical Education to file a detailed counter-affidavit within six weeks on the Gorakhpur deaths. The case will be heard on October 9. A division bench of Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Daya Shankar Tiwari passed the order on a PIL filed by activist Nutan Thakur after hearing state Advocate General Raghavendra Pratap Singh and counsel for the department of Medical Education Sanjay Bhasin.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Opposing the petition, the Advocate General said the state government had taken every possible measure in the matter. He also assured the court of all possible action as soon as the probe report is submitted by the Chief Secretary. However, the petitioner argued that the state government action so far gave the impression that they were trying to hide facts and shield certain guilty people. According to the petitioner, under such circumstances the Chief Secretary’s inquiry would be eyewash. She also emphasised the problem of private practice in state hospitals and medical colleges, seeking complete ban on that."
A tad too sweet,"MOVIE REVIEW: BAREILLY KI BARFI

Nonika Singh

Ever since Anand L Rai invented patakha Tanu, which fit Kangana Ranaut like a glove, there has been a deluge of perky small-town female characters. So, Bitty (Kriti Sanon) of Bareilly Ki Barfi comes as no surprise. This daughter of a sweet shop owner is bold and vivacious, can break into a jig (break dance to be precise) at the slightest turn of music, smokes and drinks and has the courage to tell her suitors that she is no virgin. No wonder she can't find a suitable groom. After all girls like her, few and far between, are a ‘disaster.’

But before she decides to call it quits and run away from home, she stumbles upon a book Bareilly Ki Barfi that best describes a girl just like her with no value judgements attached to her behaviour which others, including her mother, call misdemeanors.

Thus begins her search for the author and director takes us on to the love path where identities are muddled and soon love has three facets, not just the visible Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti. If Kriti is just right for the exuberant Bitty and Khurrana is endearing and exasperating in turns as his character demands, Rajkummar Rao as the third angle and the underdog is brilliant. He gets even better when he transforms into the snazzy confident, almost brash guy. Only if he had some more screen time as well as something more (spoiler alert).

Nevertheless, for a considerable part the director keeps you invested in the story told simply as well as has you nibbling over the key question---who will get the girl? Fleetingly, the film reminds you of those delectable super fresh romances such as Sai Paranjpye’s Katha. But if those films skillfully and subtly delved into complexities and many shades of human nature, here the director decides to play super safe and love story ends the way you so hope and wish it won’t. The conflict resolution is a downer.

Thus Bareilly Ki Barfi, despite the surface gloss of rebellion, turns too sweet. If you like your love stories more sugar than spice be Bareilly’s guest. We would have preferred a sharper climax, the sparkle of which can otherwise be seen interspersed in-between and not just in Javed Akhtar’s witty voice-over that takes you enroute Bareilly ki galiyan, especially the Misra household that is peopled with few but animated characters and competent actors (Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi as parents). Dialogues such as Agar ladkiyan shakal dekhti to desh ke aadhe se zyaada ladke kunwaare hote have a zing. Indeed, Bareilly… has many delightful one-liners and amusing moments but the overall impact is not tantalizing enough to make it a wholesome fare one must bite into. Unless you have a sweet tooth…the saccharine-high barfi will leave you craving for more."

"Doctor, nurse shifted over hospital death","Our Correspondent

Abohar, August 17

On the assurance of Sub-Divisional Magistrate Poonam Singh, villagers, various unions and relatives of Sukhwinder Kaur, who died allegedly due to the negligence of a doctor and staff of the Civil Hospital here yesterday, agreed to lift dharna from the hospital this evening.

Whosoever was found guilty would face action, she said. The SDM assured financial assistance to the surviving daughters of deceased Sukhwinder Kaur by the District Red Cross Society and from the Chief Minister Relief Fund and assured that government doctors or nurses if found working in private hospitals would be sacked. Following this, villagers, various unions and relatives of Sukhwinder Kaur agreed to lift dharna. The deceased will be cremated on Friday, they said. Meanwhile, doctors and paramedical staff in the Abohar Civil Hospital and community health centres in Khuikhera and Seetogunno, besides other hospitals across the district, today went on a strike and staged a parallel dharna.

"Sharif, sons fail to appear before anti-corruption body","Lahore, August 18

Ousted Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his two sons on Friday failed to appear before the top anti-graft body, which wanted to interrogate them over money laundering and corruption charges revealed by the Panama Papers. On July 28, a five-member Supreme Court Bench disqualified Sharif from continuing in his office for possessing a work permit at the firm of his son in the UAE. The court also ordered the NAB to investigate money laundering and other corruption charges against Sharif, his children, son-in-law Safdar and federal finance minister Ishaq Dar, a relative of Sharif, in light of the report of the Joint Investigation Team. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) following a Supreme Court order had issued summons to Sharif and his sons - Hussain and Hasan - to interrogate them at its Lahore office over their offshore properties revealed last year by the Panama Papers leak. A 10-member NAB team had reached Lahore from Rawalpindi to record the statements of the Sharifs, but they did not turn up before the office closed at 3 pm local time, a NAB official told PTI. “Sharif and his sons were supposed to join the investigation today here in Lahore office but we are informed by the office of Sharif that he is not coming. No reason has been given to us,” the official said. He said the NAB would issue second summons to them in two weeks. A leader close to the Sharif family denied receiving any summons. “Nawaz Sharif and his sons had not yet received the NAB summons. Sharif will only decide whether or not to appear before the NAB after receiving the summons,” Senator Pervaiz Rashid told PTI. But another leader of the ruling PML-N party said Sharif has decided not to join the investigation. He said Sharif will join the probe only after the Supreme Court decides his review petition against the court’s verdict that disqualified him. The 67-year-old three-time prime minister has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, Sharif held a defiant roadshow with thousands of supporters from Islamabad to Lahore to project his political strength after the Supreme Court verdict. One of the three applications Sharif filed in the Supreme Court calls for staying “further implementation of the judgment till a decision on the review petition is taken”. The apex court is likely to take up Sharif’s review petition early next month after judges return from vacation. Sharif has expressed serious concerns on the NAB investigation, saying it was unprecedented for a Supreme Court judge to supervise NAB proceedings against him and his family members to get a “desired result”. “Sharif has also been advised by some of his party members to boycott the NAB investigations. He would not get any relief as it has already been decided to grill him,” the PML-N leader said on the condition of anonymity. The NAB said it will issue second summons to the Sharifs if they do not join the investigation after the first summons. The third and final summons will be issued next month if there is no compliance even after the second summons, it said. Sharif, his sons, daughter Maryam, son-in-law Safdar and relatives Ishaq Dar and Tariq Shafi face several cases, including over the Al-Azizia Steel Mills, the Hill Metal Establishment and Hudabiya Papers Mills.

Indian-origin mom wants action over daughter’s suicide in UK,"London, August 18

An Indian-origin mother whose daughter committed suicide last year after suffering physical and emotional abuse at the hands of an ex-boyfriend has written to a UK police force to disclose evidence linked to the death and take action against the culprit.

Daksha Dalal wants Leicestershire Police to hand over any evidence they hold so her family can consider a private prosecution over the death of 25-year-old Meera Dalal in February last year.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting suicide on the day Meera Dalal died but was released with no further action.

An inquest into her death in May this year was told that she took her own life as a result of domestic violence.

“I seriously felt as if I would get some justice from the police but I didn’t. A loss of a child is an intense grief that you will never, ever be able to overcome. If I could help one girl, one child or somebody’s daughter, that would make me happy,” Daksha Dalal told the BBC.

She is trying to obtain copies of her daughter’s medical records, along with other evidence held by police and has written to Leicestershire Police asking for hospital and doctors’ reports, an audio recording of a call her daughter made to police, CCTV footage of the former boyfriend at her daughter’s workplace and all police reports in relation to the investigation.

A general physician report read out at the inquest earlier this year said Dalal was given treatment in hospital on one occasion, “having been the subject of domestic violence”.

The inquest had concluded that the former liaison officer for Nuffield Health, a private hospital in Leicester, died as a result of suicide.

The family had made a complaint to Leicestershire Police following Dalal’s death and the force was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

The 50-page investigation report contains a catalogue of police incidents involving Dalal and her then boyfriend dating back to December 2013.

The conduct of four police officers was investigated by the IPCC, but the investigator found there was no case to answer for misconduct.

Leicestershire Police said: “Following a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Meera Dalal who died on 15 February 2016, police found no evidence to warrant a prosecution being brought by the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service).

“As a result of her death, and previous contact between Leicestershire Police and Meera, an inquiry was conducted by the IPCC, which concluded there was insufficient evidence to consider misconduct proceedings and there was no case to answer for the officers involved.”

The IPCC said: “On the basis of the evidence available, and at the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator formed the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable misconduct meeting could find that any of the officers had breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour, Duties and Responsibilities.”

Dalal killed herself at her family home at Syston in Leicestershire and was discovered by her father Ashok Dalal.

Her mother has since been raising awareness of domestic abuse through a Facebook page in her daughter’s memory. — PTI"

Children avoid eye contact when anxious,"Washington DC

A study recently revealed that children, aged nine to 13, pay close attention to potentially threatening information and avoid eye contact when anxious.

According to researchers, the shorter and less frequently they look in the eyes of others, the more likely they are to be afraid of them, even when there may be no reason to be.

They also found that the child continues feeling fearful of that person even though he/she may no longer be threatening or scary.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Kalina Michalska from the University of California, Riverside said that looking at someone's eyes helps them understand whether a person is feeling sad, angry, fearful, or surprised. But less is known about eye patterns in children - so, understanding those patterns can help us learn more about the development of social learning.

The researchers showed 82 children, aged 9 to 13 years old, images of two women on a computer screen.

The computer was equipped with an eye tracking device that allowed them to measure where on the screen children were looking, and for how long.

The participants were originally shown each of the two women a total of four times.

Next, one of the images was paired with a loud scream and a fearful expression, and the other one was not. At the end, children saw both faces again without any sound or scream.

They examined that the participants' eye contact when the face was not expressing any emotions, to determine if children make more eye contact with someone who is associated with something bad or threatening, even when they are not expressing fear at that moment.

The results suggested that anxious children tend to avoid making eye contact, which leads to greater fear experience. Even though avoiding eye contact may reduce anxiety in the short term.

The research appears in journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. —ANI"

Tax benefits for hill states,"Tax benefits for hill states

Punjab has a reason to resent

THE Centre may revive an inter-state wrangling over a tax holiday to the hill states. Already the idea of having a single market and a single tax has been distorted and needlessly complicated. The NDA government has added one more complication to the GST. It has promised to refund its share of 58 per cent of the taxes it will collect under the GST as part of the deal to promote industrial units in the hill and north-eastern states. The new arrangement done outside the GST Council places on the states — Himachal Pradesh, J &K and Uttarakhand, among them — a responsibility to refund to these industries, numbering some 4,200, the remaining 42 per cent of the taxes collected under the GST. This is in accordance with the original tax holiday plan meant to encourage industry in these states. However, it is not yet clear whether these states will be able to meet their part of the commitment now. They had earlier promised tax incentives in the hope that local youth would get employment on priority, and more importantly, over a period when industrial establishments get going, they would not only recover the sacrificed tax revenue but also have a regular source of income. However, under the new arrangement the GST would be collected from these industries by the states consuming their products. By reimbursing 42 per cent tax claims of these units all that the hill states would get in return is possible employment for local youth, subject to meeting their requirements. It has been suggested that the Himachal assembly poll time-table has influenced the Central decision. Ever since the Vajpayee government offered the tax holiday in 2003 for a 10-year period which was extended by the UPA, Punjab has blamed its failure to attract fresh investment or stop existing units from relocating to other states on the Central largess to Himachal Pradesh. The latest Central decision will not be appreciated by the political leadership in Punjab, struggling to bring in new units and woo the existing ones with sops, including subsidised power and tax incentives. This is another side-effect of the GST regime."
"Starc out, Faulkner back in Australia squad for India tour","Melbourne, August 18

Australia on Friday recalled the pace duo of James Faulkner and Nathan Coulter-Nile for the five-match ODI series against India next month but Mitchell Starc was left out owing to a foot injury. Faulkner, who was the man of the match in the 2015 World Cup final, was omitted from Australia’s Champions Trophy squad. The 27-year-old has played 67 ODIs, grabbing 95 wickets. India and Australia are set to play five ODIs and three Twenty20s between September 17 and October 13. “Pacemen James Faulkner and Nathan Coulter-Nile have been recalled to Australia’s ODI squad for their tour of India in September and October, as have allrounders Ashton Agar and Hilton Cartwright,” Cricket Australia said in a statement. The 29-year-old Coulter-Nile, who has also been picked in the Twenty20 squad, has been battling injuries in recent years, which has resulted in a mere 16 ODI appearances. He has 27 wickets to his credit in the 50-over format. Cricket Australia stated that Coulter-Nile had been picked after having “shown impressive signs in the Indian Premier League earlier this year”. The pacer turns up for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. “Nathan brings raw pace to the side with good variation. “It is great to see him back from injury and we are hopeful he will have a big impact in this series,” selector Trevor Hohns said. “James Faulkner is a solid one-day campaigner and is very familiar with subcontinent conditions, coming off a very good tour of Sri Lanka last year. We hope he will take his chance in returning to the one-day side,” he added. In the left-out list, Starc was joined by all-rounder Moises Henriques and the injured troika of Chris Lynn, John Hastings and James Pattinson. All of them were a part of the squad that competed in the Champions Trophy in June. “Starc has been rested for the entire tour as he continues his recovery from a foot injury and he will now target a return in the domestic one-day cup for NSW Blues ahead of the Magellan Ashes,” the CA said. In the T20 squad, pacers Jason Behrendorff and Kane Richardson have been selected, while Josh Hazlewood has not been included for the T20 leg of the tour. Veteran all-rounder Dan Christian and wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine have been named, while Coulter-Nile has also been named for the 20-over matches. “Dan is a very experienced allrounder who can be a very dangerous batsman. He had a solid IPL season this year and we believe his bowling will be well suited to the conditions we will face in India,” T20 selector Mark Waugh said of Behrendorff. Skipper Steve Smith and David Warner have returned to the T20 side after missing this year’s series against Sri Lanka due to a clash with the Test tour of India. Chennai, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Indore and Kolkata are scheduled to host the five-match ODI series while Hyderabad, Ranchi and Guwahati will be venues for the T20s.

The squads:

Australia ODI squad: Steve Smith (C), David Warner, Ashton Agar, Hilton Cartwright, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Patrick Cummins, James Faulkner, Aaron Finch, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Adam Zampa.

SC seeks govt response on compensating 10-year-old rape victim,"New Delhi, August 18

The Supreme Court on Friday sought responses from the Centre and the Chandigarh administration on a plea seeking Rs 10 lakh compensation for a 10-year-old rape victim who delivered a baby yesterday.

A Bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta also issued notices to the member secretary of the National Legal Services Authority and the District Legal Services Authority of Chandigarh and posted the matter for further hearing on August 22.

The minor rape victim, whose plea seeking permission to undergo termination of pregnancy was turned down by the apex court earlier, yesterday delivered a baby at a government hospital at Chandigarh.

Senior advocate Indira Jaising, who is an amicus curiae in the matter, mentioned the plea before the bench which took it up for hearing.

Jaising told the bench that a compensation of Rs 10 lakh should be given to the rape victim as she was only ten-year old and cannot look after the child.

Referring to yesterday's apex court judgement, the senior counsel said the court had awarded Rs 10 lakh compensation to a rape victim whose plea for abortion was turned down.

""A 10-year-old mother cannot look after the child. Nothing has been paid to her so far,"" Jaising told the Bench.

On July 28, the Supreme Court had dismissed a plea seeking its nod for terminating the 32-week-old pregnancy of the ten-year-old rape survivor after taking note of a medical report that abortion was neither good for the girl, nor for the foetus.

The PIL was filed after a Chandigarh district court on July 18 refused to let the girl undergo the abortion.

Courts allow medical termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act and can make an exception only if the foetus is genetically abnormal.

"The Tribune, Personal finance news","KG Krishnamoorthy Rao

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning.

Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides.

Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability.

During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop.

These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery.

Time to take a call

Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer.

In a clear message to errant unaided private schools, the government has served fresh show-cause notices to around 449 private schools over their failure to implement the Justice Anil Dev Singh panel recommendations over refunding excess fee, warning them to comply with the Delhi High Court orders or face action.

Addressing reporters on the issue, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said around 449 schools have been asked to implement the Justice Anil Dev Singh Committee recommendations failing which the government as a “last resort” will be forced to take them over.

The committee had scrutinised a total of 1,108 private unaided schools and of them it was found that around 544 schools were found to have changed excess fees on the pretext of Sixth Pay Commission.

“Of them 44 schools fall under minority, 15 schools have refunded as told to the High Court while around five have already deposited excess fess as specified by the Anil Dev committee.

Further, 17 schools have already been served notices by the government, 13 have been closed and one already taken over by the government. The government has served notices to 449 schools on the issue four days ago with a deadline to respond within two weeks, said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

“The Delhi Government does not intend to “interfere"" into their functioning, but will surely will “discipline” such schools, if needed, said Kejriwal.

The schools are among over 500 schools under scanner for overcharging parents on the pretext of implementing recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission as per the report by the committee headed by Justice Anil Dev Singh.

“Some of them are doing good work. But if they don't implement the recommendations of the panel's report then we will take them over as a last resort,"" Kejriwal said."

As the memory of those horrible days and years fades away, we are itching to reopen some of the settled questions about our collective existence. Perhaps after seventy years it is time, once again, to revisit those blood-stained days and recall Partition’s sobering lessons…

Harish Khare

With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

Admittedly, the British decision to grant India independence was principally driven by the simple fact that the four-year-long World War II had totally exhausted the imperial will to rule; in fact, the British desire to hold on to India had already been tested morally and ethically by the Indian National Congress, which under the Mahatma’s leadership had waged a unique peaceful freedom struggle. The British middle classes, with their pretensions to liberal values, had no answer to the Mahatma’s saintly leadership. The Union Jack had to be lowered from Red Fort, sooner than later.

But by the time the British came to the conclusion that they could no longer stay in India, they had already instigated mischief among the Indian leadership. The colonial rulers had cynically worked on the Indian society’s religious fault lines, encouraged and cultivated sectarian agendas which ultimately coalesced into the demand for a separate nation.

The Muslim League, under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had already legitimised use of violence in pursuit of its demands. The League’s call for ‘Direct Action’ was an invitation to chaos and the mobs. Once a society develops a taste for violence, its leaders are rarely able to calibrate and control the streets. By the time August 15, 1947, came the Muslim League’s leadership skills were already over-extended even in what came to be known as East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In India, the Congress leadership was barely able to push the mobs back.

Still, a monumental tragedy was destined to take place. The sheer scale of the number of Hindus and Sikhs, who found themselves forced to migrate out to India and of the Muslims in India who had to leave for Pakistan, was maddeningly benumbing. Grand statistics simply cannot convey the trauma and the tragedy that engulfed this part of the world soon after August 1947.

A sympathetic American reporter and an eye-witness described the post-Partition days as “one of the great convulsions of modern history.” On December 12, 1947, he tried to convey the nature of disaster that overtook the two nascent nations: “Consider what has happened. In an orgy of religious-communal madness, some 10 million citizens of the north-western provinces had been routed from their homes. An unknown total, probably between 2,00,000 and 5,00,000 (compared to 2,95,000 American war-dead in World War II), had been put to sword, machine-gunned, or roasted alive. The splintered Punjab administrations were quickly swamped and there even appeared danger that the infant central governments of India and Pakistan Dominions might succumb.” Phillips Talbot (An American Witness to India’s Partition).

The frenzy in the East was no less violent, no less gory, no less bloody than it was in the West. The Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs joyfully discovered their capacity for inflicting violence and death on their erstwhile neighbours as well as total strangers. The massacres, the mayhem and the madness outpaced humanity and all known civic-minded virtues; the trauma and tragedy touched nearly every home, every life. No one was unaffected; no one could remain emotionally unmolested by this continental turbulence.

After a few months the mobs could be rolled back and blood could be washed off the streets, but the memory of Partition-centric violence was now etched on the soul of an entire generation on both sides. The two successive states had entrenched habits and protocols of acrimony and suspicion and political leaders and sectarian interests saw to it that India and Pakistan would not settle down to a peaceful co-existence.

The raw memories of Partition also impacted on how the two states went about the business of creating an internal political order. Once Jinnah was gone, Pakistan hastily abandoned his ideas of an inclusive society and nation. In India, the Mahatma was assassinated. The murder was planned by those who wanted to make India a Hindu State and they thought the Old Man was an obstacle. Ironically, the assassination settled, once for all, how India would grant equal protection and equal citizenship to all its minorities.

Perhaps some in India would argue that Partition’s unfinished agenda still remains unattended. May be, after 70 years, we should simply revisit those horrible, horrible days of chaos and disorder before we embark on another self-defeating journey…"

The police have failed to make any arrest in the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Sector 23 on Tuesday. Even after more than 48 hours, the police have failed to find any substantial clue in the case and are groping in the dark. The Class VIII girl was raped at knife-point at Children Traffic Park in Sector 23. While the police have denied releasing any sketch of the accused, sources said around half a dozen sketches had been prepared. However, the victim did not identify any of the sketches as those of the accused. The police have thus not released any official sketch, confirmed an official. Around 8:15 am on Tuesday, the victim was crossing the park to go to her school to attend the Independence Day celebrations when the accused dragged her into a nullah at knife-point and raped her. The victim went home after the incident and informed her family, who then approached the police. According to the police, who have questioned over 32 suspects, the accused could be a middle-aged drug addict.

Why whisky tastes better with water revealed,"Why whisky tastes better with water revealed

LONDON: Whisky connoisseurs have long thought that mixing a few drops of water could enhance the taste of the drink, and now a study has revealed a scientific explanation for why that may be true. Researchers at Linnaeus University in Sweden have found that adding water to whisky alters the drink’s molecules to make it taste better. Whisky is a chemically complicated beverage. After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled. However, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 per cent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly. Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. “The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,” said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University. “One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,” Karlsson said. Researchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions. They found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid. “This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,” said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University. “Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface. “An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,” Friedman said. These findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass. “How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual. Some people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,” Karlsson added. The research was published in the journal Scientific Reports. PTI"

Amritsar, August 17

In yet another robbery incident, three armed persons looted an employee of a finance firm when he was returning after collecting installments from clients late last evening.

Munish Kumar, the victim, works as a recovery or a collection agent with Janlakshmi Finance Company on Tarn Taran Road here. He was returning from Mullechak village after collecting money on his motorcycle.

He said when he reached near the Bhagtanwala chowk, three unknown motorcycle-borne youths came from behind and intercepted him. They took out a sharp-edged weapon and threatened him to hand over the bag. When he tried to resist, they snatched his bag containing cash to tune of Rs 1.40 lakh, a tablet, a finger- printing machine and a charger before fleeing. He told the police that the motorcycle had the registration number 4152 written with paint.

The police authorities said that a case under Section 379-B, IPC, against unknown persons had been registered.

Jagtar Singh, SHO, Gate Hakima police, stated that though the police had scrutinised several CCTV cameras but the images were not clear. The accused had covered their faces and therefore could not be recognised. Further investigations were under progress.

This is second such incident in the past one month in which an employee of the same finance firm was robbed by robbers. Earlier, Karan Mahajan, a collection agent of the company, was robbed of Rs 60,000 near Naushehra Kalan village on July 19. He works as a collection agent for the Majitha Road branch of Jan Lakshami Finance Service Company.

He said he was returning to the branch at around 12 noon after collecting Rs 60,000 from 20 clients when the incident took place.

Employees of finance firms have been easy targets of the miscreants. In May 25 last year, two motorcycle-borne youths snatched Rs 5.60 lakh from Sunil Kumar, an employee of a Delhi-based finance company, in the posh Green Avenue locality here. He was going to deposit the cash in the bank when the incident took place."
Reporting turbulent times,"ARCHIVES

The Tribune, which continued to print except for a brief break, stood tall in the tough times, mirroring the events that were reshaping the lives of millions

Roopinder Singh

The Tribune, ever the chronicler of the people and events of Punjab, found itself in an unusual situation of becoming the subject of news reports. In the days leading to Partition, two employees were killed in Lahore, one was stabbed. The Tribune ceased publication in Lahore on August 16, 1947. A truck and a car evacuated 94 staff and some of their family members. The printing press it left behind, newsprint, typewriters and a van were given to Pakistan Times by the West Punjab Government. Just 40 days later, on September 25, 1947, the newspaper resumed publication — from Simla. Yes, the printing press was small, staff inadequate, and finances badly crunched, but the paper gave a voice to the people and made them aware of events that were shaping their lives.

A perusal of the files shows that it was on Wednesday, April 9, 1947, that The Tribune had a banner headline “Proposed Partition of Punjab and Bengal”; another one, “Maharaja of Patiala Urges the Princes to Join Constituent Assembly.” Even then, there was hope. On April 21, the banner headline read: “No Partition of Indian Now”.

However, reality soon sunk in, and on June 21 and 23, the headline declared: “Bengal votes for Partition”, and “Punjab to be Partitioned,” with another item highlighting the worsening situation in Amritsar where “100 bombs [were] exchanged by rival mobs.” Details about how various institutions and assets were to be divided are fascinating — instant records have a compelling intensity, even as the fluid situation makes for patchy, chaotic historical narrative.

The August 15 issue declared: “India Wakes to Life and Freedom.” It reported on the historic session of the Constituent Assembly for New Delhi. From Karachi came another report: “Birth of Pakistan an event in History” and another one titled “Goodwill and Friendship with Britain and Hindustan Qwaid-i-Azam Jinnah’s Aim.” Thereafter, the staff was forced to flee from Lahore.

By October, when The Tribune resumed publication in Simla, the horrific deaths and displacement of millions dominated the reporting. There is the story of how Hindus and Sikhs were wiped out in Miani, a village in Pakhtunkhwa. Another day, another story. This about the “Ill-fated train from Pindi to Dadan Khan; Witnesses’ Account of Loot, Murder and Abduction,” even as an adjoining item says “Retaliation Denounced: UP Communists Appeal for Peace”. On October 5, the banner headline is: “4 Columns of 1,15,000 Marching to India: 30,000 Hindu and Sikh Refugees Cross Border. Muslims attack Convoy Near Janarwala.”

A separate story on this page details the efforts of The Tribune’s Refugees Forum, wherein displaced people made efforts to contact their loved ones. By the end of the year, On December 5, 1947, The Tribune was able to announce: “Hindus and Sikhs Evacuated from W. Punjab. Colossal Task Completed Within Allotted Time. Small Pockets Yet to be Cleared. Over 8 Million people cross border.”

One aspect of the task may have been completed, but there was so much more. A new country was being run. This region and its people had borne the brunt of Partition. Millions of lives had been lost, many more millions displaced, rendered homeless, and many families torn apart in the days that led to the Independence of India. The Tribune was, once again, the chronicler of Punjab, serving the people of the state."
"Lakshya,16, wins Bulgaria Open","New Delhi, August 17

Young Indian shuttler Lakshya Sen clinched the Bulgaria Open International Series title after notching up a hard-fought win over Croatia’s Zvonimir Durkinjak in the men’s singles final in Sofia. The Uttarakhand shuttler, who celebrated his 16th birthday yesterday, defeated second seed Zvonimir 18-21 21-12 21-17 in a 57-minute match. He had beaten Sri Lanka’s Dinuka Karunaratna 21-19 21-14 in the semifinals yesterday. Junior world No. 1 was recently sent to train under former All England champion Peter Gade, who is currently the head coach of French national team. Lakshya had reached the finals of Senior National championship in February. “It is a creditable achievement for Lakshya. He is still a junior but he has been able to win tournaments and that is a good sign. We had sent five players on a 10-day training trip with the French national team. He trained under the great Peter Gade and it has benefitted him,” coach Vimal Kumar said. “He had a good tournament. He beat the top seed Sam Parsons in the first round. He won the junior Nationals and was also the finalist at the senior Nationals this year and it gave him a lot of confidence to beat top players like HS Prannoy. So I feel if groomed properly, he does have a great future,” Kumar said. Asked about Lakshya’s upcoming tourneys, Vimal said, “He is concentrating on his strength. We have former national champion Sayali Gokhale attached to him and she travels with him. In two months time, he will be playing Vietnam Grand Prix and then it would be junior World Championships,” he added. Last year, the Indian had won the India International Series and clinched the bronze at the CPB Badminton and Sports Science Training Centre in Thailand. — PTI"
"AIADMK merger: EPS, OPS factions fail to reach consensus","Chennai, August 18

Amid talk of an imminent merger, marathon deliberations that began on Friday in the two factions of the AIADMK seem to have made no headway with ticklish issues posing hurdles.

(Follow

While rebel leader O Panneerselvam held consultations with his loyalists, Chief Minister E Palaniswami held marathon talks with his Cabinet colleagues.

On expectation of a merger announcement at the Jayalalithaa mausoleum at Marina Beach late in the evening, security was beefed up there, with several MLAs converging.

However, it soon became apparent that there were hurdles to the merger talks, with leaders of both factions starting to leave the venue.

Party sources indicated that there were “some ticklish issues” that were to be addressed by both groups, but declined to elaborate further.

While the Pannerselvam camp held over four hours of consultations, Palaniswami was closeted with top office- bearers, besides his ministerial colleagues for a long period of time.

With the talks getting prolonged due to “issues”, the expectations for an announcement in this regard tonight faded.

Jayalalithaa’s burial complex had been decked up and the party office was brightly lit in the wake of expectations of the unification of the AIADMK factions.

Office bearers were seen holding garlands, apparently in anticipation of arrival of leaders of both camps.

The expected late night press meet by Panneerselvam was later deferred.

The merger talks came days after sidelined AIADMK (Amma) leader T T V Dhinakaran held a well-attended rally at Madurai in which about 20 legislators and six MPs participated.

This was apparently aimed at charting his own journey and conversely seeking to run rough shod over the Palaniswami and Panneerselvam camps.

Dhinakaran and his loyalists sought to showcase the meet as a show of strength and claimed that the party rank and file was largely with them.

The rebellion in the ruling AIADMK and factional feud began with a sudden late night meditation by Panneerselvam in February at the burial site of Jayalalithaa at the Marina Beach where he revolted against Sasikala.

The former chief minister had said that he was forced to resign from his post and asserted that only a person desired by people and cadres should succeed him in the government and party.

Panneerselvam was immediately sacked from his top party post of treasurer, marking the birth of a new rebel faction.

Subsequently, Sasikala named Palaniswami as Legislature Party Leader and she herself had to go to Bengaluru to serve a prison sentence following her conviction in the disproportionate assets case.

Soon, Palaniswami took over as chief minister and his government was ridiculed as a proxy of Sasikala by rebel Panneerselvam, and Opposition parties led by the DMK.

In April, in a political twist, Tamil Nadu Cabinet announced sidelining Sasikala and Dhinakaran and Palaniswami gradually emerged as leader of a faction of about 122 MLAs in the 234 member assembly.

Palaniswami and his Cabinet colleagues took a stand against Dhinakaran in April for the first time after the RK Nagar bypoll was cancelled.

They were also on the same page after Dhinarakan was named in a case of trying to bribe Election Commission officials.

Further hardening the stand against Dhinakaran, an August 10 meeting chaired by Palaniswami said his appointment went against party bye-laws, setting the stage for a formal merger.

Following it up, the government yesterday announced an inquiry into Jayalalithaa’s death and declared that Amma’s Poes Garden residence will be taken over and turned into a memorial.

By conceding these key demands of the Panneerselvam camp, the process of unification got a fresh impetus and after several rounds of deliberations the merger came through. PTI"

Ludhiana, August 17

The building branch of the Municipal Corporation has served a notice on the owners of Grand Walk (Gurdeep Jujhar, who is said to be close to the Badal family) regarding the “illegal” sixth floor of the mall. The notice was served on the owner by the ATP, Zone D, yesterday.

Three days’ time has been given to the owners to remove the illegally constructed floor on their own or else the MC will be forced to take action as per law, and during action, if there are any damages, the owners will be held responsible for the same. The notice says the floor construction was non-compoundable, for which no permission was sought by the owners. A leading pub is being run on the floor.

It was also learnt that the MC has filed a caveat in the case, so one-sided orders are not issued. It was filed with the Civil Judge, Senior Division.

Meanwhile, some tenants, including Brighteous Education Pvt Limited and Jasbir Singh, owner of R2P, who also have their establishments on the sixth floor of mall, have pleaded that they should not be made to suffer on account of a dispute between the owner of the mall and the MC. The case has been adjourned till August 22 for hearing arguments. Law Officer of MC Ashok Bajaj has filed a reply in the case.

After the removal of inter-locking tiles from a chunk of land (allegedly a green belt) by the MC, work to plant samplings on the land has been started by the civic body officials.

Earlier, the issue of alleged encroachment on MC-designated green belt measuring 3,000 square yard was highlighted by the Lok Insaf Party leader, Simarjit Singh Bains, around five days ago. Officials of the MC had gone to take “action” against the violation but they had to return without doing anything as SAD leaders objected to the move. The leaders had said action could not be taken without notice, and secondly, the MC staff had come to take action on a holiday, which was against law."

At all events such is the case with the United Province and even a lawyer shifting to the Punjab from there has to pass a special test in the special laws of this province. Such an appointment also implies in some sense that the Punjab is not in a position to supply the high and exacting standard of qualification which is demanded for service in the State. Even in the judicial department the Punjab has furnished to the Chief Court its own Judges and an officiating Chief Judge, and any number of District and Sessions Judges who can hold their own with their compeers of the other provinces."

Amritsar, August 17

In yet another robbery incident, three armed persons looted an employee of a finance firm when he was returning after collecting installments from clients late last evening.

Munish Kumar, the victim, works as a recovery or a collection agent with Janlakshmi Finance Company on Tarn Taran Road here. He was returning from Mullechak village after collecting money on his motorcycle.

He said when he reached near the Bhagtanwala chowk, three unknown motorcycle-borne youths came from behind and intercepted him. They took out a sharp-edged weapon and threatened him to hand over the bag. When he tried to resist, they snatched his bag containing cash to tune of Rs 1.40 lakh, a tablet, a finger- printing machine and a charger before fleeing. He told the police that the motorcycle had the registration number 4152 written with paint.

The police authorities said that a case under Section 379-B, IPC, against unknown persons had been registered.

Jagtar Singh, SHO, Gate Hakima police, stated that though the police had scrutinised several CCTV cameras but the images were not clear. The accused had covered their faces and therefore could not be recognised. Further investigations were under progress.

This is second such incident in the past one month in which an employee of the same finance firm was robbed by robbers. Earlier, Karan Mahajan, a collection agent of the company, was robbed of Rs 60,000 near Naushehra Kalan village on July 19. He works as a collection agent for the Majitha Road branch of Jan Lakshami Finance Service Company.

He said he was returning to the branch at around 12 noon after collecting Rs 60,000 from 20 clients when the incident took place.

Employees of finance firms have been easy targets of the miscreants. In May 25 last year, two motorcycle-borne youths snatched Rs 5.60 lakh from Sunil Kumar, an employee of a Delhi-based finance company, in the posh Green Avenue locality here. He was going to deposit the cash in the bank when the incident took place."

Telcos to be penalised up to Rs 10 lakh for call drop: TRAI,"New Delhi, August 18

Telecom operators may face a maximum penalty of Rs 10 lakh for call drops which will now be measured at the mobile tower level instead of telecom circle, as per the new quality of service rules issued by regulator TRAI on Friday.

(Follow

; and

)

“We have proposed financial disincentive in the range of Rs 1-5 lakh. It is a graded penalty system depending on the performance of a network,” TRAI Chairman R S Sharma told reporters here.

TRAI Secretary in-charge S K Gupta said if an operator fails to meet call drop benchmark in consecutive quarters, the penalty amount will be increased 1.5 times and in the third consecutive quarter, it will be doubled.

“However, there is cap of Rs 10 lakh on financial disincentive,” Gupta said.

Under the previous quality of service rules, penalty on call drop was Rs 1 lakh per violation and could go up to Rs 2 lakh in case of third subsequent violation.

The new rules will come in effect from October 1.

Sharma told reporters that the previous rules did not address temporary issues in telecom network like non-functioning of mobile towers or geographical issues like network quality in an under-served town.

“The average taken at circle level would hide many things. It did not take care of temporary or spatial problems.

Therefore, we have decided that 90 per cent BTSs (base transceiver station) should meet 2 per cent call drop benchmark (in a quarter),” Sharma said.

Similarly, he said, call drop during 97 per cent of time should not be more than 3 per cent on 90 per cent of mobile sites in a telecom circle during peak hours of the day.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) also fixed benchmark for radio-link time out technology (RLT), allegedly used by operators for masking call drops.

RLT is used for continuation of a call in case a subscriber is moving or is in base network area for short period. It is the time used for connecting call of a subscriber from one mobile tower to another.

RLT parameter can be in range of 4 to 64 but the regulator has said telecom operators increasing it beyond 48 will have to explain reason for increasing RLT level.

Telecom operators’ body COAI said that it is still studying the “voluminous amendment with multiple recommendations” in the new regulations, adding that consumer experience is key for the industry and new rules are in place to ensure that the operators remain fully compliant.

“However, it must be noted that the quality of service provided by a network is beyond the absolute control of a network service provider,” COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said.

He said that the quality of service available from a network is dependent on a number of extraneous factors which may not only be environmental such as the number of users accessing the network at that time, area covered by the base station, whether the customer is indoors or outdoors etc.

“Over and above this, issues like right of way and misinformation amongst citizens around EMF emission issues are still major problems, refusing to die down, preventing TSPs from accessing crucial sites for seamless connectivity. The courts have also recognised the challenges on this front faced by the operators,” Mathews said. PTI"
Furore erupts over killing of teenager as Philippines drugs war escalates,"Manila, August 18

The Philippines police came under pressure on Friday to explain the killing of a high-school student after the 17-year-old became one of at least 91 people shot dead this week in an escalation of President Rodrigo Duterte’s ruthless war on drugs.

Television channels aired CCTV footage that showed Kian Loyd Delos Santos being carried by two men to a place where his body was later found, raising doubt about an official report that said he was shot because he fired at police officers first.

Witnesses told the ABS-CBN channel that the teenager did not have a gun and police officers at the scene handed him one, asked him to fire it and run.

National police chief Ronald dela Rosa said that if the Grade 11 student did not pose a threat, the officers who shot him on Thursday night would be held accountable.

“Just think about it, he is just a kid. If that happened to your sibling?” he said on GMA TV. “We will investigate it, I assure you.”

Metro Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said the three policemen involved had been relieved of their duties and an investigation would be launched into the incident, which took place in the Caloocan district in the northwest of the capital.

Police killed at least 27 people in Manila on the third night of a new push in Duterte’s war on drugs and crime, taking the toll for one of the bloodiest weeks so far to 94, official police reports, Reuters witnesses and media reported.

Earlier in the week, 67 people were gunned down and nearly 250 arrested in Manila and provinces adjoining the Philippines capital, in what police described as a “One-Time, Big-Time” push to curb drugs and street crimes.

The spike in killings drew condemnation from Vice President Leni Robredo, who belongs to a party opposed to Duterte.

Branding it “something to be outraged about”, she has been a constant critic of the crackdown that has killed thousands of Filipinos and caused international alarm since Duterte took office over a year ago.

The term “one-Time, Big-Time” has been used by police to describe a coordinated drive in crime-prone districts, usually slums or low-income areas, often with additional officers.

Roberto Fajardo, police chief in Metro Manila’s northern district, said such operations have been underway since the war on drugs began but were stepped up after the president’s State of the Nation Address last month when he vowed that “the fight will not stop”.

‘NOT THE SOLUTION’

However, police say there has been no specific instruction from higher authorities to step up anti-drug operations and they are only doing their job.

Duterte indicated this week that the escalation had his blessing, saying it was good that 32 criminals had been killed in a province north of Manila, adding: “Let’s kill another 32 every day. Maybe we can reduce what ails this country.” On Thursday, he said he would not just pardon police officers who killed drug offenders during the anti-narcotics campaign, but also promote them.

“I don’t think they are simply acting based on the president’s endorsements,” Duterte’s spokesman, Ernesto Abella, told reporters. “It just so happens they are taking active steps in addressing the drug situation in Philippines.” Critics maintain that members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) are executing suspects and say it is likely they have a hand in thousands of unsolved murders of drug users by mysterious vigilantes. The PNP and government reject that.

Several senators, including known allies of Duterte, raised concern on Friday over the jump in the death toll, calling for an investigation.

“Killing the poor and powerless is not the solution to the drug problem when tons of methamphetamine are smuggled in,” Senator Francis Pangilinan said in a statement.

An ally of the president, Senator Jose Victor Ejercito, said he was “worried that these intensified killings are being used by some rogue police officers, knowing that the president will protect them”.

Although the violence has been criticised by much of the international community, Filipinos largely support the campaign and domestic opposition to it has been muted.

“Again and again we hear people say it is safer ... they appreciate the fact that the Philippines is being made safe again,” presidential spokesman Abella said. Reuters"

Japan backs India on Doklam issue,"New Delhi, August 18

Japan came out in full support for India in its protracted military stand-off with China at Doklam, near the Sikkim-Tibet-Bhutan tri-junction, saying no country should use unilateral forces to change the status quo on the ground.

Acknowledging the situation at the Doklam Plateau, Japanese Ambassador to India Kenji Hiramatsu said, ""We recognise Doklam is a disputed area between Bhutan and China and the two countries are engaged in border talks. We also understand that India has a treaty understanding with Bhutan, that's why Indian troops got involved in the area,"" according to the local media.

The endorsement of the Indian position by Japan is a significant development at a regional level as China has violated agreements with Japan as well and not with only India and Bhutan. It is pertinent to mention that Japan is also engaged with the sovereignty issue with China over East China sea.

Reacting to the developments in Doklam, the Bhutanese Government had on June 29 issued a press release in which it clearly stated that the construction of the road inside the Bhutanese territory is a direct violation of the agreements and affects the process of demarcating the boundary between the two countries.

China is attempting to build a road through Doklam plateau, which is part of Bhutan, a development that would be a serious disadvantage to India's military defences.

Meanwhile, as the Doklam stand-off is approaching its second month, China's Foreign Ministry has reiterated that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops would continue to defend Dong Lang, which is Chinese territory, and India should withdraw all its troops and equipment from there.

The stand-off began when China started constructing a road in the area. India objected to the road construction after the Chinese troops ignored Bhutanese protests, triggering the faceoff from June 16.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has reiterated that India's road map is peace and talks are going on to resolve the issue diplomatically.

India has made its stance clear that that it stands for peace the border question can be solved diplomatically, not by war. —ANI"

Jalandhar, August 17

Adopting zero tolerance towards the axing of trees in the state, the Forest Department has started lodging FIRs with the police against the people indulging in this activity to ensure stringent punishment to them.

Conservator of Forests Satnam Singh and Divisional Forest Officer Vikram Singh Kundra said on the directions of Forest Minister Sadhu Singh Dharmsot, the department had geared up to check the illegal felling of trees in the range.

They said on August 13, the department had busted a gang involved in the cutting of trees after they were caught felling a tree illegally. They said the gang had planned to axe 11 trees in the range, but due to the strict vigil of the department, they were caught cutting the first one only.

The officers further said that acting swiftly, the department had got an FIR registered with the police in the Bilga police station under Sections 379 and 511 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act 1927. The department had also seized the equipment used by the gang to fell trees. The officers said eight persons deployed by the gang to fell the trees had admitted that they were hired by a contractor to axe the trees.

Based on the statement of these eight persons, an FIR had been registered against the head of the gang Harbhans Singh of Boparai village. The police said that the kingpin had been arrested by the police. The officials said shunning the practice of compounding such erring persons, the department had now decided to initiate police action against the defaulters.

Forest Range Officer Davinder Pal Singh was also present on the occasion."
"Solution to Kashmir, terror will be found by 2022: Rajnath","Lucknow, August 18

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday asserted that by 2022, a solution would be found to the Kashmir problem as also other problems like terrorism, naxalism and North East insurgency.

“There are a lot of problems—terrorism, naxalism, Kashmir problem. Much is not needed to be said about these problems. But I can assure you this much that by 2022, we have pledged to create a ‘new India’...So a solution will be found to all these problems before 2022. We want to assure the countrymen on this,” he said.

Singh was addressing a programme here titled ‘Sankalp se Siddhi — New India Movement (2017-2022) Naye Bharat kaa nirmaan’.

On the occasion, he administered oath to the gathering for making India ‘Swachh’ (clean), poverty-free, corruption- free, terror-free, communalism-free and casteism-free.

“If people could take (Quit India) pledge in 1942 and get freedom in 1947, then why is it so that after 70 years of Independence, India is not that self-reliant which it should had been?

“I would congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking a pledge to create a ‘new India’ before the country celebrates its 75th year of freedom,” he said.

He said Mahatma Gandhi understood the importance of cleanliness and had made it a campaign but it is Modi who gave it the shape of a mass movement.

“For 85 long years after the first war of Independence in 1857, India understood the country’s power and kept on gathering it.

“In 1942, the entire nation stood united when Mahatma Gandhi said ‘British should Quit India’ and gave the clarion call of ‘do or die’. ... It was the result of this pledge which bore fruits five years later,” Singh said.

He said if in five years after launch of Quit India movement, India could achieve Independence, “then why can’t we make a ‘new India’ after taking pledge in 2017 and realising it in 2022?”

He said Pandavs also had achieved victory in Mahabharata because of their pledge and resoluteness.

“This (new India) will be an India where there will be no poverty or illiteracy, every person will have a house, no one will die of shortage of medicine. On the global stage, India will emerge as a powerful nation,” he said.

Talking about corruption, the home minister said, “In the first meeting of the Union Cabinet, we took a pledge to fight corruption. Our pledge was to change power and system.”

Referring to GST which was rolled out on July 1, he said, “Many of our friends are having problems but after a few months, all will praise GST. We passed GST with the pledge of ‘one-nation, one-tax.”

Singh said BJP does not indulge in politics of government formation “but for nation building and development.” — PTI"
Decrypting your home loan eligibility,"Harshil Mehta

Home is where the heart is. Though owning a home may mean different things to different individuals, one thing is common —we all want to own a home. Given the expense involved, most people prefer to avail a home loan to finance this dream, which is one of the most important decisions and undertakings in his life. Applying for a home loan can often seem like a complex process but one must be aware about some of its key aspects. Some important factors to be considered while applying for a home loan are as follows:

Income

This is the most important factor with a strong bearing on home loan eligibility. If the applicant is a salaried employee, then banks and financial institutions will consider his salary and age. This basically means that the loan eligibility will be evaluated on the basis of his income and the number of years the individual has worked. Lenders also reconfirm the individual’s repayment capability and the tenure of his job. One can also club his spouse’s income to enhance his home loan eligibility and can apply for a joint home loan.

Age factor

While applying for a home loan, banks and financial institution check the age of the borrower as this assesses the number of years the applicant would work. It is often believed that a joint home loan is easily available, but this is not the case always. Age of the co-applicant is also vital while applying for a home loan. For example, Brinda Roy, 29 years old takes a home loan with the co-applicant being her mother who is 60+, then the loan tenure will be calculated mainly on the basis of the age of the older person. The tenure of the loan will be restricted from 10-15 years depending on the bank or financial institution. If Brinda was individually applying for a home loan then her eligibility would depend more on her individual credit score than her age.

Debt

If an individual is applying for a home loan with other outstanding loans such as a car loan or personal loan it may affect his home loan eligibility. If one already has an existing home loan with over 12 unpaid instalments, banks and financial institutions generally take this into account while calculating the borrower’s eligibility. In such a situation, it is important to prepay full or half of their existing outstanding loans to improve their eligibility and ensure that their new application for the home loan remains unaffected.

Credit score

To qualify for a home loan, a good credit score is very important which usually ranges from 400 to 900. Banks and financial institutions prefer to lend to borrowers with credit score higher than 750 since it reflects stronger credit worthiness. This gives a clear picture about the applicant’s credit history, past payment behaviour and makes way for attractive interest rates for the borrower. Before applying for a home loan, it is most critical to check eligibility criterion. It is also very important for the applicant to know the amount they are eligible for and at what interest rate, which will help you to optimise chances of loan approval. Additionally, improving one’s loan eligibility will also have positive impacts on one’s personal financial planning and help move towards better financial security in life. The writer is CEO, DHFL.

Cyber mining virtual money,"A peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, bitcoin is said to be the future of money. Is it really or just a speculator’s dream?

Vaibhav Sharma

There is nothing wrong with online money transfers, and they are convenient for the most part. You can pay with your credit or debit cards, banks accounts and even digital wallets like PayTM that simply let you scan a barcode and transfer money. With things like Samsung and Apple Pay, it seems that the world is headed towards an even more seamless future where all you will ever have to do is wave your phone. But apart from cash transactions, in all these modes of payment there is a middleman who is taking a part of the spend as fee for his efforts in delivering the money, ensuring there is no misuse, and for bookkeeping. With credit cards, you have companies like Visa and MasterCard taking up to almost 3 per cent of the transaction value as fee, and the situation is similar with players like PayTM and Mobikwik. More often than not, this cost has to be borne by the seller. So, is there something that could remove the middleman altogether, but at the same time ensure security and accuracy?

What is it?

It is described as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that is completely decentralised and operates without an intermediary. But what does that really mean? Let’s look at it this way. If you give someone cash, you cease to have that banknote in your possession any more. But that isn’t the case with digital currency. What if you made two copies of the same and sent it to different people. What if you made 100? That would make any digital currency a non-starter. So perhaps there could be a ledger maintained that would keep a track of what you had, and what was sent. The question would then be twofold: Who would maintain such as a ledger, and could that person be trusted? Bitcoin answers all these questions with a remarkably simple, yet secure setup. There is such a ledger, but instead of trusting one person with the bookkeeping, a copy of this ledger is shared with everyone. Whenever bitcoin is spent, a corresponding entry is made in everyone’s ledger and this ensures that no one can cheat the system. The code on which this ledger runs is open source — which means that it is maintained, secured, improved and checked in the public domain under everyone’s watchful eyes.There are a number of ways you can come into possession of bitcoin; the first method is to devote a considerable amount of your computer’s resources to keeping a copy of the ledger described above, and as reward for the same you would be awarded bitcoin. In fact, this is the only way bitcoins can be created. The second and easiest method is to simply buy it from an online bitcoin exchange. If you wish you can also sell something and accept bitcoins as payment, or simply trade your local currency with someone offering bitcoins as barter. To store them, you’ll need something known as a bitcoin wallet.

The risks

The manner in which its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned bitcoin puts a cap on their total number at 21 million. The greater the number of bitcoins in circulation, the lesser will be the speed at which they can be mined/created. While this means inflation will not be an issue with Bitcoin, it does have its own set of challenges. Since it is divorced from the governments or central banks, it is not backed by anything. If you lose a bitcoin because of a hack or for other reasons, there is no getting them back. Further, as they have no inherent value of their own, their worth exists only because there are people willing to accept them. In April 2013, bitcoin went from trading at $266 to about $50, and then rose to $100. In October of the same year, when the dark web portal The Silk Road was seized by the FBI, the price crashed from the $140 region to about $110. When people attempted to capitalise on the fall, the price rose to about $200 in a few weeks. By November 2013, it was trading at over US$1000 at a famous bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox. By April 2014 the prices fell again to about $400, and even fell as low as $200 in early 2015. However, in the last few months, bitcoin has really rallied to climb to over $3000 in August 2017.

The reward

In addition to being quicker, cheaper and more reliable, bitcoin also eliminates the middleman and thus provides a layer of secrecy to the transaction. In fact, it lets you remain largely anonymous, and this is one of the reasons why it was so popular on the dark web. People used it to buy drugs, arms and even services of hitmen on The Silk Route before it was shut down. Even when demonitisation hit the country, a number of people turned to bitcoin in hopes of staying outside the tax net. Things like these make it clear that bitcoins will never been favoured by the government, but if you have the appetite for risk, bitcoins are something that may grow in value even more, after all, there can only be 21 million of them in total, ever. From $50 in 2013 to over $3000 currently is an exponential rise that has made many millionaires. Bitcoin’s acceptability is also growing rapidly with mainstream companies like Expedia getting onboard. Digital currencies are so hot right now, that an offshoot of bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash that was only created on the 1st of August 2017 crossed a valuation of $7 Billion in a day."
The Tribune: Himachal Pradesh and Shimla news,"NEW DELHI: The CBI has moved an application for conducting lie detector tests on those arrested in connection with the sensational rape and killing of a minor girl in Kotkhai area of Shimla in Himachal Pradesh.

New Delhi, August 18

The CBI has moved an application for conducting lie detector tests on those arrested in connection with the sensational rape and killing of a minor girl in Kotkhai area of Shimla in Himachal Pradesh.

The CBI sources said here the agency wanted to conduct polygraph tests on the accused as their statements were inconsistent.

The accused, including Ashish Chauhan, the first one to be arrested in the case, would be subjected to the test after attaining their consent, they said.

Read: Himachal govt orders CBI probe into Kotkhai rape, murder case 6 arrested in gang-rape, murder of Kotkhai schoolgirl Clamour for justice to rape victim gets louder Kotkhai rape: Suspect murdered in jail; mob sets police station, vehicles on fire According to the law, the test is conducted only after getting an approval from an individual. In case an accused declines to give permission, it goes against him or her in the court of law.

Meanwhile, the agency has examined over 100 people in connection with the rape and killing that triggered massive public outrage against the state government, the sources said.

Among those quizzed by the Central probe agency were kin of some influential officials of the state government, they said.

The case was handed over to the CBI by the Himachal Pradesh High Court on July 19 on the state government’s plea amid public outburst against the state police. The CBI filed two FIRs on July 22.

The 16-year-old girl had gone missing after school hours on July 4 from Haliala forest in Kotkhai area of Shimla district.

Her naked body was found in the forest on July 6 and the post-mortem report confirmed rape.

The DGP constituted the SIT headed by an officer of IG rank, which arrested six persons. One of the accused was killed in police custody in Kotkhai Police Station.

The CBI had also registered the case of custodial death of one of the suspects who was a Nepalese citizen, it said. PTI"
"Wounds remain unhealed, lessons unlearnt","70 YEARS LATER…

Harish Khare

As the memory of those horrible days and years fades away, we are itching to reopen some of the settled questions about our collective existence. Perhaps after seventy years it is time, once again, to revisit those blood-stained days and recall Partition’s sobering lessons…

Harish Khare

With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

Admittedly, the British decision to grant India independence was principally driven by the simple fact that the four-year-long World War II had totally exhausted the imperial will to rule; in fact, the British desire to hold on to India had already been tested morally and ethically by the Indian National Congress, which under the Mahatma’s leadership had waged a unique peaceful freedom struggle. The British middle classes, with their pretensions to liberal values, had no answer to the Mahatma’s saintly leadership. The Union Jack had to be lowered from Red Fort, sooner than later.

But by the time the British came to the conclusion that they could no longer stay in India, they had already instigated mischief among the Indian leadership. The colonial rulers had cynically worked on the Indian society’s religious fault lines, encouraged and cultivated sectarian agendas which ultimately coalesced into the demand for a separate nation.

The Muslim League, under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had already legitimised use of violence in pursuit of its demands. The League’s call for ‘Direct Action’ was an invitation to chaos and the mobs. Once a society develops a taste for violence, its leaders are rarely able to calibrate and control the streets. By the time August 15, 1947, came the Muslim League’s leadership skills were already over-extended even in what came to be known as East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In India, the Congress leadership was barely able to push the mobs back.

Still, a monumental tragedy was destined to take place. The sheer scale of the number of Hindus and Sikhs, who found themselves forced to migrate out to India and of the Muslims in India who had to leave for Pakistan, was maddeningly benumbing. Grand statistics simply cannot convey the trauma and the tragedy that engulfed this part of the world soon after August 1947.

A sympathetic American reporter and an eye-witness described the post-Partition days as “one of the great convulsions of modern history.” On December 12, 1947, he tried to convey the nature of disaster that overtook the two nascent nations: “Consider what has happened. In an orgy of religious-communal madness, some 10 million citizens of the north-western provinces had been routed from their homes. An unknown total, probably between 2,00,000 and 5,00,000 (compared to 2,95,000 American war-dead in World War II), had been put to sword, machine-gunned, or roasted alive. The splintered Punjab administrations were quickly swamped and there even appeared danger that the infant central governments of India and Pakistan Dominions might succumb.” Phillips Talbot (An American Witness to India’s Partition).

The frenzy in the East was no less violent, no less gory, no less bloody than it was in the West. The Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs joyfully discovered their capacity for inflicting violence and death on their erstwhile neighbours as well as total strangers. The massacres, the mayhem and the madness outpaced humanity and all known civic-minded virtues; the trauma and tragedy touched nearly every home, every life. No one was unaffected; no one could remain emotionally unmolested by this continental turbulence.

After a few months the mobs could be rolled back and blood could be washed off the streets, but the memory of Partition-centric violence was now etched on the soul of an entire generation on both sides. The two successive states had entrenched habits and protocols of acrimony and suspicion and political leaders and sectarian interests saw to it that India and Pakistan would not settle down to a peaceful co-existence.

The raw memories of Partition also impacted on how the two states went about the business of creating an internal political order. Once Jinnah was gone, Pakistan hastily abandoned his ideas of an inclusive society and nation. In India, the Mahatma was assassinated. The murder was planned by those who wanted to make India a Hindu State and they thought the Old Man was an obstacle. Ironically, the assassination settled, once for all, how India would grant equal protection and equal citizenship to all its minorities.

Perhaps some in India would argue that Partition’s unfinished agenda still remains unattended. May be, after 70 years, we should simply revisit those horrible, horrible days of chaos and disorder before we embark on another self-defeating journey…"
"Dengue, chikungunya threat set to bite again","Punjab was among worst-hit states in last 2 years

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 17

The state is facing a threat of outbreak of vector-borne diseases — dengue and chikungunya. Around 2,000 suspected and 127 confirmed cases of dengue have so far been reported in the state. Besides, 750 clinically suspected and 17 confirmed cases of chikungunya have also been reported. A look at the data of previous years reveal that this year the situation is not much better than the previous year when more than 10,000 dengue cases were reported. Last year, by mid-August around 170 cases of dengue were reported. “Though the number this year is a little less, the real challenge is the next three months,” said Dr Gagandeep Singh, nodal officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme. He said though the Health Department was issuing almost 10 times more challans to defaulters providing a conducive atmosphere for vector breeding, dengue prevention needed strong participation of public, which unfortunately was not happening. Last year, Mohali was the worst affected district in the state with more than 2,000 cases. According to the Health Department, this year too Mohali has been badly hit by dengue. Chikungunya threat is too looming large over the state. It was last year that the first indigenous case of the disease was reported in Punjab and the number later crossed 2,000. The biggest worry for health officials is that over the last three years, despite having small population share, Punjab figured among the worst affected states. Last year with over 10,000 cases of vector-borne diseases, Punjab was the worst-affected state after West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. In 2015, with more than 14,000 cases, Punjab was second after Delhi."

The arrest of separatists and the charges against them go far beyond managing security. The hints are clear: the Centre won't concede any political ground to hardliners, and, any talk of talks would come later

[ + read story ]

ON July 24, seven Kashmiri separatist leaders were arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for allegedly funding militancy and unrest in Kashmir. It marked a shift in government’s policy to deal with secessionism in Kashmir. It is defined by iron fist with no valet glove.

The arrests followed a series of raids by the NIA that continued for over a month. Apart from active separatist workers, a battery of businessmen is also under scanner within and outside Kashmir, making the crackdown more target-oriented. Only this week the Enforcement Directorate raided a prominent business man of Kashmir.

Such crackdowns — conducted in the past too — related to alleged unlawful activities, in which cases were formally registered for follow-up investigations. But these yielded no results. The general belief among security agencies is that the hawala money has been pumped through cash, trade and funding through Middle East, but nothing has been established conclusively. The NIA probe, however, appears aimed at fixing the separatists and their alleged links to hawala channels.

The police, state intelligence and Central agencies maintain that hawala money has been used to fund street protests, subversive activities, violence and militancy in the state. According to the J&K government, 173 cases of funding have been registered in the state since 2001 till last year.

“Charge-sheets were issued in 90 cases, 45 were under investigation and 23 are awaiting sanction. Nine cases were untraced and six not admitted,” says a senior official. The police require the state home department’s sanction to proceed in the cases under various laws. Some of the cases were:

2011: Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, a key aide of hardline Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani was arrested along with three others with alleged hawala money of Rs 21 lakh. The case was later handed to the NIA.

2002: J&K Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik was arrested after his aide was held on way to Srinagar from Nepal along with $100,000. A charge-sheet followed.

2006: Delhi Police slapped charges of funding separatist organizations on a Dubai-based Kashmiri businessman close to Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.

These cases have only dragged on. The separatists have called the seizures and arrests as “a campaign of vilification”. Their denial lent some weight when last year Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, in a written response to a question in the state Assembly, denied having received any report about separatist leaders receiving hawala money.

What’s different now?

While the security situation on the ground remains fluid, the NIA has extended its role in targeting the entire separatist spectrum. “The operation is to basically explore a co-relation between funding from Pakistan and Hurriyat as well as militants,” an official privy to NIA investigations said. “The state police have been treating individuals of terrorist organizations invoking section 18 & 20 of UA(P) (Unlawful Activities Prevention) Act and the NIA is targeting organizations as a whole, including their hierarchy (section 38 UA(P) Act,” the officer said.

This is perhaps the first time section 38 UA(P) has been invoked in the state.

Hot on the money trail in Srinagar, Jammu, Haryana and Delhi, the NIA has tightened its noose and arrested seven Kashmiri separatist leaders for allegedly funding militancy.

The arrested separatists included Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Altaf Funtoosh (Geelani’s son-in-law and in-charge of legal cell in Hurriyat), Ayaz Akbar (Hurriyat spokesman), Raja Mehrajuddin Kalwal (district president of Srinagar for Geelani-led Tehreek-e-Hurriyat), Peer Saifullah (Geelani’s aide), Aftab Hilali Shah alias Shahid-ul-Islam (spokesman for Mirwaiz-led Hurriyat), Nayeem Khan (National Front chairman) and Farooq Ahmad Dar alias Bitta Karate (head of a JKLF faction). The sleuths have summoned at least over two dozen people for questioning, including Geelani’s sons.

The separatists were arrested in connection with the terror funding case under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war against Republic of India), 121A (conspiring to commit certain offences against the state) of IPC and sections 13 ( punishment for unlawful activities), 16 (punishment for terrorist act), 17 (punishment for raising funds for terrorist act), 18 (punishment for conspirac), 20 (punishment for being a member of terrorist gang or organization), 38 (offence relating to membership of terrorist organization), 39 (offence relating to support given to terrorist organization), 40 (offence of raising funds of Unlawful for a terrorist organization) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

‘War against India’

The investigations began in the follow-up of a television expose that found Nayeem Khan, Karate and Javed Baba conceding that they received funding from Pakistan to perpetuate secessionist activities in Kashmir. The NIA later registered a case on May 30, against the separatist and secessionist leaders, including the members and cadres of the Hurriyat Conference, who have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed organizations Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Dukhtarane Millat, Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and other militant organizations. These outfits allegedly raised, received and collected funds through various illegal means, including hawala. Some of the charges relate to funding separatist and terrorist activities, including throwing stones on security forces, burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India.

J&K former Director General of Police K Rajendra Kumar says NIA is a professional organization and the investigation will definitely have impact on the ground. “They (NIA officials) have all the data and are immune to interference from any quarter. You need to cut the oxygen of funding. Once that is done, you will see an impact on the situation,” he says. “The investigation of funding is a specialist job. The NIA has the logistics to investigate such cases.”

Separatists, who have termed the crackdown aimed at “defaming them and their movement”, have roped in Kashmiri lawyers to defend their case. While the lawyers may question the jurisdiction of NIA in J&K, the separatist have a tough road ahead. Their shutdown call against the NIA crackdown did not evoke an effective response from the people.

“The NIA crackdown may trouble us, but in the end New Delhi will be a loser. Any further delay in resolving the Kashmir issue will only harm the government,” says a separatist leader.

The crackdown: No one spared, hardliners or moderates"
DISABLED,"As Devendra Jhajharia gets set to be the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award, he becomes a ray of hope for many

Sabi Hussain

Devendra Jhajharia’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing ever since his name was recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. While there is a deluge of congratulatory messages on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, his native home in Rajasthan is being frequented by politicians and bureaucrats. The award has suddenly brought the focus on this two-time Paralympics gold medalist. “It’s been a surreal few days,” said an elated Jhajharia over the phone from his village Jhajharian ki Dhani in Churu district. “It’s like a dream come true. I waited 12 years for this honour, since winning the gold at 2004 Athens Paralympics. The award has given a ray of hope to other para athletes in the country,” said the javelin thrower and Rio Paralympics gold medalist. August 29 would, indeed be, a watershed moment in para-athletics, as Jhajharia will become the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Each day a new fight For para-athletes, such moments of joy during their professional career are far and few between. Instead, they have an everyday fight on their hand for recognition, equality and, more importantly, against bureaucratic red-tapism. Last month, para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande was forced to beg in Berlin, Germany, after she apparently ran out of money to meet her expenses while competing in a week-long tournament. Recently, a 62-member Indian contingent of hearing-impaired athletes, returning after its best-ever performance at the Deaf Olympic Games in Turkey, protested when no official from the Sports Ministry or the Sports Authority of India came to receive them at the Delhi International Airport. “Time and again, we have been failed by the system,” said Haryana’s Paralympian and Arjuna awardee discus thrower Amit Saroha.

Spurred by taunts

Recalling his struggle, Saroha said the fight was not about coming out of the hospital following a horrific car accident in 2007 but being able to find acceptance in the society. “I wanted encouragement, not sympathy. I wanted the Tri-colour wrapped around my body, not a consoling hand on my shoulder,” said Saroha, a gold medallist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Para Games and a silver medalist at 2015 and 2017 editions of the World Championships. “My lower body had become paralysed after the accident. I didn’t want to sit idle at home. Since I had been a National-level hockey player until 2003, I decided to participate in throw ball and discus throw events. But, the Paralympic Committee of Haryana (PCH) refused to accept my candidature,” said Saroha. “The accident had left me quadriplegic (with paralysis of all four limbs). The PCH officials were convinced that my upper body wouldn’t be able to generate the strength required to throw the discus. I had to run from pillar-to-post for my selection in the Indian team. It was only when I won my first international medal (a silver in discus throw) at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Para Games that the attitude of people changed,” added the 32-year-old from Sonepat. Jhajharia had his own poignant tale to share. “Since childhood, I was considered physically weak. My classmates would make fun of my thin frame. To become physically stronger, I started participating in sports. But things took a turn for the worse. At eight, while climbing a tree, I was electrocuted after accidently touching a live wire. This led to the amputation of my left arm. I would be taunted with comments like “tundla ho gaya hai” (his hand has become disabled). It was a nightmare.” “In 1995, I participated in a district-level championship for students. All other participants were able-bodied. I became district champion after winning the tournament. That was the turning point of my life. Later, when I won gold medal at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2002 and at the Athens Paralympic Games in 2004, I shut the mouth of all those who had told my parents that I wouldn’t be able to do anything in my life,” added the 36-year-old.

What keeps them going

“Simple, to see the Tricolour rise and hear the National Anthem during the medal ceremony. People who have never experienced it won’t understand. You can’t describe the feeling of pride in words,” said high-jumper Sharad Kumar, who won a silver medal at the recent World Para-athletics in London. “It’s also our way of living with dignity. We para-athletes feel ignored and discriminated. But, we have found solace in sports. I only have problem with my leg but the able-bodied have problem with their mind and heart. They are more disabled than us,” added the 2014 Incheon Para Asian Games gold medalist, who suffered paralysis of his left leg after being administered wrong medicine for polio at the age of two. Tragedy struck Sundar Singh Gurjar when he lost his left hand in a car accident in 2015. He created history by becoming the first Indian to win gold in men’s javelin throw event at the Worlds recently. “I had been competing as a javelin thrower till that fateful evening. But, before anybody could point a finger at me, I made sure to continue pursuing my sports career. I didn’t want people to make fun of my disability.” The gold at the Worlds was a redemption for Gurjar, who missed an announcement call for his name at the Rio Paralympics as he failed to understand the accent of the announcer. He reached the arena a minute late to find that he’d been disqualified. “This shows the indifferent attitude of the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI). What exactly was the official attached to our contingent doing when my name was called? The PCI official should have ensured my participation. I was left to fend for myself,” Gurjar said. Giving back to the game In spite of the hardships faced by them, these shining lights of para-athletics are a role model for other differently abled athletes. Saroha spends his entire salary of Rs 40,000 per month — which he earns as a coach at the SAI’s Sonepat centre — on providing training and arranging for exposure trips abroad of some of his protégés like Dharambir Nain, Amit Balwan, Sunil, Rampal Chahar, Rinku Hooda and Ekta, among others. At present, Saroha is funding 17 para-athletes. “If I’ll help others, only then God will help me,” said Saroha. “Whatever cash award I receive from the Haryana government, I spend the amount on funding my trainees. I don’t want other para-athletes to go through the same struggle I was subjected to.” Both Jhajharia and Deepa Malik, Rio Paralympics silver medallists from Haryana, have written to their respective state governments to provide them land to open a sports academy for para-athletes in Jaipur and Gurugram, respectively."
Martyr cremated with military honours,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 17

The mortal remains of martyr Hawaldar Narendra Singh Bisht, who attained martyrdom in a Pakistani ceasefire violation in the Uri Sector of Jammu and Kashmir, were consigned to flames in Haridwar today. The last rites were conducted with full military honours and in presence of a large gathering. Earlier, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat himself visited Selaqui residence of the martyr in Dehradun and laid a floral wreath on his body. The Chief Minister was accompanied by Vikasnagar MLA Munna Singh Chauhan, Sahaspur MLA Sahdev Singh Pundir and other BJP leaders. Uttarakhand Congress president Pritam Singh too reached the martyr’s residence and offered his tributes. Bisht, who sustained bullet injuries in the ceasefire violation in the Uri Sector on August 7, was undergoing treatment at the Jammu Military Hospital, where he succumbed to injuries yesterday. Martyr Narendra Singh Bisht was to retire next year and had only come to his house on a 10 day leave in July. Bisht leaves behind his wife Asha and two daughters Neha and Nikita, who were in a state of shock. Bisht belongs to Chamoli Garhwal."
First US crude oil shipment to reach India next month,"Washington, August 17

The first shipment of American crude oil worth $100 million will reach India next month, with US President Donald Trump promising to be a “reliable, long-term supplier” of energy to India’s development needs. The shipment of crude oil to India comes nearly two years after the then US president Barack Obama lifted the 40-year-old ban on its exports. During their maiden meeting on June 26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump agreed to deepen the engagement in the energy sector. Soon, Indian companies started purchasing crude from the US. Two Indian oil giants, Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, placed orders for over four million barrels. With this India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, joins Asian countries like South Korea, Japan and China to buy American crude after production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries drove up prices of Middle-East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulphur content. “New breakthroughs! oil shipments from US to India has started,” the Indian Embassy in Washington tweeted yesterday after Indian Ambassador to the US Navtej Sarna handed over papers for the shipment to Texas Governor Greg Abbott. The first lot of two million barrels costs $100 million, but given the volume being contemplated by Indian companies, this new development is expected to boost the bilateral oil trade to $2 billion. “Opening New Vistas in India US cooperation,” tweeted the Indian Embassy which also posted several pictures and a video of the event. Consignments of American crude oil left the US shores between August 6 and August 14 and are likely to reach Paradip (Odisha) in the last week of September. — PTI"
"'Incident' took place between Indian, Chinese troops in Ladakh: Govt","Says will continue to engage with China for Doklam solution

India on Friday said it will continue to engage with China to find a mutually acceptable solution to the Dokalam standoff, while confirming that “an incident” did take place between Chinese troops and Indian border guards in Ladakh on August 15.

“We will continue to engage with China to find a mutually acceptable solution,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said replying to a volley of questions on the issue.

He said peace and tranquility in the border areas is an important pre-requisite for smooth development of bilateral relationship.

Asked about the incident between Chinese troops and Indian border guards in Ladakh on August 15, the MEA spokesperson said, “Such incidents are not in the interest of either side.”

The incident occurred when land-based patrols of both sides came face to face north of the Pangong Tso (lake) in eastern Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir.

The MEA spokesperson said two border personnel meetings (BPMs) had taken place between Indian border guards and Chinese troops recently.

He said one BPM had taken place at Chushul on August 16 and another one at Nathu La a week before.

Asked if China has shared hydrological data with India in the backdrop of floods in Assam, Kumar said there is an existing expert-level mechanism, established in 2006, and there are two MoUs under which China is expected to share hydrological data on the rivers Satluj and Brahmaputra with India during the flood season of May 15 to June 15.

“For this year, we have not received hydrological data from the Chinese side,” the spokesperson said.

However, he added that it was “premature” to link it with the floods in Assam.

He also noted that in view of floods in Bihar, India was closely coordinating with Nepal, both at the Centre and state levels.

Asked about the reported comments of the Japanese Ambassador on Dokalam faceoff and if India welcomes it, Kumar gave a very guarded reaction, saying the remarks speak for themselves.

The Japanese ambassador was quoted in media as saying that no country should use unilateral forces to alter the status of Dokalam.

“We recognise Dokalam is a disputed area between Bhutan and China and two countries are engaged in border talks... We also understand that the India has a treaty understanding with Bhutan that’s why Indian troops got involved in the area,” the ambassador had reportedly said.

Kumar also refused to divulge details of communication by other countries to India on the Dokalam issue. PTI"

New Delhi, August 18

In a clear message to errant unaided private schools, the government has served fresh show-cause notices to around 449 private schools over their failure to implement the Justice Anil Dev Singh panel recommendations over refunding excess fee, warning them to comply with the Delhi High Court orders or face action.

Addressing reporters on the issue, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said around 449 schools have been asked to implement the Justice Anil Dev Singh Committee recommendations failing which the government as a “last resort” will be forced to take them over.

The committee had scrutinised a total of 1,108 private unaided schools and of them it was found that around 544 schools were found to have changed excess fees on the pretext of Sixth Pay Commission.

“Of them 44 schools fall under minority, 15 schools have refunded as told to the High Court while around five have already deposited excess fess as specified by the Anil Dev committee.

Further, 17 schools have already been served notices by the government, 13 have been closed and one already taken over by the government. The government has served notices to 449 schools on the issue four days ago with a deadline to respond within two weeks, said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

“The Delhi Government does not intend to “interfere"" into their functioning, but will surely will “discipline” such schools, if needed, said Kejriwal.

The schools are among over 500 schools under scanner for overcharging parents on the pretext of implementing recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission as per the report by the committee headed by Justice Anil Dev Singh.

“Some of them are doing good work. But if they don't implement the recommendations of the panel's report then we will take them over as a last resort,"" Kejriwal said."

Sreesanth moves HC for direction to BCCI for NOC to play in Scotland,"Kochi, August 18

Cricketer S Sreesanth on Friday moved the Kerala High Court seeking its direction to the BCCI to grant a no objection certificate (NOC) to participate in Premier league matches of Glenrothes Cricket Club at Scotland.

In a letter sent to the club on August 10, he said that he had sent a communication to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to issue NOC with immediate effect to enable him play for the club.

Sreesanth has also shared his apprehension that he doesn’t think the BCCI will take a timely decision to grant him the NOC.

In his petition to the HC, the cricketer said, “Without intervention of this court by issuing necessary clarification this petitioner reasonably apprehends that the BCCI may not issue such NOC.”

The premier league will conclude on or before September 9, the petition states.

In a relief to Sreesanth, the Kerala High Court had on August 7 lifted the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI in the wake of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal.

In his order, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque had also set aside all proceedings against Sreesanth initiated by the BCCI. — PTI"
HC refuses to shut eyes to Murthal ‘rape’,"JAT STIR

Bench may consider CBI probe if SIT fails to yield any results

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 17

The High Court Bench approved 1997-batch IPS officer Amitabh Dhillon’s name for heading another SIT

The second SIT would look into all cases, except five under the CBI and the Murthal case

The Bench said Dhillon's team “shall act independently and submit a report by the adjourned date”

It observed 173 persons were arrested and reports filed in 81 cases, but 1,105 cases remained unattended

Refusing to shut its eyes to the “rape” in Murthal during the Jat reservation agitation in February last year, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today made it clear that the Bench may consider handing over the probe to the CBI if the special investigating team (SIT) fails to come out with anything substantive within a month. At the outset, Justices SS Saron and Avneesh Jhingan asserted: “The court cannot shut its eyes to the occurrence of rape. There were undergarments with semen on it and statement of witness Bobby Joshi… How can everyone just keep quiet about it?”Granting time to enable the SIT to complete the probe, the Bench said: “In case nothing substantive is made out, the case may require consideration for transfer to the CBI.” It asserted that investigations by the SIT headed by Mamta Singh were at “some relevant stage”. It would, as such, be inappropriate to transfer the matter to the CBI at this juncture. At the same time, the Bench observed that given sufficient time to probe the matter, the SIT must come out with a specific time-frame as the court could not keep adjourning the matter time and again. Haryana Additional Advocate General Pawan Girdhar, as instructed by Mamta Singh, said the probe would be concluded in a month and that the state had never said rape had never taken place. Earlier, during the course of hearing, Mamta Singh referred to last year’s news reports on the burning down of a BMW car and women being dragged out. The SIT incharge said she was in touch with insurance companies to find out whether any claims were made. She said so far she had neither been able to trace any victim nor any accused, nor lay her hands on any lead. Amicus curiae (friend of the court) Anupam Gupta retorted that he lacked confidence in the SIT. He said Haryana Additional Chief Secretary Vijay Vardhan had approached him through officer Ashok Khemka for information on “witness” Amrik Singh deposing before the Parkash Singh committee. He said Amrik Singh may have been in a denial mode, but would speak up before the CBI, if the case was handed over to it."

The Tribune: World news,"WASHINGTON/HAGERSTOWN:President Donald Trump on Friday fired Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the latest high-level White House shake-up, removing a powerful and controversial figure known for far-right political views.

Washington/Hagerstown, August 18

President Donald Trump on Friday fired Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the latest high-level White House shake-up, removing a powerful and controversial figure known for far-right political views.

Bannon was a force behind some of Trump's most contentious policies, including a travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, and has fought with more moderate factions inside a White House riven with rivalries and back-stabbing. Bannon's ouster comes with the President, seven months into his term in office, increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville last Saturday.

As Trump came under fire from prominent fellow Republicans, business leaders and US allies abroad, he faced mounting calls for Bannon's ouster. “White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Friday. “We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.”

A champion of economic nationalism and a political provocateur, Bannon, 63, is a former US Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood movie producer. Bannon had been in a precarious position before but Trump opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his 2016 victory and is backed by many of the President's most loyal rank-and-file supporters.

The decision to fire Bannon could undermine Trump's support among far-right voters but might ease tensions within the White House and with party leaders. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals, including a healthcare legislation overhaul, because of fierce intra-party divisions.

Trump ran into trouble in recent days after saying anti-racist demonstrators in Charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests. Those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow Republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies even as some supporters, including Vice-President Mike Pence, stood by Trump.

A source said Bannon had been given an opportunity to depart on his own terms. ""The President made up his mind on it over the past couple of weeks,"" the source said. Kelly had been evaluating Bannon's role within the White House. ""They gave him an opportunity to step down knowing that he was going to be forced to,"" the source said. Bannon has told friends he could go back to Breitbart News if he were to leave the White House.

Sperm cells created from ear tissue may treat male infertility,"London

Scientists have created sperm cells from small pieces of ear tissue to help genetically infertile male mice produce healthy offspring, an advance that may pave the way for novel therapies to treat human infertility.

Our sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes, researchers said. Usually, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y (XY), but about one in 500 men are born with an extra X or Y.

Having three rather than two sex chromosomes can disrupt formation of mature sperm and cause infertility.

In a study published in the journal Science, researchers at the Francis Crick Institute in the UK have found a way to remove the extra sex chromosome to produce fertile offspring.

If the findings can be safely transferred into humans, it might eventually be possible for men with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Double Y syndrome (XYY) that are infertile to have children through assisted reproduction using this technique.

The team took small pieces of ear tissue from XXY and XYY mice, cultured them and collected connective tissue cells known as fibroblasts.

They turned the fibroblasts into stem cells and noticed that in the process, some of the cells lost the extra sex chromosome.

With an existing method, they used specific chemical signals to 'guide' the stem cells into becoming cells that have the potential to become sperm. These cells developed into mature sperm when injected into the testes of a host mouse.

The researchers then harvested these mature sperm and used them through assisted reproduction to create healthy, fertile offspring.

""Our approach allowed us to create offspring from sterile XXY and XYY mice,"" said Takayuki Hirota from the Francis Crick Institute.

""It would be interesting to see whether the same approach could one day be used as a fertility treatment for men with three sex chromosomes,"" said Hirota.

In a preliminary experiment, the team found that stem cells produced from fibroblasts of men with Klinefelter syndrome also lost the extra sex chromosome.

""There is currently no way to make mature sperm outside of the body. In our mouse experiments we have to inject cells that have the potential to become sperm back into the testes to help them finish developing,"" said James Turner, Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute.

""But we found that this caused tumours in some of the mouse recipients. So reducing the risk of tumour formation or discovering a way to produce mature sperm in a test tube will have to be developed before we can even consider this in humans,"" said Turner. —PTI"
"Kasauli getting finished due to illegal construction, SC told","The desperate bid of a Kasauli-based hotel to stay out of an NGT order directing its closure, was on Friday opposed in the Supreme Court by an NGO which claimed that the picturesque Himachal Pradesh town was “getting finished” due to unauthorised construction.

A Bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta was told by the NGO that if the court would allow the hotel—Kasauli Inn and Kasauli Regency—to operate, it would have “spill effect” as several such people would move the court seeking the relief.

“The NGT has said in its judgment about the alarming state of affairs in Kasauli. Kasauli town is getting finished due to this. They cannot be allowed to operate,” the counsel appearing for SPOKE told the Bench.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing the hotel, said they were seeking a stay on the NGT order directing closure of the hotel as well as disconnection of its electric supply.

He said the hotels had seven and 10 rooms respectively and in their case, they had a statutory consent to operate.

However, the Bench observed, “In your case also, there is unauthorised construction (as per NGT order)”.

The Bench initially said it would pass an order similar to the one it had passed on July 11 staying the NGT’s order to demolish another hotel in Kasauli with a rider that the alleged unauthorised constructions should not be utilised.

However, after the NGO opposed the plea, the Bench fixed the matter for hearing on August 21.

The apex court, which had earlier observed that no law was followed in the construction of some resorts and hotels in Kasauli, is hearing separate pleas of some resorts and hotels there which have sought a stay on the NGT order.

It has already stayed the NGT order with respect to some of the hotels and resorts there.

The NGT had imposed hefty fines on several hotels including Bird’s View Resort, Chelsea Resorts, Hotel Pine View, Narayani Guest House, Hotel Nilgiri, Hotel Divsikha and AAA Guest House for causing irretrievable damage to the ecology, polluting the environment and raising unauthorised constructions.

The NGT’s judgment had come on the plea filed by SPOKE which had contended that such huge commercial activity cannot be permitted due to the fragile ecology of Kasauli town. — PTI"
Hindi films now portraying women in a progressive way: Kareena,"Mumbai, August 18

Kareena Kapoor Khan says she is proud and happy that Bollywood filmmakers are now showing women in a progressive way. The actor attributes this change to the influx of young writers in films. In an interview to PTI, Kareena says, “One can definitely see a change in the way women have been portrayed on screen in the Hindi film industry. “The roles are now written by young directors, who have been successful in highlighting the personality of women who are hardworking and successful. Films have now been portraying women in a more progressive manner.” The 36-year-old actor, who was last seen in ‘Udta Punjab’, welcomed her first child, Taimur Ali Khan, in December last year. Talking about balancing her work and motherhood, the actor says, “I have always maintained a personal and professional life but now it’s more difficult as Taimur is too young. I try to strike a balance. I have a great support system with (husband) Saif and my family.” Kareena believes a modern Indian woman plays diverse roles in her life and she considers herself to be one. “She is a multifaceted woman, lives her life to the fullest and fulfils her choices with confidence and style. I am proud to be a married, independent and working woman. I carry that with great honour and pride. Despite being married, I work and have my own identity.” Kareena is all charged up to begin work on her next project ‘Veere Di Wedding’ alongside Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar. However, she did not comment on the reports of her signing a biopic by Omung Kumar, another movie with Salman Khan and Karan Johar’s next. Meanwhile, the ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ star is the muse of designer Anita Dongre’s autumn winter campaign #IamAND, which celebrates the multifaceted personality of the modern Indian woman. “AND is one brand that has changed the fashion scenario in the country. With its new campaign, the brand conveys a very strong message of celebrating the multifaceted personality of the modern Indian woman, which I truly identify with,” says Kareena. PTI"

Pride and prejudice,"Pride and prejudice

When leaders are required to lead

OPINIONS are based on facts; convictions on beliefs; and prejudices on unexamined half-truths or worse. In day-to-day discourse and rational exchanges between people, the first is discussed, the second debated, sometimes without much reason, and the third is asserted mindlessly. Civilised society encourages discussion and debate but clamps down on prejudice. It is a genie that is best left in the bottle, even as its existence cannot be denied as the United States is discovering the painful way. Charlottesville, a small town of 50,000 or so in Virginia, USA, became the centre of a rally of white supremacists recently. There were ugly, violent clashes. At a time like this, it was for President Donald Trump to provide leadership. His original response was tepid and widely derided. He then issued a more robust statement. A day later, the original sentiment asserted itself and the US President again said that the people who were protesting against the white extremists were to blame as much as the extremists for the violence. The pushback to the President’s statements came from the corporate leaders who resigned from his advisory council, from the civil society at large and politicians, including a few from his own Republican Party, who spoke out. This pricked his pride and triggered fits of pique. However, it called out his prejudice. The US experience has a message for India too. We, too, face such issues when home-grown right-wing activists kill cattle transporters, or target members of a particular community, or seek to impose their version of morality on women, thereby curtailing their freedom. Insufficient and equivocal condemnation of such acts by the Prime Minister emboldens criminals and gives them political legitimacy. It is time our businessmen, civil activists, and politicians, too, behaved like leaders they ought to be, to stand their ground when faced with prejudice, to be on the side of facts, to push back the growing tide of intolerance. The strength of our country lies in its multicultural, multilingual and multi-denominational character. These fundamental values need to be nourished by leaders who fight back against prejudice. When they do, they become the pride of the nation."

Under the scanner

Panchayat members have alleged that they are forced to cough up large sums on extending “hospitality” to the auditors

A senior official says even the work done by the auditors is slow as only 2,000 accounts have been audited in

two years.

Even in those accounts, the auditors failed to find any irregularity

The Punjab Government is likely to change the third-party auditors hired by the previous SAD-BJP government for auditing the accounts of over 13,000 panchayats in the state. Reason: A large number of complaints of impropriety has been received against the auditors. The Rural Development and Panchayats Department has already held discussions as to who could replace the auditors. Panchayats have complained that “unnecessary demands” were being raised by the auditors. The government pays Rs 7,000 per panchayat as audit fee. The department is flooded with complaints that the panchayat members are being forced to cough up a similar or higher amount for extending “hospitality” towards the auditors. A senior official told The Tribune that even the work done by the auditors was very slow and in the past two years, only 2,000 panchayat accounts had been audited. The auditors have also failed to find any irregularity in the accounts audited so far, thus giving credence to the complaints that the exercise was a mere eyewash. “The previous government had ordered the audit of these accounts because of suspicion of irregularities in the panchayat funds, especially the accounts related to MNREGA. But the auditors have failed to point out a single anomaly. They have already audited the accounts of panchayats that got the maximum grants,” said the officer. The department is also examining the audited reports of these 2,000 panchayats. When contacted, Tripat Rajinder Bajwa, Rural Development Minister, said there was a rethink on the auditors who had done the audit of some panchayats."

LONDON: Scientists have created sperm cells from small pieces of ear tissue to help genetically infertile male mice produce healthy offspring, an advance that may pave the way for novel therapies to treat human infertility.

[ + read story ]

London

Scientists have created sperm cells from small pieces of ear tissue to help genetically infertile male mice produce healthy offspring, an advance that may pave the way for novel therapies to treat human infertility.

Our sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes, researchers said. Usually, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y (XY), but about one in 500 men are born with an extra X or Y.

Having three rather than two sex chromosomes can disrupt formation of mature sperm and cause infertility.

In a study published in the journal Science, researchers at the Francis Crick Institute in the UK have found a way to remove the extra sex chromosome to produce fertile offspring.

If the findings can be safely transferred into humans, it might eventually be possible for men with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Double Y syndrome (XYY) that are infertile to have children through assisted reproduction using this technique.

The team took small pieces of ear tissue from XXY and XYY mice, cultured them and collected connective tissue cells known as fibroblasts.

They turned the fibroblasts into stem cells and noticed that in the process, some of the cells lost the extra sex chromosome.

With an existing method, they used specific chemical signals to 'guide' the stem cells into becoming cells that have the potential to become sperm. These cells developed into mature sperm when injected into the testes of a host mouse.

The researchers then harvested these mature sperm and used them through assisted reproduction to create healthy, fertile offspring.

""Our approach allowed us to create offspring from sterile XXY and XYY mice,"" said Takayuki Hirota from the Francis Crick Institute.

""It would be interesting to see whether the same approach could one day be used as a fertility treatment for men with three sex chromosomes,"" said Hirota.

In a preliminary experiment, the team found that stem cells produced from fibroblasts of men with Klinefelter syndrome also lost the extra sex chromosome.

""There is currently no way to make mature sperm outside of the body. In our mouse experiments we have to inject cells that have the potential to become sperm back into the testes to help them finish developing,"" said James Turner, Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute.

""But we found that this caused tumours in some of the mouse recipients. So reducing the risk of tumour formation or discovering a way to produce mature sperm in a test tube will have to be developed before we can even consider this in humans,"" said Turner. —PTI"
Discovery of simple method to extract DNA claimed,"Bengaluru

Iraqi scientists at Al-Qasim Green University claim to have found a ""universal, rapid and inexpensive"" method for the isolation of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from the blood of a wide range of species for genomic studies.

Currently there is no common procedure for extracting DNA from the blood of both mammals and birds since each species has a unique property that requires different methods to release its own DNA.

The method reported in the recent issue of the Journal of Genetics exploits the fact that if blood is placed in water, this rapidly enters the red blood cells (RBCs) by ""osmosis"" and causes these cells to burst and release their contents -- that includes DNA -- in a process called ""hemolysis"".

The researchers claim the validity of extracting genomic DNA by this method was confirmed by several molecular biological experiments.

It was found that it provides an efficient and versatile alternative for extracting bulk amounts of DNA from the blood of a variety of species, including humans.

The report says this novel method was used by the researchers to successfully extract DNA from blood samples collected from 135 human volunteers, 60 cows, 178 sheep, six goats and 81 hens.

Half a teaspoon of blood, diluted with two teaspoons of distilled water and centrifuged for just four minutes could yield enough DNA to perform several molecular biological experiments, the researchers report.

""This is the first manuscript that describes the use of distilled water as the eliminator of RBCs,"" the researchers claim. ""It is a reliable and easy to use method for the extraction of large quantity of DNA from blood of both mammals and birds for several molecular experiments.""

They also claim their method has proven its superiority to many commercially available DNA extraction kits that ""either require large amounts of blood samples, are relatively expensive or time-consuming,"" they report.

However, DNA experts in India have reservations about the validity and novelty of this method and the purity of the DNA extracted.

""One may like this method to be reproduced in other labs before accepting its use,"" Jayaram Gowrishankar, former director of Hyderabad's Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Analysis, told this reporter.

""Besides, it is not clear how useful this method will be since existing methods are already very simple and easy to perform,"" he added. —IANS"
Dark truth,"When it comes to the screen, only fair-skinned girls bag lead roles in Punjabi movies. So, is talent only a silent victim?

Jasmine Singh

Reality bite(s)

Talent matters

Wrong note

Kul Sidhu, a Punjabi actress known for her roles in films like Qissa Panjab and award-winning film Nooran has never been part of commercial Punjabi films. Reason? Her dark skin tone! Bollywood and Tollywood has an unsaid criterion for actresses – fair skin - and Kul does not fit the bill!Despite being one of the most talented actresses in the industry, she has faced disparity. “I can’t even tell you how many times the industry has made me realise that I am a dark-skinned girl. In fact, I have given up hope of doing all kinds of roles in Punjabi cinema because they do not see me as someone who fits the criteria for being the lead actress,” shares Kul, who has been offered roles of a kaamwali in Punjabi movies! “I am an actress; I do not mind the role, because I will anyway justify it with my acting. But we also know how much a kamwaali’s character is worth in Punjabi cinema.” Punjabis and their fixation for fair-skinned girls is not new...how many dark-skinned actresses do you find here? “I am sure if there are any talented girls with dark skin tone, they wouldn’t even think of acting in Punjabi films because they know that no one will cast them in a main role.”Popular director Amit Prasher begs to differ. “I think directors always cast an actor or an actress depending on the role and not skin colour. At least I wouldn’t do so.” In the same breath, Amit doesn’t deny the fact that there are not many dark-skinned actresses in the Punjabi industry, “You could be right...because of this perception, fair-skinned girls can make it to the screen easily.”Even some Punjabi songs are dedicated to the gora rang; a song by Arsh Benipal...Gore rang vaali yaar thoda chadd gayi/Assi shad ditta nasha gore rang da/Khudi labhni a sanwle je rang di/Labhni e saawle je rang di/ Khyal rakhu thode yaar jo malang da...the song clearly leaves the dark-skinned girl as the second option. However, for Punjabi film actress Diljott there is no bias or stereotype in the industry. “It depends on character, rather than looks. At the same time, I also feel that since it is commercial cinema, and it is the face value that sells, the actresses are expected to be beautiful and men are required to be handsome. But for sure there is no disparity in terms of skin colour in the industry.” Adds director Sameer Sandhu, “It is not about the colour; it is about the role. Maybe not many roles are written where a dark-skinned girl gets to play the protagonist.”

"One killed in stabbing in western Germany, attacker on the run: Police","Berlin, August 18

One man was killed and another injured in a stabbing in the western German city of Wuppertal, police said on Friday, adding that the attacker was still on the loose.

“We can confirm there has been a deadly crime. One man has died and another man is in hospital,” a police spokeswoman told AFP.

The police said they were hunting for one or more assailants, but could not immediately provide more information about the circumstances of the attack.

The stabbing happened at around 12:45 GMT in the city’s Elberfeld area.

Also in the afternoon, several people were stabbed in the street in the Finnish city of Turku, with police shooting one suspect and warning several others could be at large.

The stabbing in Germany also comes a day after 14 people were killed in twin terror attacks in Spain. — AFP"
Terrorist attacks mar La Liga’s return,"Madrid, August 18

Spain’s La Liga returns on Friday under the shadow of terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils that left 14 dead and more than a hundred injured.

The league’s authorities still plan for all 10 La Liga fixtures to take place, including Barcelona’s match at home to Real Betis on Sunday.

All games across the top two divisions will be preceded by a minute’s silence.

“LaLiga has asked the RFEF (Spanish Football Federation) to hold a minute’s silence in all matches of the first day of the competition in LaLiga Santander and LaLiga 1l2l3,” La Liga said in a statement.

Barcelona’s players held a minute’s silence before training on Friday, whilst the club published a picture of the players and coaching staff with the hashtag “TotsSomBarcelona” (“We are all Barcelona”) on its social media channels.

“As a mark of respect, the flags will fly at half-mast at the club’s facilities and the players from both teams will wear black armbands in all the club’s matches this weekend,” Barcelona added in a statement.

Barcelona’s other top flight side Espanyol are away to Sevilla on Saturday.

“With our hearts still shrinking to see Barcelona, our beloved Barcelona, attacked vilely by terror and hate, we want to show our solidarity with all the people affected as well as to thank enormously all the support received by both the city and our club,” Espanyol said in a statement.

The league’s biggest stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were among those to lead tributes to the victims as the shocking events of Friday unfolded.

“I want to send my condolences and all my support to the families and friends of the victims of the terrible attack in our beloved Barcelona, in addition to totally rejecting any act of violence,” Barca forward Messi, wrote on Instagram.

“We are not going to give up, there are many more of us who want to live in a world in peace, without hate and where respect and tolerance are the basis of coexistence.”

Ronaldo and his Real Madrid teammates also showed their solidarity with Barcelona as the two clubs’ fierce rivalry was forgotten at a tragic time.

“Dismayed at the news coming from Barcelona. All the support and solidarity (to) the family and friends of the victims,” Ronaldo wrote on Twitter.

That mood was reflected on the front pages of Spain’s sport newspapers on Friday.

“Today we can’t talk about sport,” splashed Madrid-based Marca.

Taking a line from Barca’s club anthem, Barcelona-based Sport’s headline ran “Tots units fem força” (together we are stronger).

The first league matches of the season take place on Friday night when Leganes welcome Alaves in Madrid before Valencia host Las Palmas.

Newly-promoted Girona host Atletico Madrid in the first game in Catalonia since the attacks, just over 50 miles north-east of Barcelona on Saturday.

“The most important thing is what happened yesterday,” Atletico coach Diego Simeone said on Friday.

“Unfortunately it was a very hard day for everyone.

“I express my solidarity, sadness and encourage all those that want to live in peace.” — AFP"

Jalandhar, August 17

Adopting zero tolerance towards the axing of trees in the state, the Forest Department has started lodging FIRs with the police against the people indulging in this activity to ensure stringent punishment to them.

Conservator of Forests Satnam Singh and Divisional Forest Officer Vikram Singh Kundra said on the directions of Forest Minister Sadhu Singh Dharmsot, the department had geared up to check the illegal felling of trees in the range.

They said on August 13, the department had busted a gang involved in the cutting of trees after they were caught felling a tree illegally. They said the gang had planned to axe 11 trees in the range, but due to the strict vigil of the department, they were caught cutting the first one only.

The officers further said that acting swiftly, the department had got an FIR registered with the police in the Bilga police station under Sections 379 and 511 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act 1927. The department had also seized the equipment used by the gang to fell trees. The officers said eight persons deployed by the gang to fell the trees had admitted that they were hired by a contractor to axe the trees.

Based on the statement of these eight persons, an FIR had been registered against the head of the gang Harbhans Singh of Boparai village. The police said that the kingpin had been arrested by the police. The officials said shunning the practice of compounding such erring persons, the department had now decided to initiate police action against the defaulters.

Forest Range Officer Davinder Pal Singh was also present on the occasion."
