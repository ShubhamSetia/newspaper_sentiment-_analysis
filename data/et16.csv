"The real military truth: On Doklam, stop saying the Chicken’s Neck area is vulnerable: it isn’t","The Doklam confrontation is not over by any means, and no one can say how it will turn out. As the two sides reinforce their positions, the portents are not good. In the meantime, India needs to stop overplaying the vulnerability of the Chicken’s Neck, the narrow corridor between north and northeastern India.

Indian commentary has identified the Chicken’s Neck as the driving concern behind New Delhi’s insistence that it must stand firm in Doklam. The Chicken’s Neck area is the area between Bhutan, China, Nepal and Sikkim in the north and Bangladesh to the south. At its narrowest, between Bangladesh and Nepal it is 14-17 km wide. Beyond this, it is about 200 km by 60 km in area. The strategic argument is that China could use Doklam to thrust through the Chumbi Valley to sever northern from northeastern India.

This is an extremely dubious thesis. It is about as credible as arguing that the Siachen Glacier is vital to the security of Kashmir and northwestern India. For one thing, Indian forces in the Doklam-Sikkim sector are superior to their PLA counterparts, a point that Indian experts never tire of repeating. India clearly has the advantage of the heights, numbers, and logistics. If so, a Chinese breakthrough here is highly unlikely.

But assuming that the PLA does get past our defences, a thrust from Doklam or from the trijunction of Bhutan, China and India will have to traverse 100-130 km of Indian territory, with Indian forces all round. Note that the PLA will have to negotiate winding Indian roads on which there is no place to hide. It cannot get its men and equipment off the road, and Indian long-range artillery, rockets and attack aircraft will pick them off in a “turkey shoot”.

If the PLA gets to flatter land, it will be able to fan out. However, by the time it does this, Indian forces from both flanks will have massed. The Chinese may even be vulnerable in their rear, with the Indian army harrowing them from behind. Again, long-range artillery, rockets, and aircraft will have a field day.

Assuming that nevertheless Chinese forces make it to flatter ground and try to consolidate their positions, they will face an enormous logistical problem. Their supplies will have to come all the way from Tibet. In military parlance, India will have the “interior” supply lines which are much shorter while the Chinese will have the exterior lines going back to the Tibetan plateau. As a result, their logistics will be horribly exposed to Indian interdiction. The PLA forces in the Chicken’s Neck area will gradually be starved of supplies and will be destroyed or captured.

Another possibility is that the Chinese would try to take and hold this area with special forces that are parachuted behind Indian lines. Chinese special forces have grown and improved in capability over the past decade, but they are not much more than a short-operations force against paramilitary or insurgent opposition. Their ability to hold ground against regular military forces and expand their operations is extremely limited.

This then is the commonsense military truth. It is not clear why Indian analysts, including unnamed or retired military analysts, continue to propagate the myth that the Chicken’s Neck is vulnerable, but it does us no good to repeat this myth endlessly. Certainly, the PLA knows that a thrust here would be suicidal.

Having said that, there is one circumstance in which the Chicken’s Neck would be vulnerable: all-out war with China. In that case, India would be fighting desperately in many sectors, and it might not be able to defend the Chicken’s Neck sufficiently. If so, the Doklam road would be of little or no relevance since the entire border would be in flames and India’s military situation would be perilous across hundreds of kilometres."
"GMR finds buyer for its barge-mounted power plant for $ 63 million, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","The company said in a press release on Wednesday that it will be the designated airport operator in the consortium for this project.

Hyderabad: The GMR Group, which owns a 220 MW gas based power plant in Andhra Pradesh's Kakinada, will sell its barge-mounted power plant to a buyer for USD 63 million.

According to a regulatory filing, the infrastructure major has said that GMR Energy Ltd (GEL) will enter into a definitive agreement with the buyer soon.

The filing, however, did not reveal the buyer's name.

""GEL has entered into a memorandum of undertaking with an external party for sale of its 220 mw gas based power plant for a consideration of USD 6.3 crore and is in the process of entering into a definitive agreement and conclude the sale,"" the filing said.

According to GMR, the plant is operational since November 2001 and redeployed at Kakinada since April 2010.

The company is exploring various commercial options for the plant, which did not generate power since 2013 due to shortage of natural gas.

According to the latest investor presentation of GMR Infrastructure, said the project cost of the plant was USD 90 million (Rs 600 crore).

A GMR official has declined to comment when asked about the development.

GMR Group, which owns both gas and coal-based power plants in the country, has been suffering losses due to shortage of fuel.

The energy vertical of the group incurred losses to the extent of Rs 179.95 crore during the quarter ended June 30 against loss of Rs 95 crore in the same quarter a year ago.

GMR shares traded at Rs 16.20 apiece on BSE at 1410 hrs."
"Amid Speculations Of Casting A Female James Bond, Daniel Craig Confirms His Presence In Bond 25","Despite speculations, there won’t be a female bond this time as Daniel Craig has just confirmed that he’ll play James Bond in Bond 25 for the last time.

For long, rumours were rife that this time there will be a female James Bond, and in fact, speculations had reached a point when it felt like Cara Delevingne is in talks for the role, and she’ll soon sign the project.

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"splar companies: Tamil Nadu latest to push solar companies for post-auction tariff cut, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: States continue to put pressure on renewable energy companies to cut tariffs for projects awarded when costs were higher, ignoring concerns raised by banks, which say their loans are at risk and that such practices would discourage further lending and investment in the sector.The latest state to seek lower tariffs is said to be Tamil Nadu. The Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Co ( Tangedco ) wants the winners of a solar auction held in January-February to reduce tariffs to Rs 3.47 a unit from Rs 4.40 per unit, matching the winning bid in a subsequent auction.“There were meetings between Tangedco officials and the winning developers on July 21 and again on August 10,” said a person familiar with the development. “Tangedco has not put anything in writing, but that is what it wants. It will not sign PPAs for a higher tariff.”Indeed, in Tamil Nadu government circles, there was indifference to the fate of the earlier solar auction since a bigger sale held later achieved a much lower tariff.“If the developers want to cancel their projects, they can do so,” said an official. “Tangedco has found a lower tariff. No PPA has been signed as yet. It is entirely Tangedco’s choice.”Tangedco officials refused to comment on the matter.Some developers who claim to have acquired land and made other investments in anticipation of their projects are set to file a petition with the regulator to compel Tangedco to accept the tariff of Rs 4.40 per unit. They will emphasise that Tangedco flouted the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission’s order of June 13 directing it to sign all power purchase agreements related to the first auction and submit them within a month.If they file the petition, it will be Tangedco’s second run-in with renewable energy developers this year. Wind developers have taken it to court to stop efforts to hold another auction while a TNERC order setting a levelised wind tariff remains valid till the end of the current financial year (as reported in ET’s August 7 edition).The first tender for the 500 MW solar auction received a tepid response due to stringent conditions such as a project completion deadline of 12 months. Bids were received for 292 MW from 20 entities. The biggest bidder was Rays Power Infra Pvt, which sought and won 100 MW at Rs 4.40 per unit. The project size eventually went down to 224 MW with 16 bidders. In June, the discom obtained regulatory approval for a uniform rate of Rs 4.40 per unit.By then, Tangedco had auctioned 1,500 MW of solar projects, relaxing some tough conditions and easing the completion deadline to 24 months. Mining major Neyveli Lignite Corporation bid for the entire lot but was ultimately awarded 449 MW. The 18 winning bids – of the 25 put in – varied between Rs 3.47 and Rs 3.97 per unit and here, too, all winners were asked to match the lowest bid, which they did."
"Coal consumers being taxed much less under GST: Piyush Goyal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) regime in effect from last month has reduced the incidence of tax on coal to 5 per cent, as compared to a cumulative tax of more than 13 per cent on account of various indirect taxes earlier, Parliament was informed on Thursday.""In the pre-GST regime there was Excise Duty on coal at 6 per cent, VAT at 5 per cent (on intra-state sale) Stowing Excise Duty at Rs 10 per tonne of coal production, Central Sales Tax (CST) at 2 per cent (on inter-state sale, on submission of Form C),"" Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal told the Lok Sabha in a written reply.""Post implementation of GST, all these taxes and levies have been subsumed and GST at 5 per cent is being charged to consumers,"" he said.The Minister said that the earlier Clean Environment Cess on coal at Rs 400 per tonne was replaced by the GST Compensation Cess also at the rate of Rs 400 per tonne.""However, previously VAT/CST was charged on Clean Environment Cess but no such taxes are levied on GST Compensation Cess,"" he said.The new pan-India tax regime has also widened the scope for state-miner Coal India (CIL), which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic production, to claim input credit on its costs.Under the earlier value-added tax (VAT) system, CIL used to claim back part of the five per cent VAT it paid on purchase of material. However, the central excise and some other regional taxes could not be claimed back.Now under GST regime, Coal India can claim back a major part of the taxes paid as input credit."
"diabetes: New diabetes drug reduces blood glucose by pushing it to urine: Dr Alvin C Powers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi:, President of, was recently in India to co-inaugurate ‘ International Diabetes Update ’ 2017, which highlighted many advances in diabetes therapy and how to use these advances to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."
"petrol pumps: Petrol pump racket: Accused visited 25 nations to study tricks to rig machines, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: The man at the centre of the investigations into tampering of fuel dispensers made several trips aboard to study technology and methods for rigging machines at petrol pumps , cops have learned.Prakash Nulkar, 56, who previously worked at a manufacturer of fuel dispensers, visited 25 countries, including China, Japan, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa between 1998 and 2017. He finally decided to import components such as microchips from China and altered them to suit local specifications, said an officer with the Thane Crime Branch The chips were inserted into fuel dispensing units, which then pumped less fuel than what customers paid for. The method helped dishonest petrol station owners skim hundreds of litres of fuel every day.“Nulkar was the biggest supplier of tampered machines and parts to petrol stations across the country. He revealed many details during interrogation,” said the officer, who has been part of the probe from the start.On June 16, the Thane Crime Branch inspected a petrol station in Manpada and found that its dispensing units had been altered to secretly pump less fuel. Several petrol stations were subsequently raided in Mumbai, Thane district and other parts of the state and more instances of cheating came to light.Nulkar was arrested from Hubli Karnataka , on July 11. He apparently wanted to set up an operations control centre in China. Investigators are reviewing his international transactions and trying to identify suspects located outside India.One of his main associates in the country was Vivek Shetye, a 47-yearold software engineer from Dombivali. He was arrested earlier. The Crime Branch officer said multiple teams tracked Nulkar’s movements for close to a month before finally nabbing him.In all, he made 40 trips abroad. Singapore, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Madagascar, Bahrain, Myanmar, Malaysia are among the countries he visited. “Nulkar conducted a detailed study before starting the racket. All his foreign trips and the people he met there are under scrutiny. This could be just the tip of the iceberg,” said deputy police commissioner (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe.So far, evidence of tampering has been found at 125 petrol pumps across the state."

The Glitch Episode 1: Why Corruption In India Is As Common As Sand In The Desert,The Glitch Episode 1: Why Corruption In India Is As Common As Sand In The Desert
Bad politics behind endless project delays,"In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited the example of a railway line between Howrah and Champdanga in Bengal. It was decided in 1975 to put in broadgauge tracks in this 74-km stretch. Part of the project was completed — the rest has been stuck for 42 years. Modi said his monthly reviews of projects have speeded up investment, completion and commissioning of new projects. It is welcome that some projects are getting completed in this fashion. Mere monitoring will not, however, help others get built.

Delays in executing projects do not really highlight the failure of Indians to strategically plan, manage and execute new projects. What it does underline, however, is the trait of overambitious politicians to allocate projects to suit particular constituencies, with scant regard about whether it is possible to execute them all in time.

An over-supply of announcements tends to spread resources like capital, manpower and managerial skills too thin on the ground for any one project. Delay follows. The solution is for politicians to refrain from throwing confetti-showers of projects, which are much more than the capacity of the public or private sector to execute, to impress voters.

Data from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) shows that the value of projects completed every quarter peaked in March 2016, five quarters ago. It has been falling, on average, since then. The last two quarters, from January to June 2017, have been especially bad. CMIE cites the lack of investment appetite and says most projects being finished now were proposed 10 years ago. The government should try to mitigate financial and other risks associated with investments to bring animal spirits back to the business of forming and executing new projects."
"While Celebrating The Patriotic Spirit From Assam, Let Us Not Forget The Grim Flood Situation There","This is arguably one of the most shared images on social media in the past two days. Four people including two children who are almost neck deep in water saluting the tricolour hoisted on the occasion of India's 71st Independence Day.

The man who hoisted the flag is Tazem Sikder, the headmaster of a government run Naskara lower primary school in Dhubri, Assam. Others seen in the picture are Mizanur Rahman, a teacher along with Jiarul Ali Khan and Haider Ali Khan, two Class 3 students.

The image shared by Mizanur Rahman was an instant hit on Tuesday as the nation celebrated Independence Day.

Others too shared images from various parts of Assam where people 'celebrated' Independence Day amid heavy flooding across the state.

ANI

They too were widely circulated across various social media platforms lauding the patriotic spirit of the Assamese people. But many seemed to have failed to notice one prominent thing in all those images -- the flood waters.

Reuters

Assam is currently in the middle of a catastrophic flood, the second flood in less than a month, which has left 33 lakh people displaced and 1.83 lakh hectares of standing crops inundated. 28 people have been killed across the state in the second leg of floodings taking the total death toll this year to 112 so far.

Reuters

Thirty-three lakh people were affected in 25 districts, including Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Darrang, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta and Bongaigaon. Dhemaji district in upper Assam is the worst-hit where nearly one lakh people were affected. Flood water is flowing over the roofs of houses in many areas.

As flood waters were flowing over National Highway 37, communication between upper and lower Assam have snapped. Vehicles were stranded on the highway and being diverted via Nagaland.

Kaziranga National Park, which is home to a large population of rhinos, elephants, tigers, wild buffalos and eastern swamp deer have also been hit badly by the flood, with an estimated 85 per cent of the reserve under water.

This is the worst deluge the north eastern state has witnessed in nearly three decades.

The current flooding is adding to the woes of the state which was almost brought to its knees by heavy rains last month.

The first wave of floods between April and July claimed 85 lives and affected about 19 lakh people in the state.

At least 107 animals, including seven rhinos, died in last month's flood in Kaziranga.

PTI

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had come under heavy criticism after he rushed to his home state Gujarat, to assess the flood there while ignoring Assam.

He finally visited the state early this month, by the time the initial flood waters had begun receding."

Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

"India to phase out 5,500 Megawatt of coal-fired power plants, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: India has identified 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of inefficient coal-fired power plants to be retired, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told lawmakers on Thursday, as the country looks to cut emissions and make better use of its coal reserves.

The Central Electrical Authority (CEA) has identified coal-fired plants which are more than 25 years old for retirement in a phased manner on the basis of their ""inefficiency and un-economic operation,"" Goyal said. He did not provide details on the timeframe over which they would be phased out.

Around 78 percent of generated power in India still comes from coal-fired plants, making it one of the biggest users in the world of the dirty and cheap fuel.

Coal-fired plants account for about 195 GW of India's 330 GW of installed power capacity, data on the CEA's website shows.

India, which is also undergoing a programme to retrofit several coal-fired plants to reduce emissions, has retired about 4 GW of coal-fired power plants over the last two years.

However, state-run power utility NTPC Ltd plans to invest $10 billion in new coal-fired power stations over the next five years despite the electricity regulator's assessment that thermal plants now under construction will be able to meet demand until 2027, Reuters reported this month."
"GST impact: Over 25% of trucks idle amid drop in interstate movement, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Wholesale and distribution businesses in particular are hesitant to despatch untaxed cargo under the GST regime.

More than a fourth of India’s 6 million-strong truck pool is said to be idle after the goods and services tax ( GST ) came into force on July 1 amid a drop in interstate movement of untaxed and underreported cargo, leading to a fall in retail freight charges.That’s having a knock-on effect on the transport and truck-making businesses, at least in the short term, experts said.Interstate retail freight rates are down 40-50%, the sharpest decline in over three decades, said SP Singh, senior fellow at the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training ( IFTRT ).Such steep declines in freight rates were seen in 1984, 1988, 2008 and just after the 2016 demonetisation , say transporters To be sure, transport operators are reporting logistic efficiency gains as those trucks that are running are reaching destinations quicker with border check posts having been scrapped.India’s 6 million trucks range from 5 tonnes to 49 tonnes. Out of the total, 1.3 million have national permits and 1.2 million have permits for their home state and neighbouring states, with 40-45% of them not running currently.Out of the remaining 3.5 million trucks that have permits for their home states, a fourth are idle, added Singh However, in the long run, the increased economic activity that’s expected to result from GST, will mean greater demand for trucks, raising the prospect of a big boost for the commercial vehicle market.But for now, wholesale and distribution businesses in particular are hesitant to despatch untaxed cargo under the GST regime.Untaxed invoices dodging the tax authorities have virtually disappeared from freight markets, except for a few interstate destinations in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, parts of Maharashtra and the North-East, said Singh of IFTRT.That’s led to a postponement of new truck purchases and a rise in defaults on hire purchase dues.Non-banking finance companies may hold back on lending, pushing up interest rates. The Indian medium and heavy truck segment fell 32% in the June quarter to 48,493 units due to significant pre-buying in the preceding quarter and delayed purchases due to uncertainty on GST.Long-haul transporters renew their fleet every five-six years, with the older trucks going to the secondary market. But transporters have stopped selling older vehicles, as there is no clarity over GST on secondhand trucks, said Naveen Gupta, secretary general, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).He’s sought government support for truckers who can’t make loan and insurance payments on account of lower earnings.The worst hit are small fleet operators and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which account for almost 40% of the load carried in the country, according to a senior executive at a leading truck maker.Many operated outside the purview of taxes and it will take a few months before the numbers get back to former levels as they become familiar with the GST regime. However, Jasjit Sethi, CEO of TCI Supply Chain Solutions, one of India’s largest transporters, said July has always been a slow month.He expects a hockey stick kind of growth in the next quarter as transporters get more comfortable with GST. “The idle capacity in our opinion is at about 10-15%, which is largely seasonal in nature with a little bit of impact from the GST announcement,” Sethi said.“The movement is sluggish right now, but with the onset of festive season, we are expecting stronger movement of goods and the freight rates to firm up.”Another truck company executive said his company had started seeing a 10-15% increased efficiency in goods movement, which effectively means the existing fleet can do that much more business. Vinod Aggarwal, MD and CEO at VE Commercial Vehicles , expects demand to be slow in the coming two months before things normalise in the GST ecosystem.“There are hiccups expected in the next one or two months,” he said. “Starting September, the demand may pick up. Customers are in wait-and-watch mode. One after the other disruptions have taken place. Government has to look at ways of boosting private investment and that combined with correction of interest rates will help drive demand fundamentally.”When buying resumes, transporters will seek quality.“With faster turnaround time and higher efficiencies, people will be more inclined to replace the older legacy trucks with modern trucks, which is expected to gain a larger pie of the market and that in turn will aid growth in commercial vehicle market,"" said TCI’s Sethi."
Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness. What is his caste you may ask? Pat comes the reply, he is an Indian. For him, the happiness of the people around him is more important than the caste he belongs to. Known for their strong stand to unite one and all, United Colors of Benetton strongly believe in the ideology of unity. In this video, they bring alive the incredible story of this man in Lucknow and exemplifies how we all can be #UnitedByFaith."
"Hailed As Gorakhpur Hospital Hero, Dr Kafeel Gets Support From Social Media After Being Sacked","At least 70 children have succumbed in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital, making it one of the most unfortunate events of our times. As claimed by the authorities, the unfortunate event happened due to the shortage of oxygen supply, as the dues amounting to Rs 65 lakh weren't paid.

BRD Medical College Dr Kafil, child specialist Statement In Gorakhpur pic.twitter.com/s7Xsag6G81 — Bahujan Samaj Party (@BspUp2017) August 13, 2017

Pushpa Co., the organisation that dealt with the supply of oxygen had even threatened the hospital for cutting the supplies if the dues weren't cleaned. They even wrote a letter, clearly stating the consequences if the payment wasn't made.

But what remains unclear that despite these threats. the hospital continued to function, ignoring the fragility of the situation and what might happen if the supply is cut.

As a result, Dr Kafeel Ahmad, the head of the paediatrics department and the encephalitis ward at BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur was been sacked without much mulling. Dr Ahmad, who was once reported as the key figure of the hospital is now being accused of carelessness and the miserable attempt at earning a commission over the payment.

No one should be allowed to use the words ""unfortunate"" and ""tragedy"" in relation to #Gorakhpur. This was murder. — Faye DSouza (@fayedsouza) August 12, 2017

But let's get to know what Ahmad was up to during this debacle. Ahmad made several calls to nearby facilitators, but everyone refused to make the delivery. He was then offered a deal only over full payment in advance -- he did not hesitate for a minute but took out his ATM card and asked one of his staff members to get the cash from his bank account at the earliest.

Upon further deliberation, he found out that a friend owned a private hospital could spare three oxygen cylinders, so he drove himself and fetched those cylinders. He then, single-handily brought 12 oxygen cylinders, trained staff on artificial respiration and made frantic calls to help distraught patients.

Despite everything, Dr Ahmad witnesses the death of 70 children, false accusation and a sacking that made him lose his job. According to the government and the authority, the reason for sacking him is ‘dereliction of duty’ as well as ‘carrying out private practice’.

We don't know whether Dr Ahmad was actually responsible for these deaths or saved many lives as there hasn’t been any official validation from the hospital. But, circumstantial evidence suggests that if Dr Amhed was not there, some more children would have died."
"GST: IGST collection from imports rises about 60% in just one month of GST, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The collection of Integrated Goods and Services Tax from imports crossed Rs 20,000 crore in July — the first month of the roll out of the new indirect tax regime, pointing towards a major jump in revenues. Total customs revenues in July 2017 stood at Rs 26,500 crore as against Rs 16,625 crore collected in July 2016.Collections have been quite robust,” a government official said. However, the official said IGST collections have also received a boost from the fact that there is a component of state GST as well in the tax.Besides, the government has done away with a number of countervailing duty (CVD) exemptions and not extended them under the GST regime that were available in the previous tax regime, such as that on some electronic products.The rise in customs revenues on imports should take care of any decline in GST collections because of any production-related disruption after the rollout of the new regime.Overall GST trends would be available only in August when the final tax collection numbers for July are collated.There is apprehensions that revenues may take a hit because of sluggish sales across the country in the first month of GST. Central Board of Excise and Customs would carry out a detailed analysis of the initial trends when the final numbers become available.India rolled out GST, which replaces 17 central and state taxes such as central excise duty, service tax , value added tax and 23 cesses, from July 1.IGST collections are first revenue trends on the new tax as also indication of the largely smooth rollout. IGST become payable from June 30 midnight on all goods entering the country, barring the exempted ones.IGST on imports replaces countervailing duty and is levied in lieu of state GST and Central GST, but over and above basic customs duty . IGST is equal to the sum of Central GST and State GST levied on any product in the country. GST has subsumed countervailing duty, which was levied in lieu of central excise duty, and special additional duty on imports."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
"Today online medicine market is growing at an exponential rate: Deepak Tomar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, CEO,, Gurgaon, India, talks on how the online pharmacy is catering to the medicine requirements of the retailers, wholesalers and people in an easier and safer way. Edited excerpts:The concept of online medicines started around 4 to 5 years ago. At that time some companies came up with a concept where a user can upload their prescription and medicines are delivered at the doorstep. The prescription however needs to be vetted by a pharmacist physically or online in order to be considered. This concept is getting a lot of support from the government of India as well. Couple of years ago, there was no provision of online pharmacy licensing. Now the government of India has allowed online pharmacy licenses in few of the states, where online orders can be taken in and the medicines can be home delivered. This online medicine market is growing at an exponential rate and currently the number of online medicine orders range somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 a day.Another company that I own, Clavex has its headquarters in San Jose, California with offices in Sydney, Australia & Gurgaon, India. It was while working on Clavex, that we got an opportunity to work with a number of pharmacies in Australia and New Zealand, health research companies in US & UK and some of the health care providers through them. It was due to an intense interaction with them, that we gained a deeper understanding of the health care industry and how the industry works. After this, I returned to India and interacted with the big names in the pharmaceutical industry in order to understand the trends and future scope of the industry in the country. After all, we know that the Indian retail economy is projected to expand to $1.1 trillion in a couple of years. There however aren’t many players who would be willing to cater to the health care sector. It is to fill this void that we came up with the concept of an all inclusive health care platform for India and see a great scope of expansion.It was two years ago that we came up with HeyCare. Most of the players in the field like Amazon, healthcart which are essentially e-commerce companies and 96% of the e-commerce companies are not into getting the pharmaceutical goods. Selling online in the smaller towns, cities, and villages is quite a challenge. Villages make up for about 50% GDP of the country and if we combine the tier 4, 5 cities and small towns with it, it accounts for 60 to 70% of the country’s GDP. The e-commerce companies are currently targeting only the 30-40% GDP of the tier 1, 2, and 3. What sets us apart from the rest of the industry is that we cover the whole country and have a clear segmentation of the country in place. The current model of e-commerce is definitely not the best suited one for it, which prompted us to come with inclusive e-commerce which essentially means e-commerce with assisted sale. The concept of assisted sale is assisting the retailers who are already selling in these villages. Currently the e-commerce companies are getting the products sent in by the retailers into their warehouses, and then send the orders to the consumers. The retailers are barely making any profits as they are also paying warehousing charges. This model is, hence rarely profitable. What needs to be done is to go hyper-local. You can send the medicines to the retailers and they can then take care of the logistics. This is the model that we are introducing with HeyCare and another parallel brand.HeyCare is a B2C platform for first world India that is the tier 1, 2, and 3 cities where users can come online, make an appointment with the doctor, upload the prescription and get the medicines delivered at home. In case there are any tests prescribed by the doctor, they can be booked with the diagnostics lab, and a representative would come collect your samples from home. The reports will be uploaded on the same application and accessed easily by the user. For kids especially there is a vaccination reminder feature and a pill reminder function, especially for the elderly. The money transactions are also pretty simple here which is managed by a special dedicated wallet within the application called Care Wallet. These are the features currently developed in the application.While interacting with numerous pharmaceutical companies, a common pain point came to light, that is distribution. The supply chain here is exceptionally long consisting of a country head, regional heads, then state heads and CNF, supervisors of distribution, distributors, wholesalers and then retailers. It is for this reason that the margin really thins out for each of these entities. HeyCare steps in here and offers a direct connection between these pharmaceutical companies and the retailers. HeyCare would provide a complete retail distribution channel thus fattening up the margins for both, the pharmaceutical companies and the retailers. This model also eliminates the fear of counterfeit medicines as these activities are rife at the super distributor and distributor level which is out of the companies’ control.The future of HeyCare in India is the development of a highly efficient retail distribution channel in the country which would then act as a third party distribution channel for its first world healthcare industry. Once the system for the first world India is regularized and implemented effectively, we intend to expand the channel across other industries as well. The biggest advantage here would be an efficient and common payment platform for the consumers, retailers and wholesalers which would ease up the transactions for everyone. It is pleasantly surprising that some of the bigger names of the pharma world are approaching us to sign on with us and eliminate the hassle of maintaining a physical retail distribution channel while opting for the online distribution channel with HeyCare. The model of companies like Micromax mobiles where they chose to go exclusively on sale with Flipkart is slowly being emulated in the pharma industries too. HeyCare has, in fact bagged quite a few contracts with the pharmaceutical companies that are partnering exclusively with us and we would be their exclusive online distributors."
‘SK Abbasi is to Sharif what Manmohan Singh was to Sonia … Pakistan’s SC has poor record of defending democracy’,"With Pakistan also celebrating 70 years of its independence Farahnaz Ispahani, Global Fellow at Washington’s Wilson Centre, former member of Pakistan parliament (from Pakistan People’s Party) and former media advisor to the Pakistan president, spoke to Rohit E David on the political flux in Islamabad after the ouster of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister, its impact on Kashmir and the nefarious role of Pakistan’s deep state:

What is your view on the political prospects of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi who has been PM of Pakistan after Nawaz Sharif stepped down?

PM Abbasi has been nominated by Nawaz Sharif from his own party and is seen by all as a loyal placeholder until the next elections, in which Sharif’s nominated prime ministerial candidate will run. Sharif remains the head of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and, as is the subcontinent’s tradition, control of the party is more important than who is officially PM. Abbasi is to Sharif what Manmohan Singh was to Sonia Gandhi.

What is your view on Pakistan Supreme Court barring Nawaz Sharif as PM?

The verdict came as no surprise. Pakistan’s Supreme Court has a long history of political decisions and acts directly instead of waiting for due process through lower courts. Now it has disqualified a three times elected prime minister from holding public office for life, in a corruption inquiry linked to the Panama Papers.

However, Sharif was not named in the Panama leaks, there was no trial, and it has yet to be proved that he abused public office for private gain. The judges disqualified him on what many unbiased observers consider a mere technicality. It is indeed sad that no Pakistani PM is allowed to be voted out by the people and SC judges or generals decide when a PM should be ousted.

Why has no Pakistan PM completed a full five-year term?

It is because of what many call the permanent establishment in Pakistan. This is led by the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies; closely emulated by the Supreme Court and, in many instances, the bureaucracy. This is Pakistan’s constant and consistent power base. They do not accept the right of elected leaders to change the nation’s course. The Supreme Court of Pakistan and the five high courts have an extremely poor record of defending democracy against authoritarian interventions. The Supreme Court has legalised each one of Pakistan’s three successful military coups in 1958, 1977 and 1999.

What impact will this have on Pakistan’s Kashmir policy?

Kashmir policy, all regional policy and non-regional foreign policy has been directed by the establishment since Pakistan’s founding. Several civilian prime ministers – most recently Sharif – have tried to improve ties with India but the powerful ‘Kashmir first’ lobbies in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have destroyed all these efforts by the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. India and Pakistan can normalise relations without resolving all disputes first, as many countries have done, but that is not acceptable to the Pakistani establishment. Kashmir policy, anti-India policy and the policy of strategic depth have caused Pakistan to be increasingly isolated in our neighbourhood and around the world. Proponents of that policy do not want to accept that.

Will this make the civilian government weak forever?

Nothing has to be forever. But Pakistan’s permanent establishment and its stranglehold on Pakistan’s media have made it very difficult to stand up to it even as we see today for a hugely popular and elected leader like Nawaz Sharif. Judiciary has become an instrument of the establishment. It responds to media noise rather than sticking to law and legal process.

How do you assess Imran Khan’s role leading up to this court case? Do you foresee Pervez Musharraf and Imran Khan coming out with a third front?

Imran Khan has been in politics for decades but, until now, he has always been a bridesmaid who never made it to being the actual bride. He is thought to be growing more personally unstable and that is making some in the permanent establishment concerned about supporting him in the next elections against Sharif’s powerful PML-N party in the all-important Punjab province. That said, he has some following in urban areas among angry, hyper-nationalist youth and retired military personnel. And he remains a favourite of pro-establishment media.

Do you feel that judicial accountability and judicial independence have become tools of a deep state?

I will only say that judicial accountability must be across the board and not selective to be credible. There is a reason why no general, judge or senior bureaucrat faces the kind of accountability inflicted on politicians. When the process is not transparent, it leads to suspicions about the deep state being at work."

"After The Failure Of 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', Distributors Now Want SRK To Refund Money","With back to back losses and big releases flopping one after the other, Hindi Film industry is indeed going through a rough patch.

Massive flops include films like Salman’s Tubelight, Ranbir Kapoor, and Katrina Kaif’s Jagga Jasoos and now, Imtiaz Ali’s Jab Harry Met Sejal has joined the list. The film that was one of the most anticipated films of the year ended up proving to be one big disaster. Apart from the producers, NH Studioz too has suffered huge losses.

The studios had acquired the rights of Tubelight for Rs. 132 crores and Jab Harry Met Sejal for Rs. 80 crores and now that both the films have proved to be such disasters, the intensity of the losses are huge.

While Salman had set a great example by returning some amount to the distributors, a Bollywoodhungama report claims that the distributors have sent an SOS message to Shah Rukh Khan, and have asked them to follow the suit.

Viral Bhayani

According to the reports, they are now expecting a refund for the backbreaking losses since Shah Rukh Khan had made good profits from the pre-sale of All India Rights to NH Studioz, satellite, music, and digital rights.

Pinterest

Just to jog your memory a little, SRK had distributors of his 2015 film Dilwale when they had incurred losses and he had refunded close to Rs. 25 crores to cover up 50% losses to distributors of Dilwale.

And this wasn’t the first time SRK did so because, in 2001 and 2005, Shah Rukh Khan had refunded the individual distributors of his films Asoka (Eros) and Paheli (UTV) after they failed to perform at the box-office.

While no actor or producer is bounded to return money to distributors, our actors are definitely setting a great example.

To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

"Selling LEDs at petrol pumps a major step in boosting oil companies’ non-fuel retail business: Pradhan, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government’s latest move to make LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances available for sale at petrol pumps will give a major fillip to oil companies ’ business arising from segments other than fuel retail, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.The retail fuel outlets of Oil Marketing Companies witness a total footfall of over 35 million every day. “In order to take advantage of this to enhance the non-fuel retail energy business, LED bulbs and other energy efficient appliances from EESL will be sold at ROs. The Ministry had recently taken the decision on daily pricing of fuel to prevent huge distortions in margins in the retail business. This step of selling LED bulbs will also help in the margins of retail outlets ,” Pradhan said.The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking an initial pact between the three OMCs – Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) – and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) under the power ministry for selling of LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances at over 55,000 pumps across the country.Pradhan urged EESL and OMCs to develop a viable business model for the retail outlets in the next six months. The oil companies will help in branding and marketing of the UJALA Scheme – the government’s flagship initiative to promote LED bulbs -- at all their retail outlets thereby making petrol pumps attractive to customers. “The RO dealers will directly conduct business with EESL and would get around 10 per cent margin,” Pradhan said.The OMCs have been tying up with other stakeholders, too, to develop their non-fuel retail business at retail outlets. A pilot launch of tie-up with Mother Dairy Safal outlets has been carried out in Bhubaneshwar in Odisha under which customers are expected to get fresh and quality vegetables and fruits at affordable rates at the petrol stations.BPCL has also entered into a tie-up with In & Out retail chain at their ROs. HPCL is also in the process of tying up with retail chains of the market to expand their business at ROs. Pradhan said the Janaushadhi Stores under the Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers will also be opened at ROs in the future.Apart from this, Common Service Centre (CSC) concept of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is also being explored to be brought to the petrol pumps. Under CSC, citizens will be able to avail many Government-to-Citizen and Business-to-Citizen services including PAN, E-Aadhaar Cards, utility bill Payments, banking solutions and Agri Services."
"Nuclear medical generators stuck at airports, PMO concerned, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: Reacting to a TOI report on the scarcity of nuclear generators affecting diagnosis at the country’s leading hospitals, the prime minister’s office asked doctors from AIIMS , New Delhi, on Monday to brief its officials about the issue. Over 90 technetium-99m generators, which could have helped perform nearly 10,000 life-saving scans, have been languishing at Mumbai and New Delhi international airports since August 6 and are close to expiry.TOI had reported the previous Saturday how the generators with a maximum shelf life of 14 days are stuck at airports because one of the major importers could not complete the paperwork for a new licence in time. As a result, thousands of scans to be carried out at nuclear medicine centres for cancer, heart, renal diseases had to be cancelled.Dr Chetan Patel, who heads the nuclear cardiology unit at AIIMS, said the PMO has promised to look into the matter and expedite the process of getting approvals. “Currently, we have cut down the volume of tests by 40%,” he said. The hospital has approached the government’s Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology for the key radioactive material but is yet to receive supply.Currently, in most of the 200-odd nuclear medicine centres in the country, scans have either been completely stopped or drastically reduced. “The crisis will worsen as we have been told there will be no supply in the coming weeks,” said Dr B R Mittal, head of nuclear medicine, PGIMER Chandigarh, which normally performs at least 100 scans every day. “We are forced to turn away patients,” he added.While the generators have been coming to the country since the past 30 years, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) imposed quality control last October, making it mandatory for importers to obtain fresh licences. However, an order asking the customs to restrict their import has disrupted the supply of generators since one of the importers is yet to get the registration certificate. Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh had previously told TOI that importers were given five to six extensions since last year to complete the formalities.A bigger hazard looming now is that of radiation exposure at the two key airports. Even if the generators become useless for medical consumption, they cannot be discarded like regular medical waste. Hospitals store them for two to three months before they become non-radioactive and are safe to be discarded. “Since airports don’t have any such facility, there is a risk of radiation exposure, even if minimal,” said Dr Anshu Sharma, president, Society of Nuclear Medicine (India). “The Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) has stringent regulations for discarding of radioactive materials. How will airports follow these regulations?” he said.Vishat Diagnostics, the largest importer of technetium-99m generators that supplies to 80% of the hospitals, said they won’t import generators till they get the registration certificate. Ajith Kumar from Vishat said, “We have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 15 lakh because of the government’s stance. We will not be importing any more generators till we have all the papers.”Meanwhile, patients have been badly hit. Patang Khandekar (65), who was asked to undergo a full-body scan, was turned back from a Marol hospital on Monday. “It is sad that we have wasted precious radioactive material that our nuclear reactors don’t manufacture,” said Dr G Mahapatra from SevenHills Hospital."
"REC issues clarification on CAG report, says issues of non-compliance do not refer to the firm, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: State-run Rural Electrification Corporation ( REC ) on Friday said that the Comptroller and Auditor General’s remarks regarding non-compliance of Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) norms do not pertain to the firm. CAG had, in a report released on Thursday, slammed REC and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) for not following internal guidelines and RBI rules in sanctioning loans to independent power producers that led to surge in bad loans.“The C&AG report under reference is a combined report for REC and PFC. The remarks of the CAG regarding non-compliance of RBI norms, do not pertain to REC. As a matter of fact, the CAG itself under para 1.3 of the said report has stated that REC has followed the prudential norms of RBI in recognizing its NPAs since 2014-15,” REC said in a statement.Speaking at the release of the first quarter results, Chairman and Managing Director P V Ramesh Babu said the CAG report pointed issues pertaining only to PFC and not REC. He added CAG has appreciated REC on many occasions for following RBI norms."

"Alkem Labs to tap domestic, international markets for growth, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The Mumbai-based firm said it would also look at building base in the emerging therapy areas of cardiac, anti-diabetes, CNS and derma (skin) by leveraging on its core strengths.

New Delhi, Aug 13 : Drug firm Alkem Laboratories is looking to tap domestic as well as international markets for growth going forward, the company has said.

In the domestic market, the company plans to consolidate presence in the segments it is in and is aiming to build base in the emerging therapy areas and OTC segment.

""The company would look to consolidate its market leading position in its established therapy areas of anti-infectives, gastro-intestinal, pain management and vitamins, minerals & nutrients,"" Alkem Laboratories said in its Annual Report of 2016-2017 financial year.

The Mumbai-based firm said it would also look at building base in the emerging therapy areas of cardiac, anti-diabetes, CNS and derma (skin) by leveraging on its core strengths.

""The company would expand its product offerings by launching innovative and differentiated products through indigenous R&D and in-licensing opportunities,"" Alkem Laboratories said.

About the over-the-counter segment, the company would further invest to build its OTC portfolio through new product offerings and media spends, it added.

In the international markets, Alkem Labs is looking forward to the US market as one of the key growth drivers for the company. In the fiscal year 2017, its US business delivered sales of USD 181 million.

""Aided by a healthy pipeline of 91 Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filings, own front end and supply chain in the US and cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities, the company looks to capitalise in the world's largest pharmaceutical market,"" the report said.

Continued investments in R&D and accelerated ANDA filings along with timely new product launches would be the key growth drivers in the US, it added.

In-licensing opportunities and strategic alliances and partnerships to enhance capabilities and product portfolio in the US pharmaceutical market are also being explored, the report said.

Alkem currently has presence in over 50 international markets with its key markets being Australia, Philippines, Chile and Kazakhstan.

The company is focusing on key select international markets rather than spreading itself thin over too many markets, the report said.

The drug maker plans to grow operations by creating strong local presence and offering differentiated products, it added.

""Expansion through strategic acquisitions and partnership agreements for product out-licensing and in-licensing would also be an enabler for the company in these markets,"" the report said.

Established in 1973, Alkem Laboratories has a portfolio of over 700 brands covering all major therapeutic segments. It has 16 manufacturing facilities, 14 being in India and two in the United States. AKT RKL AP NP SRK JM"
"Modi govt’s energy efficiency scheme to enable Rs 1,000 cr investment by 2020, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The Modi government’s flagship scheme to ramp up energy efficiency profile of buildings being executed by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) will lead to investments of Rs 1,000 crore over the next three years through 2020, an official statement said today.EESL, a joint venture of PSUs under the power ministry, is implementing the Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme which was launched by power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal in May. “Under the programme, EESL intends to bring in investment of around 1,000 crore covering more than 10,000 large government or private buildings by 2020,” the ministry said.EESL plans to retrofit one crore LED lights, 15 lakh energy-efficient ceiling fans and 150,000 lakh energy efficient ACs in buildings. Apart from retrofitting, EESL also aims to widen its services in areas like centralized AC system, Energy Audits, and New Generation Energy Management System in buildings.The finance ministry has issued guidelines for mandatory installation of energy-efficient appliances in all central government buildings across the country as a majority of these buildings are old constructions and, therefore, consume large amount of energy. The finance ministry has directed usage of LED-based lightings and energy-efficient cooling equipment in government buildings will lead to savings through reduction in energy consumption.In order to implement this plan, the Department of Expenditure under Ministry of Finance has decided to take up the services of EESL on nomination basis to assist ministries and departments to retrofit energy-efficient appliances in their premises across the country.The Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme has two business models -- The Energy Servicing Company (ESCO) model where the entire upfront investment is made by EESL and is paid back by the building owner out of the resulting energy savings from the intervention and the Project Management Consultancy (PMC) model where EESL acts as the project management consultant for implementing the project and the client invests the entire project cost and bears one-time PMC charges of EESL.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in January 2015 launched the National LED Programme to facilitate rapid adoption of LED-based home and street lighting across the country. The programme components -- Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) and Street Lighting National Programme (SNLP) of EESL -- are currently under implementation in 29 States and 7 Union Territories."
15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

Here’s Why That Friendly Smiley You Use In Your Email Maybe Doing You More Harm Than Good,"Think you’re being nice or friendly by adding a smiley to the end or between your emails? Software developers may agree with you and give the full go ahead by equipping you with a barrage of conversational tools, but a recent study claims you may want to consider stopping using smileys or similar emoticons in formal emails.

wokv.com

A recent study, however, called “The Dark Side of a Smiley” claims that smiley face may come across as rather benign and might be causing more harm than a good.

Using a smiley face emoji or similar emoticons in work-related emails may not create a positive impression and could actually portray low competence, reveals the study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.

thebalance.com

""Our findings provide first-time evidence that, contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence. In formal business emails, a smiley is not a smile,"" said Ella Glikson, a post doctorate fellow at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) in Israel.

Researchers conducted a series of experiments with a total of 549 participants from 29 different countries.

In one experiment, participants were asked to read a work-related e-mail from an unknown person and then evaluate both the competence and warmth of that person.

All the participants received similar messages. Some included smileys while others did not.

lifewire.com

Researchers found that in contrast to face-to-face smiles, which increase both competence and warmth, the smileys in an email had no effect on the perception of warmth, and in fact had a negative effect on the perception of competence.

""The study also found that when the participants were asked to respond to emails on formal matters, their answers were more detailed and they included more content-related information when the e-mail did not include a smiley,"" Glikson said.

""We found that the perceptions of low competence if a smiley is included in turn undermined information sharing,"" she said.

comindware.com

In another experiment, the use of a smiley was compared to a smiling or neutral photograph. The findings show that in the case of a photograph, a smiling sender was perceived as more competent and friendly than a neutral one.

However, when an e-mail on formal work-related matters included a smiley, the sender was perceived as less competent. The smiley did not influence the evaluation of the sender's friendliness, researchers said.

ucn.sk

The team also found that when the gender of the e-mail writer was unknown, recipients were more likely to assume that a woman sent the email if it included a smiley.

However, this attribution did not influence the evaluation of competence or friendliness.

""People tend to assume that a smiley is a virtual smile, but the findings show that in the case of the workplace, at least as far as initial 'encounters' are concerned, this is incorrect,"" Glikson said.

lifewire.com

""For now, at least, a smiley can only replace a smile when you already know the other person. In initial interactions, it is better to avoid using smileys, regardless of age or gender,"" she added.

Food For Thought: Let’s make the Independence Day feast an annual ritual,"On this 71st Independence Day, there are many things we need to be proud of and many things we still need to work on. And one of the things we need to work on is celebrating Independence Day. According to me, Independence Day celebrations today are great insofar as they evoke the spirit of nationalism, love for the flag and remind us of the sacrifices of our freedom fighters who laid down their lives so that we could experience the fruits of independence. However, these celebrations can be very sombre. We as a young nation need to have fun as we reaffirm our Indian identity.

Again, I don’t mean any disrespect to rituals such as hoisting of the national flag, singing patriotic songs and listening to the Prime Minister’s speech at Red Fort. All of these things will continue. But we need rituals that organically bring us together as people. Independence Day should be as much about euphoria as it should be about respect. One fun Independence Day ritual that is slowly dying out is kite flying. In the years gone by, August 15 was a day that saw kites obscure the sky in many parts of the country. It was a joyous activity that transcended religion, caste, ethnicity and localities. However, the youth these days have failed to inherit this tradition, being preoccupied with other leisurely pursuits.

Hence, we find ourselves in a situation where we need another fun-filled Independence Day ritual. And in my opinion, a replacement can be found in Independence Day feasting. People coming together on Independence Day to share food is a fantastic way to strengthen communal harmony and assert our Indianness. Since food is an essential pillar of culture, what better way is there to reflect the diversity of India than through a feast that represents its myriad regional cuisines? And the more diverse the backgrounds of our friends and family members are, the richer our feast will be.

In fact, an Independence Day potluck feast is the perfect symbol of India’s unity in diversity. Such a feast also gives us an opportunity to reflect on our shared destiny as a people. Besides, when people sit and eat together, their differences of opinion and politics take a back seat. It breaks down the feeling of otherness and replaces this with bonds of friendship. This is all the more needed in today’s highly politicised atmosphere where questions of identity have become complicated.

Plus, an Independence Day feast will be a ritual that people don’t need to stress about. There are no questions of whether one is patriotic enough. If you are hosting such a feat on Independence Day, sharing delicious food with your friends and family, and spreading general warmth and love, you are as Indian as one can be."
ISRO Scientists Make Their First Music Video To Celebrate India's 70th Independence Day,"A bunch of scientists from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has made their first music video. While, during the day, they study rocket science, at night the 20-something-member band, 'ROCK@Band' busies itself with making music.

Their video has been released on YouTube ahead of India's 70th Independence Day.

The patriotic video, made mostly in Malayalam, talks about building a new India and putting an end to violence. It also seeks to boost the morale of their fellows at ISRO who are preparing for Chandrayaan-2, scheduled for launch early next year. The video inculcates an animation of the tricolour being placed on the moon as well.

It took the scientists 18 months to shoot the video where they spent Rs. 10,000 from their own pockets. The project is fully supported by the Space Engineers Association (SEA), reports NDTV.

The entire video was shot on the Arabian Sea coast and came about as a part of the recreational activities supported by the SEA.

"Cadila Healthcare: How billionaire father-son duo turned family firm into world beater, Health News, ET HealthWorld","If the stock market is any guide, Sharvil Patel has just inherited one of the top generic drug manufacturers in the world. Now, he just has to figure out how to keep it that way.Even as the copycat drug business reeled from increased regulatory scrutiny, withering competition in the US, or some combination of the two, his family’s Cadila Healthcare Ltd. seemed to have things worked out.Under Patel’s father, Pankaj, the Indian drugmaker had a major plant cleared of US Food and Drug Administration sanctions - a feat that many of its compatriots have struggled to pull off - clearing the way for its US product pipeline to finally start flowing. In the first half of this year, Cadila’s stock delivered returns of almost 50 per cent, making it the best among generic drugmakers worldwide with a market value of more than $1 billion.Cadila has given up a chunk of those gains in recent days as quarterly results from across the industry show US price pressures have only increased. But the Patels say their new products can over time offset that deterioration because many of them will face less competition, either because of exclusivity agreements or the complexity of making them. And besides, with three generations in the generic drug business, they’ve seen hard times before.""That’s the beauty of being in a business family - since you’re born you are seeing it,"" Sharvil Patel, who recently took over as managing director, said sitting next to his father at the company’s 10-story headquarters. ""You see it with his relationship with his father, my grandfather, you see it when you come to work.""Cadila reports first-quarter results tomorrow.Analysts have revised their estimates for its first quarter down amid weak results across the industry, Bloomberg data show. While the average estimate still projects revenue rising 11 per cent, net income is now forecast to shrink about 3 per cent. On Wednesday, Cadila’s stock dropped about 8 per cent as the Indian generics sector tumbled after a subsidiary of the country’s biggest drugmaker, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., reported a decline in sales.Pankaj Patel says price erosion on Cadila’s portfolio of older products in the US is now in the low double digits, compared to the high single-digit estimate he gave on a conference call only last quarter.But the Patels also expect to benefit from sales of new products. Cadila got a particularly big boost in June when it announced that because it had been first to file, the FDA had awarded it six months of exclusivity to sell a generic version of Shire PLC’s $1.1 billion ulcer drug, Lialda, in the USThis fiscal year, they plan to launch three generic drugs delivered transdermally, often through adhesive patches, a tricky technology that commands higher margins because of its difficulty to copy. That’s part of about 40 generic drug applications the company has before the FDA, any of which they say could be approved this year.""It’s the largest pipeline in the landscape among the domestic players,"" said Nitin Agarwal, a Mumbai-based pharma analyst with IDFC Securities Ltd. ""They picked the right products and have done a good job of executing those products.""Founded when Pankaj Patel’s father, Ramanbhai, left his academic job at a local school of pharmacy in 1952, the firm now has a market value of almost $8 billion and annual revenue of about $1.4 billion. Though Pankaj Patel is one of India’s richest people, they still keep to the Indian tradition for all generations to live together in the family house, the latest additions being Sharvil’s two young children.That arrangement made another family tradition, no talking about work at home, all the more important more than a year ago as Cadila found itself saddled with a US sanction blocking new products from its main plant.Like the company’s larger Indian rivals, Sun and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., a 2015 FDA inspection found manufacturing shortfalls at Cadila’s key Moraiya factory about 30 kilometers outside Ahmedabad.Re-inspections at Sun’s Halol factory and at facilities belonging to Dr. Reddy’s produced new lists of issues that left their warning letters in place, though Sun did have some success with US regulators this year getting an import ban lifted on another Indian plant acquired in 2015.While the Patels undertook many of the same steps of simplifying and automating their manufacturing processes as their Indian peers, they say cultural changes were just as important.That meant big changes like erecting a firewall between the manufacturing and marketing teams so workers in the factories don’t feel pressured to sacrifice quality to meet commercial deadlines. And there were the smaller things like producing videos on quality issues that play on a loop in factory canteens, or running daily quizzes on quality care complete with prizes. Ultimately, a re-inspection saw the Moraiya warning letter lifted.The Patels are also taking steps to ensure their factories don’t run afoul of the FDA again by setting up a unit to collect forms the FDA publishes for all its global inspections so they can analyze whether potential problems noticed at other companies could appear at a Cadila factory.Last month 64-year old Pankaj Patel announced his more than 20-years running the company were over, handing the reins to his son. He will now focus on broader strategic questions as he steps back into the role of chairman to let his son run the company’s day-to-day operations as managing director.""I think it is right for management and senior people to hand over the baton to the next generation,"" the elder Patel said, ""You lead the organization by example."""
"Zydus Pharmaceuticals: Zydus settles patent case over Aptalis' drug Canasa, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: Zydus group firm Cadila Healthcare on Monday said patent litigation relating to Aptalis' drug Canasa used for treatment of ulcerative colitis has been settled.

As a result of the settlement, the company's ""US subsidiary, Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc, will be able to market its generic version of Canasa in the United States beginning on June 13, 2019, or earlier under certain circumstances,"" Cadila Healthcare said in a statement.

Zydus Cadila had earlier received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to market its generic version of Canasa (mesalamine suppository 1 g), it added.

Canasa is indicated to treat mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

The company's product will be produced at the group's topical plant at Ahmedabad, Cadila Healthcare said.

Shares of Cadila Healthcare, the listed entity of the group, were trading at Rs 480.70 per scrip in the afternoon trade on BSE, down 0.47 per cent from its previous close."

The Google Pixel 2 Will Do Certain Things When You Hold It In Your Hand And Squeeze It Hard,"With recent leaks, we’ve seen for sure that the Pixel 2’s display won’t be nearly as fancy as the larger Pixel 2 XL. However, FCC filings from HTC revealed a few other intriguing features from the smaller flagship device to come out from Google.

By the looks of things, HTC is bringing over is “squeeze” mechanic from the U11, which let the phone perform specific functions when you applied pressure to its side edges. In the Pixel 2, it’s being called ‘active Edge’, with a sample screenshot included in the filing showing that the default function is to activate the Google Assistant.

A few other details have also emerged, like the fact that the Pixel 2 is definitely being manufactured by HTC, though the Pixel 2 XL is being rumoured to come from LG. Last year, both the Pixel and Pixel XL were HTC-manufactured

Since the timing of this and last year’s FCC filing coincides, it seems to indicate Google’s latest flagships will only arrive sometime in October. Fingers crossed that there are no unfortunate delays."
How Indian business dealt with Partition,"Prakash Tandon remembered August 15, 1947 as a fine day. “Bombay was happy and festive, as I had never seen it before,” he recalled in his autobiography, Beyond Punjab.

The monsoon had abated and the city was decked up with the new tricolour which “fluttered in millions, from every window, lamp post, tree, tram, bus and car. Everyone was out in the streets, gay, happy, confident… The next day, Mountbatten drove from the Santa Cruz Airport into the city, the first and last Englishman to receive a hero’s welcome in Bombay.”

Personally too Tandon had every reason to be optimistic. He was a young man, British trained, but now working in a multinational, Unilever, where he had been hired as the first Indian manager. Unlike the hidebound old British companies Unilever had early recognised the need to Indianise management.

The process had not been entirely easy, especially for a proud Punjabi like Tandon, but he had adapted and done well and was now handling sales for Dalda, one of their top products. Informally he’d been told that his future with the company was bright (he was ultimately to become the first Indian chairman).

Yet there were shadows. Tandon knew his father, who still lived in their home city of Gujrat in West Punjab would probably have to be evacuated soon. The old man didn’t want to move, but his Pathan neighbours were worried about his safety.

There had also been his odd encounter with a newspaper editor from Poona. The man had probably come to ask for Dalda ads for his paper, but when they met he had harangued Tandon about the wrongs committed to Hindus, assuming that as a Punjabi Hindu he would sympathise. “Words poured from his like a torrent. He was a small man, muscular and trim, with short cropped hair and intense dark eyes that shone with sad anger.” Months later, on January 30th, Tandon heard his name again – his name was Nathuram Godse and he had just assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.

By then the dam had broken. Tandon had got his father out safely, but was deep in the problems of his Dalda wholesalers: “Daily I received pathetic letters from their friends and relations, wondering if I knew what had happened to them. I spread the word as well as I could that on crossing over they should contact us, and we would do all we could to help; they should rest assured that they would be provided with jobs as soon as they had recovered enough. I made the same offer to our Muslim wholesalers who had moved or were hesitating. I would help with the exchange of their business, the premises, their houses and furniture, and even their Dalda delivery trucks, the horse carts and hand carts.”

In retrospect, he writes sadly, “about the only cheerful day that year was the fifteenth of August…”

Tandon’s memoirs offer a rare insight into an aspect of Partition that has received little attention: how it affected Indian companies. This pales in comparison, of course, with the political manoeuvring and chaos that both precipitated Partition and resulted from it, the bureaucratic nightmare of effecting the transition, the military nightmare of containing the violence and, above all, the human anguish of the millions displaced.

Yet the business impact seems unlikely to have been low. We are talking, after all, of companies losing large chunks of their field of operation, possible sources of raw materials and markets, and not least, the human issues that Tandon was swamped with, of employees, dealers and, in a few cases, senior managers who abruptly had to move. How did Indian companies cope?

As it happens one part of the answer is that many companies really did not have much at stake. G.D.Birla is quoted, in Dwijendra Tripathi’s Oxford History of Indian Business, from prior to Partition, enumerating how few business enterprises were likely to fall in probably Pakistani territory: “nine cotton mills out of 289, ten sugar mills out of 166, three cement plants, and none of the jute mills, steel mills, or paper mills numbering 108, 148 and sixteen respectively.” Birla’s aim was to remind Pakistan’s politicians how much they would lose by Partition, yet the same figures could be interpreted in precisely the opposite way.

For many Muslim businessmen, this lack of industrial development in Muslim majority areas and the relatively few Muslim industrialists (most were traders) was proof that they could not prosper in a Hindu dominated business environment.

Jinnah encouraged this sentiment by actively courting Muslim businessmen – he himself was from a family of Kathiawari merchants – and by 1940, notes Tripathi, men like Mirza Ahmed Ispahani and Sir Adamjee Dawood of Calcutta, Sir Sultan Chinoy, S.M.Jamail and Habib Rahimtoola of Bombay, Yusuf Haroon and Haroon G.Allama of Karachi and Nasir A.Shaikh and Martib Ali Shah of Lahore were solidly behind the Muslim League – and so were their not inconsiderable financial resources.

With many Hindu businessmen like Birla close to Gandhi, if not exactly the Congress (and the Gujarati business community was close to Sardar Patel), this confrontation was evident. Tripathi argues that whatever Birla might have been saying in public, in private he seems to have concluded that a division was inevitable, perhaps even desirable, though he was clearly thinking in terms of a federation rather than two entirely separate countries: “As early as 11 January 1938, almost around the time as Jinnah began to voice his demand… Birla wrote to Gandhi: ‘I wonder why it should not be possible to have two federations, one of the Muslims and another of Hindus… I fear if anything is going to check our progress, it is the Hindu-Muslim question…’“

Birla was careful to keep his thoughts to just a few, but his fellow industrialist Ramkrishna Dalmia openly supported the Pakistan proposal: “Dalmia claimed that he was the ‘first Hindu’ to back Jinnah’s demand,” writes Tripathi.

Such views probably came from a clear-eyed business judgement of the state of Hindu-Muslim relations and how they might hold back national development. Birla wrote to Nehru: “If in a partnership business, one partner is discontented, he would be given the right to separate himself from the erstwhile common concern…”

It should be stressed that Birla was far from advocating Partition – the same letter goes on to hope that Muslims if given the offer would reject it – but he clearly saw the folly of putting one’s head in the sand and pretending the option should never be considered.

Birla’s views should not be taken as representative of the Hindu side. In fact Tripathi suggests that the real divide was not so much on religion, as between those who lived in areas like Punjab where there were long traditions of Hindus and Muslims working together and those who did not. Businessmen like Lala Shri Ram fell in the first category and were passionately against Partition, perhaps partly because they foresaw the business loss, but also because “undivided India was too sacred a concept for them to admit of the idea of bisection.”

A few Muslim businessmen also fell into this category – M.M.Hasham Premji was one who, as his son Azim Premji has recalled, turned down Jinnah’s offer of a senior ministerial position to stay in India. One who did take up the offer was Ghulam Mohammed, who quit Mahindra and Mohammed, the company he had started with the two Mahindra brothers. Mohammed went to Pakistan to become its first Finance Minister and then had a controversial tenure as Governor-General. The Mahindras renamed themselves Mahindra and Mahindra.

Some were also hedging their bets: hoping to run businesses in both countries while continuing to stay in their homes in India. From today’s perspective of an enforced Indo-Pakistani divide this might seem naive, but its worth remembering that few at that time foresaw how divided the countries would turn out to be.

The riots of Partition forced most of these families to flee, but some did in fact stay in India well into the Sixties. And when they left for Pakistan it was probably as much because at that time, with the monsoons failing in 1966 and Mrs.Gandhi increasing her socialist rhetoric, Pakistan probably seemed a better business bet than India.

Tripathi’s second category consisted of businessmen who both faced less business risk from Partition and had a less romantic view of India: “Though not fanatic, businessmen in this category looked upon the Muslim community as an encumbrance rather than a partner in the nation-building task. G.D.Birla for instance, though more magnanimous towards the Muslims than his brother B.M.Birla, who hated them from the core of his heart could not always hide his distrust for them…”

For this category Partition was the practical solution, and even where they faced uncertainty, for example in the jute business, where the growing areas were in East Pakistan and the mills in the West, they had usually diversified to the point where they could absorb any loss (and would also, presumably, have counted on continuing to trade with East Pakistan for raw jute).

A third category comprised businessmen like the Parsis, who stayed aloof from Hindu-Muslim feuding but occasionally, as with Sir Ardeshir Dalal, an associate of the Tata’s, advanced economic arguments against Partition; they were ignored.

The foreign companies were also neutral in their response. The few pessimistic businessmen like the Sassoons sold out and left. The responses of those that remained ranged from a combination of cynicism and apathy on the part of the old, fading British managing agencies, to a pragmatic hope of multinationals like Unilever for new markets in a new country.

Talk of Congress socialism did cause alarm, but they had faith in the pragmatic views of leaders like Sardar Patel. In any case they were all flush with money after World War II, when most Indian companies made profits supplying the Allied effort, and could afford to wait.

In the meantime, as Tandon noted rather bitterly, they disapproved of getting too involved with the problems: “My English colleagues in charge of the other marketing divisions, maybe partly because British sympathy at this time seemed to lie more with the other side, thought I was going to unnecessary lengths.”

Partition’s real business impact then was less on established companies as on the smaller businessmen who did not have the resources to ride it out, or who left it too late. These are the stories we have all heard, of entrepreneurs who arrived with one suitcase and unpacked business success stories from them.

A few have become almost legendary like the Sindhis of Mumbai’s USA (Ulhasnagar Sindhi Association) or Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi from whose tandoors eventually a thousand butter chickens would bloom. Such stories should not conceal the struggle behind them, or the many who didn’t succeed, but they do point to one fact – Partition did offer as business opportunities, for those willing to take them.

This stemmed from its nature – unlike a one-sided expulsion, as would happen with the Indians in East Africa, Partition was an exchange, however violent, and at the lower levels of business at least there was a chance for similar entrepreneurs from each side to step in.

Penderel Moon, a British civil servant who had taken up employment with Bhawalpur, a Princely State that fell on Pakistan’s side, noted this his memoir Divide and Quit which provides a gripping view of Partition at ground level: “It was a marvel to me how the incoming Muslims who settled in these urban areas – tradesmen, artisans and ordinary labourers – succeeded from the very start in standing on their own legs with very little help of any kind from the Government.”

Moon noted how many of the refugees on the very same day of their arrival went off to the nearest large town of Multan where they set out their good, if they had any, to sell. Others set themselves up as barbers, cobblers, tailors, dhobis. “It puzzled me how so many more or less destitute people could so quickly find a livelihood by taking in each other’s washing. The explanation is that in these colony towns the interchange of goods and services amongst the refugees themselves managed to base itself almost at once on the solid foundation of the economic service to the surrounding countryside.”

Moon aptly dubbed these refugee settlements as ‘mandi towns’ which played an essential role in the local area, “and in performance of these functions the incoming Muslims were able to step fairly easily into the shoes of the departed Hindus.”

The same process was happening on the Indian side of the border, in a display of entrepreneurial capitalism that would have made Adam Smith proud. Farmers were forced to wait for the cumbersome process of land allocation from the government, and in any case had to start the whole cultivation cycle from scratch; entrepreneurs could swing straight into business.

One of the unprepossessing truths of Partition is that some people did rather well from it. A friend once told me how his grandfather had built a fortune in the food business in Bombay: “He used to say quite proudly that he made his money selling food at high prices to refugees and also employing them to work for him at a pittance.” Not surprisingly, my friend added, his grandfather never left home without a dagger to defend himself!

Mostly though the stories of Partition’s businessmen are more positive. The trauma seemed to bring out the best in the most unlikely people, like the bureaucrats who oversaw it all. Early in India After Gandhi, his gripping history of modern India, Ramachandra Guha pays them a tribute: “There was pain and suffering in the extinguishing of the princely order and there was pain and suffering in the resettlement of the refugees. Yet both tasks were, in the end, accomplished. Notably the actors in this complicated and tortuous process were all Indian. This, at least on the British side, was completely unanticipated.”

Close to eight million refugees came to India, larger than the population of small European countries like Austria and Norway, but they were resettled, and in urban areas at least recovered with amazing rapidity. This was the answer to British gibes about how Indians could never manage on their own.

Guha gives the example of Faridabad, a settlement build brand new for the refugees. A Gandhian group, the Indian Cooperative Union, headed by Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, quickly got to work here, organising self-help groups, shops and small production units. To power these, a diesel plant was found, all the way in Calcutta, where it had landed as part of German war reparations.

Since no one wanted it there, the ICU requisitioned it, and even managed to find the German engineer who had built it and persuaded him to come to India and set it up. He came, writes Guha, “but to his dismay no cranes were available to erect it. So he trained the Faridabad men to operate 15-tonne jack screws, which helped raise the equipment inch-by-inch. In ten months the plant was ready.

In April 1951 Nehru himself came to commission it, and as he ‘pressed the button, the lights came on and lifted the spirits of all in Faridabad. The township had power in its hands to fashion its industrial future.’”

Prakash Tandon, from Beyond Punjab I had not realised the bond we had built with our Dalda wholesalers till a tragi-comic incident occurred. Our wholesaler in Sialkot wrote to me that all was going up in flames and they must leave. He had sent his family to this side for safety, but a letter had just arrived that a Dalda consignment was on its way. He would remain behind to honour the documents, pay in the needed amount into the bank, and then leave, but would I in the meantime try to stop the railway wagon with the Dalda at Amritsar before it crossed the border. He was anxious for the documents not to be dishonoured, and equally that a good twenty tons of Dalda should not reach the other side. I managed to stop the wagon at Amritsar, where the wholesaler reached a few days later. Contrary to all practice, I told him that he could receive delivery and sell the Dalda at Amritsar itself, which was not his territory, in any way he liked. I heard subsequently that, homeless and penniless, he had sold the Dalda tin by tin in the bazaar at Amritsar at whatever price he could get and begun life again with several thousand rupees in hand. Years later when I met him at Meerut, where we had settled him, he embraced me in the Punjabi fashion of greeting a long lost friend, with his arms around my shoulders, and said: ‘That was the only time we both disobeyed the “system”. I literally suctioned every tin while telling the people openly what had happened, and, as there had been no Dalda in Amritsar for weeks, they cheerfully paid me whatever I wanted. They really gave me a new start in life. And,’ he added softly so that the others did not hear, ‘I took your name with each tin.’

"Breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women a year by 2020, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Dubai: Lack of early diagnosis of breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women in a year by 2020, says a study, one of whose researchers is of Indian origin.One of the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer among women in India, breast cancer claimed 70,218 lives in 2012, the study published in the Journal of Business Research showed.It also revealed that the average age of death from the disease has shifted from 50 years to 30 years.The magnitude of the problem is enormous and has major policy implications for the Indian government, said Vijay Pereira, Associate Dean (Research) at the University of Wollongong in Dubai.Pereira said there were complex challenges at national, state and community levels.""What is clear is that healthcare at state-level must transform to deliver quality care and awareness,"" Pereira said.The researchers found lack of awareness about self-examination and cultural barriers played a major role. Women sought medical care extremely late.Women do not access health services and are reluctant to consult male doctors, neglecting their health due to family obligations. They are over-dependent on other family members. All of these cause delay in diagnosis, the researchers said.Thus, educating Indian men about the significance of early diagnosis for breast cancer, could be key to halt the disease which is turning into an epidemic, the researchers suggested.""India is still a patriarchal society. Although women are now in responsible jobs and earning for their families, it's the men who are the head of the household,"" said Judith Fletcher-Brown, from the University of Portsmouth in England.Even educated professional women do not discuss private matters about their bodies with their husbands, fathers or brothers. So it's essential to direct health messages towards men, Fletcher-Brown said.Rapid economic development and greater urbanisation are also responsible for the rise in breast cancer rates, the researchers noted.Besides, women tend to have children at a later age and breast feeding is less, which increases their chances of developing the disease.Working women in urban India often have a more western diet leading to obesity. That also increases the risk.The study said community health nurses had the greatest impact in raising awareness of early breast cancer symptoms.In addition, schools and media were also found to be the good channels through which awareness could be raised in young women."

"cerc: Transmission preference for wind projects, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Industry executives called the development a rare official intervention in a regulatory matter. Officials said the government is keen to ensure wind and solar energy projects are implemented quickly post auction.

NEW DELHI: The government has told the central power regulator that winners of wind project auctions be given preference in transmission facilities, a move that should help achieve the target of 60,000 MW of wind energy by 2022 but has upset firms that did not win projects.Anand Kumar, secretary at the ministry of new and renewable energy, has communicated this to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission days before the quasi-judicial body hears the matter.Industry executives called the development a rare official intervention in a regulatory matter. Officials said the government is keen to ensure wind and solar energy projects are implemented quickly post auction. “The renewable energy secretary has written this was essential to ensure timely completion of the wind projects and achieving the government’s target to add 60 GW of wind capacity by 2022,” one of them said.

"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.“The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,” Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. “The only solution is our focus on improving execution.“India’s biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers’ pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma’s Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India’s pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun’s consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun’s profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun’s U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG’s blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.“Going forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters” as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. “The U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.”As prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company’s leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."
"Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals & Gautam Gambhir pledge to spread awareness for organ donation, Health News, ET HealthWorld","12th August 2017, New Delhi: Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals and Ace Cricketer Gautam Gambhir came together on the occasion of World Organ Donation Day to encourage people to take a pledge for donating organs to save countless lives. This public awareness initiative aims to bring together information and awareness on the issue of organ donation. Gift A Life ” is a unique initiative of the Apollo Institute of Transplants to encourage people to pledge their organs and save countless lives in the process. This can be done by simply signing up on the web site – www.giftalife.org.Gautam Gambhir also encouraged people to pledge for their organ donation, as the same can save many lives. The gathering also witnessed presence of organ recipients who were given a new lease of life through cadaver organ donations. Dr Anupam Sibal , Group Medical Director and Senior Paediatric Gastroenterologist, Apollo Hospitals Group said “We are thankful to Gautam Gambhir for supporting us in this Noble cause. Each year, thousands of people die while waiting for an organ transplant. There is a shortage of organs, and the gap between the number of organs donated and the number of people waiting for a transplant is getting larger. One of the major reasons is lack of awareness about Organ Donation in India at large where majority of population is still shackled with myths and religious beliefs regarding Organ Donation in India, hence there is an urgent need of address this issue and create sound awareness on organ donation in India.All the staff of Indraprastha Apollo Hospital also took pledge to donate organs along with Gautam Gambhir. They also urged everyone to make the decision to donate their organ. Gautam Gambhir also appealed to the media to create awareness about organ donation and saving precious lives.Every year almost 5 lakh people die in India due to non-availability of organs. Nearly 1.5 lakh people are in dire need of kidney but only 3 thousand of them receive one. Vital organs such as the heart, pancreas, liver, kidneys and lungs can be transplanted to those whose organs are failing. A single donor can save eight lives by donating the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas and small bowel."

Infosys’s driverless golf cart versus Google’s autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google’s autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, which “rather than simply copy Glaxo’s migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).” The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural — software and hardware — support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."

"Slash IUC, licence and spectrum fees","The telecom regulator’s proposal to bring down the Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) promises to both increase bad blood in the telecom sector and worsen its finances. The government must intervene to protect the consumer and the sector’s viability. IUC is the charge that an operator, in whose network a call originates, pays the operator in whose network the call terminates, for the service of receiving the call from the originating network and carrying it on to the called party. As compared to the old 2G days, the network usage per call is lower now when calls are converted into discrete packets that are sent over the network interspersed with packets of other calls and assorted data. This is the rationale for trimming IUC.

However, the cost of the network has gone up because of higher spectrum costs. A lower IUC would lower the cost of a call for the consumer, who, ultimately, bears the cost of the call. However, it would lower revenue for telcos. Now, for large networks such as Bharti and Vodafone, what one pays the other as IUC gets more or less offset by what it receives from it as IUC, since they have roughly the same number of subscribers.

Smaller networks pay out more as IUC to larger networks than what they receive as IUC. Apart from the decline in network usage due to packetisation of calls, two factors favour lower IUC. One, voice accounts for an ever-declining share of telecom revenue globally and net IUC receipts form a tiny fraction of this dwindling part of the business. Two, high IUC is anti-competitive, favouring incumbents against new entrants.

Telecom finances in the country have turned parlous with the aggressive entry of Reliance Jio and the government’s insistence on high spectrum fees, extracted by auctioning tiny chunks of spectrum. To prevent telco loans from adding to the banks’ growing mountain of bad debt, the government must intervene. It can lower the steep revenue shares it collects as licence and spectrum usage fees, still pegged at the high rates set when spectrum was allotted along with the licence without separate upfront payment."
"The Ancient Greeks Built An Accurate, Eclipse-Predicting Computer More Than 2000 Years Ago!","You may think of computer as a modern invention, and indeed they are, but the concept itself is older than you can imagine. In fact, even as we’re watching the solar eclipse this month because we’ve predicted when they occur, the ancient Greeks had a computer that could do the same.

The ancient Greeks' Antikythera Mechanism

Called the Antikythera mechanism, it was discovered in 1900 when a group of sponge divers took shelter from a storm on the island of Antikythera. The divers unearthed a shipwreck approximately 2,000 years old, where an archeological expedition later uncovered the primitive computer.

The mechanism consisted of a device the size of a shoebox and covered with dials, filled with about 30 gears made of bronze. Though it was discovered in pieces, researchers eventually realised it was a computational mechanism that let the Greeks pinpoint eclipses and other astronomical phenomenon.

Instructions on the box showed that the crank could be turned to calculate the positions of the stars during future solar and lunar eclipses, allowing the user to predict at what time they would occur. Additionally, it was a sophisticated enough machine to even figure out the kind of eclipse that would occur (ie whether partial or total) to a precise degree.

It’s still unclear what the significance of eclipses were in Greek culture, though it’s believed they were omens of some sort."
Recruitment drive: What the government needs to do to create millions of jobs 😜,"Two scholarly-looking people in serious conversation.

1st scholar: The minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkariji, has very rightly said that driverless automobiles, like the Tesla, will not be allowed in India. As Nitinji pointed out, driverless cars would make millions of drivers lose their jobs.

2nd scholar: Too true, bro. All us PhDs and research scientists who drive taxis, and trucks, and buses, and private cars, and sarkari cars would be jobless and out on the street.

1st scholar: Yeah. Because the country’s job market being what it is, driving taxis and trucks, and buses, etc are the only jobs we can get. And the competition is getting fiercer and fiercer.

2nd scholar: You’re telling me. Why, just the other day there was this guy, a chit of a double MA from JNU or someplace, asking if he could get a job as a driver. I told him that at this rate mere graduates, BScs, and BComs, and BAs would start lining up too, bringing our standards down.

1st scholar: Well said. But banning driverless cars to give people employment isn’t good enough. We should ban all wheels.

2nd scholar: You mean disinvent the wheel?

1st scholar: Exactly. The wheel has been the single biggest invention to create joblessness. Before the wheel, people had to go in palkis, or palanquins, in which four people were needed to carry one person. Eight people, if the person was very large, as some of these mantrijis and sethjis can be.

2nd scholar: I see what you mean. With the invention of the wheel, one person driving a bullock cart, or car, or taxi, or bus, could carry lots of people. So if we scrapped all wheels and brought back palkis we’d create millions more jobs for guys like us. Great idea! Shall we go tell Nitinji about it? I’ll go get my malik’s car.

1st scholar: Car, shar. We must start as we mean to go on. Go get a palki and three other chaps to carry me as the passenger.

2nd scholar: Uh, oh. I knew there had to be a catch somewhere…."
Facebook & Instagram Will Be Rolling Out Tweaked Newsfeed & Comments To Make Them Easier To Use,"Facebook is has announced a redesign for its two most popular apps, Facebook and Instagram. The two are both receiving changes to make them more visually appealing, as well as easier to comprehend at first glance.

Facebook is losing the blue header and trims across most of the app’s interface, which they’re saying will make it easier to navigate and more consistent. Additionally, the comments are being changed to look more like chats in Messenger. Instead simple line breaks, each comment will get its own gray bubble

Even profile pictures are changing from squares to circles, more like how Twitter’s design is. Lastly, the Like, Comment, and Share buttons have been made slightly larger, to make them easier to click, and are being decolorised save for an outline.

Instagram meanwhile, has its redesign focused on comments. Comments on each image will now be organised into threads, just like on the Facebook app. That way, differentiating between a new comment and a reply to someone else’s comment should be easier."
"GST: Arun Jaitley indicates scope for rationalisation of rates under GST, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said there is scope to rationalise goods and services tax ( GST ) and rolling 12 per cent and 18 per cent slabs into one as implementation of the country’s most comprehensive indirect tax reforms progresses.“I do concede that as it (GST) moves forward, there will be scope for rationalising the rates. There, probably, will be scope that the two standard rates of 12% and 18 per cent, after some time, could be clubbed into one. That is a fair possibility and a suggestion,” Jaitley said replying to debate on the two bills related to GST in J&K.Central Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir ) Bill, 2017 and the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir) Bill, 2017 were later passed by a voice vote.The current GST has 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent rates, plus one for luxury and sin goods. There are some that are zero rated, or nil rate.Jaitley said if the two rates had been merged into one its inflationary effect would have been high. “Therefore, we did not get into this exercise,” he said responding to criticism over several slabs in the GST rates. Jaitley said there can’t be a single slab in a country like India which has a large population below poverty line (BPL). As an example, he said a hawai chappal and a BMW car could not be taxed at the same rate.The finance minister also wondered why certain manufacturers have hiked the prices of small hybrid cars even though the duty has been reduced. He added that a hybrid car is priced higher and those who buy it can afford to pay a little more. He said one of the GST objectives is to assist domestic products and the government does not want to just allow cheap foreign products to come in.Jaitley said the passage of the bills will ensure greater economic integration of the state with rest of the country. He asserted that special status of Jammu and Kashmir was “never meant to create economic impediment” as he maintained that the GST is in the larger interest of traders and consumers of J&K.Jaitley said it was a positive step that J&K has been integrated with GST and the dream of one tax regime is now met, hitting out at the Congress party for its reported claim that GST would infringe upon the special status of J&K.“If they (J&K) didn’t integrate, the traders would not have got input credit and the tax on final products would have been higher... That would have made products costlier and consumers would have to pay more,” the minister said. “J&K is a consumer state and GST being a destinationbased tax, revenues of the state would increase.” He added that if GST was not put in place in J&K, then customers would prefer to buy products like cars and refrigerators from outside the state."

"Now, energy efficient appliances to be available at petrol pumps, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: In a bid to boost the government’s Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) scheme, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) under the ministry of power today signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Oil Marketing Companies ( OMCs ) for distribution of energy-efficient appliances across petrol pumps.According to the agreement, the distribution of energy efficient appliances including LED bulbs , LED tube lights and energy efficient fans will be taken up at select retail outlets of Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ), Hindustan Petroleum Corp ( HPCL ) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation ( BPCL ).“Both UJALA & Ujjwala are clean energy movements aimed at making lives of poor easier. The MoU between EESL and OMCs is a partnership for the smart people who want to save electricity,” Power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal said at the signing ceremony.Goyal also added India would be the first country in the world to shift 100 per cent to using LEDs for its lighting needs by 2019. As part of the pact, EESL will make the entire upfront investment for ensuring availability of the products at the outlets and no upfront capital cost will be borne by OMCs barring manpower and space, EESL said in a statement.“The consumer can purchase high quality 9 Watt LED bulbs for Rs 70, 20 Watt LED tube light for Rs 220 and five-star rated ceiling fans for Rs 1,200,” EESL said. The power ministry aims to use the vast network of the three-public sector OMCs of over 54,500 petrol Retail Outlets (ROs) throughout India.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme . This has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW, the statement added.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."
"Quality drug test: Bad Medicine! Pfizer, Cipla, DRL, other 63 drug firms fail quality test, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Pfizer Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Cipla are among 66 drug makers that have some of their products failing quality tests carried out by the country’s drug regulator.Samples tested from these companies were found to be not of standard quality during a drug survey carried out through the National Institute of Biologicals over two years, according to a Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation ( CDSCO ) notification posted on its website. At least five samples of drugs from these companies failed the tests during the 2014-2016 survey, CDSCO said.According to the notification, 25 samples by Pfizer, nine each by Dr Reddy’s and Alembic, seven by Cipla and six by Zydus Healthcare were found to be not of standard quality. It didn’t specify the drugs that failed the tests.A Pfizer spokesperson said the company was unable to confirm authenticity of products picked for the tests, or the evidence of the alleged deficiencies “as the due process of providing a sealed market sample was not followed"".Samples of the company's products were found to be fully compliant with all required specifications during tests at independent FDA-approved laboratories, the spokesperson said, adding that this was communicated to the regulatory authorities and no further action was recommended.“Pfizer places the utmost importance on product quality and patient safety. All Pfizer products released in the market meet every national and international testing specification,” the spokesperson said.Other companies ET contacted for comment did not respond until press time Friday.The survey, conducted to check the proportion of substandard drugs in the country, had tested 47,012 samples from 1,719 manufacturing units, CDSCO said. Around 3.16% of these samples were found to be not of standard quality, while 0.02% were spurious.India expects to bring down the proportion of its substandard drugs to 2% over the next three years to match global standards. The country’s drug regulator has been engaged in risk-based inspections of over 250 manufacturing plants as part of its efforts to achieve this goal."

India @70: Why this Independence Day deserves to be celebrated in a big way,"India’s independence was the harbinger of a wave of decolonisation, which by the mid-1970s, had brought the age of European empires to an end across Asia and Africa. Since then, the erstwhile Jewel in the Crown has stood out among the cohort of countries that became independent since the middle of the last century. For all of India’s myriad flaws, on the 70th anniversary of our independence, a little bit of triumphalism is surely in order. The big picture is that India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy and a rambunctious and reasonably successful democracy.

Seven decades of institutional stability — the same Constitution, parliamentary democracy, regular transfers of powers, and an independent, if deeply flawed, judiciary — is nothing to be scoffed at. All success is relative.

Among large countries that escaped the shackles of colonialism around the same time, Egypt is a military dictatorship, while Indonesia has seen an unsteady transition to democracy after the autocracy of the Suharto years. Brazil has had several Constitutions in its nearly two centuries of independent existence. The contrast with Pakistan, where no democratically elected Prime Minister has completed a full term, is obvious.

The benefits of institutional stability are obvious, and we would urge the utmost caution in attempting to tamper with long-standing arrangements, such as the special status of Kashmir. Or, for that matter, sudden attempts to introduce rules that appear to make it impossible to lawfully consume beef in a diverse country.

This stability has enabled the ship of state to change course, notably when it comes to the economy. In 1991, India pivoted to a market economy abandoning a stated commitment to socialism, a transition that continues today, more than a quarter-century later.

A deepening of social and economic freedom, we would argue, must be the national project for the decades to come. On the social front, the criminalisation of consensual gay sex diminishes the country’s status as a great democracy. As do attempts to ban books or shut down discussions, both by governments and mobs. In the looming contest with China, India’s soft power is a source of strength that needs all the help it can get.

Greater freedom for business has resulted in the creation of a large and vibrant private sector. India is today a member of the G20, largely due to the success of private sector-led development since 1991.

The coming to power of the second BJP government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, appears to be bringing about a change of course almost as consequential as the 1991reforms. It’s hard to argue, that the government is not carrying out big-bang reforms. Besides introducing the goods and services tax (GST) and a bankruptcy code, it has quietly moved to eliminate both the cooking gas and kerosene subsidies.

The war on corruption (essentially tax evasion) has been ferocious. It involves investigative agencies such as the CBI and ED, regulators such as Sebi, structural reforms such as GST and, more controversially, demonetisation. Few can cavil at this. Greater tax compliance is a significant structural reform and history shows that countries whose citizens dodge taxes less tend to do better in the long run.

Less unaccounted-for money would mean stronger balance sheets and, hence, more capacity to invest. Bad Indian habits, such as paying for real estate and luxury good with cash, deserve to disappear. But the government must also take care to ensure that the tax inspector does not get overmighty. The crackdown on tax evasion —as distinct from legal tax avoidance — must be accompanied by vigorous implementation of other parts of the Prime Minister’s agenda such as ease of doing business, and reducing uncertainty by not indulging in frequent rule changes, bans and retrospective amendments.

Going forward, fixing the so-called twin balance sheet problem by way of the bankruptcy code is key to reversing a slump in investment and fixed capital formation. A worrying aspect of the Modi years is a sharp decline in the savings and investment from the 34-35% range achieved at the height of the 2004-08 boom. There is no easy solution to this.

The new bankruptcy framework is forcing some of the great and good of Indian business to confront a fundamental rule of capitalism: you will lose control of your company if you can’t service your debt. Hopefully, the cleaning up of company and bank balance sheets will lead to higher investment and growth and, concomitantly, more revenues for the social sector, which can tackle the still widespread poverty that continues to blight India’s tryst with destiny."
Bonds Of Friendship: Taipei Universiade is Taiwan’s red carpet for the world,"From August 19 to 30, Taiwan’s capital Taipei will host more than 7,700 student athletes from 153 countries for the 2017 Summer Universiade. The latter is the premier international multi-sport event for University athletes who consider it to be a stepping stone to participation in the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the Olympics. The Taipei Universiade will see the young athletes vie for laurels in 21 sports at 38 different venues. In fact, this Universiade will be the largest international sporting event in Taiwan – a big feat for this island nation of 23 million people.

But what’s even more important for Taiwan is that the Universiade is an opportunity for it to broaden its international engagements and build ties of friendship. As is well known, Taiwan has official diplomatic ties with a handful of small countries. Saddled by the historical baggage of the Chinese civil war that forced the Kuomintang to flee to Taiwan and transplant the Republic of China there, the Taiwanese today continue to navigate complicated narratives of identity and state. Add to this the fact that an overwhelming majority of countries in the world recognise only one China, which being the People’s Republic of China, and it’s easy to see why Taiwan has had to find creative ways to keep its diplomatic and strategic depth intact.

And one of the ways in which Taiwan has done that – and continues to do so – is to become a giver. It has tried its best to share its successes with the rest of the world, be it through outbound investments, manufacturing and research collaboration, or medical aid and technical assistance. Of course, all of this hasn’t been easy with China constantly pressuring Taiwan to toe its line of eventual re-unification. However, the reality is that Taiwan today is very different from China. The former has evolved into a robust multi-party democracy, while the latter has become a Communist powerhouse. Plus, the new generation in Taiwan has no real attachment with China. And having grown up in a free-thinking, democratic atmosphere, it is hard to see Taiwanese youth even consider re-unification with the mainland.

Nonetheless, Taiwan’s challenges remain as it continues to be constrained from taking part in the comity of nations as a normal country. And it’s here that Taiwan’s well-wishers need to help it. After all, Taiwan is a unique success story – a manufacturing dynamo, a beacon of democracy and a leader in cutting-edge innovation and research – that needs to be nurtured further. All Taiwan asks for is friendship and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is focussed on building long-lasting relationships rather than cost-benefit economic activities that usually determine foreign policy. Taiwan is thinking about everyone’s future and solutions to global challenges – it simply can’t afford to be selfish.

This is precisely why the Taipei Universiade is so important for Taiwan. By welcoming young people from across the world to Taiwanese shores, Taiwan wants to build ever-lasting friendships. Indian athletes too will be participating at this Universiade. It is hoped that they, along with athletes from other nations, will become bridges for their respective countries to Taiwan – the heart of Asia."
"Columbia Clinic launched at Embassy TechVillage in Bengaluru, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Bangalore: Over the last two decades there has been an alarming rise in cardiovascular disease , diabetes, hypertension, asthma and respiratory diseases and cancers in India, especially among the urban population.

"Unleashing the potential of technology in intelligent vaccine management, Health News, ET HealthWorld","ByCEO, Hilleman Laboratories , MSD Wellcome TrustIndia has come a long way since its ‘Tryst with Destiny’ 70 years ago. This especially holds true if we look at the extraordinary evolution of our healthcare environment. Today, India is known globally as the “Pharmacy of the World”. We not only create medicines for 1.3 billion Indians, we also export them in large quantities to other underdeveloped as well as developed nations of the world. India’s expertise at producing globally acclaimed medicines including vaccines has earned us the pride of being a nation which has the largest capacity for WHO prequalified vaccine manufacturing in the world.For a nation to make such remarkable progress as ours, multiple reasons come into play. One very pertinent reason is the political will of the country, as rightly put by Dr Samlee Plianbangchang Regional Director, WHO , in his advice on strengthening public health for human development. A clear example of this is our commitment to ‘Mission Indradhanush’, which aims to realise 90% basic vaccination coverage in our population by 2018. What’s more, in the BRICS Health Ministers' Meeting of 2017, the Indian Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, ç, reinstated India’s growing commitment towards healthcare. He assured that the country’s National Health Policy is completely aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals targets, with major focus on improving the country's vaccine programmes and drug security. This shows India’s absolute resolve in meeting its Millennium Development Goal (MDG).However, as with any success story, there are gaps. For a country that provides 37% (1) of the total WHO pre-qualified vaccines, India is far from achieving complete coverage in immunization within its own population. According to WHO, India has only succeeded in achieving 65% coverage in basic immunization while countries with similar or lower per capita GDP are far ahead. For instance, Brazil stands at 90% and Mexico at 88% . This is quite disappointing given that India accounts for approximately one-fourth of global deaths from vaccine preventable diseases (VPD). Besides, supply of indigenously produced, low-cost vaccines is plentiful. What makes it further distressing is the fact that even countries with low resource settings, for instance Bangladesh, have been able to achieve near full immunization coverage. Thus, it is not good news for India. Today, India has ten million under-immunized children , and a frightening 1 of every 3rd child in the country is not fully immunized under our National Immunization Program. This must change.One of the most formidable challenges that exists in the country’s healthcare system is the inefficiencies in vaccine management, mostly in logistics and temperature monitoring systems (2). Ironically our universal immunization program (UIP), which is among the world’s biggest, is largely facilitated by indigenously developed vaccines, an admirable feat. In addition, almost all the globally recommended policies for vaccine management are adopted in India, including the use of vaccine vial monitors (VVMs), the shake-test, the multi-dose vial policy (MDVP), the use of diluents and the monitoring of vaccine wastage rates. But the country’s vast population, geographical expanse combined with poor living conditions have vastly impeded the vaccine delivery system, leading to huge vaccine wastage and inadequate immunization coverage.It takes meticulous planning, strong logistics and cross-functional innovation to transport a vaccine from its manufacturing site to administration in the field. At the heart of a robust delivery system is cold chain infrastructure . Cold chains help preserve vaccines at prescribed temperatures and maintain product-specific environmental parameters including air quality levels. They are the primary source for transporting and storing vaccines, more so in tropical climate of developing countries like India. A breakdown of the cold chain system results in wastage of vaccines due to exposure to environmental conditions. Administering expired vaccines can do more harm than good and must be avoided at all costs. Thus, lack of sustained cold chain management can prove detrimental towards achieving immunization coverage .A study by the National Cold Chain & Vaccine Management Resource Centre (NCCVMRC) shows that in India there is a 25% shortage in overall cold chain capacity (National Cold Chain Assessment, 2014). There exists a glaring 200-300% scarcity in walk-in coolers (WIC) and walk-in freezers (WIF) (1) This is extremely worrying as India aims to introduce more vaccines within its UIP which is likely to further burden our crumbling systems.What the country needs at this hour is an efficient mechanism to optimise vaccine outreach and delivery. First, we need to build on our existing capacity including our technical staff by increasing their ability to handle complex vaccine environment and familiarize them with best practices in supply chain management. Second, vaccines under all conditions, need to be carefully temperature managed so that they don’t lose their potency. Third, we need efficient collection of reliable data for informed decision-making in planning for vaccine distribution, in improving supply chains, and in introducing newer vaccines in the future.Globally, and in India, newer technologies are being explored to minimise vaccine wastage. A case that needs special mention is the development of heat stable vaccines. Once fully developed, these vaccines will greatly relieve the need for cold chain, easing the logistical problems that we face today and bringing down costs (7). This also means it will be much easier to store, transport and administer vaccines across multiple geographies. Consequently, these next-generation heat stable vaccines can be delivered to the most remote corners of India, ensuring wider immunization coverage. Another great example of the use of newer technologies is the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN). In 2014, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare partnered with UNDP to design and implement an Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network which allows healthcare workers to better understand the vaccine preservation machinery. The eVIN innovation is already making an impact in our UIP and early results suggest a promising start.In short, these are exciting times for healthcare in India. The world of vaccines is showing more promise than ever. Technology and Innovation have made healthcare sustainability a real possibility of near future. And with the will to conquer and the technology in our grasp, I am confident that India will continue to surge ahead in bridging the gap of vaccine access and coverage among the most deserving of our people."
California Bill Wants To Delay School Start Time So Teens Can Catch Up On Some Sleep,"Getting groggy teens to get ready for school is always a huge task for parents. But people in California needn't fret anymore, thanks to California’s Senate Education Committee that has passed a bill to ensure opening hours not be earlier than 8:30 am for middle and high school students.

Picture for representation/Reuters

According to local media reports, the Senate Bill 328 would require all middle and high schools across to have their start times be no later than 8:30 am. The bill author, State Senator Anthony Portantino (D-La Cañada Flintridge), said his bill was based on research conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

The bill was in the Assembly Education Committee on July 12. It now awaits a hearing in the Assembly Appropriations Committee in late August or early September.

According to a study conducted by Centers for Disease Control, among 39,700 public middle, high, and combined schools in US have an average start time of 8:00 am.

The report states that adolescents who do not get enough sleep are more likely to be overweight, to engage in daily physical activity, suffer from depressive symptoms and engage in unhealthy risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking tobacco, and drug abuse.

Anthony Portantino's bill ensures that 3 million students in California’s public middle and high schools can go to school at times that gives them enough sleep time, eat healthy and then head to school.

The study suggests that when high schools start at 8:30 am or later, attendance rates and graduation rates improve."

"Achieving high end of 6.75-7.5 per cent GDP growth difficult: Economic Survey, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Achieving the high end of the 6.75-7.5 per cent growth projected previously will be difficult due to appreciation of rupee, farm loan waivers and transitionary challenges from implementing GST, the Economic Survey said today.

For the first time today, the government presented a second or a mid-year economic survey for the year 2017-18 highlighting the new factors that the economy faces since the last such exercise in February.

It also said that the scope for monetary easing was considerable and this, coupled with reform to address the twin balance sheet challenge, will help the economy achieve its full potential quicker.

""Cyclical conditions suggest that the policy rate should actually be below... the neutral rate. The conclusion is inescapable that the scope for monetary easing is considerable,"" he said.

The Economic Survey said that a number of indicators-- GDP, IIP, credit, investment and capacity utilisation, point to a deceleration in real activity since first quarter of 2016-17 and a further deceleration since the third quarter.

The first volume of the Survey in February had predicted the range of GDP growth of between 6.75-7.5 per cent, factoring in more buoyant exports, a post-demonetisation catch-up in consumption and a relaxation in monetary conditions consequent upon demonetisation.

Since then all the new factors-- real exchange rate appreciation, farm loan waivers, increasing stress to balance sheet in power, telecom, agricultural stress and transitional challenges from implementing the GST -- impart a deflationary bias to activity, the Survey said.

Since February 2017, the rupee has appreciated by about 1.5 per cent.

It said the government and the RBI have taken ""prominent steps"" to address the twin balance sheet challenge which has boosted market confidence in the short run. Also, the removal of checkposts and easing of transport constraints after Goods and Service Tax (GST) implementation can provide some short- term fillip to economic activity.

The Survey said that the balance of risk to achieving the 6.75-7.5 per cent growth has shifted to the downside.

""The balance of probabilities has changed accordingly, with outcomes closer to the upper end having much less weight tha previously,"" it added."

Moral Modi and the logic of you all embracing a Kashmiri each,"Even his strongest critics give this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi: he is a very strong communicator. His election campaign speeches can be warlike, his foreign policy speeches are praised for statesmanship, and his Independence Day speeches from the Red Fort have come to be known as sort of moral science lessons to the nation.

For example a standout moment in the 2014 speech was when he pointed to how parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions, but not their sons. Against the backdrop of rising cases of rape, Modi urged parents to put some checks on their sons, ask them where they are going, why they are going and who are their friends – because every rapist is somebody’s son.

This year’s Red Fort speech was also full of quotable moral quotes, like where India used to raise the slogan Bharat choro before Independence it now needs to carol Bharat jodo, rejecting violence in the name of religion. It needs to swap the chalta hai attitude with badal sakta hai, especially to fulfil the dreams of the generation born this century who will turn 18 next year.

But the standout moment of the 71st Independence Day speech was when he talked about solving the problems of Kashmir: “Na gaali se … na goli se … samasya suljhegi har Kashmiri ko gale lagake.” Change will come not by cussing nor by guns but by pulling each and every Kashmiri into a hug.

What gives this rhetoric an extra flourish is that this is a prime minister very well known for his jaadoo ki jhappis. Except they seem to be reserved for the likes of Trump and Nawaz Sharif.

Independence Day in Kashmir itself of course means shutters down, traffic restrictions, mobile and data services disrupted. So cynicism with respect to jhappi promises is understandable. As Omar Abdullah, while welcoming the PM’s words, tweeted, everyone there is weary of “yet more talk & no concrete action.” Perhaps the PM’s words were addressed to the rest of India, urging his legion of devotees to be more thoughtful and compassionate.

It is also a fact that his dominion is such that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi were to literally embrace Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti tomorrow, yes that jhappi could somehow amount to concrete action, that could signify change indeed."

Zubair Ahmed, the Quetta Bears batsman, succumbed to the nasty blow he sustained after being hit on the head by a bouncer. The incident occurred during a club match at Mardan District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, on Monday (August 14). Ahmed, who has played four games for Quetta, reportedly didn't have his helmet on when he was struck on the head.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) took to Twitter to convey their condolence and also urged every cricketer to wear the protective gear at all times while at the crease.

Tragic death of Zubair Ahmed is another reminder that safety gear i.e. helmet must be worn at all times. Our sympathies with Zubair's family pic.twitter.com/ZNmWDYaT5w — PCB Official (@TheRealPCB) August 16, 2017

Earlier in the week, Australia opener, David Warner, was struck on the neck during a three-day intra-squad game against a Steve Smith-led unit. The southpaw Warner was reportedly jolted by the hit to his neck, but was quickly back on his feet. Smith checked on his national-side deputy before the latter walked off the field. Warner had been dismissed for four in the first innings and had batted 14 balls in the second, before missing his attempted hook shot off Josh Hazlewood and getting hit - cutting short his bid to get some game time before he gets on the flight to Bangladesh. Later, the Australian think-tank decided to rest him on the final day of the practice game as a precautionary measure.

The world of cricket came to a standstill following the untimely demise of Australia cricketer Phil Hughes, who failed to recover from the head injury copped in a Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales in November, 2014. Ever since, calls for enhanced protective gear, and safety at all times, have increased.

"IIT-M start-up bags $1 million order from Singapore firm, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: A start-up born at the IIT-Madras Incubation Cell has bagged a million dollar order from a Singapore-based company to transfer technology used by its first two products. The key focus of the technologies is clinical training using virtual patients so that actual treatment becomes safer.The two products — “ Laparoscopy Surgical Simulator with Haptics Feedback” and “In-Vitro Fertilisation Training Simulation with Haptics Feedback” — are expected to change the way doctors are trained to make the patient safer. While high-end simulators with haptics feedback cost around Rs 2 crore in the international market, these new technologies integrating virtual reality with haptics (interaction involving the sense of touch), home-grown in IIT-Madras’ Touch Lab, will cost just about Rs 30-35 lakhs.The start-up Merkel Haptics was formed in 2011 to convert lab work into products, and Touch Lab at the Applied Mechanics Department of IIT Madras was founded to research the sense of touch.Speaking to TOI, the founder and principal investigator of the lab, Prof M Manivannan, said: “The Touch Lab is unique and the only touch lab in India. This project started when I visited CMC Vellore. I was watching how laproscopic surgery was done. The idea of a laparoscopy surgical simulator with haptics feedback was converted into a PhD thesis and a prototype was developed in the lab in five years. It was then taken to the company (Merkel) to develop it into a product to make it commercially viable.”The project received Rs 60 lakh from the government. CMC Vellore provided chemical advisory input and carried out the preliminary validation of the product. It was patented in 2012-13. “The second product – In-Vitro Fertilisation Training Simulation — has been commissioned by Innov4Sight Health and Biomedical Systems Put Ltd, Singapore,” said Merkel Haptic Systems Pvt Ltd CEO P B C Paul.“Our objective is go for an Indian company transfer so that the Indian customer can afford these products. We went for this Singapore-based company as it has a huge base in India and, also, the company got an order from the Singapore government for the In-Vitro Fertilisation Training Simulation product,” Paul added.“Actual training is happening on real patients and there is always scope for mistakes. This is what is happening in all clinical training, with risk of injury. Our technology will replace the real patient with a virtual patient and doctors can practice on the virtual patient any number of times until they master the skill so that the real patient is safer, Manivannan said. “The Medical Council of India has made skill labs mandatory. But this virtual technology with haptics feedback is not available in India and foreign companies are making a lot of money,” Manivannan added.According to Paul, these products will not cost more than Rs 35 lakh to Rs 40 lakh. He said this was also “a much better technology and (the need for) after-sales support is almost negligible”."

Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri

K Shriniwas Rao • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:44 AM

Irrespective of how much I may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. © AFP

Given all the drama that surrounded the selection of the coach before they left for the tour of Sri Lanka late in July, a 3-0 series sweep like this one, wrapped up in just under eleven days, has once again brought the smiles back in the Indian camp. Ravi Shastri, back in a very familiar setting that he had helped put in place during his previous stint, is understandably elated. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Shastri talks about the road map ahead, his chemistry with the cricketers and his role going forward. Excerpts...

This was a first: A series sweep away from home. It should instil a good deal of aggression and positivity.

When was the last time that Sri Lanka were beaten like this at home? I'd like to wait and see how some other teams will cope against this same Sri Lankan team in the near future. But then, this is not about Sri Lanka, this is about the Indian team and the manner in which they've stamped their authority here. India's lowest score in this series (487) was still a 100-odd runs more than the best that Sri Lanka could manage throughout the three Tests. So, that should sum-up the total dominance, with the bat and ball.

What are the takeaways for the team after a performance like this?

Even if this team ends up losing a game, as long as they can walk out of the field with their heads held high, knowing that they gave their best, there's no problem whatsoever. A disciplined approach is what counts. For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik [Pandya] and one in the third game from [Mohammad] Shami, we've not faltered. How many catches did we drop throughout this series? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid. It's the effort that counts and in that, if we have to look at the bigger picture, we're taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.

The bowling unit has been coming together splendidly...

Bharath Arun has known these youngsters for such a long time now. Look at Kuldeep [Yadav], for instance. He's been tracking Kuldeep's growth from the Under-16 days. It's the same with some of the others he's worked with for a while now. So, in that sense, there's a sense of familiarity that's also helping. We've always seen Kuldeep as a guy with great potential but let's not go on harping about it. One step at a time. Not just the Test team, even [in] the ODIs, now that we have the likes of Jasprit [Bumrah] and Axar [Patel] coming in, they've all worked with Arun and I am keen to see things moving forward from here.

Hardik made a huge impression in the series...

Hardik may still be new to Test cricket but he's showing what a quick learner he is. As Virat [Kohli] said, he's been the biggest positive of this series. He was working on the cutters for the first time on the morning of the day's play with Arun and he didn't flinch once in going out and testing it the same day. That kind of confidence is what you need at this level.

He can add good balance to the attack if you only have to go in with two pacers...

Of course. But look at Shami and Yadav. They have been relentless. Look at the kind of surfaces that were on offer and these two continuously kept clocking between 141 and 145 kmph. To watch them in action on Day 2 of the game was very satisfying, knowing that these tracks hardly gave them any assistance.

And the fielding too... you've been quite focused on that front...

Oh yes. That's what I also talked about in my interview. When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding eleven in the world. The fittest of the lot and that's right up there in the list of priorities.

You really don't mind showering praise on individuals when you have to...

A few good words don't just make your day but they also give you the sense of belonging and confidence to take the next big step forward. A lot is spoken about coaching an international team. This team loves the pressure they face and the players see it as a challenge. Cynicism and negativity can kill all the joy. I'm not that kind of a guy. I look at the glass as being half-full.

And when there's enough trust and confidence in a healthy working relationship, things begin to look so much better from the outside.

Well, the trust is there. I can't speak for the time when I wasn't around, but what I can say with a sense of absolute belief is that nothing has changed between how things were during my last stint and now.

What is it about you and this Indian team that they have absolute faith in you?

Well, that is for the players to answer. I have a job to do and in my close to 35-year career as a cricketer and a commentator and the other roles that I've handled, I've always tried to give my best. All I can say is that the sense of trust comes from the players knowing that they have someone around who they can walk up to and discuss anything they want. If I really want to make lives difficult in order to get 100% commitment from the other guy, I can very well do that and everybody in this set-up knows what I'm talking about. Yet, at the same time, I don't believe in unnecessary interference. Everybody in this set-up has a responsibility carved out and come what may , that responsibility needs to be carried out to the best of the ability. My job is to ensure this is happening on a daily basis and outside of this, anything that needs to be done in the interest of the team.

A word on Wriddhiman Saha....

Saha has been excellent, be it his wicketkeeping, batting or catching. He had always been an unwavering guy in domestic cricket for years and that hard work is showing. He's grown so much in confidence and remember, he's walking into MS' [Dhoni] shoes. He's done phenomenally well to grow out of that shadow. The kind of 'keeping he came up with in this series - on the kind of surfaces that were on offer - makes him the No. 1 wicketkeeper in the world right now.

Batting seems to be the last of your worries...

To be honest, with a batting unit like this one, the last thing you'd do is lose sleep. The core is such a good one and I'm glad the way Shikhar [Dhawan] is timing the ball. He's got two big hundreds that have put him in the frame of mind that he loves to be in.

Cheteshwar [Pujara] has been batting like a dream and he's in a zone where he has set his targets going forward. And as if all of this wasn't enough, you saw a knock of a different kind here the other day. Hardik's century simply changed the course of an entire Test in less than an hour. We were thinking of going forward by 60 to 80 runs when the tail was batting and look where we ended. Five batsmen got a hundred in this series and close to 10 cricketers got 50-plus scores, which is a first in Test cricket for any team.

You keep insisting 'this is Virat's team' and you're just an extension. Can you elaborate?

I've always maintained this, not just now but even in my earlier stint that this is Virat's team. Prior to when he took over as captain, it was MS Dhoni's bunch and he nurtured some of the boys who've prospered today. The captain is the leader of the pack and the coach is an extension of that role, in the sense that it's the coach's responsibility to ensure that everything is in order for the team and its skipper to go and give their best. These are the principles I followed in my previous stint too. Irrespective of how much I or anyone else may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. Too much importance is given to other things, which is unnecessary. What matters is whether there's confidence and trust between all the individuals and that is my responsibility, to ensure there's enough of it.

There are some big Test series coming up next year, followed by the World Cup in 2019. Has the team sorted its priorities?

The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, we must realise that if India need to show their might in the game, achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle. Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it's Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year.

Assam Floods: Complexities of Disaster risk reduction,"Assam floods indicate impact of disaster is being determined by several inter-linked factors. These factors are unique in different parts of the same region. Therefore, the exercise of devising strategies for disaster risk reduction to deal with flood becomes multifaceted. The flood situation in Assam created by incessant rainfall and overflowing of the Brahmaputra has taken several lives and caused injuries across many districts. Assam is still struggling to deal with the ongoing floods and has also dealt with the similar situation in the past.

According to Assam State disaster management Authority report of 14th August, 2017, floods have affected 25 of the state’s 32 districts. In all 3,192 villages are reported to be inundated. Nearly 32 lakh people are directly affected. Nine of the state’s rivers are flowing above the danger level.

The nature, type and cause of floods across different parts of the state are different. In some areas flood situation is worsened due to high level of siltation and rising river bed. This is specially the case in Majuli district.

Poor maintenance and resultant failure of embankments and erosional activities are other contributing factors leading to recurrence of floods causing high magnitude of losses and damages.

Floods in urban areas such as Guwahati are a result of yet another set of contributing factors such as inadequate urban drainage, poor maintenance of drains and improper land use planning. A single flood event can not be attributed to climate change but shifting rainfall pattern is also influencing the characteristics of the floods.

In such a context, disaster risk reduction efforts to reduce flood losses require due attention to not only the direct causes but also the social milieu, economic diaspora, natural environment, ethical and cultural practices. These processes are complex in nature owing to historical background and the present processes of development and urbanization. Culture influences to a large extent affect the implementation of strategies and policies.

To deal with these processes, strategies and implementation will call for a new approach undertaking pro-active initiatives to involve techno-social-cultural-economic-environmental-governance initiatives.

Social factors including education, awareness and social capital will determine to a large extent the success and failure of these strategies, included therein the ideas of economic disparity and the brutality of market forces during and post flood situation. Dualistic nature of cultural practices needs to be taken into account in fitting the solutions wherever required.

Technological solutions can be harnessed. The use of technology is prevalent in our day-to-day lives. The emergence of smart phones and its wide range of users cannot be ignored as a resource which can be used for multiple purposes like imparting training programmes, updates and basic Dos and Don’ts of different disaster events. Most of the solutions in the technological arena of disaster management can be achieved with optimum utilization of what we think is minimum (Just owning a smart phone).

The challenges to be tackled are continued from the previous disasters pertaining to livelihood practices and its sustainability and vulnerabilities. The tackling of new risks becomes difficult because the existing risks are dynamic in nature and therefore the process of crafting solutions becomes even more complex.

We very much respond to floods but not much of recovery work is seen as we are still standing at a point where we are offering only short-term response. Much of capacity building strategies like preparedness, prevention and mitigation are operational but need to be revisited for a larger, greater, broader understanding, commitment, involvement and efficient delivery of services.

Disaster risk reduction is a long term process entailing a wide coverage of issues and understanding of multiple dimensions of communities’ vulnerability and resilience. Disaster risk reduction becomes a locally-specific solution strategy wherein specificities, region specific issues, community resilience practices need to be taken into consideration.

The realization of disaster risk reduction goals demands a detailed and broader approach where strengths, weaknesses, challenges and unique local features are fully taken into account over the long run."
"Cairn moves court against ITAT order on capital gains tax demand, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Cairn UK Holdings Ltd today moved the Delhi High Court against tax tribunal ITAT's order holding the company liable to pay Rs 10,247 crore as capital gains tax on transfer of shares it did through an internal reorganisation of its Indian business in 2006.

A bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Pratibha M Singh said the matter will be heard in due course and if it does not, then the parties, including the tax department, can move an application for early hearing.

Cairn in its plea has challenged the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal's March 9 order by which the UK-based company was held liable to pay Rs 10,247 crore as capital gains tax.

The company had approached ITAT after it was slapped with a tax assessment order of Rs 10,247 crore in January 2014.

The I-T department had raised a total tax demand of Rs 29,047 crore on Cairn, including Rs 18,800 crore in backdated interest.

In its plea before the ITAT, Cairn had said the assessing officer had ""erred"" in raising the demand by invoking the retrospective amendment to section 9 of the Finance Act introduced in 2012, which was not on the statute when the India-United Kingdom Tax Treaty was entered into."

"OPINION: Light ahead, but at the end of a tunnel: Economic Survey is sanguine and cautious, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Volume II of the Economic Survey holds out bright light at the end of a pretty dark tunnel: medium-term prospects are bright, but short-term ones are dim. Growth would be lower than 7.5% in the current fiscal, inflation would stay below 4%, state governments would find it difficult to spend on capital formation after using up their fiscal space to take on the debt of bankrupt power utilities and distressed farmers.The Centre is doing its best to prop up the flagging investment ratio, but is constrained to meet its fiscal deficit target in a year of low nominal GDP growth and promised spending on higher civil service pay. To help things along, the RBI must slash its policy rates aggressively and the ongoing process of tackling the twin balance-sheet (TBS) problem must continue apace. And the government must boost farm incomes by removing constraints on farm prices such as export bans,stocking limits and marketing restrictions.The Survey’s diagnosis of the economy’s ills and its prescriptions are unlikely to blind observers of the economy with any dazzling originality. That does not mean they are not sound, although some qualifications apply. Is the goods and services tax ( GST ) guaranteed to keep prices in check? Improved tax compliance, on which higher tax collections are predicated, will mean that many habitual evaders would start paying tax.As the share of indirect tax in GDP goes up, prices would bump up in the year of GST implementation . The Survey is right when it says that remunerative prices for farmers and low inflation are convergent goals — but only eventually; in the short run, reducing distress on the farm would mean higher food prices.The Survey attributes most of the stress in the power sector to large additions to capacity and the welcome drop in renewable power prices. The hard reality is that continued power theft and paucity of the political will needed to make people pay for the power they consume are at the core of the crisis in power. Volume II carries forward the tradition of the Survey serving as an aggregator of relevant research and guide to applied economics for students of all ages.[This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Economic Times.]"

Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Tue, 15 Aug, 2017, 06:39 PM

""It is a blessing in disguise for both Pujara and Ashwin because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year"" - MSK Prasad © Getty

Ravichandran Ashwin, the spearhead of the Indian attack, is set to play for the Division 2 County side Worcestershire for the rest of the Championship season. He is expected to make his County debut against Gloucestershire at New Road in Division Two on August 28. Australia fast bowler John Hastings, who represents Worcestershire in the County circuit, was ruled out of the remainder of the season with a foot injury, and Ashwin slots in as a replacement for him.

""Ravi is a fantastic international cricketer who is currently in terrific form with his game,"" Steve Rhodes, the County's Director of Cricket, said.

""He is ranked in the top three as a bowler in Test cricket, is a wonderful all-rounder who can bat six and scores hundreds in Test cricket.

""It is unlucky for John Hastings with his injury but Ravi is a wonderful cricketer for us to have at a crucial point in our season.

""It is a really important last few games for the club and to have someone of his ilk and class and quality is a huge boost for the Club. The good thing about Ravi is he has been successful on all types of pitches in all sorts of different continents. He is a class bowler who will bowl well here,"" Rhodes added.

The off-spinner, with 292 Test wickets to his name, hasn't yet played domestic cricket in England. However, the ace spinner has now received the green signal from the board to represent Worcestershire in County cricket after the selectors decided to rest him for the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

Worcestershire still have four Division 2 matches left during the County season. So the veteran all-rounder could miss out on the upcoming ODI series against Australia scheduled to start on September 17 as he looks to acclimatise to the English conditions ahead of the Test series against England next year.

Meanwhile, Chesteshwar Pujara is also set to return to the Second Division County side, Nottinghamshire. The middle-order batsman has already scored 232 runs at an average of 44.60 for the County side this season. After playing the first half of the season, he was called up for national duty for the just-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka.

Both Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire are eyeing a promotion to Division One. Nottinghamshire have 184 points from 10 matches and are placed at the top of the table. On the other hand, Worcestershire have slotted in at second position with 149 points. Worcestershire last played in Division One in 2015 when they were relegated after ending the season as the bottom-placed team with 151 points.

""It is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year,"" MSK Prasad, the chairman of selectors said.

""It is always good to play and get that first hand feel of the conditions. From a selection point of view they have been rested first and then they have been given consent by the BCCI to go and play county cricket,"" he added.

Ashwin, in all likelihood, will play against his Indian team-mate, Pujara, when the Midlands County take on Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on September 5. Worcestershire are also slated to play against Leicestershire and Durham.

Nawab of Pataudi sr. (33 matches), Kapil Dev and Zaheer Khan (16 matches) are some of the famous Indian cricketers who have played for Worcestershire. Zaheer, the wily seamer, had a successful time at Worcestershire, bagging 78 first-class wickets for the County.

There were also reports that experienced pacer Ishant Sharma too was to ply his trade in England, turning out for Warwickshire. The fast bowler, however, clarified on Twitter that he hasn't penned a contract with any County side. Warwickshire also have Jeetan Patel as their foreign player and were unlikely to sign up Ishant.

Contrary to the news rounds through various sites, have not signed Warwickshire or any other county. — Ishant Sharma (@ImIshant) August 14, 2017

Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now © Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Here's How A 3D Printer With Robot Arms Will Go To Space To Build What We Need There By Itself,"When we need a space station upgraded, or a satellite repaired or a Moon outpost built, it’s up to astronauts to get the job done. Or worse, launch it into space from rockets on Earth.

Now, a private company is planning to change that letting a 3D-printing bot manufacture and build whatever hardware we need in space.

The Archinaut, depicted assembling a satellite array larger than itself - Made in Space

Astronauts need a suit to survive in the vacuum of space, but that’s not all. They also need to rest and take an occasional pitstop to resupply their oxygen. Made in Space instead has now shown off a device that can 3D print parts in a thermal vacuum, similar to what it would experience in space.

Part of the company’s Archinaut program, the development is another step in their efforts to eventually launch a 3D printer into space, once that has robot arms. This way the bot could not only custom manufacture the parts it needs, but also place them itself as and when required.

The large difference here is that Made in Space’s 3D printer, called the Extended Structure Additive Manufacturing Machine, has a thermally insulated case, similar to the parts that protect the electronics on a satellite. “Our tactic has been, let's control the environment that's inside the printer, because we can't do anything about what's outside,” Archinaut project manager Eric Joyce told Wired.

The advantages are enormous, as the Archinaut could build hardware much larger than would be possible on Earth. If you build a giant satellite on the ground, you need to have a rocket capable of lifting it, and the money to spend on the fuel. But if you’re manufacturing plant is already in space, you can build a satellite or telescope of massive proportions. And without gravity, there’s no fear of 3D printed parts not being able to take the structure’s weight.

NASA has already recognised the potential here, with Made in Space operating under a two-year $20 million contract with the space agency. The company has already been experimenting with 3D printing on board the space station, and its next task will be to add the arms to the printer."
A Samsung Galaxy S5 Drops From Plane While Shooting A Video & It Shockingly Survives The Fall!,"Just like you don't play football without kicking or getting kicked, you don't use a phone without at least dropping it once. It's one of the rules of the universe.

But where most of us drop our phones in the toilet, off the dinner table, or while removing it from our pocket, one guy literally dropped it from a plane up in the sky.

No, we are not even kidding. This actually happened -- at least according to Reddit.

Just over a day ago, a Reddit user posted an interesting video on the popular website under the title ""My Uncle was filming another plane while flying and accidentally dropped it!""

In the video, you can see the phone's point-of-view video as it slips from the pilot's hands and goes into a tailspin and lands in an unsuspecting guy's garden, amidst the flowerbed.

What's stunning about this video -- which is what a lot of people are not yet convinced about -- is that the phone falls from over a thousand feet high and doesn't break apart, falls on its face and continues to record video, catching a guy who ultimately discovers the phone on his property.

The fact that it's a Samsung Galaxy S5 makes the video even more surreal. What are the odds of this happening, right? Brb, calculating...

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
"GST: Piyush Goyal rules out review of 5 per cent GST on solar equipment, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Amidst reports that there is still lack of clarity on the 5 per cent goods and services tax (GST) levy on solar equipment, Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal has reiterated that there is no ambiguity as the government is very clear on the issue.

""There is no question of ambiguity on this. It has been made very clear that 5 per cent GST will be applicable on solar equipment. If they (equipment makers) still have issues with it, it is very sad and we cannot do anything,"" Goyal, who was in the megapolis, told over the weekend.

The industry has claimed that though the government has said GST would be applied to solar modules at a concessional rate of 5 per cent, there is still no clarity on whether it will be extended to other equipment as well.

""The Goods and Services Tax was introduced to bring in more clarity and transparency in the system. I think our stand is very clear in this,"" he said.

Goyal further said the ambitious plan of increasing solar capacity to 100 GW by 2020 and promoting solar products would boost small and medium enterprises.

""We have set a target of 40,000 MW of rooftop solar capacity by 2022. Small and medium enterprises can take active participation in this. Apart from this, there is scope in sectors like solar pumps, solar streetlights and energy- efficient systems among others,"" the minister said, adding ""the country is moving from a job-seeking to job-creating economy""."

CHARLOTTESVILLE: US President Donald Trump faced renewed pressure on Monday to respond more forcefully to a violent white-nationalist rally in Virginia, after drawing a storm of criticism when he avoided explicit condemnation of far-right groups.In a strong rebuke to the president, the CEO of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms resigned from a business panel led by Trump. Merck & Co Inc CEO Kenneth Frazier cited a need for leadership countering bigotry .The president has been assailed by Republicans and Democrats alike over his handling of Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed when a man drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. James Alex Fields Jr, the driver, was denied bond on Monday .Trump met top law enforcement officials at the White House to discuss the issue.Critics said Trump waited too long to address the violence, and slammed him for stating when he did that “many sides“ were involved, rather than explicitly condemning white-supremacist marchers.Merck's Frazier, who is black, did not name Trump or criticise him directly in a statement posted on the drug company's Twitter account, but the rebuke was implicit. “America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy , which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,“ he said.Trump immediately hit back, but made no reference to Frazier's comments on values, instead revisiting a longstanding gripe about expensive medicines. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!“ Trump said in a Twitter post.In his comments on Saturday, Trump denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.“Authorities said Heyer, 32, was killed when Fields' car slammed into a crowd of antiracism activists confronting neo-Nazis and KKK sympathisers, capping a day of bloody street brawls between the two sides in the Virginia town.Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to defend the president in TV interviews on Monday in which he stressed the administration was taking a robust approach to investigations.The attack on counterprotesters “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism,“ Sessions said."
"Oil prices edge up on falling US crude stocks, but global glut still weighs, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE- Oil prices edged up on Wednesday on a fall in U.S. crude inventories, although markets were still being weighed down by general oversupply.

Brent crude futures were at $51.02 per barrel at 0218 GMT, up 22 cents or 0.4 percent from their last close.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $47.70 a barrel, up 15 cents, or 0.3 percent.

U.S. crude inventories fell by 9.2 million barrels in the week to Aug. 11 to 469.2 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday.

That compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 3.1 million barrels.

""The market took this as a mildly bullish report,"" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities.

However, gasoline stocks climbed by 301,000 barrels, compared with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.1 million barrel decline.

Official Energy Information Administration (EIA) data will be published late on Wednesday.

More broadly, analysts said ample supplies were preventing prices from moving much higher.

""It is the ongoing fundamental issue of excessive supply that is continuing to weigh on oil prices... Not a lot has changed despite the OPEC and Russia efforts recently. While these producers have tried to limit their oil output, U.S. shale oil continues to rise,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with non-OPEC producers like Russia has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018.

Offsetting much of that effort, however, U.S. oil production has soared by almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.42 million bpd.

On the demand side, analysts also see a gradual slowdown in consumption growth as gasoline demand peaks in the United States due to improving fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles, while China's voracious oil thirst also starts to taper off.

The crude forward price curve shows that the market condition known as contango, when it is profitable to store oil for later sale and which is seen as an indicator of oversupply, no longer applies.

Yet neither is the curve in backwardation, which would make it profitable to sell oil immediately and which is seen as a healthy market for producers.

""OPEC and Russia still face an uphill battle in reducing the global supply surplus in the face of growth in output elsewhere (U.S. shale oil, Libya, Nigeria) and less than compliant behaviour in their midst (Iraq, UAE),"" French bank BNP Paribas said in a note."

"nuclear medicine: Besides newer isotopes, nuclear medicine is all set to revolutionize the diagnostics and therapeutic capabilities: Dr Mythri Shankar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Senior Consultant, Nuclear Medicine Department,, Bengaluru, talks about the role and advancements in PET-CT. Edited excerpts:PET-CT is a new hybrid imaging modality and is mainly used for the staging of head and neck cancer in particular, meaning how far the cancer has spread; looking at TNM staging, the entire T stage which is a tumour extent and the nodal involvement. Most common sites would be the lungs, the bones and PET-CT scans offer a one stop scan where we can image the entire body and check for increased focal or metabolic activity or glycolysis which indicates presence of tumour in those areas. It is also very good for restaging to assess how the patient has responded to that particular type of treatment. We look for fall in glycolytic activity which helps us assess the treatment response of a metabolic level be it partial or complete.Something that we are seeing or trying to explore in head and neck cancer is tumour volume estimation but there is a little bit more value addition that PET-CT could bring into the picture by estimating the tumour volume to be different than the CET estimated volume. It could allow us to cover more area of treatment or give lesser amount of radiation therefore preventing complication that could happen from radiation therapy.Thyroid cancers form a very important group of head and neck cancers and they are a little different when you compare them to other head and neck cancers. The point being they are excruciatingly iodine sensitive and they pick up iodine. We have a lot of scans in nuclear medicine which use iodine just like PET-CT to stage the extent of disease in the patient and that we have been using so far but now sometimes what we have seen is certain types of thyroid cancers differentiate. The differentiated types of thyroid cancer do not pick up iodine as well as some of the other common groups do. Here we need to still go ahead and check how far the cancer has spread and these cancers are not iodine avid. Such group of patients can benefit from what we call FDG PET scan which measures the glycolytic activity in the tumour cell and helps us stage and treat the patient better.Nuclear medicine is basically use of isotope within the human body, we use it both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, we can diagnoses using it in scans and we can use it in treating the patient. Radioiodine ablation has been the main stream of theranostics just like diagnostics where we use it for therapy. When we do a radioiodine ablation in thyroid cancer there is a also a concept where we use a recombinant TSH, where we use that to stimulate the uptake of the radioiodine therapy which we give and it allows us to makes the procedure faster. This is not new it has been there and more people are starting to use it. Except for the cost factor it is a great tool to have where we can use exogenous, recombinant TSH to stimulate the gland and also use radioiodine therapy in a better way.Futuristically, we are seeing a lot more nuclear medicine and PET-CT scan centres in India. Today we have close to 200 and just in Bangalore we have close to 10 combinations of nuclear medicines and PET-CT centres. We are seeing a lot of newer isotopes, lot of finer techniques with more targeted, diagnostics and therapeutic capabilities."

Chawla joins Ranji champions Gujarat for 2017-18 season

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:50 PM

""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move"" - Chawla © Getty

Piyush Chawla has ended his long-term association with Uttar Pradesh cricket in order to represent Gujarat in the upcoming first-class season, the legspinner confirmed to Sportstar. ""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move,"" Chawla said on Wednesday (August 16).

Chawla, who picked up 226 wickets in 80 first-class matches for UP over a period of almost 12 years, will now bolster the defending champions' bowling line-up which already consists the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and RP Singh, who also made the same move two years ago. It is to be noted that Chawla featured in only two Ranji games last season after getting sidelined for a major period with an injury.

The 28-year-old made his Test debut for India way back in 2006 but has since then managed to add only two more caps with his last appearance in the format coming almost five years back. With the BCCI reverting to the home-away format for the Ranji this season, the legspinner has observed the lack of help for spinners from the surfaces in UP as the main reason behind his move. ""The kind of wickets you get in the Western region which has a red soil layering help the spinners better,"" Chawla pointed out.

""When I play in Uttar Pradesh, the wickets are either seaming tracks or flat ones. That's how the weather is. So, it was time to make a move to a state where I can bowl much better and get wickets.""

Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel had a role to play in the move, according to Chawla's own admission. ""A couple of years ago, when UP toured Gujarat for a match, I saw the wicket was a turner, and it was helping the spinners,"" he recalled. ""So I had told Parthiv, 'If I ever think of making a move, please keep your options open for me.'

""Last year, I only played a couple of matches for UP as I was injured. I couldn't play much, and only participated in one-dayers and T20s, because in the second game of the Ranji Trophy itself, I was injured. So, this year I was mulling a change. I spoke to Parthiv and told him about my plans. He and the officials at the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) were happy with the move. I am thankful to them that they welcomed me,"" he added.

"China's Fosun, Shanghai Pharma say bid for stake in U.S. drugmaker Arbor, Health News, ET HealthWorld","By Kane Wu

HONG KONG - A unit of China's Fosun Group and Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co are among bidders for a stake in U.S. speciality drugmaker Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC, the companies said on Monday.

The bids come as Chinese companies face tightening scrutiny on their overseas investments. Chinese regulators are reviewing deal agreements in minute details, and have cracked down on some large domestic conglomerates, including Fosun, for their debt-fuelled acquisitions abroad.

Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said in a stock exchange filing its Hong Kong unit submitted on July 19 a non-binding bid for a stake in Arbor, which is backed by private equity firm KKR & Co LP.

In a separate filing, Shanghai Pharma also said it had submitted a non-binding bid for a stake in Arbor on the same day.

Both companies did not disclose the quantum of stakes they had bid for nor the financial terms but said they have not entered exclusive talks with the seller.

Fosun Pharma said its Hong Kong unit will begin conducting due diligence to determine further steps.

Arbor has appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to run the sale process, which has attracted around half a dozen preliminary bids, mostly from Chinese companies and private equity firms, according to people familiar with matter. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Some of the bidders may seek to acquire control of the company, said two of the people, adding that discussions are at an early stage still.

A potential deal could value Arbor at around $3 billion, two of the people said.

Bloomberg, which first reported on the sale process, said the bidders were seeking to buy 20 percent to 30 percent of Arbor.

Arbor did not immediately respond to a Reuters query for comment. The sources could not be named as the discussions are confidential.

Atlanta-based Arbor produces mainly branded prescription drugs for the paediatric, hospital and cardiovascular markets.

New York-based KKR agreed to buy more than a quarter of shares in the company in December 2014, in a deal that valued privately held Arbor at over $1 billion, Reuters reported at the time.

"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don’t want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don’t interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that’s the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors’ well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."

"Cost Optimisation: ONGC to tap big data to raise output, optimise cost, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Many oil services providers as well as tech firms are working with several oil firms on applying big data analytics for higher productivity.

NEW DELHI: Oil & Natural Gas Corp is betting on Big Data to prepare for a future of low prices and hard to extract oil, on the lines of some global oil majors which have been using the power of advanced data analysis over the last few years and benefitting from it.Explorers like ONGC deal with tonnes of data. The rise in advanced computer analysis over the years has prompted it to work on bringing all internal data on one platform to help its operations. “Exploration and production is now moving into challenging areas.You can’t lose time in decision making. Having all data and information available at the click of a button would help make quick and optimal decisions,” said Ajay Kumar Dwivedi, director-exploration at ONGC. Globally, reserves have been dwindling, raising the cost of production for firms that must explore deep sea and other difficult terrains for oil and gas, especially at a time oil prices are low and expected to stay so for a long time.This requires companies to strive for major leap in efficiency, and big data analytics is helping majors like Shell as well as smaller shale oil producers do just that. Companies are pooling data from across their units, figuring out their interconnection, building predictive models and programmes that help better plan, design processes, and ultimately induce productivity “This is not just about cost optimisation , which many people have been talking about. This is also about creating new knowledge using the in-house domain expertise,” Dwivedi said, adding that the new knowledge can have significantly bigger impact on the way the company operates. ONGC would engage data scientists from IITs and IT firms to put in place over the next few months the big data platform that would contain all exploration and production information including geological, seismic, well log, drilling and output figures, he said.“The problem in drilling or production we face today is not always new. There are chances of us having encountered a similar problem in a different field or a basin in the past. So if we have a ready reference to how we solved the problem then can help us move quickly now,” said Dwivedi. The big data initiative would also shorten the learning curve for younger employees, he said.Integrating big data in the company’s operations could enhance efficiency and image of ONGC which, like many other state firms in India, has been criticised for inefficiency and suboptimal decision-making in the past. Many oil services providers as well as tech firms are working with several oil firms on applying big data analytics for higher productivity."
"GST will not be an obstacle for solar growth story: Gajanan Nabar, CEO, CleanMax Solar, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: CleanMax Solar , one of the biggest solar-rooftop firms in India, has recently bagged a Rs 700 crore investment from US-based private equity firm Warburg Pincus . In a conversation with ETEnergyworld, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Gajanan Nabar talks about the investment, impact of GST on the company’s business and the need to make the solar sector self-sustainable.Edited excerpts:As India’s largest rooftop solar developer with a market share of 24 per cent, the funding will primarily be utilised to maintain our leadership position. While we currently operate solar farms in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, we will use the funds to continue our rapid growth in the open access solar power markets in India. Additionally, we are keenly looking to increase our sustainability product offerings to corporates by venturing into energy storage solutions by combining it with Rooftop Solar plants. International expansion is also on the cards, with our operations in UAE set to commence shortly.The introduction of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), which is the single largest tax reform by the Government of India, is an excellent initiative to bring about the ease of carrying out business. Under the gambit of the GST, the solar power plant, which is the input, is taxed, whereas electricity as an output is not taxed. As a result of this, we have unusable credit on GST, which is a minor challenge in the cost competitive solar Industry. However, we are trying to offset this by offering improvements in quality and reduced construction time. Overall, while there are initial hiccups till we fully comprehend the system, the long-term benefits of GST will outweigh them and will not be an obstacle for the solar industry growth story in India.Subsidy is not a sustainable thing for any sector in the long run. It is required for any new technology or business model in order to bring a disruptive change to begin with. However, it is not stable in any economy to continue with it. The government is doing the right thing since the cost of solar projects is going down and the performance is improving, the industry can eventually function on its own.We are doing a lot of our businesses without any subsides.From the rooftop perspective, net-metering is certainly one. Wheeling and banking charges are also a challenge. In some states, there are no wheeling and banking charges for open access. But there is still a long way to go as the sector is just emerging. I do feel the overall approach of the government is very positive. As an industry, we can keep asking for more subsides but that is not how you want to build a sustainable business. Let us not forget that we are very dependent on imports and that is one element which is beyond the ambit of the Indian economy. Trade relationships and other geo-political challenges come into play. What is required is more clarity on vision, alignment of discoms with state governments and boards with central government.Not currently but it is on the horizon and we will certainly look at it.It is around 300 MW which includes rooftop. We are seeing exponential growth in rooftop as we more than doubled the business last year. So we are hoping to continue like this. We have installed over 100 MW as of now. We are also looking at international markets -- the Middle East and Southeast Asia."
"Govt capex to rise 25 per cent to Rs 3.9 lakh crore by 2019-20, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government's capital expenditure will rise by 25 per cent to Rs 3.9 lakh crore by 2019-20, with defence outlay alone jumping 22 per cent, according to the Mid-Year Review tabled in Parliament today.

It has budgeted for Rs 3,09,801 crore as capital expenditure during the current fiscal which will rise to Rs 3,41,000 crore in the next one, and to Rs 3,90,000 crore in 2019-20, it said.

Defence, which accounts for about 30 per cent of the government's capital outlay, will see the spending rise from Rs 91,580 crore in the current fiscal to Rs 1,01,137 crore in the next one and Rs 1,11,706 crore in 2019-20.

Together with revenue expenditure, government's total spending is projected to rise from Rs 21.46 lakh crore in 2017-18 to Rs 23.4 lakh crore in the next financial year and Rs 25.95 lakh crore in 2019-20.

While outgo on fertiliser subsidy is projected to be flat at Rs 70,000 crore between the current fiscal and 2019-20, the food subsidy bill will rise to Rs 1.75 lakh crore in 2018-19 and Rs 2 lakh crore in the following fiscal. Food subsidy bill in current fiscal is pegged at Rs 1.45 lakh crore.

Petroleum subsidy would drop to Rs 18,000 crore in 2018- 19 from Rs 25,000 crore in current fiscal and to Rs 10,000 crore in 2019-20.

Petrol and diesel prices have been decontrolled and subsidy outgo on petrol is restricted to LPG and kerosene.

""In continuation of the efforts of the government to rationalise subsidises, the Government has decided to increase the cost of LPG cylinders by Rs 4 per month. The ultimate aim of the Government is to eliminate the subsidy on LPG cylinders by end March 2018,"" the review said.

After successful implementation of paying subsidies directly into bank accounts of LPG users, the government is now focused on reducing kerosene subsidies.

Introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 this year as also the increased surveillance post demonetisation would expand the tax base from in next two fiscal years, the review said.

The tax-GDP ratio will increase by 30 basis points in 2018-19 and 2019-20. ""The tax-GDP ratios are projected to be 11.6 per cent in 2018-19 and 11.9 per cent in 2019-20,"" it said.

While the revenue deficit target of 2 per cent of GDP will be met in current fiscal, the deficit would be 1.9 per cent in the next. ""However the elimination of effective revenue deficit will have to be re-calibrated,"" it said.

The review projected aggregate revenue expenditure in Defence, excluding pensions, to grow by about 10.4 per cent in 2018-19 and 8.5 per cent in 2019-20. ""This pushes the defence revenue expenditure to Rs 201,511 crore and Rs 218,629 crore in 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively,"" it said."
Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of déjà vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government’s apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India’s total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government’s achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi’s intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015–16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016–17 as per reports.

farmers suicide in India: Over 12,000 farmer suicides per year, Centre tells Supreme Court #MyNewIndia https://t.co/pY5mXmI9BU — काकावाणी (@AliSohrab007) August 13, 2017

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 – a promise prominently mentioned in BJP’s 2014 manifesto."

With Inputs Reuters"
Let the poor sell their children as a poverty alleviation measure,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on health, in its report on the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2016, has said that women should be allowed to rent their womb and become surrogate mothers for total strangers in exchange for a hefty sum of money, a rate that will be fixed by the government. The panel was of the view that “economic opportunities available to surrogates through surrogacy services” should be permitted. The Committee observed that if many impoverished women are able to provide their children with education, construct home, start a small business, etc. by resorting to surrogacy, there is no reason to take this away from them.

If surrogacy is an economic opportunity, why not selling of babies or children? If a couple is in dire need of money and the sale of children can help alleviate their poverty, why can’t they do it? Every time they needed money, they could produce a baby and sell it, or sell one of the already existing babies/children and reduce their own burden and also help a childless family in the process. India could be selling its excess population of poor children all over the world perhaps. It could become a market leader. It could help reduce the population and could be the best poverty alleviation scheme with no input of government’s scarce resources.

This reminds one of the satirical essay by Jonathan Swift called A Modest Proposal or to give the full title- A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick. Swift’s recommendation for impoverished Irish was to ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. “A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled…,” said Swift. The standing committee’s proposal seems no less satirical, except that they are dead serious.

“For any woman who is going through surrogacy, there is a certain cost and certain loss of health involved. Not only will she be absent from her work, but will also be away from her husband and would not be able to look after her own children,” says the committee. It therefore recommended that surrogate mother should be adequately and reasonably compensated. Actually, allowing them to sell their own babies might be so much simpler! No absence from work. No neglecting the children she chooses to keep. She is in fact earning some money for them.

The committee goes on to express great concern over the fact that surrogate mothers could be exploited as “there are enormous inequalities in the bargaining power of surrogates vis-à-vis medical clinics and commissioning parents due to surrogate’s illiteracy, socio-economic marginalization and lack of access to legal representation”. They have a neat solution for it. The government can just fix a minimum retail price for the surrogacy. “The relevant authorities should fix the amount of compensation” says the committee and adds that the fixed amount should not be subject to bargaining between the surrogate mother and her client. No more worries about finding employment for poor women or about Skill India. The government could help fix a minimum rate for selling children too.

In fact, why only women and children, maybe all poor people could sell one kidney each at government fixed rates. Maybe some portion of their liver too or any other body parts they can afford to spare. The government could put out a rate list and ensure the money is paid. It could have differential pricing for foreigners, NRIs and Indians. The government could even tax the transactions, differentially of course, and earn some money from it. The options this committee report opens up for the country’s poor is mind boggling- a happy problem of plenty?"
"Government slaps $264 million penalty on RIL, BP for less production, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government has imposed a new penalty of USD 264 million (about Rs 1,700 crore) on Reliance Industries Ltd and its partners for producing less than the targeted natural gas from eastern offshore KG-D6 fields in 2015-16.

The total penalty now, which is in the form of disallowing recovery of cost incurred for missing the target during six years beginning April 1, 2010, stands at USD 3.02 billion, an oil ministry official said.

The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) allows RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources to deduct all capital and operating expenses from the sale of gas before sharing profit with the government.

Disallowing costs will result in government's profit share rising.

The government has claimed an additional USD 175 million as its profit share after the cost disallowance, the official said.

Gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas field in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block was supposed to be 80 million standard cubic meters per day but actual production was only 35.33 mmscmd in 2011-12, 20.88 mmscmd in 2012-13 and 9.77 mmscmd in 2013-14. The output has continued to drop in the subsequent years and is now below 4 mmscmd.

Emails sent to RIL and BP remained unanswered. The two companies have challenged the cost disallowance of the past years and have initiated an international arbitration seeking dropping of the same on grounds that the PSC does not provide for any such punishment.

The government had for 2010-11 disallowed USD 457 million of cost, USD 548 million for 2011-12, USD 792 million for 2012-13, USD 579 million for 2013-14 and USD 380 million for 2014-15.

Now an additional USD 264 million has been disallowed for output lagging behind target in 2015-16.

The output was behind target in 2016-17 as well and the cost disallowance will be calculated only next year, the official said.

RIL had previously stated that ""every year, based on its own interpretations of the PSC and assumptions (with which the contractor group does not agree), the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas revises the total cost it proposes to disallow and consequently aggregates the figure with figures of the previous years.

""It also demands additional profit petroleum (in total including previous year claims as well) as Government of India share"".

Of the additional profit petroleum claimed, the government has already collected gross USD 81.7 million in the gas pool account by taking away any gas price higher than USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit during November 2014 to March 2016 period.

From April 2016 to date, the gas price has been less than USD 4.2 and no deposits were made to the gas pool account.

Contractor group refers to RIL and its partners BP and Niko.

RIL holds 60 per cent interest in block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. BP has 30 per cent and Niko the remaining 10 per cent."
"11-YO Girl Nails 56-YO Relative Who Raped Her For Four Days, Family Wanted To Save The Accused","A courageous 11-year-old with no support from her parents helped nail a 56-year-old distant relative who repeatedly raped her over four days in 2014. Relying on her statements, the special court sentenced the accused to life imprisonment on Friday.

The child, from Karnataka, faced the nightmare when she was sent to the accused and his family in the city by her parents in 2014 to undergo ""exorcism of the evil spirits"" that, they claimed, had possessed her.

Representational Image

The special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court also ordered the accused to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the child. The amount was to be deposited in a fixed deposit account and should be handed over to her when she turns 18.

The court refused leniency to the accused, who claimed he was suffering from hypertension and had to marry off his daughter. ""When the accused is making submissions about his ailments, the plight of the victim, her helplessness at the time of the incident has also to be considered. She was at the mercy of this accused. But he had committed the heinous offence with the girl whom he was expected to take care of,"" retorted the court.

The girl's parents did not come to court; they had even visited her at a shelter with relatives of the accused. The prosecution believes it was an attempt to influence her. ""Generally parents are the first persons to raise their voice for the cause of their child, but here is a case where parents have not turned up for the cause of their child,"" the court said.

Representational Image

The girl told the court that she wanted to continue living in the orphanage as her parents would discontinue her studies.

She added that she had been living with the accused and his family for a month, when all the relatives, except the accused, left for Gujarat for a week. The accused, whom she called 'chachu', sexually assaulted her on October 23, 2014. It continued for the next few days, during which she was confined to a room and threatened that she would be killed is she opened her mouth.

On October 26, when the accused had gone for a bath, she slipped out and escaped to a neighbour's house. She confided in the neighbour about her ordeal. After spending a night at their house, she was taken to the police station to lodge a complaint.

The court dismissed the defence of the accused that she had falsely implicated him as she was fed up of being repeatedly taken to shrines for exorcism. It also refuted the defence claim that the court 'cannot rely on the sole testimony of a victim child suffering from evil spirit.'

Will Amazon Prime Video and Netflix be the upholders of free speech,"Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have been racking up a number of deals of late. The online streaming rights for Padmavati starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been sold to Amazon Prime Video for a rumored Rs 20-25 crore. Padmavati is rumored to have been made at a cost of Rs 180 crores by the director of the film Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

Is this going to be the new norm for film makers? It could well be. Salman Khan has offered Amazon Prime the rights to stream his movies even before their television premiere. Yash Raj films, T-Series and many others have been reported to have signed similar deals.

With more than 2000 screens across India, multiplexes are an attractive option. USA with more than 40,000 screens has over 125 screens per million of population. India has a measly six screens per million people. Multiplexes may not de-risk the creative expression.

Getting the movie to the right number of screens is not a task for the faint hearted director. Even if the movie is slated to be shown for a week at a multiplex, the fate of the movie is usually decided over the weekend. If there is a blockbuster movie released in the same week, the audience will go to watch the bigger draw. Hence a movie made with a smaller budget does not have the staying power to survive another week at the multiplex.

During the shooting of Padmavati, the director was assaulted by the workers of Rajput Karni Sena who also vandalised the sets of the film. The vandals were peeved by what they claimed was the “distortion of historical facts”. They were offended by the manner in which Alauddin Khilji was shown to be obsessed with Padmavati’s beauty. It is easy to expect that multiplex owners will hesitate to screen Padmavati lest the vandals destroy the movie theatre after watching the movie. You never know who will be offended.

This may mean that a film maker who decides to make a movie that may not be the usual song and dance kitsch that is the standard fare of Bollywood is at risk. Of course Padmavati is not the first movie that has courted controversy. Songs have had to be dropped or have their lyrics modified to appease a group that has been offended. Anyone can take a film or an artiste to court or beat them into silence. Comedians have been told that their brand of humor is offensive and have been hauled up before courts. Artists have been threatened because their depiction was not acceptable.

For the film makers, writers, lyricists and comedians, the streaming giants may offer a safe haven where opinions that are not palatable to the majority can be expressed. The stand-up comedians can do their routine without fear of a backlash other than the market forces. If viewers do not watch the shows or rate it poorly, the artistes will be taken off the air or at the very least not invited back. Free speech that challenges our worldview may thrive in the fringes while the mainstream cinema continues to dole out what is safe but bland. That may be another form of the digital divide."

India @70: How this identity politics game is programmed to classify and rule,"Inshallah, India may never believe in the two-nation theory, but like Hinduism’s belief in 330 million gods — one deity for every Indian in 1947 — it was hardwired from its bloody birth to practise its politics according to a multi-nation theory. If the All-India Muslim League was the first to successfully introduce the notion in December 1906 of a political entity to represent a people — in its case, Muslims — over the decades, independent India’s political parties learnt well from that template.

Divide and rule, of course, predates the formation of Pakistan and the independence of India. But the British divvied up India through (already existing) religious communities and castes — not to mention ‘martial and non-martial races’ after the 1857 mutiny — to handle their affairs of state better. In the case of their successors, as well as those competing for a slice of political action, identity politics became the most efficient way of keeping and getting their snouts in the trough of power.

In the early days of Independence, of course, the Congress, radiating with the afterglow of being the political party of the freedom struggle, successfully represented the proverbial everyone: the upper caste, the lower caste, the Hindu, the Muslim, the poor, the affluent, the middle classes, the peasantry, the trader, the nationalist, and all variations thereof.

Even as challenges came from the CPI (which accused Nehru’s government of not being socialist enough), and from C Rajagopalachari’s Swatantra Party (which accused Nehru’s government of being too socialist), the Congress managed itself to be seen as everything to everyone in the first two decades of the ‘sovereign democratic republic’.

The addition of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ — to the existing ‘sovereign’ and ‘democratic’ in the preamble of the Constitution — via the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, during Indira Gandhi’s Emergency was a good indicator of the desperate need for the Congress in government to emphasise that it, and not the communist parties, was the natural port of call for the peasantry and working class, and that it, and not other entities, was the protector of Muslims and other minorities.

The 1956-founded Republican Party of India (itself evolving out of the Scheduled Castes Federation founded by B R Ambedkar in 1942) made as little headway in electoral politics as a party representing Dalits as the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, founded in 1951 by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, representing Hindus.

It was only after Janata Dal Prime Minister V P Singh announced in Parliament in 1990 that his government was keen on implementing the recommendations for reservations along caste lines made by the Government of India Report of the Backward Classes Commission — a.k.a. the ‘Mandal Commission’ — set up by the 1979 Morarji Desai Janata government to “identify the socially and educationally backward”, that saw political parties ideologically moored to identity politics erupt.

If the Bahujan Samaj Party, founded by Kanshi Ram in 1984 to represent Dalits in general and Jatavs in particular, had lost its security deposit in 222 of the 246 seats it contested in the 1989 Lok Sabha, by 1993, riding the Mandal surf, it came to power in Uttar Pradesh in a coalition with Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party, a political entity ‘for Yadavs and Muslims’. In 1997, breaking away from the Janata Dal to create his own identity politics brand equity after the fodder scam made his tenure in the party untenable, Lalu Prasad Yadav formed the Rashtriya Janata Dal — this after two stints as chief minister of Bihar that started in that magic year for caste politics, 1990.

Year Mandal also marked the breakout year for the BJP, which now was able to pitch itself properly as the ‘sole unifier’ of Hindus in a political marketplace filled with self-proclaimed guardians of more and more atomised identities. The Babri Masjid demolition in December 1992 would become both the cause and an effect of this trajectory.

At the national level, the 1990s and 2000s saw the golden age of coalitions: each ‘tribal chief ’ bringing their tribes demands and support to the long wooden table. But for both the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government and the Sonia Gandhiled, Manmohan Singh-prime ministered UPA government, identity politics retained its lustre.

That is, until the ‘coalition compulsions’ that made corruption so visible and risible for a national electorate, ended the UPA’s tenure. Gujarat CM-turned-BJP’s prime ministerial candidate managed to convince India’s voters in 2014 that more than just narrow pipelines are needed as delivery mechanisms for ‘corruption-free’ development and progress.

This hardly spelt the end of caste and religious politics. It was about identity politics getting subsumed. Identity-based deliverables — as seen in both Nitish Kumar’s victory in Bihar and Narendra Modi’s BJP’s in UP — is today a more evolved, sophisticated, precise and subtle welding of the promise of governance and development with micro-managing the caste and community pipelines.

In Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar had written, “I have no hesitation in saying that if the Mahomedan has been cruel, the Hindu has been mean; and meanness is worse than cruelty.” And by ‘meanness’ he meant denying the fruits of empowerment and wealth. Pure ID politics of the kind in decline today — as witnessed by the defenestration of Mayawati and defeat of the Yadav clan in UP, and the relative ease with which Nitish Kumar could dump Lalu Yadav in Bihar — was based on denying those not ‘in your fold’.

The new identity politics seeks to retain community and caste lines, perhaps even to accentuate them. But the stated objective is to make this kind of identification easier to deliver the goods. In that sense, it is a return to the old British strategy of classify and rule. It’s about not being stingy to anyone any more. Or, at any rate, not coming across as mean."
"P.D. Hinduja Hospital: Soon, technology will help to bridge the demand and supply gap in healthcare: Joy Chakraborty, COO, P.D. Hinduja Hospital, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld, Joy Chakraborty, COO P.D. Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Mumbai, talks about the technological advancements that have been adapted by the hospital to make healthcare easier to access. Edited excerpts:In Indian healthcare, the technology has emerged in a big way in terms of delivering quality healthcare to the patients. Till 19th century, we have seen the medical technologies were taking leading role in terms of delivering care to patients, but subsequently in the 20th century, we have seen non-medical technologies also emerging and started playing important role. What we have seen the difference in terms of keeping medical records, electronic medical records availability, individualized treatment, medical treatment in terms of big data analytics playing very crucial role. The other important thing coming up is the patient centric care through patient engagement and patient experience, and technology is playing a role too. So many hospitals today in our country, in the metros and the tier 1 cities have adopted all this technologies to get patients to receive best possible care in their facilities.All these technologies are playing a very important role again in terms of delivering quality care to the patients. Just to give an example, earlier a patient who visited a hospital a year or two before, didn’t have access to their records, they didn’t have ready access of their reports to the doctors when they visit for the second time. But now it has enabled their physicians as well care providers to go through the past records, to record the existing information, the diagnostic tests and reports which is enabling them to get care not only in the hospital but even when they are away from their hospital or the healthcare setup. So it is a continuum of care which will go in a long way to get better outcome for these patients when they avail treatment. So this is indirectly the quality of care which has enhanced over a period of time.In our country you know on one side we have Bharat, and the other side we have India. So people, they are challenged with the affordability. When you look at these technologies, it comes at a price. But if you look at the breakeven point, you really need to assess that where is the cost benefitting and you will see that it needs to have a good volume, target mass, target population and most of the time it has been found that only affordable class get use of these technologies. They’re only able to get access to these technologies, whereas 70% of the population who are staying in the rural India don’t have access to all this. So the major challenge is how you get technologies enable with affordability for the masses.Hinduja Hospital, for the last 65 years, remain as the pioneer, as a leader in the healthcare delivery in this country. Since 1951 when this hospital began its journey, we got all the medical technologies. For example; Gamma knife was been installed in this hospital in 1997 when no other hospital in this country even thought about it. We started radiation treatment, PET scan and many other technologies, first of its kind in this region or in this country. Parallel to this we have taken up the leading role in information technology and non-clinical technology. Today, our entire ecosystem has been charged up with high end information technology and other technologies which are enabling patients to get a better treatment, enabling our clinicians to give a better outcome for the patient and which is causing a shorter stay and cost effective care for our patients at this hospital.In Hinduja Hospital, we have got several things integrated with the IT. The first of its kind is the PACS which is the speech to text conversion. So a patient who undergoes any test in the radiology department, their results is getting transmitted to them through online by virtue of PACS. The turnaround time for the reporting has significantly brought down thought the speech to text technology which gives a doctor an authentication to release the report in no time, without any delay it reaches the patient or to the clinicians. The second example I can quote is our NAT testing. We’re the only healthcare facility in Mumbai which has started giving the NAT tested blood since 2009 and patients are getting safe blood transfusions in other hospitals by virtue of that facility. The other very good example I can quote from Information Technology is the way we have created our laboratory information system. Our lab results are equally like PACS, are getting transmitted to the patients and to the clinicians as soon as the tests are done and it is released by the doctor. And many of the other things we have integrated like patient payment system. The way demonetization has affected many hospitals, many facilities, but we had geared up long before. So we had facilities like online payment, kiosk payment, e-transfer, as well payment through different payment wallets and their gateways which has helped our patients to come across, during this difficult time, to avail treatment in our hospital.Mostly, even as we know that in Western world we follow the HIPAA compliance and HL7 standards which enables them to ensure data security. In our hospital we have ISO 27001 certification which is enabling us to give better data security. So systems and processes are in place. We have our in-house server, we have not put things in cloud which sometimes causes data leakage. So in some of these ways, we ensure data security and safety.Technology is going to play a very important role. Today, everyone is coming to the hospital and it has become a hospital centric care. But the days are not far when we have such a huge gap between demand and supply - to bridge the gap, technology will play a very important role. So, critical care as well as the chronic care is going to be rendered at patient home. It is going to be rendered in a virtual mode. So a system like disease management system, home care programmes will play a very important role and I am hopeful that this will be able to bridge the gap between demand and supply and some of the diagnostic services can be done at different kind of setup. So as a result of that, as we predict that India needs to have 10 lakhs made in next 10 years, so that kind of situation can be managed.Hinduja Hospital is a pioneer in terms of starting the home healthcare programme, way back in 2006. So since 2006, our professionals like doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, they visit our patient home, as and when it is required and it has become much more professionally designed. In 2009 when many of these companies had not yet started their operations in this country, at that time, we created a call center and through that network, we started receiving calls from the patient who wants to have blood collection, nursing care as well as physiotherapy services, doctor visits and consultations at their home. All these services at their home front and our everyday, the demand is also going up. In that way we are able to minimize the length of stay of the patients which is indirectly becoming beneficial for the patient because their treatment cost is also coming down."
"insulin: 'Diabetes cure comes a step closer', Health News, ET HealthWorld","London: Scientists are a step closer to finding a cure for diabetes, after they successfully created insulin-producing cells from skin using stem cell techniques.

Researchers at the University of Bergen in Norway have transformed skin puncture cells from diabetes patients into insulin-producing cells. Their aim is to transplant these cells under the skin of people with diabetes.

""This study is a step towards discovering how ""stand-in"" cells can secrete insulin in the body,"" said Helge Rader, professor at University of Bergen.

The researchers' goal is to replace insulin shots and blood sugar measurements with insulin-secreting cells capable of automatically secreting insulin in response to the blood sugar level.

This can become possible by implanting a capsule with tailor made cells in each diabetes patient.

""Our study is a step further in the spare part or regenerative medicine, where a lot may go wrong but where a successful approach may cure diabetes,"" Rader said.

There is an ongoing race between scientists trying to restore insulin secretion within the human body in diabetes patients, by artificially created insulin-producing cells.

""There is a big market out there for those who can commercialise successful treatment with this approach. Today 400 million people have diabetes worldwide,"" Rader added."
"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India’s high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM’s signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM’s housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India’s proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were “cashless”. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone’s case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government’s bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state’s chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‘Mob violence is unacceptable’ (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."
"Since Independence, the 10 'Greatest Achievements of India' that nobody is talking about!","14

Space program and defense program

Despite having almost nil self-reliance on defense technology and space technology, today we are one of the most advance nations in this field. Indians have been able to develop one of the most envious space programs in the world started in the year 1969 after their independence .To this day, we launched various space programs including Lunar and Mars mission, and on way to commercially launch satellites of developed nations at very low cost, all thanks to Indian Space Research Organization."
The right notes from the Red Fort,"The most remarkable thing about the PM’s speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day was its omission — of any reference to the ongoing standoff in neighbouring Bhutan, next to the where the borders of India, China and Bhutan meet, with the People’s Liberation Army. The rhetoric on the Chinese side had been met with firm refusal to comply with China’s demand that Indian troops withdraw, without any answering rhetoric from New Delhi. This tactic found its most obvious expression in the Prime Minister’s refusal to mention the word Dokalam in his speech. This is sound. India protects its interest and leaves it to China to act the aggressor.

PM Narendra Modi did not surprise anyone when he claimed that demonetisation has helped unearth black money and that his crackdown on black money will spare no one. The claims to be accelerating the pace of rail and road construction, too, were on predictable line. That he had to repeat the claim of bringing power to villages that had been kept dark till now, a major theme in his Independence Day speech last year, stands testimony to the challenge the last mile presents in such tasks. Where the PM broke new ground was in making an unequivocal commitment to social cohesion and rejection of jingoism. Violence in the name of faith is not acceptable, he said. This is most welcome.

He should keep saying this and get the state machinery to live up to this claim. Neither abuse nor bullets (na gaali se, na goli se) can solve the Kashmir problem, he said. We hope this sentiment will inform the response of the government and to the demand raised by Sangh Parivar outfits to end Kashmir’s special constitutional status.

More explicitly than in any of his three previous Independence Day speeches, the PM deployed India at 75 as the focus of his government, rather than the outcome of the next general elections. This lays the ground not only for schemes and the inspiration to build a New India but also for preparing the electorate for the continuity of a Modiled government all the way up to 2022. In sum, another bravura performance by the Prime Minister."
"Tech Firms With Indian CEOs, Founders Are Creating Record Number Of Jobs For Americans In US","Silicon Valley emerged as a hotspot for Indian software graduates in the 1970-80s. Ever since, they have broken the glass ceiling for immigrants, pushed the boundaries of technological innovation and many have secured highly visible positions of power.

From the likes of Vinod Khosla cofounding Sun Microsystems, to Sabeer Bhatia establishing Hotmail, to the new crop of leaders, including Sundar Pichai becoming the CEO of Google, Satya Nadella becoming the CEO of Microsoft, and most recently Jyoti Bansal selling his app performance management company App Dynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion, a long list of success stories have emerged over the years.

“I was in the US on an H-1B visa and I had to wait many years to get my Green Card before I could start a company of my own. If you already have an established start up in India, moving to Silicon Valley to establish a presence is a bit easier,” said Jyoti Bansal, founder of AppDynamics to ET.

Ajmer-born Bansal moved to US with dreams of setting up his own venture in 2000, but it took him seven years of working for other startups before he got the employment authorisation document that allowed him to launch his own company.

“The first challenge for Indian-origin founders is to overcome visa and immigration issues before they can start a business in Silicon Valley. And the most important ingredient missing is the lack of experience selling and marketing in US and international markets, but that will come over time,” Bansal said.

In 2016, according to the US Census Bureau, Indians stood out as the richest, as well as the most educated ethnic group in the country. Most recently, in an environment that’s becoming increasingly hostile, MadeByImmigrants was formed in association with the Amercian Civil Liberties Union.

This comes as US president Donald Trump has made his views clear on immigrants taking away local jobs. The project said immigrants had set up over 65 companies, creating over 500,000 jobs in US, with Indian entrepreneurs and those at a leadership level contributing close to 35 percent to 40 percent.

“At Google alone, 40 percent of the engineers are Indians, it’s common for quite a few of them to set out and start ventures on their own. Even at the leadership level there are Indians heading various verticals,” a senior executive at Google told ET at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, there were 89,000 Indians living in Silicon Valley in 2015, with most involved in the tech industry. Newer enterprise tech Indian startups Postman, Nutanix and Helpshift had to overcome a series of challenges ranging from insurance, office space, making local recruitments to adapting to cultural changes.

“Setting up shop in a new country can be complicated. Everything is a bit different--banks, insurance, ways of doing business. We found our investors, Nexus Venture Partners, who have a base in Silicon Valley, to be super helpful on recruitments, finding an office, business advice on day to day challenges,” said Abhinav Asthana, cofounder of Postman.

According to Abinash Tripathy, founder of Helpshift, the top two issues Indians face are adaptation to the culture and lack of a local network. “We are just starting to see the first generation of product startups emerge from India, which is very exciting,” said Tripathy.

“The process of the ecosystem maturing to the point where we will create globally competitive companies is a multi-decade process that has just started,” he said.

"Ramp up capacity to achieve 100GW solar target by 2022: Study, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: India will need to add over 15,000 MW solar capacity every year to achieve the target of 1,00,000 MW by 2022, a study has said.

The country's installed solar capacity fell short of target of 17,000 MW by the end of the financial year 2016-17, according to the joint study undertaken by NEC Technologies and industry body Assocham.

""The country will need to significantly ramp up the pace of solar capacity additions by 10,000 MW this fiscal and over 15,000 MW per year to meet the 2022 target of 1,00,000 MW (100GW), which the government set up in 2014,"" it said.

The biggest technological issue in terms of solar is the efficiency of solar cells, the study said.

""Currently, the efficiency ranges from 12-20 per cent, though this continues to improve. The rest of the energy striking the panel is either reflected or is wasted as heat. The main issue with efficiency is that higher efficiency solar panels cannot be commercially mass produced,"" it said.

To achieve the 1,00,000 GW target by 2022, the focus has slightly shifted from indigenous manufacturing as policies to curb the imports from other countries are not benefiting the domestic manufacturing.

Furthermore, the increase in taxes in the GST structure in solar from zero per cent to 5 per cent, coupled with reduced taxes in coal from 11.69 per cent to 5 per cent, may lead to slow adoption of solar in the Indian energy sector, the study said.

Lack of uniform policies across sectors and implementation issues is also an area of concern, it said.

""In India subsidy structure is complex and there are involvement of multiple agencies. Land allotment is a long procedure in India, which requires approvals at different levels from authorities.""

Currently, the foreign investment in Indian solar industry is less than 20 per cent, the report said.

Even 100 per cent FDI under automatic route and 74 per cent through foreign equity participation in a joint venture (without approval) have not paved the way for significant foreign investments in this sector, it added."
"Injectable tissue patch may help repair damaged heart, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The flexible tissue scaffold, shown here emerging from a glass pipette with a tip one millimetre wide, unfolds itself after injection into the body. (photo by Miles Montgomery and Rick Lu)

Toronto: Scientists have developed an injectable tissue bandage smaller than a postage stamp that can repair damaged hearts.

Repairing heart tissue destroyed by a heart attack or medical condition with regenerative cells or tissues usually requires invasive open-heart surgery.

Researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada have developed a technique that lets them use a small needle to inject a repair patch, without the need to open up the chest cavity.

The AngioChip is a tiny patch of heart tissue with its own blood vessels and heart cells beating with a regular rhythm.

""If an implant requires open-heart surgery, it's not going to be widely available to patients,"" said Milica Radisic from University of Toronto.

She said that after a heart attack, the heart's function is reduced so much that invasive procedures like open-heart surgery usually pose more risks than potential benefits.

Miles Montgomery, a PhD candidate in Radisic's lab, has spent nearly three years developing a patch that could be injected, rather than implanted.

Researchers found a design that matched the mechanical properties of the target tissue, and had the required shape- memory behaviour: as it emerges from the needle, the patch unfolds itself into a bandage-like shape.

""The shape-memory effect is based on physical properties, not chemical ones,"" said Radisic.

This means that the unfolding process does not require additional injections and would not be affected by the local conditions within the body.

The next step was to seed the patch with real heart cells. After letting them grow for a few days, they injected the patch into rats and pigs.

Not only does the injected patch unfold to nearly the same size as a patch implanted by more invasive methods, the heart cells survive the procedure well.

Over time, the scaffold will naturally break down, leaving behind the new tissue."
"Aggressive solar power bids may lead to capex pressure for players, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: With solar developers bidding aggressively at lower tariffs, they have little financial buffers to face challenges such as cost overrun, increased interest rate and counter-party delays, says India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).

According to the rating agency, falling panel prices and increased competition have contributed to aggressive bids.

""An increase in panel conversion efficiency has contributed to a reduction in land required for panels and a fall in the balance of system cost, resulting in lower bids,"" Ind-Ra said.

The analysis of the tariff of Rs 2.44 per unit of the Rewa project shows that it could have an equity internal rate of return of 10 per cent, it said.

""Risk allocation in tenders has taken centre stage in bids. Tenders floated consciously address payment security and grid curtailment to attract low bids. The Rewa bid started this trend. Solar Energy Corporation of India and NTPC have witnessed low bids from developers, because of the comfort derived from their credit profiles,"" the agency said.

Given the pace of solar capacity auctions, along with an emphasis on compliance with renewable purchase obligations, the utility scale solar capacity additions are likely to be in line with the targets of the Ministry of Power, it said.

However, Ind-Ra noted that the rooftop solar capacity installation is lagging behind ground-mounted installation owing to no concerted efforts to achieve targets.

Ind-Ra further said adverse financial conditions can derail renewable projects.

""Also, the grid curtailment risk, albeit likely to be temporary in nature, is a concern as renewable penetration increases. Against the backdrop of distribution utilities trying to reduce power purchase costs, the emerging threat of renegotiation and termination of power purchase agreements can derail developments in the sector,"" it said.

According to the agency, developers are favouring USD bonds for financing because of ease of placing large issuances.

""Rupee bonds for renewable projects have taken a backseat owing to investor perception of fast-changing dynamics and doubts about long-term sustainability,"" it said."
"solar products: GST implementation may hit solar capacity addition in 2018: Report, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: India has already installed more solar capacity in the first six months of 2017 than in the entire 2016, according to a report by Mercom Capital Group , which tracks the Indian solar sector.Around 4,800 MW has already been commissioned in calendar year 2017, against 4,038 MW in 2016. The report expected an addition of 10,500 MW through the year, which will be another record, almost twice the 5,525 MW added in financial year 2016-17. But 2018 is likely to be a different story because of confusion over applicability of the goods and services tax ( GST ) on solar products , the report warned.“We have reduced the 2018 forecast by approximately 15% due to uncertainty surrounding GST rates, which has resulted in a slowdown in tenders and auctions.”Initially, the government had maintained that all solar components would invite 5% GST, as reported by ET in its July 4 edition. Later, however, it clarified that only solar modules would be taxed at 5%; the other components would face 18% or 28%.“Government agencies have created an environment of chaos and uncertainty surrounding these rates. It has brought auction and PPA signing activities to a standstill as nobody wants to move forward without knowing what the GST rates are going to be,” Mercom added.The ministry of new and renewable energy is urging the finance ministry to stick to the earlier 5% for all solar equipment, but a decision has yet to be announced.The sharp fall in solar tariffs at the last auctions held in May this year has also become a dampener, according to the report. “States are postponing tenders and auctions as they angle for the lowest possible tariff, especially after the recent winning bid of Rs 2.44 per kwH in the Bhadla Solar Park auction.States are renegotiating power purchase agreements and want to re-tender to get closer to the lowest possible tariff.” Mercom said around 1,000 MW of tenders were cancelled in April-June. The report said the sharp fall in prices of Chinese solar cells and modules has brought down the cost of solar installation to Rs 4 crore per MW. It used to be over Rs 6 crore per MW even a year ago."

"Margin on revision knee surgery implants as high as 277%: NPPA, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The NPPA said the average total trade margin on Insert was 182 per cent priced between Rs 25,041 and Rs 57,583 whereas the landed price of the imported implant was between Rs 8,718 and Rs 18,234.

New Delhi, Aug 9 : Drug price regulator NPPA today said it has found average trade margins on various knee implants used in revision surgery to be as high as 277 per cent after analysing available market data.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said it analysed trade margins in the orthopaedic knee implants used in revision surgery cases based on available data from official sources, manufacturers and importers.

Sharing the data from the preliminary analysis on its website, the NPPA said the average total trade margin was found to be the highest in case of tibial plate at 277 per cent with MRP ranging from Rs 51,000 to Rs 1.65 lakh.

The margin to importer for the same was 65 per cent with landing price ranging from Rs 19,506 to Rs 32,032. The margin to distributor 128 per cent with minimum and maximum price to distributor ranging from Rs 22,293 to Rs 54,000.

The drug price regulator further found that the second highest average total trade margin was on patella at 219 per cent with MRP ranging between Rs 4,000 and Rs 20,000 although the landed price was between Rs 1,178 and Rs 5,022.

Similarly, the average total trade margin on femoral implant was 196 per cent with MRP between Rs 74,875 and Rs 2,67,500, while the landed prices ranged between Rs 27,877 and Rs 79,433.

The NPPA said the average total trade margin on Insert was 182 per cent priced between Rs 25,041 and Rs 57,583 whereas the landed price of the imported implant was between Rs 8,718 and Rs 18,234.

When contacted for comments, medical devices industry body MTaI said: ""This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the revision knee system and the data seems inaccurate.""

MTaI further said its members would review the NPPA data and ""issue a detailed and thoughtful response"".

In a revision knee surgery, a previously used implants are replaced by new ones.

Last week, the NPPA had invited comments from stakeholders for discussion after it found that the average trade margin on orthopaedic knee implants to be as high as 313 per cent. RKL AKT MKJ"
Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."
"pharmaceutical: No more freebies: India plans crackdown on marketing by drugmakers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","By Zeba Siddiqui

MUMBAI - India, one of the world's largest markets for pharmaceuticals, is drawing up its first set of marketing rules for drugmakers, restricting gifts and trips offered to doctors and pharmacists to 1,000 rupees ($15), according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters.

While such rules are common elsewhere in the world and adhered to by large pharmaceutical companies, they are not set in stone in India, where campaigners have long demanded a crackdown on unethical selling practices. These have included gifts ranging from electrical appliances to foreign junkets to encourage doctors and pharmacists to prescribe and stock certain medications.

Currently, India has only a voluntary marketing code that critics say is ineffective.

""In India, corruption and bribery of doctors is widespread,"" said Samiran Nundy, one of India's leading gastrointestinal surgeons. ""I've seen a range of ways in which this works, from presents to doctors to paying for them to attend conferences in places like Thailand.""

""It's great that marketing rules are coming into place, but there are a huge number of regulations in India that are not enforced,"" he added. ""I hope that these will be enforced.""

Apart from limiting marketing spending, the draft proposal drawn up the Department of Pharmaceuticals and being reviewed by India's law ministry would also forbid drugmakers from making misleading claims around the curative abilities and efficacy of drugs.

The rules also impose strict limitations on the number of trial samples offered to doctors.

An official at the Department of Pharmaceuticals declined to comment on the specifics of the draft, but told Reuters that the order was being reviewed.

The official, who asked not to be named, said no timeline has yet been set on the implementation of the new rules.

According to the draft seen by Reuters, a failure to abide by the rules will result in a marketing ban on a drugmaker for more than a year depending on the degree of the violation, and the confiscation of ""all packets of the highest selling brand of drugs"" made by that company.

The seized drugs will be handed over for use at government hospitals across the country.

Companies can turn a marketing suspension order into a cash fine, according to the proposal. They will have to pay penalties of between 500,000 rupees ($7,800) and 100,000,000 rupees ($1.56 million) to reverse a marketing suspension order, depending on the severity.

MANDATORY CODE

In a letter last year, Tapan Sen, a member of Rajya Sabha, urged the government to act on drafting a mandatory code on the marketing of pharmaceuticals, citing irregular practices by several companies.

Indian media reported that the letter said the country's largest drugmaker, Sun Pharma, Abbott India and privately-held Macleods Pharmaceuticals were among drugmakers found to have sent doctors on ""pleasure trips.""

Abbott said at the time that it had a strict policy against providing gifts and other incentives to doctors, while Macleods refuted the allegations.

A Sun spokesman told Reuters the company organises 'continuous medical education' programmes to educate doctors, not promote its products, and these are compliant with the voluntary marketing guidelines set by the government in 2015.

The current draft says companies will be allowed to organise screening camps or awareness campaigns at public health centres, but it bars advertising by stealth and mandates that doctors involved in such events be paid commensurate to their average daily income.

To ensure implementation of the rules, an 'Ethics Compliance Officer' of the rank of joint secretary to the Indian government would be appointed.

Pharmaceutical marketing practices have long been a subject of controversy globally. In India, where health insurance is scarce and many rely on pharmacists for medical advice, critics say sketchy practices have led to the over-prescription of strong cocktail drugs, causing drug-resistance.

GlaxoSmithKline was battered by a bribery scandal in China that landed it with a record $490 million fine in 2014.

It went on to slash the number of sales reps and overhaul its business globally, stopping sales-based incentives for drug reps and reducing paid junkets for doctors.

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."

Along with that and these facilities which we have taken will enable us to develop high pressure, high temperature blocks which we also have in our company's kitty. This will be a very good synergy for us to develop the gas fields which are with us on high pressure, high temperature.This block is already producing. Three wells have been been drilled earlier. The fourth well is under production and is producing gas, around 3 lakh cubic meters. The fifth well is being designed to do a hydrovac and drill. The entire activity is on. This block has to be drilled for about 30 wells by 2028-2029.It is about one TCF and we could recover out of this.It is very difficult at this point of time to answer because there are a lot of other discoveries in this particular block and only when we carry out lot of exploration in that zone that the entire potential can be assessed by us. As of now the only production is happening from one of the discoveries. Three wells were already there, fourth well is under production, the fifth is likely to be completed during the year and as we go along we have to drill more wells to complete the blocks. Apart from that, other discoveries in that particular block wherein we need to explore, do appraisals - it will take some time."

"Gorakhpur hospital deaths: Criminal negligence if anyone dies due to oxygen supply shortage: UP Health Minister, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh on Wednesday stated that it's a clear case of criminal negligence, if someone dies due to disruption in oxygen supply, adding that when Gorakhpur tragedy probe result comes, culprits won't be spared.

In a video conference with the Chief Medical Officer (CMO), the Associate Chief Medical Officer (ACMO) and the Hospital Secretary, Singh said flood relief check posts have been made in which every check post, doctors and teams have been deployed accordingly.

""During the time of surprise inspection at check posts, a doctor was suspended for absence from duty. As the flood water goes down, number of snakes increases in the area. Arrangements have been made for anti-snake venom. Chlorine tablets are being given so that people would get clean water for drinking,"" he said.

Singh said the Government has given Rs. 250 crore in total to every district's Chief Medical Officer so that money-related problems should not occur in future.

""The hospital were given money. If still medicines were not made available, then CMO and their teams will be held responsible for that,"" he said.

He further asserted that there was no lack of oxygen cylinders in Gorakhpur hospital, citing that no such report went to them.

""There is no as such treatment for Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), only personal cleanliness and precautions should be taken accordingly,"" he added.

Tragedy continued to descend upon Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital, as another child succumbed to encephalitis today, taking the death toll over 70 on Sunday.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has outrightly blamed the college principal, Rajiv Mishra, for laxity in performing his duty.

He also said that a team of top ministers was asked to determine if the death of the children was actually due to a disruption in oxygen supply at the hospital and assured to ""not spare anyone found guilty""."

"The 70s: Naxalbari, LSD, Poetry and the Emergency","It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven.

Or so we thought as we entered the seventies. Smoking weed; falling in love; writing poetry and dreaming of a new and just world order.

I had barely entered Presidency College when Naxalbari happened and classmates began to disappear.

They had gone to the forests, in the memorable words of Marxist poet Subhash Mukhopadhyay to fight a war for those who knew not how to. By coincidence, that was when my first book of poems appeared. I got married. All night I stayed awake translating the nine cantos of the Meghnad Badh Kavya, Michael Madhusudan Dutt’s 19th century epic. I did a day job as an office boy in 14 Bentinck Street where the Chinese shoe shops were.

Satyajit Ray’s Aranyer Din Ratri had just released. No one had known there was a sexual side to the Brahmo. Shombhu Mitra was still staging Dasachakra based on Ibsen’s Enemy of the People while Badal Sircar had discovered the Third Theatre and taken his plays out of the proscenium and on to the streets.

Shakti Chattopadhyay, then in his mid-thirties, was lying in the gutters, drunk as usual. His poems scribbled on torn sheets may yet outlive Tagore. Nikhil Biswas had died at 36, leaving behind 10,000 drawings. Yes, it was the best of times.

India was still recovering from the excitement of the Beatles visiting Rishikesh. Ravi Shankar was storming the West, with Yehudi Menuhin at times, with John Lennon other times. Rajneesh was shocking Bombay with his spiritual sermons on free sex.

Dylan’s harmonica rang in our ears as Blowing’ in the Wind played everywhere. Madhubala had just passed away. Zubin Mehta was conducting the LA Philharmonic. And I? I was smoking hash with Ginsberg and listening to Howl ‘midst the smell of burning flesh as funeral pyres lit up Calcutta’s night sky. Or strolling home at daybreak with the great Ustad after a nightlong concert. No, no one could sing the Malkauns like Amir Khan did.

We were all young then, full of anger and hope. We dreamt of a just world. We believed poverty could be fought and defeated. Che with his trademark beret stared down at us from red posters, though very few among us were actually Red. It was azaadi we yearned for. We protested against the Gulag as loudly as we raised our voice against Mai Lai.

I quit college. Not for politics but for poetry. Poetry, for me, was hope. It was azaadi from the tired clichés of politics. I started a magazine that brought together the best voices. Agyeya and Faiz, Muktibodh and Yevtushenko, Octavio Paz.

Brewing next door was a war. The young students of East Bengal took on the Pakistani army with the poetry of Shamsur Rahman echoing in their hearts: Freedom is a voice everyone hears; freedom is a voice everyone fears. I remember Kaifi telling students in Dhaka that poetry alone can win the war for them.

Around that time, a young man quit his job in Calcutta and caught a train to Bombay to try his luck at the movies. KA Abbas gave him his first break. But it took him a few more years and a film with Rajesh Khanna to be noticed.

A script by two young men, Salim and Javed defined his real role: the role of the Angry Young Man ready to set the skies on fire in his pursuit of hope and justice. It started with a small film called Zanjeer but soon went well beyond cinema. It defined the indomitable spirit of the seventies and raised its richest baritone: Rage.

The rhetoric of non violence had already tired. The young were seeking hope, a new Utopia in a world without answers. Doubt and dilemma dogged them. That is when Bachchan picked up the gauntlet and showed them the way out. India found a new hero. He stood up for the weak and the poor. He fought against injustice and crime. And yes, he was violent when violence was required. He was the new moral compass, the voice that whispered in our ears: Fight back.

The long war in Vietnam had ended. Free Bangladesh was born by the will of its young writers and poets. And India showed it will not cower before the Emergency, come what may. It was a reassertion of our will. The left, the right, everyone got together to fight back the darkness. Till Mrs Gandhi submitted to the will of the people.

The eighties came with the assassination of John Lennon. Andrei Sakharov was arrested in Moscow. The Rubik’s Cube arrived. So did the first 24 hours news channel by CNN. Mrs Gandhi returned to power. Mikhail Gorbachev broke the Kremlin’s grip. The USSR was no more the USSR. Pac-Man took Japan by storm. Led Zeppelin broke up. And Uttam Kumar died. So did Mohammed Rafi. And Sahir.

By then I had married again. The Emergency was over. Mrs Gandhi was back in power just one day before my birthday. Naxalbari was also over. My poetry gave way to journalism.

Two years later, Kapil brought home the World Cup. I moved to Bombay. Amitabh won an election and went to Parliament. (I made the same mistake a decade later.) Bofors broke out. And the world as we knew it had changed forever.

The seventies was about freedom, hope, courage. Each one of us against the world, living out our bravest moment. Will that ever come back again? I doubt it."
Shraddha Took A Pay Cut To Star In 'Saaho' With Prabhas & The Pay-Gap Between Them Is Whopping!,"Prabhas became a star in the eyes of the entire world with just one project, the magnum opus Baahubali. And since the time the second part of the movie has released, people have been longing to see his next film. And more than that, fans are excited to know who he is paired alongside.

After a lot of speculations and so many names doing the rounds, it was revealed that Bollywood actress Shraddha Kapoor has been roped in for the role, but fans were apparently disappointed by the same.

But did you know that Shraddha Kapoor was approached for the role earlier as well? In fact, she was one of the few first choices of the filmmaker. But since she, reportedly, demanded a huge sum of money, things didn’t work out.

It is said that Shraddha had demanded Rs 12 crore. Since the movie is going to be shot in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi simultaneously, hence, Shraddha who takes Rs 4 crore for a Hindi film, demanded thrice the amount.

Now that she has signed the deal, wondering how much she is getting paid? Rumour has it that the actress has taken a pay-cut and is taking home Rs 9 crore.

#Prabhas #stylish #prabhasraju #darlingprabhas #instadaily #photooftheday 😎 A post shared by Srikanth Prabhas (@srikanth4prabhas) on Aug 15, 2017 at 8:32pm PDT

Curious to know what’s Prabhas’ remuneration for the movie is? If reports are to be believed, the handsome hunk is taking Rs 30 crore. And that’s more than triple the amount Shraddha is taking.

“Saaho will be shot in Mumbai, Abu Dhabi and Romania and every character in the film has many shades but Prabhas himself will be seen in a never-seen-before avatar and will be seen doing lots of modern-day action and will be undergoing training,” a source told Pinkvilla.

The movie also stars Neil Nitin Mukesh in a villainous role, and he has promised that Saaho is going to be the biggest action film of 2018.

The Eternal Quest,"Many aspirants begin their spiritual journey with great enthusiasm but somewhere along the way, they slow down or get confused. GURUDEVSHRI RAKESHBHAI says the pause helps you scrutinise your religious activities and understand your true intentions



Pursuit of liberation begins with a desire for it.However, one wonders if man has the genuine desire for it.He is easily satisfied doing a few religious activities, and although he expects liberation, he lacks a genuine desire for it. Generally, one eats food when one feels hungry. But in our modern-day pseudo-lifestyle, meal times are fixed. You never ask the body whether it is hungry or not.You know it is time to eat, so you eat. Such ‘hunger’ can be false. Mere thinking about mealtimes can make you falsely believe that you are hungry. Try this experiment.Ask someone at home to turn the clock to make it an hour early so it shows 1 pm, your regular mealtime, when it is actually noon. Looking at the clock, you will spontaneously feel hungry! Now, try making it an hour late so it shows noon when it is actually 1 pm. On that day, you will feel hungry later! If looking at the clock determines your hunger,your hunger is artificial;it is not real.It is only a mental need,not physical.In the same way,religious activities without a yearning for liberation are only mental demands, not the need of the soul; they are emotional outbursts triggered by external circumstances.



You Want Both



Dig a little deeper into your desire for light and you will realise that you want both, the illumination of enlightenment and the darkness of worldliness. On the one hand, you say you don’t need the world, that you want only the bliss of the soul.Yet, for happiness, you run towards the world. In short, you don’t wish to become free from darkness, yet you wait for illumination to happen. Don’t you realise that without wanting to remove the darkness,you cannot light your lamp? First, realise that you actually want darkness alone.You have always hoped to acquire joy from darkness alone and fear that illumination will shatter your dream world.You love worldliness alone, yet you believe, and make others believe that you want liberation. You speak of liberation but to become happy, instead of bringing changes in yourself, you try changing the world.You speak of liberation only to comfortably live in the world. How will you light the lamp if you are so attached to darkness? Even if someone tries to light it for you, you soon blow it out.Even when someone shows compassion towards you, it does not make a difference.You are in love with darkness and wish to live in that alone. Enlightened ones have showered compassion upon you in the past.The sun itself has come knocking at your door, but you choose to hide in your darkness.You know that with light,your desire and hope from darkness will be destroyed. So you fear light.As long as you have even a bit of inclination to acquire from darkness,you will not let the lamp be illumined. You are so dishonest that you are not ready to accept the way you are.You do not want to accept that, ‘I want to live in darkness alone. I want happiness from worldly objects and events.’You join those who speak about light and show how interested you are in it, but you want to live in darkness alone. If you accept that you are merely talking about light and are not really interested in it,one can find a way out.You love darkness but you want to show that you are a lover of light.You can’t give up your attraction of being called religious for there is reputation and honour associated with it. Your attraction for this honour linked with religiousness makes you start pretending to be religious.You actually use religion to hide your flaws.Showing aspiration for illumination,you continue to hide your delusion. Your cry for light is merely to hide your passion for darkness.There is no inner transformation. You still want to make changes in the outside to gain joy and peace. There were two friends fishing on the banks of a lake. Seeing the lake-supervisor approach, one of the friends started running.The supervisor chased him, caught him after a mile and a half and said,“You will be prosecuted for fishing without a fishing licence.”The man immediately took out his licence from his pocket and showed it to the supervisor.The supervisor was surprised and said, “If you had the licence, why did you run?”The man said,“I had the licence, but my friend didn’t!” This man ran far away from the spot so that his friend could escape and hide.The same thing happens in your mental world.To conceal your wrong inclinations,you act pious.This is the ‘benefit’ of being ‘religious’ without truly yearning for liberation! No one will doubt you. If you want transformation, catch your desires. Go to their roots. Start accepting your flaws.That is the first step towards liberation.



Stop Self-deception



Many approach me for learning how to meditate because they want inner peace. But they show no enthusiasm in fulfilling the conditions necessary for meditation. Only a true customer is ready to pay the price, for he knows the real value of liberation.If you want liberation without paying its price, you are a beggar asking,‘teach me meditation, give me satsang, show me the means.’ But when it comes to putting anything at stake, you withdraw. You complain that ‘I have a lot of difficulties.Once everything is set,I will begin the pursuit of liberation.’Amidst the chase for wealth,power, family, status, reputation, you are stranded. Stop deceiving yourself — if you genuinely desired liberation,you would have given up everything and worked for liberation alone.



Turn Within



Only when you turn within, you experience bliss. A mind wandering outside can never be happy or peaceful. It gets sorrow wherever it goes. In spite of wealth,status,relations you have remained unhappy and wounded within. As long as you are living with the belief that,‘I will get happiness from the other’,you will remain sorrowful.Happiness is your nature, so by focusing within and staying steady within, you will experience it. If happiness were to come from the other,why haven’t you found it till now? Many times you have extended your begging bowl in front of others, and sometimes had some good fortune too,yet,why have you not been happy? Don’t you realise that those you beg from are beggars themselves, begging from you and others? If indeed they had happiness,why would they demand from you? All in the world are asking for happiness, yet no one is seen receiving it because asking itself is a mistake. By asking,you continue being outside. You forget that what you are asking is your own inherent nature.What is missing is identification with it. Turn towards the Source,your true Self, for happiness is religion; to turn outwards for happiness is being irreligious. None have ever gained happiness from outside, and those who have turned within have never failed to experience bliss.Even though their ways have been different — some by dancing, some by sitting in meditation,some through devotion and some through knowledge, but the direction was the same,for their destination was the same, the Self.Where there is forgetfulness of the Self, there is suffering.Where there is awareness of the Self, there is bliss. By remaining outside, you will gain nothing, and by turning within, nothing will remain to gain.

"Amateur Boxer, Intern, Traveler - Here’s How Maria Sharapova Spent Her Time Away From Tennis","Maria Sharapova is not just a tennis player. She's a supermodel, an entertainer with a wacky sense of humour and also a business owner. When the World Anti Doping Agency slammed a ban on her for consuming contentious substance meldonium, everyone wondered how she would keep herself busy. But she did manage to remain in the limelight by hook or by crook.

Now that she's all set to return to the tennis court with a wild card entry at the US Open, we bring you all the dope on what Maria was up to for so long

Internship With The NBA In Manhattan

Twitter

Basketball after tennis? Really? Was she really mulling over a switch in sport discipline? Soon after the ban was imposed, Sharapova was spotted in Manhattan for a three-day internship with the National Basketball Association. She worked closely with NBA commissioner Adam Silver. Moreover, she also gained some work experience at an advertising agency in London. She was working with VCCP in central London.

Back To Student Life

Twitter

Maria already owns a business line called Sugarpova. And picking up more business skills is highly imperative. So she joined the Harvard Business School. She took to Facebook to announce her entry into the school. She said, """"Another day at school, and another 5.30 am wake up call. Here I am checking out the campus and getting my morning fix.""

Amateur Boxer. Well...

From tennis to basketball to boxing? Maria Sharapova is quite enthusiastic about all sport disciplines. (Just that she doesn't know who Sachin Tendulkar is). During her ban days, she dared to glove-up and post a photo on Instagram where he is seen packing a punch. We almost expected her to hit the ring.

Travel is part of Maria's professional life. She travels to USA, Britain, France and Australia for obvious reasons. But as she waited for her ban to be lifted, she went around the world - Italy and New York being her pick of the destinations.

Now where would Maria travel? US Open, of course."

The grandfather and the pioneer in the family, Captain Jai Dev Bhasin, was among the first seven pilots in the country to become a commander in 1954. When his future daughter-in-law Nivedita Jain joined his company, Indian Airlines, she was the third woman to do so. Today, she and her husband Captain Rohit Bhasin are proud parents of two young commanders, Rohan and Niharika Bhasin.

""I was at a friend's birthday party when my father came running with an appointment letter for me from Indian Airlines. The day is etched in my memory. It was June 29, 1984,"" she says. She was just 20 when she received the letter and in the next 11 years, went on to achieve her most cherished career milestones. At 26, already a mother of a one-year-old, she received her command on a Boeing 737, becoming the youngest woman captain of a jet plane in the world. Seven years later when she became a commander on Airbus 300, one of the bigger air craft then in the world and also the first-ever wide-body aircraft, it would be the culmination of her dreams.

She also became a trendsetter when she co-piloted the world's first ever all-woman crew flight with a Fokker Friendship aircraft on the Calcutta-Silchar route in 1985.

Her feats set her apart and her children say they were in awe of her from their early days.

""As a a child I used to keep looking at her while she was getting ready for work and I really wanted to dress up like that one day,"" says Niharika, 26, who has been flying with IndiGo for over four years and received her command on the Airbus A320 recently. Not having their parents around all the time during their childhood did not bother the siblings as it was the only normal they knew. That has changed since they started flying.

""I realise now how difficult it would have been to coordinate flying and bringing up two children. They made it seem so smooth, but in all honesty it's not,"" Niharika says.

Nivedita Bhasin was the first pilot in her company to become a mother and it was in the years following her first child that the company instituted a policy on maternity leave. The mother admits that there were times she thought of quitting the profession, especially when her children were nearing adolescence, but she was not ready to give up on a dream she had struggled to achieve. That dream and passion were passed on to the offspring, who say that the thought of pursuing any other career never crossed their minds.

"Drug Controller General of India: DCGI mulls alternatives to China active pharmaceutical ingredients, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has got local drugmakers to draw up an emergency plan on dealing with any blockade on shipments from China of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ), or raw materials used to make medicines, in the event of border tensions escalating. Indian companies get most of their APIs from China.A meeting last month had discussed how India could be prepared in a “worst-case” scenario that could lead to a scarcity of imported APIs, said a senior government official. “The government has identified important therapeutic segments for which molecules are (mostly) imported (from China),” said the official. The meeting was attended by various industry association groups of both multinational and Indian drug makers. “The agenda of the meeting was to understand what measures the government could take to support the domestic industry and encourage it to manufacture these products.”The Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), a lobby group of domestic pharma firms, recently submitted a six-page action plan listing various measures that the Indian government should implement to reduce dependence on APIs from China. ET has seen a copy of this.This includes higher registration fees on imports and increased inspections of APIs from China. It has also asked the government to explore alternative sources for raw materials, especially essential therapies such as anti-infective drugs. Additionally, it has suggested the revival of state-owned units such as Hindustan Antibiotics that can produce essential raw materials in an emergency.“At present India is not able to manufacture many important drugs due to low-priced imports from China. In order to be ready for any future emergency, we need to have at least some capacities created for a few of the drugs which are identified as essential for the country. In this way, in case of any emergency, all that we need to do is to increase capacity of the same in a short time,” IDMA said in the letter to the drug controller. “We should further ensure that companies are advised to maintain three-six months stock of APIs/intermediates that are imported from China.” There was no response to emails sent to the DCGI on Monday. IDMA didn’t respond to queries.India imports about 84% of the APIs it needs, according to officials in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization. It got APIs worth Rs 13,853 crore from China in FY16, or 65.3% of the Rs 21,217-crore total. This included ingredients for essential antibiotics.Industry groups have suggested the government enter into agreements with friendly nations for supply of key medicines and APIs in the categories specified above.“There is a concern that if the tensions continue over the border issue, this will hit pharma sector and it is worrying because we do not even have the API capacity to manufacture a paracetamol,” said an executive who was at the meeting mentioned above.“But because Indian companies do not have any support from the government to produce APIs, we are losing out to China.” Though India is a leader in finished generic drugs, China is a preferred source for APIs because of price."
Bullying madrasas to celebrate Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic,"Inbound VP Venkaiah Naidu has disagreed with outbound VP Hamid Ansari over “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” creeping in among the minorities in India. Naidu says this kind of talk is just political propaganda. He says “compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due.” Perhaps the disagreement is over what exactly is “their due”. Selective food bans, anti-conversion and ghar wapsi crusades, vigilantism and ‘beef’ lynchings?

Priti Gandhi, national executive member of the BJP Mahila Morcha, has a more aggressive challenge for Ansari: “For 10 years my Hindu majority nation accepted you with open arms, placed you at the pinnacle of power and you still feel uneasy. Agenda kya hai?” Perhaps the agenda is educating the “Hindu majority” about how its condescension is neither fair nor merited. How dare you expect minorities to act as supplicants or servile? Listen up your citizenship is not of a higher order.

In its very first year the Modi government had caused a great upset by declaring Christmas Day as Good Governance Day. This year it selected Good Friday as Digital India Day. It’s true that India’s religious calendar is very crowded but it’s also true that Diwali hasn’t been declared Ujjwala Bharat Diwas for which maybe all schools and government offices could stay open. Holi also remains a holiday. The discrimination is manifest.

And now even Independence Day is being sullied. In Uttar Pradesh state-aided madrassas have been told to submit video footage of Independence Day functions to minority welfare officers in all districts of the state. Going back to Ansari’s point, surely this kind of blatant targeting is cause for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” among the minorities. The show of distrust can hardly engender trust.

BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has said with a tellingly raw crudeness, “At a time when the spectre of radical Islam is a threat to the community, Muslims should welcome the move rather than place religion over nation. Respect for national symbols is non-negotiable.” This is such a shamelessly majoritarian party line. Telling Muslims what they should feel (grateful). Setting “non-negotiable” conditions for their Indianness. And of course using the spectre of radical Islam to try to push the minority into a meek corner. But bullying someone into celebrating Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic. It kind of rubs in an absence of freedoms. And that is sound reason for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity”."

The government is also working on ways to refund patients who were unfairly charged for reused devices, he announced in the legislative council on Tuesday.Moreover, to prevent such incidents from recurring in hospitals, the state government plans to develop a web portal that will record every medical device’s journey—right from its purchase to use and re-use.“The web portal will keep a track of each medical device from the moment it is purchased, the medical institute it is sold to, and its use,” said Bapat, replying to a query raised by Congress MLC Satej Patil during question hour. The minister added that discussions with the Medical Council of India, the Drug Council of India and secretary of the public health department on the issue are in the final stages.The announcement follows special investigations by the state Food and Drug Administration in May-June that showed many private hospitals charged premium charges from patients for reused cardiac catheters and guidewires; most of these devices are only meant for single use.In April, the state FDA had found three city hospitals guilty of not only reusing medical devices meant for single use, but also charging multiple patients for the same. Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi, which is managed by the Fortis group, and BSES Hospital in Andheri were later issued show-cause notices for violating the Drug and Cosmetics Act.On Tuesday, when Patil pointed out that a few hospitals have already reused implant devices and cheated patients, the minister assured him that the government would get information about such cases and refund those patients."
"renewable energy production: Karnataka at 3rd spot in renewable energy production, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Bengaluru: Karnataka has overtaken Gujarat to become the third highest producer of renewable energy after Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.The state, which occupied the fourth position last year, has outranked Gujarat in the recently released progress report of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy Energy minister D K Shivakumar said in a tweet: ""At 7,458MW, Karnataka now has the 3rd highest installed capacity in renewable energy. We will soon surpass Maharashtra to become 2nd in India."" The neighbouring Tamil Nadu is on top with 10,625 MW.G V Balaram, MD of Karnataka Renewable Energy Devlopment, said with the development of Asia's biggest solar park at Pavagada in Tumakuru district, they were confident of clinching the number one spot by April 2018. Farmers have voluntarily contributed over 12,000 acres for the project, which is estimated to cost Rs 20,000 crore.What led to the paradigm shift? ""The third rank among 29 states follows a marked shift in policy. Strong government support coupled with an attractive renewable energy policy has propelled Karnataka to the third place,"" Balaram said.He said the turnaround was possible because of increased targets fixed by Union ministry of renewable energy at 175 GW (gigawatts) by 2022. The Karnataka government revised its policy twice and set an ambitious target of solar energy generation at 6,000MW by March 2022 while the state's solar power potential is estimated to be above 24,700 MW.""Wind and solar energy have received good response, and the state has added 3,200 MW from renewable energy sources in the past four years. This year, we will add 3,000MW from solar power alone,"" he added.At present, he said Karnataka is the only state to provide such a lucrative proposition for solar power adoption. The state government acts as a major facilitator to bridge the energy demand and supply gap and supply power to the grid. Solar energy is getting cheaper by the year and in some time, it would be cheaper than the electricity grid,"" Balaram added""The favourable policy has also enabled large corporates to buy significant proportion of their power from solar farms at a discount to supply to grids under long-term contracts with solar developers,"" said Mahesh Raviraj, an executive associated with a reputable solar company.The Karnataka government is also working with farmers to lease their land for solar and wind power generation and make them stakeholders in the energy future. When it comes to cogeneration (use of power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time) and biomass generation, Karnataka is growing faster than other states."

"'Rot is deep' at Indian hospital where 85 children died, Health News, ET HealthWorld","A lady mourns the death of a child at BRD Medical College. (Source: Getty)

Gorakhpur: Inside the decrepit children's ward at an Indian hospital where 85 infants died last week, Ram Prasad prayed his two-year-old daughter would escape the same fate as he scanned the overcrowded hallways for a doctor

His plight in 'ward 100', where the death of so many children has sparked outrage, is emblematic of a healthcare crisis where doctors are stretched to breaking point and hospitals run out of oxygen due to unpaid bills.

Authorities have launched an inquiry into the causes of the oxygen disruption at the now-notorious Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur, which Indian media has linked to the deaths of 30 infants last Thursday and Friday.

Local officials have blamed an outbreak of encephalitis for the deaths and denied a lack of oxygen was responsible.

But doctors and medical experts point to woeful underfunding in public health in eastern Uttar Pradesh, one of India's poorest regions, where just a handful of specialists are available to treat millions.

""This (deaths) won't change soon, as it isn't a simple oxygen issue. The rot is deep and the system needs to be overhauled,"" a senior hospital official told AFP in Gorakhpur, speaking on condition of anonymity.

India was spending just 1.4 percent of its GDP on public health in 2014 -- far below the global average of six percent.

In Gorakhpur, there are just 529 primary health care clinics -- less than half the number needed to cater for nearly 4.5 million people living in the district, July data from Brookings India shows.

There are just five paediatricians and 22 encephalitis treatment centres, despite the mosquito-borne illness wreaking havoc in low-lying areas of the state every year during the monsoon.

India's most populous states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are ravaged by encephalitis every year.

The disease, which affects mainly malnourished children, causes brain inflammation and can result in headaches, seizures, fever and even brain damage.

Professor K.P Kushwaha, who headed Baba Raghav Das Medical College until mid-2015, said the hospital could not cope with the volume of patients.

""The government now needs to make at least five such hospitals across the region to tackle this load and get better results,"" he told AFP.

- Life and death -

Prasad, a poor farmer from Uttar Pradesh, travelled roughly 65 kilometres (40 miles) with his wife and two-year-old daughter after the infant suddenly ran a high fever.

He arrived at Baba Raghav Das Medical College just hours after hospital authorities declared that another 25 infants had died over the weekend.

Prasad's daughter was found a bed in the overcrowded ward, where many parents were forced to squat on the floor in nearby corridors. It was worse in the neo-natal unit, where three to four infants crowded a single bed.

""We take turns to go out in the corridor and hall to rest, while the other one stands here,"" Prasad told AFP, gesturing to his wife and ill daughter.

""She probably has pneumonia, I don't know, the doctors haven't told me anything.""

Just days earlier, panicked parents used manual pumps to help their stricken children as the supply of oxygen fizzled out.

Professor K.P Kushwaha's successor was stood down over the oxygen debacle, which allegedly stemmed from nearly $100,000 in overdue bills, some dating back to November.

His replacement, P.K Singh, promised conditions at the hospital would improve ""whatever the shortcomings"".

""I understand that the hygiene situation here is very bad and there is a risk of infection,"" Singh told AFP.

But the district's chief medical officer Ravindra Kumar told AFP nothing could change as long as encephalitis plagued the poor eastern region.

""So far we have only been shooting in the dark without much idea about its causes, prevention or the cure,"" he told AFP.

A lack of primary health centres meant illnesses were not detected early and by the time patients arrived at hospitals it was too late, said a local government official, gesturing to beds full of sickly children.

""If people like them get the right advice and prompt referral, it can make the difference between life and death,"" he told AFP on condition of anonymity."

Rohit intends a ""behind the scene"" role as India's new ODI deputy

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:28 PM

Rohit Sharma, the India ODI team's newly-appointed vice-captain, said he was honoured to be named the deputy to Virat Kohli for the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. He also added that the role will be a little bit more backstage compared to what he does with the Mumbai Indians, where he is the captain.

""It is a huge honour to be appointed as the vice-captain,"" Rohit said after the team's optional practice session in Pallekele on Wednesday (August 16). ""Ten years ago, I was only thinking of playing for India. Being the vice-captain now feels really, really good. It's a kind of honour that whenever the opportunity comes - the first One-Dayer, when we come [play] on August 20 - there will be some sort of role that I will need to play, and I am looking forward to it. I am not thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment as of now. Yes, it will be a good opportunity for me to get on to the field.

""It's a different ball game completely. IPL and when you come and play international cricket, it is completely different. But again, the excitement and the energy level is the same. So yes, nothing changes too much. I am the vice-captain here, there I was the captain, so I was more in front. Here I have to play a little behind-the-scene role. But yes, I will be very excited to step on to the field as the vice-captain of the Indian team.""

Rohit was one of the three players who turned up for the optional practice session, alongside KL Rahul and Axar Patel. The opener was seen playing a number of sweeps and reverse-sweeps against the net bowlers. Rohit hinted that the shots were part of a plan to counter Lasith Malinga.

""Everyday is a learning day, today I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse-sweeps when someone like Malinga comes and bowls to you. It is something that the game demands these days. You got to be innovative and you got to play different kind of shots to get maximum results. You keep learning every day and I keep trying these things and learn about things I can do and things I cannot do. Every addition to your armoury is good and I am trying to see what I can add to my armoury. What better place than coming here and doing it; that's what training sessions are all about. Come here, improve your skills, and try and get better as a player,"" he added.

Speaking about India's opponents, Sri Lanka, Rohit said they were a dangerous side, as evidenced by their victory over India in the Champions Trophy, but added that India would look to stick to their strengths.

""I have no idea about the squad for this ODI series, but what they had in the Champions Trophy was a very good side. They beat us quite comfortably. So you know in One-Day cricket, they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing for the past few years. We got to stick to our strength.

""We have been playing good cricket. West Indies was good, Champions Trophy was good except for one day - but that can happen - but in the past two years, we have played some consistent cricket in the ODI format. As far as I am concerned, we need to look at what we need to do as a team and bring out the best on the field. That's what we did in the recent Test series. We just focused on what we need to do as a group and that has always been the talk. We need to focus on our ability and strengths,"" he said.

India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.“We should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.“We are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,“ Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."

"Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 6 Gets Leaked, HBO Spain Plays It ‘By Mistake For One Hour’!","Spoiler Alert: This article contains spoilers from Game of Thrones season 7 episode 6. Read ahead at your own risk.

The Game of Thrones fever is so high that the fantasy drama has fans all around the world. So much that it has also become the most pirated show, but even that has not stopped the show from continuing to put people into frenzy.

After the recent episodes were leaked from the currently being aired seventh season and four people from Mumbai were arrested in the same regard, there comes another twist. The leak has been traced to the Prime Focus Technologies’ office in Bengaluru. The company is involved in the digital content of the series for Hotstar.

HBO Twitter

Another episode, the sixth one, has also been leaked, and what’s even more shocking is that it was “by mistake” aired on HBO Spain for one hour. Yes, that happened, and we are wondering what’s going wrong, too. The channel wanted to air episode 6, but by mistake, it aired the seventh one entirely (71-minute long episode.)

Fans shared the video clips speculating how the episode must have leaked. Reportedly, one of the Instagram users live-streamed the entire episode.

There are major spoilers ahead. Warning you, again.

What’s more? According to Business Insider, episode 7 has also been leaked already.

If you’re a true GoT fan, you might want to wait for the episode to air on time and watch it in full. The curiosity is killing the cat, though.

Why Our Ancient Ancestors Slept Less Than Us But Had More Energy Than We Do,"The presence constant light emanating from artificial sources such as our light bulbs and the fully lit screens of our smartphones often get blamed for the discrepancies in our sleep patterns. Although, there is truth in that we should be holding our ancestors more accountable for feeling sleepy at odd hours or not feeling 'refreshed' after a full nights sleep says a recent study.

maeemdia.com

You’d think our ancient ancestors got at least eight hours of solid sleep in a cave, right? Well, it turns out our ancestors had to take regular short bouts of naps during the day and stay up for short periods during the night to keep a look out for predators and other rival groups of humans.

The study published in the Proceedings of the Royals Society B indicates that their sleeping pattern ensures that one or some people remained awake while the others slept; making sure the person asleep (the more vulnerable to attack) is being looked out for.

keywordsuggest.org

The researchers from the University of Toronto studied the sleep patterns of the Hadza People of the Tanzania who still live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that originated thousands of years ago.

After monitoring their sleep patterns over 20 days and nights they found that there were only 18 minutes when all 33 tribe members were asleep at the same time. There were at least eight people on an average that remain awake through the night at a given time.

The researchers also stated the younger Hadza lot were termed as ‘owls’ since they stayed up late during their procreation years and the grandparents were referred to as ‘larks’ because they woke up early and sleep poorly.

“Researchers have theorized that one of the reasons grandparents live so long past their reproductive years is that their function is to take care of grandchildren,” says David Samson, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. “Our hypothesis is that their lark behaviour and shorter sleep times serve a function: the elders serve as sentinels at the times of day when others are sleeping. Therefore, it’s important to have people of all ages in any population.”

Whether you’re a young adult or an older one the only way to get complete sleep is to nap in short bouts after all!

Sarahah Creator Is Thankful Of Indians Who Taught Him Programming & Proud They're Using The App,"You’ve likely heard of Sarahah by now, seen a few posts shared by friends, maybe even tried out the app yourself. In fact, you may even be tired of all the shenanigans Sarahah's causing. But there’s at least one more detail that should interest you.

The Saudi Arabian developer who created the app, Zain al-Abdin Tawfiq, says he was actually set on his way by Indian programmers.

In an interview with India Today, Tawfiq mentioned how happy he was that Sarahah eventually reached India. “The first company that I worked for, actually the only IT company that I ever worked for, was Wipro. And I am very proud and happy to see Indians coming to Sarahah. Indians have taught me programming in university, Indians have taught me programming in the company.”

Tawfiq also says his team has a lot of features planned for the app in future, though he didn’t elaborate. However, he’s also forced to touch on the privacy concerns surrounding the app. After all, people are worried about their identities being revealed on an app where they’re given the benefit of remaining anonymous. Tawfiq insists the app will never reveal the identity of a message sender unless they have their permission, except in cases where their terms of service are violated.

There’s really no saying just how long Sarahah will remain in the spotlight. And if it does eventually fade, will Tawfiq be able to reinvent himself and push forward another app of his design? Only time will tell.

"CIL floats first tender to supply coal under SHAKTI scheme, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi, Aug 8 () State-owned Coal India has floated the first tender operationalising SHAKTI scheme providing coal linkage to thermal power projects through the auction route.

According to the tender document, the bidders will have to submit their expression of interest by August 14, 2017, for seeking coal supplies.

Earlier in May this year, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved ""fading away of the existing LoA-FSA regime and introduction of a new more transparent coal allocation policy for power sector, 2017-SHAKTI (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India).

The move is likely to ease stress on account of non- availability of linkages to power sector projects.

According to the tender, all those bidders that have already concluded PPAs (power purchase agreements) will be eligible, which have been adopted or approved by the appropriate regulatory commission on or before May 17, 2017.

The existing coal linkage holders are not allowed to surrender their letter of assurance (LoA) or fuel supply agreements (FSAs) to participate in this auction.

Thermal power projects, part of 78,000 mw, which could not be commissioned by March 31, 2015, are eligible for coal withdrawal if the plants are commissioned before March 31, 2022, under the scheme.

The coal supply to the TPPs has been made in line with the provisions of the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP), 2007.

Till 2010, Coal India (CIL) issued LoA for approximately 1,08,000 mw capacity and no new LoAs were issued thereafter due to the prevailing scarcity. The CCEA in 2013 had directed CIL to sign FSAs with thermal plants of about 78,000 mw capacity.

In an attempt to cut power purchase cost, Gujarat has also invited tenders to buy coal-based electricity from independent power producers that would agree to sell power at less than Rs 2.82 per unit.

The reverse auction for procuring 1,000 mw of power through this mechanism will be held on September 8.

A power ministry official said the move is expected to bring some respite to power plants, with a total estimated capacity of 28,000 mw, which do not have regular fuel supply arrangements with Coal India.

In May, 2016, the Union Cabinet had approved the proposal for allowing flexibility in utilisation of domestic coal among power generating stations.

The methodology for use of transferred coal in independent power producers (IPPs) was issued by the Ministry of Power on February 20, 2017, and the Gujarat tender follows this."

"Gorakhpur tragedy: AIIMS to unburden BRD Hospital in 2019, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur is not just another hospital. It is the only hospital in the Poorvanchal region catering to 10 crore people in eastern UP, western Bihar and even the Tarai regions of Nepal. Nearly 5,000 fresh patients, many of them children, come to this 950-bed hospital daily, most at virtually the last stage of the deadly vector-borne disease, Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES).While the jury is out on whether deaths of 60 children at BRD in five days were due to disruption in oxygen supply or medical causes, the bad news from Gorakhpur is not likely to cease for another two years till the proposed AIIMS comes up here. It is criminal neglect on the part of successive governments at the Centre and in the state that in the last three decades that more than one lakh kids have died in Poorvanchal due to AES and more than a third of them breathed their last at BRD.Needless to say that along with an AIIMS, what is needed in Gorakhpur is a full-fledged viral research centre to develop a vaccine for AES and a protocol to fight the disease. Close to 1,000 children are dying every year at BRD due to AES as mosquitos and polluted water inflict children with the deadly virus post-monsoon. Union health minister JP Nadda has now approved building a research centre in Gorakhpur. A 500-bed facility for children in BRD is also slated to come up. But this will take its own time.The Yogi Adityanath government vaccinated 90 lakh children in 38 districts to protect them against Japanese Encephalitis (JE) – but is helpless against the AES.The development of an AI IMS in Gorakhpur has also been long stuck in red tape. It was on a calling attention motion of then Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath that the UPA government had in 2011 assured Parliament that an AIIMS-like institute would be set up in Gorakhpur to fight AES. However, nothing much moved till 2016 when the Narendra Modi government approved setting up a 750-bed AIIMS and Modi laid the foundation stone of the same in July 2016. The deadline for the same is 2019.However, serious questions would emerge on the Adityanath government if oxygen supply failure is indeed established in an ongoing inquiry as the reason for the deaths.In 2004, the BJP was embarrassed by a tragedy in then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s constituency Lucknow as 21 women had died in a stampede while BJP’s Lalji Tandon was distributing sarees on his birthday. His son Ashutosh Tandon, the present medical education minister of UP, could now end up paying the price of the embarrassment faced by the CM in his home constituency, Gorakhpur.Only a CBI probe can credibly dispel doubts over the cause of these deaths."

"UCLA: Potential stem cell therapy may help promote hair growth, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Untreated mouse skin showing no hair growth, left, compared to mouse skin treated with the drug UK5099 showing hair growth.

Los Angeles: Scientists have discovered a new way to activate the stem cells in the hair follicle, an advance that may pave the way for novel drugs to promote hair growth.

Hair follicle stem cells are long-lived cells in the hair follicle; they are present in the skin and produce hair throughout a person's lifetime.

They are ""quiescent,"" meaning they are normally inactive, but they quickly activate during a new hair cycle, which is when new hair growth occurs.

The quiescence of hair follicle stem cells is regulated by many factors. In certain cases they fail to activate, which is what causes hair loss.

Researchers from University of California, Los Angeles in the US found that hair follicle stem cell metabolism is different from other cells of the skin.

Cellular metabolism involves the breakdown of the nutrients needed for cells to divide, make energy and respond to their environment.

The process of metabolism uses enzymes that alter these nutrients to produce ""metabolites.""

As hair follicle stem cells consume the nutrient glucose - a form of sugar - from the bloodstream, they process the glucose to eventually produce a metabolite called pyruvate.

The cells then can either send pyruvate to their mitochondria - the part of the cell that creates energy - or can convert pyruvate into another metabolite called lactate.

""Our observations about hair follicle stem cell metabolism prompted us to examine whether genetically diminishing the entry of pyruvate into the mitochondria would force hair follicle stem cells to make more lactate, and if that would activate the cells and grow hair more quickly,"" said Heather Christofk, an associate professor at UCLA.

The research team first blocked the production of lactate genetically in mice and showed that this prevented hair follicle stem cell activation.

Conversely, they increased lactate production genetically in the mice and this accelerated hair follicle stem cell activation, increasing the hair cycle.

""Before this, no one knew that increasing or decreasing the lactate would have an effect on hair follicle stem cells,"" said William Lowry, a professor at the UCLA.

""Once we saw how altering lactate production in the mice influenced hair growth, it led us to look for potential drugs that could be applied to the skin and have the same effect,"" said Lowry.

The team identified two drugs that, when applied to the skin of mice, influenced hair follicle stem cells in distinct ways to promote lactate production.

The first drug, called RCGD423, activates a cellular signaling pathway called JAK-Stat, which transmits information from outside the cell to the nucleus of the cell.

The research showed that JAK-Stat activation leads to the increased production of lactate and this in turn drives hair follicle stem cell activation and quicker hair growth.

The other drug, called UK5099, blocks pyruvate from entering the mitochondria, which forces the production of lactate in the hair follicle stem cells and accelerates hair growth in mice.

""Through this study, we gained a lot of interesting insight into new ways to activate stem cells,"" said Aimee Flores, first author of the study published in the journal Nature Cell Biology.

""The idea of using drugs to stimulate hair growth through hair follicle stem cells is very promising given how many millions of people, both men and women, deal with hair loss,"" said Flores.

""I think we've only just begun to understand the critical role metabolism plays in hair growth and stem cells in general; I'm looking forward to the potential application of these new findings for hair loss and beyond,"" she said."
Windies keen to spring surprise in England's maiden day-night Test,"WINDIES TOUR OF ENGLAND, 2017

Windies keen to spring surprise in England's maiden day-night Test

On the face of it, a Test series between England, ranked third in the world, and Windies, ranked ninth, runs the risk of being horribly one-sided yet there is hope that the three-match series will be closer than the rankings suggest. With England still having a number of issues to resolve, notably with their batting line-up, and the tourists a talented and improving, if still raw around the edges, team, this is unlikely to be the walk in the park that many are expecting for the home side.

The first Test of the series being a day-night match levels the playing field somewhat, too. Windies have experienced a day-night Test already, against Pakistan in Dubai, and had a good workout against Derbyshire last week in a three-day day-night game. In contrast, England have had just one training session under lights this week in Birmingham and none of their players have had much exposure to the pink ball in their careers. Stuart Broad admitted earlier this week that it will be ""leap in to the unknown"" for England.

Given the right conditions and if the pink ball makes batting troublesome during the twilight period, the useful Windies pace attack could cause problems for England's batting line-up. Surrey's Mark Stoneman will become the 12th opener to be tried since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012 and Tom Westley and Dawid Malan, if selected, have plenty to prove too. In Shannon Gabriel, Kemar Roach, captain Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph, Windies' attack has bowlers who have pace, who can keep things tight and who can swing the ball. They should not be underestimated.

The Windies batting line-up looked in decent touch against Derbyshire last week although the county's attack was by no means strong. There were hundreds for Kyle Hope, Shai Hope and Roston Chase, as well as 92 for Kieran Powell but the batting remains the tourists' weaker suit. Much will depend on vice-captain Kraigg Braithwaite being able to blunt James Anderson and Broad and the Windies middle order, including Chase, who has scored three hundreds in his ten Tests so far, and the talented Jermaine Blackwood, being able to score consistently. There is talent aplenty but questions remain about their Test match discipline.

Given the inexperience of Windies' batsmen, England's in-form bowlers will fancy their chances of making inroads as they were able to against South Africa. Anderson was quite magnificent against the Proteas and Broad looked his hostile best in the final Test at Old Trafford. Moeen Ali's 25 wickets in that series confirmed his recent improvement with the ball and with Chris Woakes back fit and Toby Roland-Jones looking the part against South Africa, England have all bases covered.

But despite the improving nature of this Windies team, they have not won a Test series since 2014 and their last away series victory was in 2012. It would be a considerable upset were they to beat England over the next month but the men from the Caribbean should not be underestimated either. This series should prove a useful test for England ahead of the winter's Ashes.

When: Thursday, August 17, 2017, 2 PM.

Where: Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham

What to expect: The Edgbaston groundsman has not been given any instructions to leave extra grass on the surface to help keep the pink ball shiny, so it is likely to be a good, true surface for batting with some pace and bounce for the bowlers. As the game wears on, it may spin. The weather forecast is mixed with rain forecast on Friday and Sunday but decent weather on the other days.

Team News:

England

The hosts have opted to hand Stoneman his maiden Test cap and he will slot in to replace Keaton Jennings, who has been in wretched form in recent times, having scored just 127 runs in the recently-concluded four-match Test series against South Africa. Also, England resisted the temptation to play Chris Woakes, who is back fit after a side strain and there is no spot for legspinner Mason Crane as yet.

Playing XI: Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (c), David Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Toby Roland-Jones, Stuart Broad, James Anderson.

Windies

Windies must decide whether to play legspinner Devendra Bishoo or go in with a four-man seam attack as they did against Derbyshire. Given the likely good nature of the surface, Bishoo, who averages 37 in Tests, may get the nod which would mean 20-year-old quick Alzarri missing out. Shannon Gabriel, much improved over the last year, will lead the attack with Roach who would be playing his first Test since January 2016.

Team (from): Jason Holder(c), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Kieran Powell, Raymon Reifer, Kemar Roach.

Diving Into The Spirit World,"Many great 20th century scientists have been drawn to the spirit world, writes MUKUL SHARMA



The end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth saw some extremely radical and revolutionary developments in modern science in the form of electromagnetism, relativity and quantum mechanics. In the light of this, one would imagine that the age of superstition, irrationality and old wives’ tales — not to mention ghosts — would technically come to an end. But nothing of the kind actually happened.On the contrary, a lot of well-known scientists (including a few Nobel laureates), rational thinkers and eminent statesmen almost immediately dived deeply into the spirit world. From both sides of the Atlantic, from recognisably advanced nations of the time like England, France and the United States, reports started steadily streaming in that some ‘gifted’ people were being able to go into a trance and summon up or even speak directly to the spirits of the dead.Others were apparently able to enter into an altered state of consciousness and write things dictated by remote entities in what was then fashionably known as ‘automatic writing’ or as it’s still called today, ‘channelling’.



Some of these outpourings were touted to be the latest works of deceased writers and musicians describing new works of theirs such as unknown plays of Shakespeare and Bacon or new compositions by Mozart and Beethoven. In India too in the early 1900s, a Sanskrit manuscript surfaced called Vaimanika Shastra or ‘Science of Aeronautics’ which was purportedly dictated to a ‘seer’ by the name of Pandit Subbaraya Shastry who claimed it was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu sage Bhardwaj and contained mention of advanced aerodynamic flying vehicles in use in Vedic times. Bizarre as it may sound though, a lot of men of science and other research streams began flocking in droves to these séances apparently to study their veridicality, thinking it might be the next great breakthrough in their respective fields. Parapsychologists came to check out instances of telepathy and clairvoyance, reincarnation researchers wanted to see if disincarnate souls could exist and people who believed in flying saucers and ancient alien astronauts thought they might find evidence for their theories. Everything ultimately came to nothing. Either the mediums were exposed as hoaxes who cleverly fooled the gullible — including J J Thompson, the discoverer of the electron,physicist Oliver Lodge, and Balfour, the later prime minister of England — or they themselves admitted their chicanery.



For instance, the famous Fox sister mediums publicly acknowledged they were faking the whole thing while Leonora Piper was exposed by a professional magician. In which connection, the so-called Vaimanika Shastra manuscript along with the various sketches in it was also investigated by the aeronautical and mechanical engineering researchers at the Indian Institute of Science,Bangalore in 1974. Their conclusion was simple: it was nonsense. They said that the aircrafts described in the text were ‘poor concoctions’ and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics. Of one particular flying machine, the Rukma Vimana, the study noted: “If the craft is taken to mean what the drawing and the text say,it can be stated that the craft is a decided impossibility.” However, having said that and, hopefully, in the process defrocking the occult ilk, let’s skip a few decades to 1930.That was the year the Pulitzer Prize winning American author Upton Sinclair wrote Mental Radio: Does it work, and how? It documents Sinclair’s test of the psychic abilities of Mary Craig, his second wife, while she was in a state of profound depression with a heightened interest in the occult. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her brother. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 ‘partial successes’ and 70 failures. Yet what’s the bet most of us would never guess — Albert Einstein wrote the preface to this book. ¦"

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."

"Milkha Singh: WHO appoints Milkha Singh as Goodwill Ambassador for Physical Activity in South-East Asia Region, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India’s legendary sportsperson, Milkha Singh , has been appointed as the WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Physical Activity in South-East Asia Region on Friday.“Promoting physical activity for health is an important intervention, which is expected to get a significant boost in the region with the support of octogenarian Milkha Singh, a champion for the cause,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh , Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia, said.Regular exercise and physical activity helps reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer – diseases that are now increasingly afflicting people across the world.An estimated 8.5 million people die due to NCDs every year in WHO South-East Asia Region. Many of these deaths are premature and nearly all are lifestyle related, the Regional Director said.An alarming 70% of boys, 80% of girls and nearly 33% adults in the region report insufficient physical activity which is becoming a common feature of modern life, she said.As WHO Goodwill Ambassador, Milkha Singh will promote WHO South-East Asia Region’s NCD Prevention and Control Action Plan which seeks to reduce the level of insufficient physical activity by 10% and NCDs by 25% by 2025, Dr Khetrapal Singh said.Physical activity is not only cost effective, but also has long-term impact when applied strategically, for example at schools and workplaces, communities and cities, and national and sub-national events. WHO has been advocating for physical activity as a “best buy” intervention for reducing the risk of deaths due to NCDs.WHO recommends at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity for children and 150 minutes of weekly activity for adults to stave off noncommunicable diseases. Physical activity helps those aged 65 years and above to maintain cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of depression. To facilitate this, WHO has also been advocating with governments to create public spaces for recreational and organized sport.“Whatever the age group, gender, physical ability, or socio-economic background, being physically active is an effective way to ensure a healthy and productive life”, the Regional Director said.With support of Mr Milkha Singh, we expect to promote and scale up physical activity in the Region to be able to arrest and reverse the NCD epidemic, she said."

The horrible experience of 2010 CWG shouldn’t stop India from bidding for the 2032 Olympics,"By Boria Majumdar

In 2007, the 2010 Commonwealth Games (CWG) organising committee did a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis as part of its planning exercise.

Listed prominently in the opportunities section was a clear statement of belief that the CWG would ‘present the image of India as an emerging economic power and Delhi as a global business hub city’. Drawing a clear link with India’s vocal ambitions of becoming a major global power, the planners also highlighted the connections between the city’s sporting history and its recent evolution.

The sales pitch for Delhi’s bid presented the city’s post-1947 history as one that had chugged along on the engines of the two Asian Games it had hosted. According to this view, the 1951 Delhi Asiad — the first ever — was central to the original nationalist project. It led to the creation of new sporting infrastructure as well as a ‘future plan to guide the country, on the drawing board’.

This was the strand that linked it directly to 1982. As the bid document boasted, the 1982 Asiad turned Delhi into a ‘changed and modern city’ with ‘one of the swankiest stadia in the world’. And finally 2010 CWG, with a budget touching several thousand crores, was Delhi’s opportunity to leap frog into the world’s favoured sporting destinations. A number of new stadiums and roads and highways and a brand new Games village, India was clearly using the mega events route to fast track development.

But the 2010 experiment went horribly wrong. Sordid tales of corruption and under-preparedness in the lead up to the inability to exploit the gains in the medium term, the legacy of the 2010 CWG is more negative than positive. 101 medals at Delhi 2010 have now been reduced to just two at the 2016 Rio Games. Many of the stadiums built in Delhi are no more than white elephants with no proper plan in place to convert them into revenue-generating self-sufficient establishments.

Should India go down the mega event route ever again? Can mega events really convert a country into a multi-sporting one and give it a push that nothing else can offer?

If the experience of Rio 2016 is an index and Brazil a good counterpoint for India going forward, the Games in Rio did end up making Brazil a potential sporting superpower. Brazilians won many gold medals at home and the whole country was behind its medal winners. Roads would turn deserted when a Brazilian was involved in a contest and the Olympics had captured the nations’ imagination.

India too can do the same with the 2032 Games. With the reforms 2020 agenda firmly in place, it will not be a surprise if the IOC decides to favourably look at the global South as hosts for 2032. This is more so with Paris and Los Angeles confirmed as hosts of 2024 and 2028 and with China hosting the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.

India, it must be said, has a great chance in 2032 if it mounts a proper bid. With Nita Ambani as India’s IOC member, corporate support, it can be conjectured, would not be an issue and technology and infrastructure should also be in place.

India is hosting the U-17 World Cup in October and is in line to play host to the next U-21 FIFA World Cup. The cricket World Cup too will come back to India in 2023 and it will be rather surprising if India refuses to bid for 2032 based on the poor CWG experience.

Athletes, most of all, will benefit and mounting a proper bid might finally herald the turnaround we are looking for.

Planning, however, needs to start immediately if things are to move in the right direction and there can be no better occasion than the 70th anniversary of independence to mark a new beginning."

SL name ODI squad; skipper Tharanga calls for support

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Tue, 15 Aug, 2017, 09:03 PM

Upul Tharanga urged the country to rally behind the team while stating that every team in each sport goes through a rough phase. © AFP

In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's abysmal 3-0 Test series loss at the hands of the No. 1 ranked Test side India, ODI skipper Upul Tharanga called for the nation's support and urged the fans to rally behind the team in testing times as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match ODI series on Tuesday (August 15).

ODI Squad: Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando

With Asela Gunaratne yet to recover from the thumb injury he sustained during the first Test, the selectors have recalled allrounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana for the five-match series. While Perera was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe, Siriwardana's last appearance for the national side came in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in March-April this year.

Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who featured in the final ODI against Zimbabwe, has been given the axe alongside Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. In their place, the selectors have included Malinda Pushpakumara, who recently made his Test debut against India and young seamer Vishwa Fernando. Both Pushpakumara and Fernando are yet to make their debut in the 50-over format.

""Every team goes through a rough patch,"" skipper Tharanga said. ""This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.

Sri Lanka conceded 600+ totals in two of the three Tests and were asked to follow on in the last two games before succumbing to innings defeats. While the island nation weren't expected to topple the No. 1 ranked side during the series, the manner of defeat came across as rather baffling as their side kept slipping to newer depths every time. With the five-match ODI series and a lone T20I coming up, the skipper noted that every team had its share of lows and goes through a phase of transition before coming back on top.

""Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch. Obviously there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.""

The skipper also reposed faith in the limited-overs outfit and felt that they are well equipped to fare better against their opponents in the 50-over format of the game. ""Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.

""The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us.

""Yesterday despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too - so as the captain of the ODI & T20 teams, I want to appeal to each every one of you,"" concluded Tharanga.

"Rare fungus found in 200 patients in 55 UK hospitals, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The fungus, also known as C. auris and first identified in Japan eight years ago, is rare and low-risk, but has a propensity to spread between hospital patients.

LONDON: A rare fungus that can cause drug-resistant infections has been found in around 200 patients in more than 55 hospitals across Britain, health officials said on Tuesday.

Around a quarter of the cases of Candida auris have caused infections with symptoms, Public Health England (PHE) said, including in 27 patients who developed blood stream infections.

The fungus, also known as C. auris and first identified in Japan eight years ago, is rare and low-risk, but has a propensity to spread between hospital patients.

""Most cases detected have not shown symptoms or developed an infection as a result of the fungus,"" said Colin Brown, a microbiologist with PHE's national infection service.

He said health service staff were working with PHE experts to limit the fungus's spread.

First isolated from the ear of a patient in Japan in 2009, C. auris has since been linked with bloodstream and wound infections, and with ear infections known as otitis, in at least eight other countries including South Africa, Kuwait, India and Venezuela.

The first case of infection in Britain was in 2013.

PHE said in a statement that as of the start of last month, 20 hospitals had detected more than 200 patients colonised or infected with C. auris. Three hospitals had large outbreaks that had ""proved difficult to control"", it said, although all three have now been declared clear.

At least 35 other hospitals have had patients known to be colonised with C. auris transferred to them.

Serena Williams Slams Racism Again – Says She Has To Be Twice As Good As Maria Sharapova For Being 'Black',"23 Grand Slams. Open Era queen. And a daring personality on the court - that's Serena Williams. But, according to her, she still has to prove herself every time because of her skin colour.

In an interview with a British publication, she said she has to be twice as good as Maria Sharapova because she is 'black'.

Twitter

""Maria Sharapova, who might not talk to anybody, might be perceived by the public as nicer. Why is that? Because I’m black and so I look mean? ‘That’s the society we live in. That’s life. They say African Americans have to be twice as good, especially women. I’m perfectly ok with having to be twice as good,’ she said.

Twitter

Serena Williams is currently out of action because she is pregnant. Her first child - with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian - is awaited by the end of this year. We would hopefully see Serena resume her tennis duties in the next Australian Open.

"GST: GST Council flooded with requests to slash tax rates on various commodities, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","The requests also include cutting 12 per cent tax on agriculture implements to nil or maximum 5 per cent, on raw granite to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and on granite finished to 12 per cent from 28 per cent.

New Delhi: From helmets to granite slabs, hybrid cars to namkeen, the GST Council is flooded with requests for tweaking tax rates on a variety of commodities.

The Council, the highest policy making body on Goods and Services Tax (GST), has received requests for changes in tax rates on as many as 133 different products from an array of stakeholders, official sources said.

India moved to a GST regime on July 1 after the Council fixed over 1,200 products in four tax slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent.

However, some are not happy with the brackets and have sought changes, sources said.

These include slashing GST on IT products to 12 per cent from 18 per cent as it provides huge employment to skilled persons. On IT hardware, a tax cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent has been sought.

GST on helmets has been demanded from 18 per cent to 5 per cent, on textiles to nil from 5 per cent, on tractors to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and on granite slabs to 18 per cent from 28 per cent currently.

Namkeen, bhujias and potato chips should attract 5 per cent tax and not 12 per cent as per a demand put before the Council.

Tax cuts have also been sought on sweetmeats, kulfi, wet dates, Isabgol, and a variety of sugar confectioneries like peanut chikki.

Moreover, a request has been made for cut in tax on macaroni/ pasta/noodles to 5 per cent from 18 per cent as vermicelli is taxed at 5 per cent and there should be uniform tax on all products manufactured through the same set of machines and equipment.



A demand has been made to cut tax rate on packaged drinking water sold in small pouches and refill cans with 20 litre capacity to nil from present 18 per cent as GST implementation has seen a sudden rise in their prices.

Also, tax on hair pin, LPG stoves, umbrella, writing instruments, wet grinders, weighing machines compressors, textile machinery parts, chewing tobacco, multi-function printers and handmade carpets comes under the reduction category.

GST on chutney power has been sought at 12 per cent from 18 per cent and on pickle to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.

On motor cycles with engine capacity of more than 350 cc and up to 500 cc, the 3 per cent cess on top of 28 per cent tax rate has been sought to be removed as such vehicles are used for commuting. Also, only Royal Enfield makes vehicles of 350 cc and above and fulfils the ambition of Make in India.

A demand has been made to reduce cess on hybrid cars to 3 per cent from 15 per cent currently. The cess is levied on top of the total tax rate of 28 per cent. The reason behind the demand is that these cars are environment-friendly and are required to be encouraged.

GST on sanitary pads has been sought to be nil from 12 per cent.

Sources said GST Council refers some of the tax change requests to the fitment committee to see if there is any merit in the demands and upon recommendation of the committee takes up for approval any changes.



GST on dried fish has been sought to be cut to nil from 5 per cent, on plastic scrap to nil from 18 per cent, on fishing nets to 5 per cent from 12 per cent, on furniture to 12-18 per cent from current 28 per cent.

The requests also include cutting 12 per cent tax on agriculture implements to nil or maximum 5 per cent, on raw granite to 5 per cent from 12 per cent and on granite finished to 12 per cent from 28 per cent.

A nil duty has been sought for fly-ash and fly-ash bricks from current 18 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively to popularise the use of the otherwise environmental pollutant.

To help cut reliance on imported oil, duty on bio-diesel or bio fuel extracted from non-edible oilseeds has been sought to be cut to nil or 5 per cent from current 18 per cent."

Saha's 'immeasurable' brilliance leaves the world gasping,"Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp with his wicketkeeping skills in the Colombo Test © Getty

When pitches start to wither, when the bounce gets fickle, when a ball throws up dust on hitting the turf, it is the batsmen you worry about. ""Oooh"" we go when one takes off past the shoulder of the bat or hurtles through at ankle height. The spinner has a mischievous grin, the batsman the look of a condemned man.

You don't think too much about the wicketkeeper though. The byes that result from a wicked surface go against his name and if he keeps a clean sheet, it doesn't stare at you from a scorecard a fortnight later. And yet, as much as the batsman almost, he has to combat the surface. If the batsman is beaten, he lives another day, if the 'keeper is beaten, it is four byes and slip looks at short leg with a twisted smile and a raised eyebrow.

I thought of that over the last couple of days of the Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. Normally, the batsmen are on the guest list there. Hundreds are strewn around and if you are Mahela Jayawardene, you only count the runs after the mandatory hundred has appeared. But this track was different. It was powdery to start off and by the third morning, the ball was spitting and bouncing. By the fourth morning, the odd one was taking off almost vertically as Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews discovered.

And yet, every time the ball beat the bat, at varying heights, it found a comforting glove. Every time it acquired a mind of its own after pitching, it was arrested and returned to the bowler. There were no oohs and aahs, no exaggerated reactions, just a calm gather and a crouch for the next ball. Keeping was hazardous but Wriddhiman Saha made it look like just another balance-sheet to be put together and filed away.

I have very rarely seen wicket-keeping like this. Maybe Nayan Mongia standing up to Anil Kumble's rockets on a pitch of variable bounce. Maybe Syed Kirmani at his peak. Kiran More was good and MS Dhoni brought his own style to a difficult job and rarely had a bad day. But Saha, so understated, was a treat to watch. Only once in the second innings was he beaten and he would have needed a fisherman's net to catch that one. And when he caught Mathews off another Jadeja sortie that bombed the pitch, we gasped.

Jadeja was bowling in the high nineties, more than ten kmph faster than Ashwin who was going past the outside edge for fun himself, more than 15 kmph faster than Herath on average and a good 20 kmph quicker than the debutant Pushpakumara. When he felt like it, he crossed 100 kmph. After he faced the first ball, Mathews asked for an arm-guard because the first one hissed at him violently.

But Saha seemed unperturbed. Indeed, amusing as it seems, taking a DRS call seemed to fluster him more. He couldn't have known where the ball was headed and yet it seemed he did. In our commentary box, Vijay Dahiya, no mean 'keeper himself, was rejoicing. Ajay Jadeja wanted to make him the Man of the Match.

In time to come, there will be nothing to measure Saha's brilliance, no scorecard will be read in reverence, no highlights packages will be preserved, no accolades offered on awards nights.

But the eyes saw it. And left imprints behind. Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp in Colombo.

3 Powerful Tricks That Can Help You Mentally Toughen Up To Overcome Any Situation Instantly,"Your mind is as responsible for your failures as much as it is for your success because it rules your thoughts and actions. If you’re able to exert the power of will during your toughest moments, you'll be surprised as to how many times you would come out on top of the situation you feared at one point.

medium.com

These are some simple but key mindfulness building tricks that anyone can and should apply to their lives every day; especially if when you find yourself stuck in a position of confusion, fear or self-doubt in any situation.

Visualise success before the thought of failure inflicts your mind

By visualising yourself completing the task at hand repeatedly, over and over again, you create what is called a ‘winning mindset’ before going forward and getting into the task at hand.

myempoweredworld.com

If you can see yourself overcoming the hurdles you face before undertaking the task at hand you’re more likely to overcome them without a shadow of a doubt because you’re mind has already been trained to do so.

Use the power of a mantra that you create for yourself and recite it in a tricky situation

‘Mind chatter’ can block you from taking decisive action when you’re stuck in a precarious situation. For instance, if you believe and resonate with the saying “whatever doesn’t kill me will only me me stronger”, repeat it as many times as you need in a situation that demands it.

yallafeed.com

Reciting a positive mantra helps overhaul the ‘mental chatter’ that holds you back or creates feelings of negativity by trick your brain into believing that your only option is to keep going and there’s no point looking back anyway.

Detach yourself from the outcome to accomplish the impossible

Learning how to detach yourself from the result of what you set out to accomplish can be one most powerful ways to get through any task that you’re hesitant to undertake and come back from any setback even stronger.

"A 9.6 Kbps Dial Up Pack Cost Rs 1,250 Per Month, When VSNL Brought Internet To India In 1995","Internet is fast becoming as essential as oxygen in India. Thanks largely to the record low cost of access to Internet, whether it's broadband or cellular 3G/4G.

But 22 years ago, when Internet services first began in the country, getting online was quite expensive! Just look at the rate card below:

VSNL was the first Indian entity to offer Internet access in the country 22 years ago / @MumbaiHeritage

In case you don't know, VSNL or Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd was a government entity responsible for connecting India to the Internet. VSNL started offering Internet services to Indians 22 years ago on 15th August, 1995. And the early Internet adopters of the country had to shell out a lot of money to get online.

Rs 1,250 per month for a 9.6 kbps dial up connection -- remember dial up? Ah, the sweet cacophony of electronic noises that was the orchestra of early Internet!

What was crazy at the time is that if you had to go beyond dial up, and opt for a leased line, you really had to break the bank to be able to afford it. For a measly 128 kbps connection, a leased line for home use would set you back by over Rs 83,000 per month, paid annually at a flat price of Rs 10 lakh! You'd think who in their right minds would pay so much money to access the Internet at such agonizingly slow speeds? But there were a lot of takers for VSNL back then.

As many as 10,000 users signed up for VSNL's internet service in the first six months after its August 1995 launch

Also FUP worked slightly differently back then. Instead of putting cap on maximum data per month, which is the norm among ISPs now, VSNL data packs came with an hour limit for dial up users. As advertised in the card above, the 9.6 kbps dial up Internet connection would only allow 250 hours of Internet access for a full year at a price of Rs 15,000.

Ah, those were the days. Things have obviously moved on, and data prices have plummeted to record lows in India, thanks to Jio shaking things up, but VSNL still holds fond memories for anyone who remembers pre-broadband Internet days of India.

"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."
FIFA U-17 World Cup: Challenges of putting together a squad,"By Joy Bhattacharjya

The most challenging task while hosting a Junior World Cup, especially for developing football countries, is putting up a competitive squad. All the remaining preparations will not have much value if the Indian team doesn’t compete against its opponents in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. FIFA does not publish junior rankings, but in the list of football nations, five of the top ranked FIFA countries will be in India come October, including World No 1, Brazil. India’s group features the 8th, 26th and 50th ranked countries, and its no help that the lowest-rated team, Ghana, have been monsters in this competition with titles in 1991 and 1995.

The process for putting together this particular team started in April 2014, just a few months after India was awarded the tournament, when a group of 30 odd boys started practicing together in the AIFF academy in Goa. While there have been dropouts due to injury and loss of form, and fresh talent has also been unearthed over the years, at least half the squad is still from the original thirty. Most of the original boys were selected by a set of scouts led by the then Technical Director, Scott O’Donell. The challenges were immense. The first and most important issue was age. Almost 50 per cent of the boys selected could not provide birth certificates. And a fair number of those who seemed to be fine on paper then failed the compulsory wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test that is the most accepted age test in junior football.

In addition, state federation heads were often keen to put forward their favourites, rather than the best players in the state. Finally, the biggest conundrum was whether to select just the best players or also start looking at the players from the point of view of the position they could play. From over two thousand potential candidates, 29 were finally selected, with a shortage of quality left foot players. Almost half that number came from the North East, with Manipur contributing the most players, including the core of the current midfield — Suresh Wangjam, Amarjit Kiyam and Jackson Singh.

While the team started practicing and playing tournaments almost immediately, the process of scouting for new players continued. Abhishek Yadav joined as the CEO of the AIFF U-17 team in 2016, and set upon a punishing schedule of trials. Since June last year, he has personally seen more than twelve thousand boys, many from the smaller districts of traditional powerhouse states like Bengal and Kerala. Aniket Jadhav from Kolhapur was just one of the boys selected, who forced himself into a first XI position in the team almost immediately. The other push has been the online portal, where players of India origin from around the world can upload their match footage for a chance to play for India. Defender Namit Deshpande from New Jersey is one of the two players from the Americas, the other being towering 6’5” goalkeeper Sunny Dhaliwal from Canada.

The exposure given to this team has been unprecedented in Indian football. Over the past couple of years, they have played tournaments and matches in Germany, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Russia and also participated in the AFC U-16 qualifying tournament in Goa. The team has competed against the likes of Brazil, USA and Russia and while a lot of the matches ended in defeat, the opposing coaches were often impressed by the skills on view. More recently, the team under coach Luis Norton drew 1-1 against a full strength Chile, among the top 10 sides in international soccer, in a tournament in Mexico.

India have never qualified for a FIFA World Cup, senior or junior, men’s or women’s, so the pressure on these thirty is absolutely unprecedented. Talismanic senior striker Sunil Chhetri spoke of how he would cheerfully trade his entire international career for one shot at a World Cup, and these boys bear the burden of all those unfulfilled dreams.

But they have a few things going for them as well. They have played for a long time together and have had enough time to gel as a unit. They have also competed against the best in the world from different football ‘gharanas,’ — from short passing South American and Spanish teams to athletic long ball teams like Tanzania and the German Bundesliga squads, so there aren’t any real surprises. And finally, they will easily be the fittest Indian team ever to play a World Cup, going at full tilt well into stoppage time. As long as they run themselves into the ground and give it their 100 per cent each time, Indian fans will not complain."
McDonald’s allowed the tussle with JV partner to fester and deteriorate further,"By Ragvinder Singh Rekhi

“Illegal, unlawful, unjust and malicious.” A judge of the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) used these words recently to describe McDonald’s, a company where I worked for 20 years, where everyone considered themselves members of a McFamily with ketchup in their veins. What a remarkable denouement to a sorry saga.

A few weeks earlier, McDonald’s had shut down 43 of its restaurants in Delhi. The McDonald’s name, usually linked to accolades, was now being excoriated by a judge. How did this come to pass? Why did it even get to such a stage? Surely, a world-renowned company like McDonald’s would have avoided letting a matter fester and deteriorate to such depths.

The dispute between McDonald’s and its 50:50 joint venture partner for North and East India is public knowledge. Given the NCLT ruling, we now know the facts. But what is not clear is why.

In 2013, at a meeting of the board of directors of Connaught Plaza Restaurants (the JV company for North & East India), the directors representing McDonald’s ousted the Indian JV partner as managing director. One would have thought McDonald’s would have wielded ironclad power to do so. It turns out, it did not. Not even close; the JV contract clearly assigns the position of MD to the Indian partner, as pointed out by the NCLT. But, did McDonald’s have a plan?

Is McDonald’s obliged to stick with a JV partner even if it was a bad choice? Of course not. Malfeasance on the part of the partner would be justification enough to break the partnership. McDonald’s accused the partner of financial irregularity based upon misrepresentation of an event that took place over five years prior to that ill-fated board meeting. But it had re-elected him MD multiple years after the alleged irregularity, even praising his good performance! The NCLT judgement demolishes the malfeasance argument.

It appears customers, suppliers and employees in India have been abandoned by the senior management in McDonald’s HQ in USA. What were they thinking would happen when you take a 50:50 JV, each side represented by two directors, oust the managing director and then leave the day-to-day management headless and on auto-pilot for nearly four years? Is it possible that the severe consequences of this were considered and deemed acceptable? Possible, but unlikely.

McDonald’s operates in more than a 100 countries. From my years in the company, I know McDonald’s almost always preferred to resolve these sort of problems long before they got to the point of litigation. So, is it possible that the top management was not aware? Given the enormous distance in culture and geography between India and USA, it is possible.

But, then again, McDonald’s successfully operates in so many different cultures and geographies that this was likely not an act of omission or miscommunication. Of commission then? Horrors!

Iknow of no instance in my 20 years at McDonald’s, working in many different parts of the world, where the interest and well being of the customers and employees was not paramount. And, yet, here we are, with 43 restaurants shut down in the capital of India because their health licence had expired; with no leadership — McDonald’s-nominated directors have not come to India for several years. How does one entrust the day-today management of a retail, customerfacing business to an absentee board?

Is it possible that McDonald’s actually thought this would work? Clearly McDonald’s wants the partner out of the JV. To buy him out is its absolute right. But to go about it in the manner it has, destroying lives, damaging reputations and squandering the colossal resources that were expended in creating the business and brand reputation? To force down the value of the JV partner’s stake? That is not the right way.

I cannot fathom how McDonald’s top management could have approved such a course of action. Is it possible then that this whole saga was the handiwork of someone in upper mid-management who let hubris overcome better judgement, to the point of wanting to drive out the local JV partner? Or, in this case, for a pittance? Does one cut off one’s nose to spite one’s face? Go figure!

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

Fashionistas and DP fans, want to watch the lovely Deepika talking about her #F3DeepikaEdition? Watch this video right here and book one already!"

"India long way off from ideal GST, may not get there: Bibek Debroy, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi, India is a long way off from the ideal GST structure and it may not get there anytime in the near future, says NITI Aayog Member Bibek Debroy , who favours three rates.While asserting that the move towards the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a good one, Debroy says it would have been much better if it had lesser number of tax rates.""My view -- for which the government is slightly upset with me -- is that we should not have been here (the current GST) but we should have been much closer to the ideal GST,"" Debroy told IANS in an interview.""Once we are here, I am not very convinced that we will actually get there (the ideal GST).""Debroy said that ideally, there should be a single GST rate, but at present ""depending on how you count it, you have seven rates"".""Every economist would argue for one rate but no country in the world has that. But instead of seven rates, have three rates,"" he said.While the government's stand has been that the system would eventually move towards lesser number of GST rates, Debroy said it now seemed to be a difficult shift.""My point is that we don't know what those rates would be. Let's assume they are 12, 18 and 24 per cent, which sound reasonable. Can you imagine the tax rate of a product currently at three per cent increasing to 12 per cent? Really tough,"" the leading economist told IANS.Gold and gold jewellery are currently taxed at three per cent under the GST regime Debroy said that the experiences of other countries had shown that growth and revenue increases happened through increased efficiency when all products were included and there were a maximum of two or three tax rates.""Therefore, when people say rate efficiency, it will happen, but not right now. In terms of revenue increases, probably not that much beyond the extension of the base, because many more people are brought into the net,"" he said.Debroy said that an ideal GST removes all indirect taxes, puts all items under its purview and has a single rate.""Ideal GST is still a long way off. Most countries in the world that have moved towards the GST have taken more than 10 years to reach there -- if they ever have reached there,"" he said.The NITI Aayog Member said that while there are statements floating around that 140-150 countries in the world have GST, but that's not really the case.""What they have is VAT (Value Added Tax) without the service sector being integrated. Proper GST exists in not more than six to seven countries in the world.""""And out of these six-seven countries, with the exception of Canada, all are unitary countries -- that is, where the central government decides,"" he said.In a country like India, there can't be the central government unilaterally deciding on the rates and several other issues, he said.""Automatically, we are therefore talking about the dual GST and about the GST council . Now, when you have the GST council with all of the states having different perceptions, even if you assure compensation for revenue losses, what you will have is a long way off from the ideal GST,"" he said.""So you will have a lot of products outside the GST like electricity, petroleum products, liquor and tobacco... And depending on how you count it, you have seven rates, not a single one.""Debroy said that a positive way to look at it is that there has been some movement on the issue and that waiting for the ideal GST would have taken 20 more years to generate a consensus.""So on balance, even as a complicated thing, it's a very good thing that has happened. But it could have been better."""

Increasing gulf in quality defines current health of Asian giants,"Sri Lanka will have to improve massively in order to challenge India later this year. © AFP

Purely as a game, I sometimes try to do the old six word review of things. I attempted it for the series against Sri Lanka and came up with: Sri Lanka abysmal, India intimidating. It told me everything about the series and I had a word left! The home team was that bad.

Admittedly, India began overwhelming favourites but teams have visited the lovely island as favourites before and discovered opposition they sometimes hadn't anticipated. There were always, certainly in the last fifteen years, players who could take the game away from you. There were tough players, others with an air of mystery around them, some who played exotic shots and bowled at unique angles. This time there were none. It is not good for cricket because Sri Lanka has given us some very fine talents who inevitably resided within modest personalities.

It is easy therefore to belittle India's performance but that wouldn't be fair. You play the opposition you are provided and if there is a gulf between the two teams in ability, you make sure that is reflected in the scorecards. And sure it was. Each time, India racked up a lead in excess of 300, the margins of victory were the kind you would expect if a heavyweight boxer entered the ring with a middleweight. To that extent, India did what they could and while playing an opponent who hardly throws a punch back can lead to bad habits, India dominated like the better side is meant to.

Shikhar Dhawan made the most of the opportunity as did Cheteshwar Pujara. One punched with a smile, the other made incisions with narrowed eyes. And all the batsmen partook of the feast on offer. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up 17 wickets and scored runs fluently and until a headmasterly approach to the game took out Ravindra Jadeja, he had fun too. And if Hardik Pandya had been asked to choose a debut series, he couldn't have picked a better one. There is something about him and I hope it stays that way as fame envelops him. If you like fame too much it isn't your best companion as doubtlessly he will be told by wise heads. Kuldeep Yadav impressed too and the fact that batsmen don't seem to pick him means captains will always be tempted to pick him. India will have some tough choices to make in the days ahead.

If you are a cricket lover, it is difficult not to be carried away by the manner in which the ball leaves Mohammed Shami's hands and makes its journey to the batsman. The seam is upright and proud and the ball reaches the bat at a nippy pace. Shami probably bowled too little and admitted in an interview that he was the support bowler in these conditions. That may be understating things but I do hope he thinks he is Ashwin when the side tours more seam-friendly lands.

But for all that, the most dramatic performance for me came from a quiet man whose deeds even modern scoreboards haven't found ways to reflect. Wriddhiman Saha's wicket-keeping in the second Test was the performance of the series for me.

Sri Lanka come to India this winter and I hope they have more to offer. Karunaratne, Mendis, Mathews and Chandimal are far better players than they let themselves be at most times but it is the bowling they need to sort. Sandakan must play everytime but how do they replace Herath? I wish they can cajole a few more months out of fingers that have twirled so long because otherwise their batsmen will always have a mountain of runs in front of them.

The one-dayers will be more competitive but I'm afraid Test cricket needs to come to grips with the crisis that confronts it. Nobody came to watch and when one team looks like a juggernaut and the other a meek figure waiting to be run over, it doesn't bode well.

"Turkey's Unit International, Russia's Zarubezhneft and Iran's Ghadir sign drilling deal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","ANKARA: Turkey's Unit International has signed a $7 billion agreement with Russia's state-owned Zarubezhneft and Iran's Ghadir Investment Holding to drill for oil and natural gas in Iran, the company said.

In a statement, Unit said the three companies had invested a total of $7 billion for the drilling, which would take place at three oil fields and one large natural gas field in Iran.

The total reserves at the three oil fields stand at 10 billion barrels, and the fields will produce 100,000 barrels per day, Unit said. It said the natural gas field had a production capacity of 75 billion cubic metres per year.

The consortium will also be able to drill in other parts of Iran, the statement said.

The natural gas extracted from the drilling will be equal to 1.5 times the 50 billion cubic metres of gas Turkey imports annually, Unit said, adding that the reserves in this field would help meet Turkey's gas demands for the next 150 years.

Unit said all three companies had signed the agreement as equal partners, and added that this marked the first trilateral deal an Iranian company signed with foreign partners.

"This Woman Was Born Without A Vagina, But Is Now Fundraising To Raise Money For A Surgery So She Can Have A Normal Sex Life","Kaylee Moats was only 18 when she realised that she had not received her period yet. The doctor ran her through an MRI revealed that she didn't have a uterus, cervix, vagina or vaginal opening, according to GoFundMe page that her sister created to fundraise for her surgery. Her vagina looks normal but the opening is replaced by dimpled skin instead of a hole with parts missing on the inside.

mirror.co.uk

Moats, who is now 22, was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Hauser syndrome—a condition that causes the uterus and vagina to be underdeveloped or absent, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition is so rare that it only affects 1 in 4,500 girls and its cause is still unknown.

Obviously, Moats was in for quite a shock initially. ""I was heartbroken and confused when the doctor came in and told me he didn't see a uterus in the ultrasound. I was scared for the future because I didn't know what's coming up next and how I would be able to have my own family one-day,“ states Kaylee according to report in the Mirror UK.

""I did my own research and realised I have type one, which is the dimpled skin. I do sometimes have a sharp pain in my ovaries. I still ovulate like any other woman it just gets dissolved into my ovaries instead of being released,"" adds Kaylee.

“This diagnosis raises a lot of fears, concerns, and insecurities in Kaylee about her identity and her future. The options of surrogacy and adoption give her some hope but she will never be able to carry her own children. The dreams we had of raising families together are going to look a little different than we had initially planned, stated The GoFundMe page.”

Her only respite is the possibility of having a normal sex-life if her surgery goes off as planned. She needs $15,000 for the surgery and the crowd-funding page set up by her sister has already managed to raise $5,720 dollars in two months, according to New York Post.

Her boyfriend who’s been with her for the last 4 months, Robbie Limmer, says that he is not really bothered about having a sexual relationship but has been putting aside $50 every month to help fund Moats’s surgery.





“He doesn't really focus on the sexual side of our relationship because we can't do anything since I don't have a vaginal opening. But I am looking forward to having a sexual relationship. I'm not sure If I want to wait until marriage but I think having that option there is a lot more comforting,” Moats tells Daily Mail UK.

“I'm a bit nervous to have sex for the first time after surgery because I'm not sure if something is going to go wrong down there or if it's going to hurt,” adds Moats. Let’s hope for her sake the surgery goes off as planned and she is able to live a normal life and a fulfilling sex life like any other girl.

"Nitin Gadkari bats for methanol as ship fuel, to approach Union Cabinet, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: Union minister Nitin Gadkari today said the government is considering a proposal to allow use of methanol as a fuel for ships, which he said would be a cheaper, cleaner and forex-saving alternative to diesel.

""We are studying deeply how to use methanol as a marine fuel and will be going before the Cabinet soon,"" he told reporters here.

""Eight days ago we had a meeting (with veteran scientist and Niti Aayog member V K Saraswat) where we decided that if marine engines are run on methanol, it can be import substitute, cost-effective and pollution-free,"" the minister said.

Saraswat examined a proposal to build 40 bunkers of liquefied natural gas along the river Ganga as part of the inland waterways project, and suggested methanol as an alternative (to LNG), Gadkari said.

Against Rs 60 for a litre of diesel, methanol would cost Rs 20-25, while its calorific value is better than that of diesel, he said, adding ""the biggest priority for us is how to reduce the cost of fuel.""

The minister also quipped that loss-making civic transport undertaking BEST of Mumbai can cut its losses if it starts running its buses on methanol.

Methanol is used as fuel in several countries, he said, recounting his travel on a cruise ship in Sweden which ran on 100 per cent methanol.

As the fuel is derived from coal, switch-over to methanol would benefit India, a coal surplus country, he said.

The fuel can be sourced from fertiliser companies such as RCF and Deepak Fertilisers located in or near Mumbai, one of the biggest maritime trade hubs in the country, he said.

Swedish automaker Volvo has built trucks running on methanol while Wartsila has made an engine running on 100 per cent methanol, he said.

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

Manga Wisdom: Advice for the times from Japanese anime Naruto,"In yet another life lesson from my favourite Japanese anime series ‘Naruto’, a character named Jiraiya says that one should make an effort to talk to others every day. Even if it is small talk, such communication is important to unburden oneself and form bonds of camaraderie and friendship. Otherwise, keeping quiet leads the heart to become sullen and dark – in other words a route to depression and hate.



Of course, there are times that one does need to be quiet, for example during meditation and prayer to introspect and reflect on things. However, one should guard against the feeling of not wanting to talk. For, once a person gives into this feeling, he soon goes down the slippery slope of depression. Human beings are social creatures. We need to communicate with each other. However, unfortunately, we are living in times where the individual is becoming increasingly isolated. We have surrounded ourselves with technology and have access to information like never before. We have social media at our fingertips. But none of these things can actually replace human face-to-face communication.

It’s a tragedy that in many parts of the developed world – and now even in sections of India – we have a situation where people don’t know their neighbours. Such lack of social interactions is bad for mental health and society as a whole. Sure, a modern lifestyle has empowered the individual, placing individual rights over the community. But social interactions are vital to protect a society from nefarious forces. When individuals become isolated and depressed, they live in darkness. And that darkness can be manipulated by criminal and unscrupulous elements. For, these elements pretend to befriend an isolated, depressed individual and offer him a chance at salvation.

A classic example of this is the online radicalisation of individuals by terror groups such as the Islamic State (IS). Various cases have revealed that IS possesses sophisticated online cells to identify potential recruits, indoctrinate them in radical ideology, and fully convert them into jihadi footsoldiers. True, IS as an organisation has been on the wane in recent months. But its template of online radicalisation can be copied by other terror groups. And the target of such online radicalisation is usually the isolated, confused individual whose tribe has only increased in recent times.

So let us make it a point to engage in human conversation every day. It’s good for the health of both individuals and society. Let’s make a conscious effort not to recede into an Information Technology cocoon – more information at our fingertips doesn’t necessarily mean more quality human interactions. Technology is great, but we must not become slaves to it. Otherwise, it will be easy for unscrupulous forces to take advantage of us.

That said, I continue to be amazed by the ability of Japanese anime and manga to portray relevant philosophical, socio-cultural and political concepts. In that sense, the medium is more than just art and can provide incisive, as well as subtle, commentary on important issues, trends and happenings. Given these facts, I believe that Japanese manga and anime can be adapted to tell Indian stories as well. And such productions can become a source of both education and fun."

"MP govt not in favour of bringing petroleum products under GST, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Indore: The Madhya Pradesh government here today made it clear that it can not give consent to the GST Council to bring the petroleum products under the purview of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

""The total commercial revenue that we get from petroleum products is about 35 per cent of the total tax (commercial) that government collects.

""Therefore, it is difficult for us to give consent to the GST Council for bringing petroleum products under the purview of GST as we need funds for running the government, development and to fulfill our social obligations,"" finance minister Jayant Mallaiya told reporters.

However, the minister, who admitted that the rate of tax (VAT and entry tax) on petroleum products in the state is on the higher side also gave a justification for it.

""States like Gujarat and Maharashtra get sufficient tax revenue from industrial production, but it was not the case with Madhya Pradesh as industrial activities are less here. Therefore, for earning enough funds (tax revenue) we have to levy tax on petroleum products,"" Mallaiya said.

The minister said in 2016-17, a total of Rs 29,500 crore commercial tax was collected in the state which means an increase of 14.5 per cent per year.

Mallaiya said he was satisfied with the implementation of GST in the state and the GST Council on the basis of state's feedback is continuously reforming it.

""Madhya Pradesh will get lot of benefit with this new tax regime because it is located centrally. It will also result in enhancement of business activities especially stocking and transportation of goods,"" he said.

Answering a question he said only those who don't want to do their business in a fair manner are not happy with decisions like GST and demonetisation.

On opposition's charge that the state government is burdening people by borrowing money continuously, the minister said the government will not have any problem in taking loans for developmental and schemes meant for fulfilling social obligations.

Besides, the growth rate of the state is much higher under BJP regime than that of Congress."
Going on record: CCTV in courts will significantly enhance judicial transparency,"In a welcome move, the Supreme Court has favoured the installation of CCTV cameras in all courts to facilitate audio-video recordings of court proceedings. This is certain to boost transparency within our courts which are anyway saddled with a huge backlog of cases. It’s an unfortunate reality that judicial proceedings in this country, especially in lower courts, suffer inordinate delays due to non-adherence to prescribed procedures. Repeated adjournments make getting justice a laborious and expensive endeavour. Such delays and backlog only undermine people’s faith in the judiciary. True, we need more courts and judges. But this by itself won’t make the wheels of justice turn faster.

Adequate attention needs to be given to procedural propriety and reforms. And it’s here that installing CCTV cameras in courts makes sense. In fact, the apex court in March had directed all high courts to ensure video recording of lower court proceedings in two districts of every state and Union territory. Scaling this up to facilitate audio-video recordings in all courts across the country will be natural progression. This will keep a check on everyone within courtroom including judges, advocates and police, and encourage responsible behaviour on all sides. Additionally, it will reduce unequal treatment meted out to different parties, threats by any person to witnesses and absence of lawyers at important stages of the proceedings.

The issue of privacy of judges doesn’t cut ice here. It’s the law of the land that all court proceedings are to be held in open court. Besides, as the top court itself has observed, constitutional courts in other countries have audio-video recordings and US Supreme Court proceedings are even available on YouTube. The apex court isn’t going there, it has stipulated that such recordings won’t be made available under RTI. Nonetheless, the recordings will mark a significant jump in judicial transparency."
"Biocon developing 10 biosimilars that collectively target global market opportunity of over $60 billion: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India’s biopharmaceutical company Biocon , which ranks among top three biosimilar global players for insulin , has multiple successes in its container since its inception. So far, Biocon has successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars from laboratory to market in India.“We will continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in our research and development,” said, Chairman & Managing Director,. In an email interview with ETHealthworld, the Biocon chief shared her in-depth insights on the challenges, achievements and growth prospects of the biopharma industry in India. Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion’s share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‘Start-Up India’ initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia’s first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‘lab to market’ in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‘first-in-class’ oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."
Call for change: PM’s I-Day speech certainly had a sense of the occasion but was short on specifics,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi can meld a sense of history with a sense of language to deliver evocative and inspiring speeches, and those qualities were on full display when he spoke from Red Fort’s ramparts yesterday. Thus, according to him, the 1942 slogan of “Bharat Chhodo” (Quit India) should now be amended to “Bharat Jodo” (Join India). If currently we have a “chalta hai” (everything goes) attitude that should be replaced by “badal sakta hai” (everything can change). Kashmir’s problems cannot be solved by “gaali” (abuse) or “goli” (bullets) but by “gale lagaana” (embracing).

The latter is a significant overture as it suggests that while bullets or stones will not change anything, should there be a mindset shift or the emergence of new leadership in Kashmir, the Centre is listening and willing to reciprocate. Only after good will has been established can specific initiatives come to fruition, a point missed by those who fault the government for not coming up with specific initiatives in this regard. Whatever the dispute is – whether in Kashmir or anywhere else – it can be settled in a spirit of non-violence and within the framework of India’s democratic institutions, and Modi’s speech did well to emphasise this. Couched in sobriety and a sense of the occasion as it was, however, it fell short of specificity on other issues.

Most prominent among these is the critical issue of jobs for India’s burgeoning youth population where the best the PM could suggest is that youth should be trained to become their own employers. But India ranks poorly in terms of ease of doing business, which means big businesses can still survive but small entrepreneurs find it tough to cope. Modi emphasised project implementation, but this in itself won’t suffice if the business environment doesn’t improve.

Modi also promised to double farm income by 2022, but didn’t offered much by way of a roadmap to get there. He mentioned the Gorakhpur tragedy in connection with natural disasters. But Gorakhpur is one area where his dictum of “badal sakta hai” can be applied – child deaths in India are shockingly high and most other countries, including neighbouring Bangladesh, do much better. Speaking of project implementation, while physical infrastructure such as roads and ports are certainly needed if “new India” is to dawn, perhaps even more necessary are public health projects which save the lives of children."
अनहोनी होने से पहले ही चेतावनी दे देता है तोता,
Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."

Morocco wants travellers find answers to intolerance,"Morocco’s efforts to discuss peace is not exactly making breaking headlines but it is indeed unique and has been lauded by one and all, including policymakers in Washington, Moscow and Beijing, even New Delhi. And there are enough reasons why global diplomats are loving the idea.

Tangiers, the Moroccan port city that once lured American composer Paul Bowles and French writer Jean Genet, is asking new generation travellers and peacemakers to visit the sleepy city this November discuss what would drive peace and mutual tolerance across world.

The second edition of the International Festival of Ibn Battuta, themed on the Moroccan globetrotter who once travelled to India and even worked as a judge for some years, attempts to find answers to some of most difficult questions of modern times revolving around intolerance and religion. Ibn Battuta, whose extraordinary journeys that spanned nearly three decades, himself tried hard to find answers to global strife caused by reasons stretching from religion to race, power to rebellions.

The festival, an unique one, will open up important discussions to understand world history and its changing traditions to the next generation, it will also discuss why growing intolerance is becoming the biggest bane of societies across the world. In some ways, this is Morocco’s international engagement with neighbouring and distant countries, the idea is to understand the world through extensive travels.

Mohammed Dekkak, a senior organiser of the festival, argues why the current global geo-political scenarios highlight an extraordinary connection of Morocco to other nations. He feels Morocco’s open-minded international relations will open up multicultural societies, sustainability, ethics fostering peace and mutual tolerance, all through travel. Dekkak – confident different countries with different races and cultures can still sign a common charter – speaks the mind of Ibn Battuta: Travel is the language of peace, important to drive in meaningful conversations. Dekkak firmly believes every traveller is an ambassador of peace, a citizen of the world.

Conversations will drive the show, there will be business as well.

Some of the world’s most powerful economies have their eyes on Africa and dialogues in and around Africa are gaining popularity across the world. It is happening mainly because of the continent’s wealth like diamonds and oil, besides Africa offers great agrarian opportunities. The festival in Morocco assumes importance because of the country’s highly competitive, emerging economy. Tangier – ironically Ibn Battuta’s hometown – is a melting point between Africa, Europe and the Arab World.

The former Indian vice president, Hamid Ansari, was in Morocco last June, pushing bilateral trade, among the deliverables phosphates used for fertilizer, extremely valuable to agrarian societies such as India. Moroccan phosphate resources are among the most extensive in the world, with only China and the United States reaching similar levels of production. In return for phosphates and other resources, New Delhi is keen to boost Morocco’s automobile and pharma productions.

But at the heart of everything, lie conversations, serious, stimulating conversations. Like the Vienna coffee stores which offer the first cup free so that people accepting the offer start their conversations and then, buy the second cup, the second edition of this unique conference could open up interesting conversations around a subject that has rattled the world for over a decade: Growing intolerance."
