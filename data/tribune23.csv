A five-member Supreme Court Bench has struck down several hundred years old Triple Talaq, a move that is being widely appreciated. Muslim folks from Tricity share their opinions

Manpriya Singh

It definitely takes longer, with a little more formalities, to return a faulty product delivered by Amazon. Then why should it take just three words spoken in haste to end a marriage? Well, so question the new-age Muslims (especially women). But mind you, we are tampering with several hundred years old integral religious practice to do with a personal law. Nevertheless —Unconstitutional! Unconstitutional! Unconstitutional! So said the Supreme Court Bench comprising five different judges from five different faiths—striking down Triple Talaq by a 3:2 majority. Ever since, it’s been trending, trolling and everything in between.

Enough being said, with a lot more to say on the subject, we go in search of a cross-section of Muslim community from the Tricity.

Cheers to progression

It’s a good decision. I totally agree with and respect Supreme Court banning the controversial Islamic practice. As a working woman and a mother, I feel we work just as hard, sometimes more and the least we expect in return is equality if not special privileges. So I am happy with the decision. My round of applause to the bench that has given the verdict!

— Binder Kaur, Muslim government school teacher, married to a Muslim

Women empowered

It’s a very pro-women development, so I am totally happy with the Supreme Court ruling rendering the Triple Talaq unconstitutional. We can’t talk about women empowerment until we talk about women equality, so it’s a positive step in that direction. Also it takes care of instances where divorce would happen in a fit of rage or other such similar circumstances.

— Jannat Jahan/Niana, former municipal councilor, married to a Muslim

Wait & watch

There’s a part of me that totally agrees with the Supreme Court decision. It’s especially a breather in case where men divorce their wives in a fit of rage. I, especially a father of a baby girl, feel it’s a pro-women step. But at the same time, the detailed verdict of Muslim bodies will be out on this one and as a member of the Muslim community, I will agree with what they have to say too.

— Master Ali, craftsman

The flip side

People murder their wives also in a fit of anger. At least it’s better than that! Further in pursuit of court verdicts, people end up ruining their youth, their life and a significant 10-15 years. At least, this way they can immediately move ahead with their separate lives. It’s a 1,400-year-old law; must have been made keeping some things in mind. I am not saying one should uphold the Triple Talaq law as it is without amendments. If a husband says Triple Talaq, there should definitely be further probe as to under what circumstances and why he said it, but to totally quash someone’s religious practice is not a done thing.

B-town—who tweeted, who didn’t!

Otherwise quite knowledgeable about current affairs and vocal about general developments, interestingly, the likes of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan are yet to tweet, re-tweet or say anything at all on the social media on this issue. Meanwhile, there are some who minced no words and took no time in hailing the verdict.

Anupam Kher: Some decisions are not for pappus or even bhakts. The decision of triple talaq is for the win of women empowerment.

Madhur Bhandarkar: Welcome judgment by Supreme Court to declare triple talaq as unconstitutional. This will start a new chapter in the empowerment of Muslim women.

Dia Mirza: A win for democracy! Historic day for women’s rights in our country.

Kabir Bedi: Since Supreme Court has declared triple talaq “unconstitutional”, why does Parliament have to enact a new law to void it.

"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","TORONTO: Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

Toronto

Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

The system, built by researchers at University of Waterloo in Canada, analyses images of skin lesions and provides doctors with data on telltale biomarkers of melanoma, which is deadly if detected late, but highly treatable if caught early.

It deciphers levels of biomarker substances in lesions, adding consistent, quantitative information to assessments currently based on appearance alone, researchers said.

In particular, changes in the concentration and distribution of eumelanin, a chemical that gives skin its colour, and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, are strong indicators of melanoma, they said.

The artificial intelligence (AI) system — trained using tens of thousands of skin images and their corresponding eumelanin and hemoglobin levels — could initially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, a significant health-care cost, researchers said.

It gives doctors objective information on lesion characteristics to help them rule out melanoma before taking more invasive action.

""This could be a very powerful tool for skin cancer clinical decision support. The more interpretable information there is, the better the decisions are,"" said Alexander Wong, a professor of systems design engineering at Waterloo.

""There can be a huge lag time before doctors even figure out what is going on with the patient. Our goal is to shorten that process"" Wong added. PTI"

WASHINGTON: Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make long duration space trips more feasible.

Washington

Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make long duration space trips more feasible.

Astronauts cannot take a lot of spare parts into space because every extra ounce adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape the Earth's gravity.

""If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we will need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them. Atom economy will become really important,"" said Mark A Blenner, from the Clemson University in the US.

The solution lies in part with the astronauts themselves, who will constantly generate waste from breathing, eating and using materials.

Unlike people on Earth, Blenner said, spacefarers would not want to throw any waste molecules away.

Researchers are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.

Some essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, have a shelf life of just a couple of years, said Blenner.

They will need to be made en route, beginning a few years after launch, or at the destination.

""Having a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing what they need, when they need it, is the motivation for our project,"" Blenner said.

The biological system includes a variety of strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. These organisms require both nitrogen and carbon to grow.

Researchers discovered that the yeast could obtain their nitrogen from urea in untreated urine. Meanwhile, the yeast obtains its carbon from CO2, which could come from astronauts' exhaled breath, or from the Martian atmosphere.

However, to use CO2, the yeast requires a middleman to 'fix' the carbon into a form they can ingest.

For this purpose, the yeast relies on photosynthetic cyanobacteria or algae provided by the researchers.

One of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers. Those polymers could then be used in a 3D printer to generate new plastic parts.

Researchers are continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerised into different types of polyesters with a range of properties.

For now, the engineered yeast strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients, but the scientists are working on boosting output.

They are also looking into applications here on Earth, in fish farming and human nutrition. For example, fish raised via aquaculture need to be given omega-3 fatty acid supplements, which could be produced by Blenner's yeast strains. PTI"
5-year jail for retired Col,"DISPROPORTIONATE ASSETS CASE

Chandigarh, August 22

The special CBI court here today sentenced Col BS Guraya (retd) to five years in jail and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on him in a disproportionate assets case. Judge Gagangeet Kaur also ordered that disproportionate assets worth Rs 66.94 lakh of Colonel Goraya would be confiscated by the state. He was found guilty under Sections 13 (1) (e) and 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and was taken into police custody on August 18. The case had been pending for 28 years. Colonel Guraya’s family members were present in the court. Later, they were seen in deep discussion outside the court as they awaited a copy of the judgment. Colonel Guraya’s counsel SPS Bhullar said they would approach the High Court “as soon as possible”. He expressed displeasure over the “delay” in the judgment. “The sentence was announced after 5 pm; it shows lack of preparation on the part of the Judge,” said Bhullar. It was stated that between January 1987 and August 1990, Colonel Guraya, as a serving Army officer, and some others had acquired properties worth Rs 82.58 lakh. The properties were disproportionate to his known sources of income. The CBI court, during the trial, had also attached the Sector 9 house of the former Army officer. — TNS"
All for six gold bangles,"Surinderjit Singh Sandhu

I STILL have nightmarish memories from my childhood in Amritsar in the 1960s, when big landlords would flee their houses whenever a tehsildar or a naib-tehsildar visited their village for the recovery of land revenue and taccavis (loans). He would go back after attaching and taking away some cattle and household goods of defaulters. This horrifying visit would start the process of searching for a better-off relative or acquaintance for credit of hundred rupees or so to pay revenue etc. The peasantry has remained a deprived class in spite of government claims of granting it favours. The Partition had set in motion the beginning of long tales of woe of millions of displaced farmers. Their rehabilitation was accompanied by the consolidation of holdings, which brought for them immense misery. Then came the security of the Land Tenure Act in 1953 to limit landholdings. The 1970s consolidated the Green Revolution, but gave another blow to farmers by way of enactment of the Land Reforms Act, further reducing the landholdings. The government legislated the Punjab Commercial Crops Cess Act, 1974, fixing Rs 3 per crop per acre each season for chillies, cotton, mustard seeds, potatoes, sugarcane, etc., in addition to the land revenue and surcharge. Along with the Green Revolution, Punjab saw the emergence of the Naxal movement. Sangrur district was considerably affected by it. A renowned revolutionary leader, Teja Singh Swatantar, represented Sangrur in Parliament. So, the peasantry in the area was spirited to call in question any government action, which it deemed was not in its interest. Farmers refused to pay revenue, water rate and commercial crops cess in protest. In those days, this collection was reviewed every month. The SDMs of Sangrur had to feel small in these meetings. The government took a serious view and decided to seek police help. I was under training in the revenue department and was assigned two villages. A police inspector and 20 policemen accompanied our team of revenue officers. We started at 4 am and reached the village in an hour. The nambardar took us to a big house. The door was opened by a perplexed man who argued that he would pay only when the entire village paid. The villagers got wind of our raid and started pouring in, raising slogans. However, looking at the number of armed policemen, some of them courted arrest. We started attaching articles like sewing machines, utensils and cattle. The scene was pathetic, even big houses did not have anything of visible valuable. In one house, only a young boy and a girl were present. The girl said she would pay if even one person from the village paid it. The tehsil jamadar tried to enter the house, but she warned him against it. Angry, she went inside and returned with six gold bangles. ‘My father bought them for my dowry before dying. Take them.’ Saying so, she burst into tears. We entered the bangles as attached items and tried to comfort her, saying once the arrears were cleared these would be returned. But she slammed the door. After some days, hundreds of villagers came to pay her revenue and take the bangles back."
Tension grips Karnal village after clash between two groups,"Two tractors and two bikes torched, several shots fired

Tribune News Service

Karnal, August 23

Tension gripped Manchuri village in the district after a clash between two groups over a panchayat land of around three acres on Wednesday morning.

Two tractors and two bikes were torched by the mob. Several shots were reportedly fired. More than 10 persons sustained injuries and are admitted at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital (KCGMCH).

A large number of police personnel have been deployed in the village to maintain peace and harmony.

As per the residents, the incident took place at around 10.30 am over a land of around three acres of panchayat, which was allotted for a school.

A group was trying to encroach upon the land by moving tractors in it today, following which the residents of the village reached there and objected, which led to this incident. While the other group claimed of having a stay order in their favour.

As per the eyewitnesses, some of the residents set the two tractors and two bikes on fire. These tractors and bikes were belonging to those who came there to harvest land.

The injured have been identified as Amar Singh, Renu, Raj Kumar, Kajal, Raj Kumar, Nafe Singh, Darbara Singh, Jhirmal Singh, Balwinder Singh, Balkar Singh, Bakhshish Singh and others.

Darbara Singh said they have a stay order of this land in their favour, that’s why they went there to take the possession.

While from the other side, Rohtash, a resident of the village, said that it was panchayat land and was allotted for school, but some persons wanted to encroach upon it.

DSP Assandh Dalbir Singh rushed to the spot with heavy police force and took the situation under control.

“We are investigating the case and statements are yet to be recorded from both the sides. We will also verify the revenue record to ascertain the reality,” said the DSP.

SP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa confirmed that the shots were fired and the police have been deployed there to maintain law and order.

Four persons of one party sustained bullet injuries, while four persons of other party have injuries from sharp-edged weapons."

Purohit walks out of jail after 9 years; reports back to his Army unit,"New Delhi, August 23

Soon after walking out of a jail in Maharastra on bail after nine years, Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, on Wednesday reported back to an Army unit in Mumbai.

Army sources here said he reported to the liasoning unit of the Army’s Southern Command in Mumbai and is currently staying at an Army establishment in the city.

They said Purohit, an officer from intelligence corp, is likely to go to his unit in Pune where he was working before his arrest in the Malegaon blast case in late 2008.

He was released from Taloja jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai earlier today, two days after the Supreme Court granted him bail observing that there were contradictions in the charge sheets filed by different investigating agencies probing the case.

The sources said the Army headquarters will review his suspension from service after examining the court order.

During his stay in his unit, Purohit will be under various restrictions including his movement inside the unit.

The sources said the Army headquarters will study the Supreme Court’s order granting him bail and accordingly a call will be taken on whether to revoke his suspension from service.

Asked about the escort provided to Purohit after he came out of the jail, the sources said he was given the protection considering possible security threat to him.

Purohit, who was posted with a unit under Southern Command and was an officer from intelligence corp, was suspended from service soon after he was arrested in connection with the Malegaon blast case in late 2008.

After the report of the Court of Inquiry (CoI), Purohit’s salary and allowances were restricted to 25 per cent of his total pay but it was increased to 75 per cent following an order by the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), the sources said.

Purohit had approached the AFT after the cut in his salary following report of the CoI.

Six people were killed in the blast on September 29, 2008, at Malegaon, a communally-sensitive textile town in Nasik district of north Maharashtra.

The apex court set aside the April 25 verdict of the Bombay High Court denying bail to Purohit, but imposed certain restrictions while granting him relief. — PTI"
"Punjab, Haryana on maximum alert ahead of Dera verdict","Tribune News Service



Chandigarh, August 23

Over one lakh followers have reached Panchkula as Haryana and Punjab maintain maximum alert ahead of the court judgment in a rape case against the Dera head. As a precautionary measure, the government has ordered closure of schools and colleges in Panchkula district on August 24 and 25, Deputy Commissioner Gauri Parashar Joshi said on Wednesday.

Haryana Government also declared a holiday for August 24 and 25 in government offices and banks situated in Sectors 4, 5 and 6 in Panchkula district.

Many followers are still arriving at the sect’s Sector-23 based ‘Naam Charcha Ghar’ (congregation/prayer centre) in Panchkula to show their solidarity with the sect chief, who has been asked to appear in person in the special CBI court on Friday.

Joshi said the administration and police were keeping an eye to ensure that law and order was maintained. There is heavy police and paramilitary forces’ deployment near the routes leading to the district court complex in Panchkula, where the lawyers have suspended work for three days from Wednesday to avoid inconvenience to the public visiting the courts.When asked if the dera chief would appear before the court in Panchkula on Friday, a spokesman of Dera Sacha Sauda on Wednesday said the sect and its head had always followed law and would do so in future also. “We have always followed due process of law, never have we gone out of law’s purview and never ever will we do so,” he said. When asked if Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh would appeal to his followers to help maintain law and order and peace, he said, “During his satsangs (at sect headquarters in Sirsa) in mornings and evenings, Guruji always talks about humanity and things which will benefit humanity. He talks about tree plantation, organ donations, blood donation and helping out weaker sections.” Security forces in Haryana and Punjab have been taking out flag marches at many sensitive places. The Haryana government has already clamped prohibitory orders in all its districts as a precautionary measure. Police have set up barricades at several places in the two states, besides their common capital Chandigarh, where security has been further tightened ahead of the court verdict.Amid reports that the dera followers could stock petrol, lathis and other weapons at Naam Charcha Ghars, Punjab Police have asked all its SSPs and other top-ranking police officials to be alert against any such action by the followers if the court verdict goes against the Dera chief. Haryana’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Ram Niwas said that carrying of any kind of stick or weapon had been prohibited at Naam Charcha Ghars of dera followers in the state. Authorities in Haryana are making every effort to ensure foolproof security arrangements, with a senior official firmly saying that they would not allow a repeat of things as witnessed in November 2015 when there was a two-week tense standoff between the self-styled ‘godman’ Rampal’s followers and the police in Hisar during which five women and a child had died. Rampal was later arrested and close to 15,000 of his followers were evacuated from his sprawling premises in Hisar. While Haryana DGP BS Sandhu has already toured sensitive districts in the state, including Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar and other places during the past few days, his Punjab counterpart Suresh Arora on Tuesday took a whirlwind tour of Bathinda, Mansa, Moga, Patiala, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and Mohali districts, and checked preparedness. Heavy police has been deployed in Bathinda, which shares its border with Sirsa, where the dera has its headquarters. Union Territory Chandigarh’s Home department has declared the cricket stadium in Sector 16, which was associated with early training days of legendary Kapil Dev and has hosted several domestic and international matches, as ‘temporary jail’ on August 25. Officials have said the ‘temporary jail’ can be used to confine people suspected of creating law and order problem on Friday. Senior cops and administrative officers of Haryana, Punjab and UT Chandigarh have been holding confabulations to take stock of the security arrangements.Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has also held parleys with top police and administrative brass. The Haryana government has also requested the Centre to provide 115 companies of paramilitary forces, out of which many have already reached the state. Duty magistrates have been deployed at all locations in Haryana. While Punjab had already received 75 companies of central forces, Haryana got 35 companies to maintain security. Police along with paramilitary forces, the CRPF and Rapid Action Force (RAF), SSB held flag marches at vulnerable places, including Moga, Bathinda, Sangrur, Barnala, Patiala, Ludhiana, Panchkula, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Ambala and Hisar. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh warned against any attempts to disrupt the state’s law and order in view of the upcoming judgment by the Panchkula court. “All steps were being taken to ensure that law and order is not disturbed in any way in the wake of the court orders,” the Chief Minister said on Tuesday. The sexual exploitation case was registered against the Dera chief in 2002 by the CBI on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court after anonymous letters were circulated about the alleged sexual exploitation of two Sadhvis (female followers) by Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. However, the dera chief has denied these charges.

Gauri Chhabra

One of the quickest growing fields in bio-medical science is that of Genome Sequencing. It deals with the study of biological changes in living organisms. It is the branch of biotechnology that deals with the study of cells, structural and functional unit of living organisms.

Nearly every cell in the human body — from the ones in the fingernails to the ones deep inside the brain-contains a complete set of DNA, the operating instructions that influence everything from a person’s hair colour to susceptibility to disease. For years, doctors have been able to test specific genes to detect the presence of mutations associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. But only recently have scientists been able to map out a person’s entire genetic code, or genome, by sequencing all 20,000 or so genes in one fell swoop. There has been a huge movement in affordable rapid genome sequencing recently and this will produce massive numbers of new genetic data on individuals, as well as populations. The challenge is now on for a new generation of scientists who are able to combine genetics and bioinformatics in an effort to understand how various genomic changes can cause life-threatening diseases such as cancer. This will enable the development of new treatments, through combining drug and gene therapy, along with prevention strategies.

Getting in

If you are interested in getting admission in bachelor courses, you have to complete higher secondary examination with physics, chemistry & biology. The duration of this course is three years. Some colleges also conduct an aptitude test for admission in genetics course.

To get admission in master’s course, you must have done a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field from any recognised college or university. Some institutions also give admission in genetic courses on the basis of the merit list of the qualifying examination.

Career Scape

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors collect and analyse data about patients’ medical and genetic histories. You will also provide information and help families and individuals about the occurrence, risk and minimisation of inherited diseases. You can also have job duties in areas such as administration, research, teaching and lab work. Institutions such as hospitals, universities, laboratories, research facilities and government agencies can employ genetic counselors.

Laboratory Geneticists: These are specialists in genetics with relation to laboratory medicine and DNA testing. You will research genetic material to assist and work for agricultural, pharmaceutical, clinical medicine and law enforcement organisations. Many laboratory geneticists have 4-6 years of postsecondary education, while lab directors may hold either a Ph.D. or an MD degree

Clinical Geneticists: Clinical geneticists are generally licensed physicians, and may also be involved in the field of medical genetics. You can be specialised in areas such as oncology, pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology, and work in hospitals, medical centers or other research centers. In addition, clinical geneticists may manage a team of genetic counselors and work together to help identify and minimise the risk factors for certain hereditary diseases.

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors play a key role in helping patients and their families get the care that’s right for them. Genetic counselors work with doctors and other members of the health care team to help patients understand what their family history means to them, decide what genetic tests to have, and know how to use the test results to make the best treatment choices. This is especially helpful today as medicine becomes more personalised, and treatment plans increasingly are tailored to a patient’s individual needs.

The road ahead

Genetics has become popular, and there are many areas in biology and medicine that require genetics. Therefore, this is one field which offers immense opportunities.

What is Genome Sequencing?

The technique that allows researchers to read and decipher the genetic information found in the DNA of anything from bacteria to plants to animals is called genome sequencing.

Genomics involves measuring everything about a genome and the changes between genomes.

Genome sequencing involves the determination of the order of DNA bases. You may be wondering what makes these bases so important. In a strand of DNA, there are some simple units known as nucleotides. These nucleotides have a 'backbone' that consists of sugars and a phosphate group.

Commonly used techniques in genomics are DNA sequencing, microarrays, and PCR.

Genomics is being increasingly used in medicine to help diagnose disease since an individual’s DNA sequence can provide insights into the potential for developing specific diseases.

Genomics is one of many ""-omics"" disciplines that is becoming more prominent in biotechnology and research as a whole.

Discoveries in this field often allign with innovations in the technologies available to conduct analysis and perform sequencing or assays.

The very basic unit of the human genome is a single DNA nucleotide. This nucleotide is made up of minuscule atoms, which create a challenge for even an advanced microscope to be used for detection. Researchers still, however, need to be able to determine the sequence of bases in DNA.

New Delhi, August 22

The Bawana assembly by-election tomorrow is being keenly contested between three major political opponents — the BJP, AAP and the Congress – with each eyeing a victory hoping to reassert its popularity among residents in the capital.

Nearly three lakh people are eligible to cast votes at 379 polling stations set up across the constituency in Northwest Delhi. Results of the bypoll will be announced on August 28.

Though the AAP enjoys an overwhelming majority in the assembly, a victory in the bypoll would be a shot in the arm for the party after successive setbacks in the civic polls, the Rajouri Garden Assembly by-election and the assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.

The Kejriwal-led party has pitched Ramchandra from the constituency where he will take on the BJP’s nominee Ved Prakash whose resignation from the MLA post and followed by leaving the AAP had actually necessitated the bypolls. Prakash joined the BJP in March this year.

The BJP, which has just four members in the 70-member assembly, hopes to maintain its winning streak in the city while the other major contender Congress is hoping to open its account after being relegated to zero in the 70-member Delhi Legislative Assembly. The Congress has fielded its former three-time MLA from Bawana, Surender Kumar.

EVMs equipped with voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) will be used in the bypoll, as per a statement from the Chief Electoral Officer, Delhi.

The number of male, female and third gender electors are 1,64,114; 1,30,143; and 25, respectively. The average number of voters per polling station stands at 776. Of 379 polling stations in the constituency, 311 have less than 1,000 registered electors, while 68 have more than 1,000 registered electors, it said."
Twitter can help track opioid misuse,"New York

Researchers have found that Twitter can be a useful tool to find out how widespread the misuse of prescribed opioid drug is in a particular state or town, or to track the dynamics of opioid misuse in a given locality over time.

""Traditional methods of gauging opioid misuse in an area rely on compiling reports from local emergency rooms and poison control call centers,"" said lead researcher Michael Chary from the Department of Emergency Medicine of New York Presbyterian Queens hospital.

""Through social media we can observe a much larger fraction of the population, perhaps intervening before things reach the level of needing emergency medical care,"" Chary added.

Chary and his team analysed more than 3.6 million tweets and found that the information about opioid misuse was significantly correlated with federal surveys over the last three years.

For the study, published in the Journal of Medical Toxicology, the research group curated a list of keywords related to the misuse of prescribed opioids.

Based on these keywords and with the help of a software, the researchers extracted English-language tweets between the years 2012 and 2014.

In the process 3,611,528 tweets all containing at least one of the selected keywords about the misuse of prescribed opioids were selected.

The software then identified linguistic characteristics that distinguished tweets that credibly mentioned opioid misuse from spam tweets and clustered them based on semantic distance.

The team then used metadata from Twitter to identify the location of each tweet. To validate their findings, Chary and his group compared the Twitter data to geographical data contained in the 2013-2015 National Surveys on Drug Usage and Health (NSDUH).

NSDUH is a government funded confidential survey conducted annually by professional interviewers, and includes information obtained from about 70,000 Americans. It is commonly used to determine countrywide trends in substance use.

Mentions about the misuse of prescribed opioids on Twitter were found to strongly correlate with state-by-state information contained in the NSDUH.

The correlation was highest for individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 years old.

The findings from this new study show that social media can also be used to track public interest in opioid misuse, or perhaps other substances, Chary said.

""We found that our estimates agreed with national survey data, suggesting that social media can be a reliable additional source of epidemiological data regarding substance use,"" Chary said.

"Inquiry ordered into works at Jageshwar, Katarmal temples","Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 22

Tourism and Irrigation Minister Satpal Maharaj today announced an enquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds allocated by the Central government for initiating development works at Jageshwar and Katarmal temples. “The enquiry will be conducted by Meenakshi Sundaram, Secretary, Uttarakhand Tourism. The development carried by the agencies hired by the previous government did not follow the guidelines set by the Archaeological Survey of India,” alleged Satpal Maharaj, while addressing mediapersons. He said the work comprising development of tourism infrastructure did not adhere to the 200 metre limit set by the Archaeological Survey of India. The Centre had sanctioned Heritage Circuit Project ‘Swades’ for developing tourism infrastructure in Jageshwar-Devidhura-Katarmal-Baijnath sites at a cost of Rs 83 crore. The highlights of the project include development of eco-log huts, sound and light show and upgrading of temple pathways. The work was carried by the Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN), but it was stopped midway after the ASI raised objections. He said a memorandum of understanding would be inked with the UP government on the water sharing and other issues pertaining to Jamrani Dam on August 24 and 25. The multipurpose dam envisaged in 1975 is expected to provide drinking to Haldwani and Nainital, along with Bijnor and Rampur districts in Uttar Pradesh. The issue has been hanging fire since 2000 and is now nearing resolution. The department is also holding talks with the Central government to upgrade Institute of Hotel Management to a Central institute. “We will be able to raise the number of seats from 220 to 240,” he said. He e prehistoric tourism circuit at Lakotiyar in Almora would be promoted. “The prehistoric sites in Almora are more than 5,000 years old and we will develop a new prehistoric circuit to attract visitors,” he said."
Former Manchester United striker Berbatov joins Kerala Blasters,"Sofia, August 23

Indian Super League’s Kerala Blasters have signed former Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur striker Dimitar Berbatov ahead of the 2017-18 season, the player’s agent said on Wednesday.

The 36-year-old, who has signed a one-year contract, was a free agent after leaving the Greek side PAOK Salonika in June 2016.

Berbatov, who is Bulgaria’s all-time leading scorer with 48 goals in 79 matches, joined United from Spurs in 2008 for a then club-record fee of 30 million pounds ($39 million).

In Manchester, the Bulgarian scored 48 goals in 108 Premier League appearances, winning two league titles.

Berbatov will link up with Kerala’s new head coach Rene Meulensteen, who worked with him during his time at Old Trafford as well as Fulham.

Last week, the Indian club also signed former Manchester United defender Wes Brown.

Berbatov, named Bulgaria’s Footballer of the Year on seven occasions, has also played for CSKA Sofia, Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco during his illustrious career. — Reuters"

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"

Avoid politics over triple talaq

Also in this section

Mergers and manoeuvres

The long-drawn battle over triple talaq should now end with the Supreme Court, through a 3-2 majority, declaring it as unconstitutional and banning it for six months, hoping Parliament would pass a law by then. The apex court has wisely set a time limit and resisted the temptation to create a law itself, which is not its job. The judgment provides relief to Muslim women fighting for equality. A verbal divorce, which lately has gone to the ridiculous level of being delivered on the Skype or through a WhatsApp message, is plainly arbitrary and retrograde. Several Muslim countries have outlawed it. Triple talaq gives men an unfair advantage over women. In an instant a divorced woman is thrown out in the street. The threat of divorce leads to her subjugation and denial of equal rights as an individual. Opposition to the judgment from conservative Muslims is understandable. However, the Supreme Court itself was split over certain issues. The majority view on the Constitution Bench, consisting of all-male judges drawn from different faiths, is that triple talaq is not sanctioned by the Koran, hence it cannot be part of the fundamental right to religion. It is not “integral to religious practice and violates constitutional morality”. The dissenting opinion expressed by Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer is that triple talaq “may be sinful”, but the court can’t interfere in personal laws which have the status of fundamental right under the Constitution. Even though lower courts in the past have given judgments on similar lines against triple talaq, the issue this time has been politicised and blown out of proportion. This is partly because of noisy, polarising debates in TV studios and partly because BJP spokespersons have shown unusual interest in the subject. Muslims have apprehensions about the BJP’s gender politics. The party, they fear, might try to divide them for votes. Lynchings and mob violence over beef and cows have strengthened that fear. The fact that it is a court verdict and not a BJP government’s order should set at rest their worries. They can draw comfort from the court’s interpretation that triple talaq is not backed by the Koran."
Rocky rocks!,"MOVIE REVIEW - ROCKY MENTAL

Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill. Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment. The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill. Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise. Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man. Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed. The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots. Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

"Sex change, shift from one trap to another","Jalandhar turning into centre for gender reassignment surgery

Rachna Khaira

Tribune News Service

Jalandhar, August 22

(Follow

; and

)

Those not comfortable with the gender they are born with have a legal option of undergoing a sex-change surgery to become who they feel they really are. A majority of those seeking the “sex reassignment surgery (SRS)” are, however, doing it for a sad motivation — greater income in prostitution, a profession many transgenders find themselves forced into. Jalandhar, often referred to as the medical hub of North India, has also become a centre of sorts for SRS. The Supreme Court in 2014 had ruled that governments cannot deprive a person of the right to acquire the preferred gender through surgery. The procedures, however, are conducted under utmost secrecy, for hospitals fear social reprisal. Chandni was thrown out by ‘her’ family after they became aware of her transgender status around 14 years ago. Now 22, and with no job, Chandni has felt compelled to join prostitution, in aid of which she underwent sex change in the city recently. “Unlike most people, we do not get equal opportunity to study or work. Also, most of us are disowned by our families. With no support, more than 90 per cent of us end up in the flesh trade,” she told The Tribune. “As a transgender, we earn Rs 1,000-3,000 for a night; now as a ‘girl’, I can even get up to Rs 30,000. With no other means of income, the surgery has come as a lifeline to me,” Chandni said. She now also finds it easier to enter “reputed” dance bars, clubs or party joints.This is also a reason why the majority of such surgeries are sought to change from male to female. The hospitals offering this service do not want to highlight it as they fear the wrath of socio-religious groups. But the hush-hush manner also makes it possible for them to exploit those seeking the surgery by charging arbitrary amounts. One transgender in the city claimed hospitals ask for anything between Rs 2 lakh and 7 lakh. “They squeeze everything out of us. I got my surgery done last year from a reputed hospital here, and paid over Rs 5 lakh, nearly all my savings,” claimed 20-year-old Ruhi, another transgender. She wanted that Punjab, like Kerala, should also introduce the facility at a few government hospitals. “If the government cannot provide us education and job opportunities, it should at least provide us this treatment free of cost,” she demanded. Ruhi was born a boy to a bank employee in Kapurthala, but could never identify with her male body. While the legal sanction given to sex-reassignment surgeries may have provided a lifeline to the sexual minority who feel trapped inside their bodies, the lack of empathy and rehabilitation opportunities is increasingly leading to the victimisation of innocent lives.

Subsidy on beekeeping doubled,"Tribune News Service

Chief Minister TS Rawat has announced hike in subsidy to beekeepers from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Addressing a workshop here, the CM said a laboratory would also be set up for testing the quality of honey. He said, “Certified organic honey is in great demand all over the world. If we set up a laboratory here, it will help the farmers sell certified, pure honey. This will increase their income.” The state government will launch multipurpose scheme for farmers on August 25. The scheme entails offering loan of Rs 1 lakh to farmers at an interest rate of 2 percent. The scheme also figured in the BJP’s vision document released prior to the 2017 elections. A total of 4,600 farmers are engaged in beekeeping activity, while the state produces 2,083 metric tonne honey annually."

A five-member Supreme Court Bench has struck down several hundred years old Triple Talaq, a move that is being widely appreciated. Muslim folks from Tricity share their opinions

Manpriya Singh

It definitely takes longer, with a little more formalities, to return a faulty product delivered by Amazon. Then why should it take just three words spoken in haste to end a marriage? Well, so question the new-age Muslims (especially women). But mind you, we are tampering with several hundred years old integral religious practice to do with a personal law. Nevertheless —Unconstitutional! Unconstitutional! Unconstitutional! So said the Supreme Court Bench comprising five different judges from five different faiths—striking down Triple Talaq by a 3:2 majority. Ever since, it’s been trending, trolling and everything in between.

Enough being said, with a lot more to say on the subject, we go in search of a cross-section of Muslim community from the Tricity.

Cheers to progression

It’s a good decision. I totally agree with and respect Supreme Court banning the controversial Islamic practice. As a working woman and a mother, I feel we work just as hard, sometimes more and the least we expect in return is equality if not special privileges. So I am happy with the decision. My round of applause to the bench that has given the verdict!

— Binder Kaur, Muslim government school teacher, married to a Muslim

Women empowered

It’s a very pro-women development, so I am totally happy with the Supreme Court ruling rendering the Triple Talaq unconstitutional. We can’t talk about women empowerment until we talk about women equality, so it’s a positive step in that direction. Also it takes care of instances where divorce would happen in a fit of rage or other such similar circumstances.

— Jannat Jahan/Niana, former municipal councilor, married to a Muslim

Wait & watch

There’s a part of me that totally agrees with the Supreme Court decision. It’s especially a breather in case where men divorce their wives in a fit of rage. I, especially a father of a baby girl, feel it’s a pro-women step. But at the same time, the detailed verdict of Muslim bodies will be out on this one and as a member of the Muslim community, I will agree with what they have to say too.

— Master Ali, craftsman

The flip side

People murder their wives also in a fit of anger. At least it’s better than that! Further in pursuit of court verdicts, people end up ruining their youth, their life and a significant 10-15 years. At least, this way they can immediately move ahead with their separate lives. It’s a 1,400-year-old law; must have been made keeping some things in mind. I am not saying one should uphold the Triple Talaq law as it is without amendments. If a husband says Triple Talaq, there should definitely be further probe as to under what circumstances and why he said it, but to totally quash someone’s religious practice is not a done thing.

— Muslim cleric in a Sector 20 mosque, who refused to be named

B-town—who tweeted, who didn’t!

Otherwise quite knowledgeable about current affairs and vocal about general developments, interestingly, the likes of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan are yet to tweet, re-tweet or say anything at all on the social media on this issue. Meanwhile, there are some who minced no words and took no time in hailing the verdict.

Anupam Kher: Some decisions are not for pappus or even bhakts. The decision of triple talaq is for the win of women empowerment.

Madhur Bhandarkar: Welcome judgment by Supreme Court to declare triple talaq as unconstitutional. This will start a new chapter in the empowerment of Muslim women.

Dia Mirza: A win for democracy! Historic day for women’s rights in our country.

Kabir Bedi: Since Supreme Court has declared triple talaq “unconstitutional”, why does Parliament have to enact a new law to void it.

"SRK, Salman, Akshay part of Forbes’ list of highest paid actors","New York, August 23

Indian superstars Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar are among the top 10 highest paid actors in the world in a list compiled by Forbes that has been topped by ""Transformers"" actor Mark Wahlberg.

Shahrukh is at the eighth spot on the list with earnings of 38 million dollars, followed by Salman on the ninth position with 37 million dollars.

Akshay is completing the top 10 with 35.5 million dollar earnings.

Wahlberg is Hollywood's highest-paid leading man, earning $68 million in the scoring period. Forbes said the Boston native recorded his highest-ever payday thanks to soaring fees for movies such as ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" and the forthcoming ""Daddy's Home 2"".

Wahlberg replaced last year's top-ranked star, Dwayne Johnson who comes in at the second spot with 65 million dollar earnings.

On the third spot is ""The Fate of the Furious"" star Vin Diesel with USD 54.5 million earnings.

Rounding out the top five is Adam Sandler at the number four position with 50.5 million dollars and Jackie Chan on number five with $49 million dollars.

Sandler returns to the list courtesy the lucrative deal with Netflix that allows him to produce his own movies for the platform.

The world's 20 highest-paid actors tallied a combined $720 million between June 2016 and June 2017, before fees and taxes.

A quarter of this year's list hail from outside the US, including the three stars from Bollywood.

Forbes said this year, newcomers comprise one fifth of the list, including Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, Jeremy Renner and Mark Ruffalo.

Hollywood's highest-paid actors continue to out-earn their female counterparts, Forbes said adding that the top 10 actors banked a cumulative $488.5 million -- nearly three times the $172.5 million combined total of the 10 top-earning women. While only three actresses made more than $20 million in 12 months, 16 actors broached the mark, it said. — PTI"
The Java connect,"Pulsating with performances, art and life, the city of Yogyakarta in Indonesia gives you the feel of being in a different era

Akash Mehrotra

An ancient city and the last remaining Sultanate of Indonesia, Yogyakarta has been a cradle of art and culture and for long nurtured the Javanese connection with the outer world. Old ways of life exist side by side with bustling modernity here and the city decorates itself with the symbols of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. From shadow puppetry, the age old extraordinary Buddhist temple of Borobodur and the equally impressive Hindu ones of Prambanan, socially aware graffiti on the wall to the beautifully styled Batik designs; Yogyakarta, Indonesia’s second most visited spot, is a cultural palette on display.

The city comes as a huge relief from the urbane madness of Jakarta; narrow roads lined with trees, old buildings wearing a colonial touch, shops styled as pagodas, alleys lined with themed restaurants, art cafes often buzzing with some performances, random music bands performing on streets, endless boards advertising batik designing lessons, and strangers wearing a gracious smile; Yogyakarta gives you a feeling of being in a different era.

The city is always throbbing with performances, mostly unannounced. An art gallery will host a performer or a dance troupe visiting the city performing an ancient myth, puppetry shows in some random corner around the Sultan’s palace, rappers set up on a plaza, some impromptu performance in some coffee shop or even private homes inviting strangers for a local gamelan performance; festivals can pop up in any corner.

And as you remain on the lookout for the art scenes, don’t miss to do what all travel blogs tell you. Yogyakarta is a Unesco heritage site for its old temples and its age-old puppetry tradition. Put these in your ‘must-do’ list and then proceed. Start off your day with the Krotan Palace, snaking your way through the alleys of the old town, an area owned by the Sultan. The palace stands like a happy collision between the conformist and the iconoclastic. Perhaps, the most captivating, the Gamelan music, an ensemble of bronze percussion instruments, including gongs, xylophones and drums, often combined with string and wind instruments as well as vocals, can be experienced regularly throughout the week.

At a stone’s throw is the water castle. At a walkable distance from there, through the narrow alleys, housing some painters, designers and artists is the underground masque.

Cut to evening and brace yourself for some more artesia. In the north of the airport stands another emblem of Yogyakarta cultural heritage — the Prambanan temple. The towering temples with spires and spectacularly sculpted walls are a treat to watch. The temple also serves a backdrop of the Ramayana ballet, a spectacular staging of the South Asian Hindu epic, in a dance drama form, with firelights, extravagant costumes, gamelan orchestra, grandeur and an adroit mastery in story-telling. The town seems to have grown up with the Ramayana tales, no wonder many kids (including Muslim kids) have been named after characters of The Ramayana.

The Borobodur Temple

Ditch that urge to lie in late and take an hour-long drive past the enchanting countryside to the Borobodur temple, the largest Buddhist temple excavated in the early 19th century by the then British king of Indonesia, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Sitting atop a hill, surrounded by volcanoes, Borobodur haunts with its striking architectural beauty. A colossal 30 metre-high step pyramid, housing some 500 Buddha sculptures perched around and lower terraces built as balustrades with countless sculptures from Buddha’s life and teachings, the temple is a sight to behold.

In the early 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of the site and ordered its excavation. Even though one can find enough cues of this decay in the temple, Borobodur stands as a defining architectural piece and attracts hundreds of travellers and art lovers from across the world, for academic revelations and picture perfect moments.

Both Prambanan and Borobodur, give a peep into how elegantly Yogyakarta embraced and nurtured different cultures and religious ideals, which still live in the daily rituals of the common folk in the form of rituals, myths, stories passed on from one generation to other, puppetry shows, music, dance forms or just as symbols hung on doorsteps."
“A play has repeat value if the subject is relevant”,"If you have been wondering who goes to theatre in the age of digital entertainment, there are plays that have been running for decades now

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

At a time when cinema has a turnover of millions, television shows have been running for years, actors and producers are raking in the moolah, including new entrants on social media, yet in all this theatre, the world’s first form of entertainment, has been chugging along. It neither has the money, the visibility nor the fame. But actors of every genre swear by it.

“That is because there is an audience which realises the thrill of live theatre. Any live event becomes more humane due to the ‘human error factor’ and that adds to the thrill,” declares Nitish Bhardwaj, once again performing the role of Lord Krishna in the currently running play Chakravyuha, which has completed more than 65 shows. His first role as Lord Krishna in B. R. Chopra-produced TV serial Mahabharata (1988) immortalised him.

“There is human touch and a live audience! Even the long-running plays have something new happening in every show. This is what keeps the adrenalin pumping”, says Jayati Bhatia, who has acted in television series like Sasural Simar Ka, Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki, Jassi Jaise Koi Nahin and theatre shows like Vagina Monologues, Blame it on Yashraj, Mahatma Vs Gandhi for more than two decades now.

A well-written and well-directed play often gets a full house and has a tremendous repeat value. The longest-running play in the world, Mousetrap, is written by English crime novelist and playwriter Dame Agatha Christie. It opened in London’s West End in 1952 and has completed 26,703 shows at its last count!

In India, too, several plays in many regional languages, have completed more than 2,000 to 3,000 shows. Many have been staged for decades with a change of actors and directors. To name a few: in Marathi, we have Ghasiram Kotwal, written by Vijay Tendulkar and directed by Dr Jabbar Patel (1973), Nat Samrat written by V. V. Shirwadkar and acted brilliantly by Dr Shriram Lagoo (1970), Katyar Kaljat Ghusali made famous by the singing and acting of Vasantrao Deshpande (1967). In Kannada, we have Hayavadana by Girish Karnad (1971), Jokumar Swamy (1972) directed by B.V.Karanth, Mukhya Mantri (play adapted by Ranjit Kapoor from a 1976 novel by Panchari Sen, translated by TS Lohitshwah (1978). In English, we have Dance Like A Man directed by Lillete Dubey (more than 550 shows), Hamlet the Crown Prince directed by Rajat Kapoor (more than 200 shows in Mumbai alone), Love Letters was adapted in India (1993) from Pulitzer prize-winning American play by A. R. Gurney. The latest sensation is English play Vagina Monologues, which was first performed in 2003, and even after more than 1000 shows, it runs to a packed house.

“A play has repeat value if the subject is forever relevant”, observes Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal, the woman behind Indian adaption of the iconic Vagina Monolgues (1996) play by Eve Ensler. The popularity of the play and a demand for it to be staged in places where English isn’t the spoken or common language, made them translate it into Hindi as Kissa Yoni Ka.

There are many Hindi plays, especially from IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association) like Bakri (directed by M. S. Sathyu), Ek Mamuli Aadmi (directed by Raman Kumar), Ek Aur Dronacharya (S. Dangyach), Sir Sir Sarla, Ek Kadam Aage (Makarand Deshpande), which have been staged to full house.

Actor Om Katare, founder of the Yatri Theatre group (1979) which has staged more than 5,500 shows of his plays, says, “No one can touch the charm of theatre. If only there were more theatre spaces, our plays could have easily given tough competition to other entertainment bodies.”

Veteran theatre, TV and film actor Aanjjan Srivastav says, lack of space and media coverage is the bane of theatre. “If we get more media coverage, popularity of theatre will increase. It will bring in sponsors, moolah and attract more talent”, he adds."
"The Tribune, India news","NEW DELHI: Soon after walking out of a jail in Maharastra on bail after nine years, Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, on Wednesday reported back to an Army unit in Mumbai.

New Delhi, August 23

Soon after walking out of a jail in Maharastra on bail after nine years, Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, on Wednesday reported back to an Army unit in Mumbai.

Army sources here said he reported to the liasoning unit of the Army’s Southern Command in Mumbai and is currently staying at an Army establishment in the city.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

They said Purohit, an officer from intelligence corp, is likely to go to his unit in Pune where he was working before his arrest in the Malegaon blast case in late 2008.

He was released from Taloja jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai earlier today, two days after the Supreme Court granted him bail observing that there were contradictions in the charge sheets filed by different investigating agencies probing the case.

The sources said the Army headquarters will review his suspension from service after examining the court order.

During his stay in his unit, Purohit will be under various restrictions including his movement inside the unit.

The sources said the Army headquarters will study the Supreme Court’s order granting him bail and accordingly a call will be taken on whether to revoke his suspension from service.

Asked about the escort provided to Purohit after he came out of the jail, the sources said he was given the protection considering possible security threat to him.

Purohit, who was posted with a unit under Southern Command and was an officer from intelligence corp, was suspended from service soon after he was arrested in connection with the Malegaon blast case in late 2008.

After the report of the Court of Inquiry (CoI), Purohit’s salary and allowances were restricted to 25 per cent of his total pay but it was increased to 75 per cent following an order by the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), the sources said.

Purohit had approached the AFT after the cut in his salary following report of the CoI.

Six people were killed in the blast on September 29, 2008, at Malegaon, a communally-sensitive textile town in Nasik district of north Maharashtra.

The apex court set aside the April 25 verdict of the Bombay High Court denying bail to Purohit, but imposed certain restrictions while granting him relief. — PTI"
How exactly does yoga benefit mind-body health?,"Washington

From increased strength to flexibility to heart health, benefits of yoga and meditation are countless. However, we still have much to learn about how exactly these practices affect mind-body health. A new research article investigates the effects of yoga and meditation on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the activity on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) effects and inflammatory markers. By studying the participants of an intensive three-month yoga and meditation retreat, the researchers found that the practices positively impacted BDNF signaling, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and immunological markers, and in addition improved subjective wellbeing. In this study, the retreat participants were assessed before and after participating in a 3-month yoga and meditation retreat that involved daily meditation and Isha yoga, accompanied by a vegetarian diet. The yogic practices consisted of physical postures, controlled breathing practices, and seated meditations during which the participants focused on mantra repetition, breath, emptying the mind and bodily sensation. The researchers measured psychometric measures, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), circadian salivary cortisol levels, as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. They also collected data on psychometric variables including mindfulness, absorption, depression and anxiety, and investigated the relationship between psychological improvements and biological changes. The data showed that participation in the retreat was associated with decreases in both self-reported anxiety and depression as well as increases in mindfulness. The research team observed increases in the plasma levels of BDNF, a neuromodulator that plays an important role in learning, memory and the regulation of complex processes such as inflammation, immunity, mood regulation, stress response and metabolism. They also observed increases in the magnitude of the cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is part of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), suggesting improved stress resilience. Moreover, there was a decrease in inflammatory processes caused by an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 and a reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-12 after the retreat. ""It is likely that at least some of the significant improvements in both HPA axis functioning as exemplified by the CAR as well as neuroimmunologic functioning as exemplified by increases in BDNF levels and alterations in cytokines were due to the intensive meditation practice involved in this retreat,"" says corresponding author Dr Baruch Rael Cahn (University of Southern California, USA). The research team hypothesize that the pattern of biological findings observed in their study is linked to enhanced resilience and well being. ""The observed increased BDNF signaling possibly related to enhanced neurogenesis and/or neuroplasticity, increased CAR likely related to enhanced alertness and readiness for mind-body engagement, and increased anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines possibly indicating enhanced immunological readiness,"" explains Dr Cahn. ""An intriguing possible link between the effects on BDNF and the CAR is hippocampal functional integrity, since increased BDNF levels due to physical exercise has previously been shown to relate with hippocampal neurogenesis and likely relate to its positive effects on well-being and depression."" In the light of previous studies of the positive effects of meditation on mental fitness, autonomic homeostasis and inflammatory status, the researchers think that their findings are related to the meditative practices that the retreat participants engaged in. However, they suggest that some of the observed changes may also be related to the physical aspects of the retreat — yoga practice and diet — and that the observed change patterns are a reflection of well being and mind-body integration. The next step will be to conduct further research in order to clarify the extent to which the positive changes on mind-body wellness and stress resilience are related to the yoga and meditation practices respectively, and to account for other possible contextual factors such as social dynamics, diet and the impact of the teacher. ""To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine a broad range of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers in a healthy population before and after a yoga-meditation intervention. Our findings justify further studies of yoga and meditation retreats assessing for the replicability, specificity and long-term implications of these findings,"" concludes Dr Cahn. The findings have been published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience."
Govt shielding anti-social elements: Dhumal,"Tribune News Service

Shimla, August 22

Leader of the Opposition PK Dhumal today said there was an atmosphere of fear, loot and plunder in Himachal with the government completely failing to protect the life, property and rights of the people. Talking to mediapersons after the Vidhan Sabha was adjourned, Dhumal said Dev Bhoomi had been converted into drug bhoomi as the government had failed to take action against anti-social elements. “The rape and murder of the Kotkhai girl remains a mystery as there are too many missing links in the police story. The manner in which pictures of four accused were uploaded on the CM’s facebook account and later removed and then the custodial death of one of the accused in the police custody raises too many doubts about impartial investigation,” he said. He alleged that the murder of forest guard Hoshiyar Singh was being shown as suicide, which reflected the inept handling of the case. “We also wish to know how come the drugs, seized from a transport official, turned out to be lime and if he was falsely framed, then why action has not been taken against the police officials, who tried to falsely implicate him in the case,” he quipped. Dhumal said the imposition of Rs 1.15 crore penalty by the National Green Tribunal only confirmed the allegation that the forest mafia was not just flourishing, but also getting government protection. “There are reports that efforts are on to provide undue benefits to a liquor firm in the garb of reviving sick units. When there is no dearth of people seeking a licence, then why the need for such a policy,” Dhumal said. He also alleged that the government was paying standing charges to trucks at Jamta near Nahan as in the absence of a godown, the trucks had to keep waiting for days to be unloaded. “Now, in a strange development, there are reports that liquor contractors are being asked to make godowns and pay commission to the Beverages Corporation,” he alleged."
The Tribune: Sport news,"LONDON: England’s record goalscorer Wayne Rooney announced on Wednesday he is retiring from international football with immediate effect after manager Gareth Southgate tried to recall him to the squad.

London, August 23

England’s record goalscorer Wayne Rooney announced on Wednesday he is retiring from international football with immediate effect after manager Gareth Southgate tried to recall him to the squad.

The 31-year-old—scorer of 53 goals in 119 appearances for his country—told Southgate of his decision during a phone conversation yesterday.

Southgate had phoned Rooney—who had lost both the captaincy and eventually his place in the squad as he became a peripheral figure under Jose Mourinho at Manchester United last season—to congratulate him on his early season form for new club Everton.

Rooney has looked rejuvenated and happy—scoring in both their Premier League matches so far—since he re-signed for the club that nurtured his talent as a teenager before he left for United.

“It was great that Gareth Southgate called me this week to tell me he wanted me back in the England squad for the upcoming matches. I really appreciated that,” said Rooney in a statement sent to Press Association Sport.

“Having already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football.

“It is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton (Ronald Koeman) and those closest to me.

“Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me.

“But I believe now is the time to bow out.”

Rooney, England’s most capped outfield player ever, said his sole purpose now in football was to ensure Everton won trophies.

He had alluded to what his priority was in his post-match interview on Sky Sports on Monday after he joined Alan Shearer in scoring 200 Premier League goals—made sweeter as it came against Manchester United’s city rivals Manchester City.

“Leaving Manchester United was a tough call but I know I made the right decision in coming home to Everton,” said Rooney.

“Now I want to focus all my energies on helping them be successful.”

Rooney, who another former England great Gary Lineker said earlier today had been unlucky to be the only world-class player in many England sides, had one regret that he had never lifted a trophy with his country.

“One of my very few regrets is not to have been part of a successful England tournament side,” said Rooney, whose four goals in Euro 2004 propelled England to the quarter-finals before their hopes were extinguished when he broke a bone in his foot in the last-eight match with the hosts.

“Hopefully the exciting players Gareth is bringing through can take that ambition further and I hope everyone will get behind the team.

“One day the dream will come true and I look forward to being there as a fan—or in any capacity.” — AFP"
'Dress code': Students hold protest in Jammu for second day,"Jammu, August 23

Students of the Government Women’s College took to the streets for the second day on Wednesday to protest against the “dress code” and alleged “unnecessary diktats” of the management and to demand removal of the principal.

Principal Anita Sudan has dismissed the allegations against her as “wild” and said she has taken several steps like strict adherence to the college uniform and timing on the recommendations of the parents of several students after four women went missing in the recent past, of whom one was traced to Allahabad.

Joined by students of different colleges, including leaders of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students, including male members, were stopped by the policemen at the main gate of the Deputy Commissioner’s office, officials said.

The students carrying placards and banners in support of their demand for resignation of the principal staged a sit-in and later met a senior official.

They submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner highlighting various problems they were allegedly facing at the institute in the name of discipline besides the demand for the removal of the principal.

Later, students dispersed off peacefully after authorities held closed-door meeting with some representatives of the protesting students, the officials said.

Yesterday, Additional District Development Commissioner Arun Manhas said the issues of removal of a peon at the main gate of the college and passing of lewd remarks came up during the discussion between the protesting students, the college management and district administration and police official.

He assured them of a time-bound probe by Sub-divisional police officer, north, Varun Jandiyal after registration of the complaint.

However, the police officer said “the probe has not been set into motion as the students have failed to lodge a complaint.”

“We have not received any written complaint from the students so far. Once the complaint is received, we will start the probe,” Jandiyal told PTI. PTI"
AB de Villiers steps down as South Africa’s ODI captain,"Johannesburg, August 23

The talismanic AB de Villiers on Wednesday stepped down as captain of South Africa’s ODI side but will be available for selection across all formats of the game.

De Villiers has asked Cricket South Africa to relieve him of his duties as Proteas ODI captain.

In a statement released on de Villiers’ behalf by Cricket South Africa, the cricketer denied accusations that he was being selective about matches.

He assured full support to Faf du Plessis, who has largely been acting as captain of the side in his absence.

“A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months, and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,” de Villiers said.

“Over the past year or so, I have tried to manage many commitments. I have felt mentally and physically tired; my wife and I are bringing up two fantastic kids and playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll.

“Together with CSA, we have tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible.”

The 33-year-old’s recent slump in form prompted speculation that he might retire from one format of the game with the 2019 ICC World Cup in focus.

“...This strategy has prompted some people to say I am picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas, and even to suggest I am somehow putting myself before the team. That is simply not true. That has never been true.”

Playing for South Africa is, and will always be, the greatest privilege of my life, he said.

“Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I have informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team.

“It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for someone else to take the ODI side forward.

“Whoever is chosen as the new ODI captain will have my complete support.”

De Villiers said he was feeling “refreshed and revived” after his recent break, but wanted to get back onto the field from October onwards.

“If I am lucky enough to be selected, I can’t guarantee runs and catches. Nobody can do that. But what I can absolutely guarantee is 100 percent commitment to the Proteas in every format of the game, as and when required.

“That was my promise when I made my debut in 2004; and that is my promise today,” he added. — PTI"
No guarantee of residence for migrants fleeing US for Canada,"Montreal, August 23

Men and women with furrowed brows sat in pews alongside their children at a Montreal church as volunteers explained what to expect now that they have crossed into Canada from the United States seeking asylum.

They would receive temporary housing stipends and access to medical care. Their kids could go to school. The volunteers handed out small maple-leaf flags.

""I like Canada very much,"" 26-year-old Marline Dorisma of Haiti said later. ""There are lots of opportunities here."" What they did not get were any assurances that they will be allowed to stay. In fact, many will eventually be told to go back home.

The migrants are part of a recent surge of people crossing over from the United States, including some 4,000 in just the last two weeks, that is straining Canada's immigration system to the point where officials turned a domed stadium into a makeshift shelter.

Many said they left fearing deportation due to increased immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump and believing Canada would automatically give them residence, only to experience a rude awakening upon arrival.

It's a widely held misbelief that Transport Minister Marc Garneau sought to dispel during a recent visit to the international border near Quebec, where migrants have been crossing over from northern New York.

""Unless you are being persecuted or fleeing terror or war, you would not qualify as a refugee,"" Garneau said, ""and it's important to combat that misinformation that is out there.""

Like in the United States, rules in Canada allow for asylum for people who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland based on race, religion, political opinion, nationality or membership in a group like the LBGT community.

People can also be accepted if Canada fears they face torture or cruel or unusual punishment if they are deported.

But those deemed to be economic migrants are given orders of deportation through a process that can range from several months to many years.

Last year, Canada granted asylum to 63 per cent of applicants, for a total of nearly 16,000, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

For Haitians it was 52 per cent, said Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the representative in Canada for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That was similar to the acceptance rate for Haitians in the United States, about 48 per cent.

Officials, immigration lawyers and other experts say the false belief that Canada will accept all migrants is particularly common among Haitians.

""If these people were aware of the criteria that need to be met in order to be granted refugee status in Canada, and of the likelihood of being turned down and deported from Canada back to Haiti, it's possible many of them would probably have decided not to have left the United States,"" lawyer Stephane Handfield said.

Authorities say more than 80 per cent of the 4,000 who crossed into Quebec recently are from Haiti. The rest include people from India, Mexico, Colombia and Turkey, according to the provincial ministry of immigration.

The Trump administration is considering ending a program that granted temporary residency to about 58,000 people from Haiti following the Caribbean nation's devastating 2010 earthquake. Canada ended a similar program in 2014.

""We're being threatened so we have to leave the country, because we're illegal,"" said Dorisma. ""I was told that Canada isn't a country that deports people.""

At Montreal's Olympic Stadium, recent arrivals are sleeping on some 900 cots in a concourse near a rear entrance.

Officials say the shelter is operating at 70 to 90 per cent capacity at any given time and will be open until next month.

Migrants said they have been encouraged by the reception they have received so far in Canada, where there have been only minor anti-immigration demonstrations.

Inancieu Merilien, one of hundreds of Haitians at the arena, said he and others were ""being taken care of very well"" and ""being here is like a dream come true.""

In January, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted in response to a US ban on travelers from some Muslim-majority nations: ""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength.""

But the reality is many will be in an uncomfortable limbo while awaiting a decision on their status. Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council of Refugees, said the lingering threat of deportation will make it difficult to build new lives and get good jobs.

""They can't invest in integrating because they don't know what the future holds,"" Dench said. ""So it's an extremely stressful situation.""

Also, despite the access to taxpayer-funded medical care and education, the housing assistance doesn't go far. Those subsidies range between about USD 560 per month for a single adult to USD 1,900 for a family of four, meaning multiple migrant families often must squeeze in under the same roof.

Joseph Jr Clormeus, a pastor of Haitian descent who has been helping migrants, said many still prefer Canada to what they faced south of the border.

""Most of them are disoriented, weak, and don't know what the future will bring,"" Clormeus said. ""But they prefer the uncertainty of life in Canada (over) the certainty of being deported from the United States."" —AP"
"Global challenges, local solutions","American students travelling through India realise answers to climate change could well be within us

Neha Kirpal

Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.” These oft-repeated lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner hold true in these times more than they ever did. Water is scarce, and not just in the third world. Its repercussions are being experienced across the globe. This is what a group of 25 young high school students — 20 from the US and five from rural and tribal communities in India — found out while travelling through Delhi, Agra and Ladakh in a unique ‘learning through travel’ programme recently. The programme, spread out over three weeks in July, aimed to make potential future leaders socially, culturally and responsibly global citizens. Leadership collective 360Plus, theatre group Junoon and travel services provider Voygr brought together the teenagers from more than 15 diverse geographies and demographics. The theme for the year was climate change, its affects and global challenges. This was the first year that Indian students participated along with students from the US. The group first embarked upon heritage walks around old Delhi. During the old Delhi tour, they were taken to the fascinating Ugrasen ki Baoli. A step well that is used to hold water for villagers, the baoli has been around for about six centuries. Fascinated by the structure, Daviontea Bass, a student from Chicago, did a little research for herself and shared it with us. “Baolis were made around the country in hotter places because people needed a cool place to chill, swim, sleep and eat,” she observed and was surprised that they were still functioning. There were the usual tourist spots too, but not without that twist of education. Take the trip to Taj Mahal, for instance. Farhan Mashud, a student from New York, was fascinated to discover the importance of water in building and maintaining the structure of the historic monument. “It was interesting to know that the monument was built on wells that contained water and were filled with wood. This is said to have increased the life of the wooden foundation,” he said. Two artist facilitators travelled throughout with the students and took them through art processes and workshops that stimulate enquiry, reflection, exploration, perspective and expression. Sanjna Kapoor, co-founder Junoon, said, “To get a chance to work with this group of youngsters and artists together to explore the implications of climate change in our lives is a beautiful way of creating learning opportunities.” While they had heard about how climate change is directly affecting Ladakh in a session on climate change with environmental activist Dr Vandana Shiva, it was only after a visit there that they realised what it meant. Ladakh, with decreasing snowfall, melting glaciers and prolonged summers, is one of the frontiers of the climate change debate. After acclimatising to the altitude, the group got to spend some time at the eco-friendly Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) campus. Located on the banks of Indus river, the mountainous Hemis National Park in the background and a clear night sky, it made for the perfect place to live in the midst of nature. Here, students from the Leadership Collective gave talks, presentations and English conversation classes to local students. The group noticed that the river was swollen by seasonal snowmelt and its chocolate colour was indicative of pollution. However, when the students tested a water sample from the river, it was negative for nitrites, nitrates and had healthy levels of iron and hardness. It was refreshing to see that even though access to water is rapidly changing in the region, the river continues to remain relatively pristine. Through the three-and-half week journey, the group experienced bonding, learning and contemplating together on themes that impact the world. From changing spring sources in rural California, seminars about green economics in San Francisco, the drying of the Agressan ki Baoli in Delhi and the staining of the Taj Mahal in Agra, the students were able to see the connections… and maybe find some answers too."
"Hunt on for a left-arm pacer, says Arun","Pallekele, August 22

For any bowling attack to become lethal in different conditions, variation is a must. That’s the reason why India bowling coach Bharat Arun is looking for a potent left-arm speedster. Since Zaheer Khan’s departure, India have not found a capable left-arm pacer. While the skilful Ashish Nehra stuck to the shorter formats because of his fragile body, the likes of Jaydev Unadkat, Barinder Sran and Aniket Chaudhary didn’t show enough spark. “We will be speaking to the coaches of A team in this regard, we need to share as much information as possible to make best use of the bowlers coming through India A,” said Arun. “We have already got wrist spinners in Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, it will be great for the side if we get at least one good left-arm fast bowler.”Ravichandran Ashwin has played just 15 ODIs since the 2015 World Cup, giving rise to speculations over his future in the 50-over format. Asked if Ashwin was in their scheme of things for the 2019 World Cup, Arun said: “This question should be asked of the selectors. I think he is an extremely talented bowler. Even in the last ODI he played in West Indies, he got 3/28.” “He is very skilful. I don’t want to look at what has happened so far but he is definitely part of the ODI team. We would also like to give a lot of opportunities to other bowlers as well. We can then have a long-term plan, and take a call accordingly,” said Arun. The coach believes the bowling unit has improved tremendously in the last two years. “If you look at the bowling unit as a whole, there has been a tremendous improvement in the last couple of years. But looking at the 2019 World Cup, we will need to have back-up options for every bowler,” he added.

Praise for Pandya

Arun was full of praise for all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who has quickly developed into a reliable pace option for India. “If you look at Hardik, he works up very good speeds and bowls 135-plus consistently. He’s not afraid of trying different things,” the former Tamil Nadu medium-pacer said. — PTI"

Get the maximum out of your diet,"WELLNESS

Mridula Wattas

Our body needs vitamins to function efficiently. They play important roles in metabolism, immunity and digestion. The vitamins, our bodies need, can be broken down into two groups: fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K rely on fats to be digested. A lack of healthy fats in the diet can lead to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins. But if taken in excess these can be harmful to the body as these cannot be excreted easily. Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin B complex and the vitamin C. Excess intake is excreted in the urine. Because our bodies can’t store these vitamins, we need to take them regularly. The important minerals required by our body during different stages of life are calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium. A healthy balanced diet normally provides all these minerals in sufficient amount. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of various vitamins and minerals are far more than the actual requirements of our body. Because while calculating the RDAs, it is assumed that only a small percentage is actually absorbed from the food we eat. So we should make sure that our vitamin and mineral needs are met by making conditions favourable for maximum absorption of these vitamins and minerals by our digestive system. This way we can meet our daily needs by having lesser amount of these nutrients. The absorption can be maximised in the following way

Deworming

Parasitic infestations in the gastro-intestinal tract hinders the absorption of these nutrients. Even adults can have these infestations if they tend to eat out a lot because the food handlers or cooks could be the carriers. Hence, regular deworming is the must

Avoid wrong food combinations

Avoid eating palak and paneer together as the oxalate from palak combines with the calcium from paneer inhibiting calcium absorption from the gut. Do not drink tea or coffee with meals as the tannins present in both the tea and the coffee inhibit the absorption of iron from the food. Do not eat fruits along with the meals. The best time to eat fruits is on an empty stomach in morning, or as a snack between breakfast and lunch. This will ensure that all vitamins and minerals present in the food are fully absorbed. Do not drink water with meals as it dilutes the enzymes in the mouth and digestive tracks leading to in incomplete digestion and absorption of food.

Eating the right combinations

Lemon juice is a good source of vitamin C and should be taken with iron-rich foods such as spinach, quinoa, chia seeds, lentils, oatmeal and soybeans. Sulphur-rich foods like garlic and onion should always be added while cooking mutton, chicken because sulphur helps in the absorption of zinc and iron present in these foods.

Soaking and sprouting

Soaking and sprouting of cereals and pulses increases their vitamin C and B complex content and bioavailability. Eat probiotic and prebiotic foods To keep your gut healthy you need to maintain a healthy micro flora in your gut. Add the following foods in your diet which help to increase the healthy bacteria in your gut. These are prebiotic foods like banana, pineapple, garlic, onion, cucumber and flax seed. Probiotic foods like curd and yoghurt should also be added. Health and wellness is something which we all desire. Most people look for an easy way to attain it. The internet is flooded with information regarding the extra-ordinary role of some vitamins and minerals in achieving health and wellness. While the information may be true but it may not cater to individual needs. Since vitamins and mineral supplements are available over the counter and are considered relatively harmless without any side effects, more and more people fall prey to self medication with these supplements. However, these should always be taken under medical guidance and according to the specific needs of a particular person. The bottom line is that these supplements may be good for you but they do not substitute a balanced diet. Never start any such supplementation without consulting your doctor and in any case eating a healthy balanced diet is of utmost important.

"SC issues show cause notices to BCCI top brass, summons them","New Delhi, August 23

Three top officer bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, including its acting President CK Khanna and acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, were on Wednesday directed by the Supreme Court to appear before it to explain why its order on Justice RM Lodha panel recommendations has not yet been implemented. Besides Khanna and Chaudhary, the apex court also issued show cause notice to BCCI treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhry and asked them to appear personally before it on September 19. A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra expressed its displeasure that the directions given by the apex court and its order on the recommendations of the Lodha panel have not been implemented yet. ""The whole problem is that nothing has been implemented. We will issue show cause notices and direct for personal presence,"" the Bench, also comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, said. The Bench also said it would hear the plea filed by Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB), through its secretary Aditya Kumar Verma, alleging that Amitabh Choudhary had disregarded the court's direction by inviting disqualified cricket administrators to attend the board's meetings. Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that these three office-bearers were responsible for implementing the recommendations of the Lodha panel and the apex court's directions, but have not done that so far. He claimed that BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, who was accompanied by the legal advisor of the Committee of Administrators (COA), was not allowed to attend the July 26 special general body meeting in which the endevour was not to implement any of the recommendations and the directions passed by the top court. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, representing these office bearers, countered the submissions of the amicus saying after the July 26 meeting, they had sent e-mails to everyone concerned that all the recommendations must be complied with. To this, the Bench observed: ""You have expressed your helplessness. Beseeching is not the solution."" The apex-court had appointed Committee of Administrators (COA), through senior advocate Parag Tripathi, said that none of the recommendations of the Lodha panel and directions given by the court have been implemented. ""The only idea is not to implement anything. Justice (retd) Vikramajit Sen (who has been appointed administrator of the Delhi and District Cricket Assocition) had said (in the July 26 meeting) that everything contrary to what Lodha panel has said was being done in the meeting,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the COA to prepare a draft constitution of the BCCI in terms of its earlier judgment and order on the Lodha panel recommendations. ""We think it appropriate that the COA shall prepare a draft constitution in terms of the main judgement as well as the July 24 order of this court,"" it said, while directing that copies of draft constitution be handed over to all the parties before it. During the arguments, Subramanium referred to the fifth status report of the COA and said that as per it, the office bearers have not taken steps to implement the Lodha panel recommendations. In its fifth report, the COA, headed by former CAG Vinod Rai, had sought the removal of BCCI office-bearers — Khanna, Choudhary and Chaudhry. Subramanium said the apex court should give directions so that the recommendations could be implemented. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA), said there were certain issues that required to be dealt with by the court. The Bench, however, said it would deal with these aspects after the COA filed the draft constitution before it. When the counsel representing the BCCI office bearers raked up other issues, including that of the status of membership and selection, the Bench said he could argue all this after the draft constitution is placed before the court. The apex court said that on September 19, it would also consider the issue of two names that are to be chosen to fill up the vacancies that have arisen in the CoA. It said that any other aspect can also be raised by the member associations on the next date, but these must be of ""acceptable sanctity"" and issues should not be raked up only for the sake of raising them. The apex court also said that suggestions, if any, on the draft constitution should be handed over to the amicus as well as to the counsel appearing for COA. Justice Lodha panel had suggested a slew of structural reforms, including one state, one vote, in BCCI that were approved by the apex court."
"The Tribune: Jalandhar City, Jalandhar Cantt news","JALANDHAR: The decision of the Supreme Court (SC) to ban the controversial practice of instant divorce in Islam has been hailed as a victory by a large number of Muslim women in the city.

Jalandhar, August 22

The decision of the Supreme Court (SC) to ban the controversial practice of instant divorce in Islam has been hailed as a victory by a large number of Muslim women in the city.

Sweets were distributed and “Shukrana namaz” was offered by many women groups in various parts of the city to celebrate this much-awaited decision.

Though many Islamic scholars held the judgment to be confusing and said there should be no interference with personal law of Muslims, women expressed their happiness over it.

According to 27-year-old Sahira (name changed), she, along with her five-year-old daughter, was thrown out of her in-laws’ house in a humiliating manner as her husband wanted a son and when she could not give birth to one, he announced triple talaq for her. “I had nowhere to go as my parents had expired long ago. The decision though came late, but will save many women like me in future to be chucked out from the house for no reason,” said an elated Sahira.

Though triple talaq was banned by most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, the tradition had been continuing in India.

Meanwhile, welcoming the decision, Jalandhar-based Islamic scholar SS Hassan said the Supreme Court has endorsed the teachings of the Koran. “Instant triple talaq was never allowed in Koran. It has to be spread over three months, allowing a couple time for reflection and reconciliation. However, some unscrupulous people were using it on their discretion, which was against the Sharia Islamic law,” said Hassan.

Also calling it half battle won, Hassan said the actual victory against this practice would depend on the law that would be enacted soon by the Union government. “Only the implementation will tell as to how successful the decision was to secure the freedom, rights and equality for Muslim women,” said Hassan."
Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple under investigation: report,"Singapore, August 22

One of Singapore’s oldest Hindu temples is under investigation over suspected criminal offences, a media report said on Tuesday. Commercial Affairs Department is conducting the probe into Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, but it is “inappropriate” to comment further on the investigation, police said. The Commissioner of Charities (COC) also said in a statement that it had been notified of the investigation and had also launched its own inquiry into the temple. “The review identified certain areas of concern with regard to governance and administration, which warrant conducting an inquiry,” Channel News Asia reported citing the statement. The COC added that it would decide on the next course of action after the inquiry. In the meantime, religious activities would not be affected and the temple could continue with its operations and daily services, the COC said, adding that measures would be put in place to ensure the temple is properly managed. The temple at Serangoon Road is a well-known landmark in the Little India area, with about 5,000 devotees on Sundays and is popular among tourists. The temple was set up as a trust and obtained charity status in 1988. The temple, founded by Tamil pioneers in 1835, underwent a two-year-long SGD7-million makeover which was completed in 2014. It is one of 15 places of worship that have been listed for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. PTI"

Grant against working capital is taxable,"Grant against working capital is taxable

Q.I had set up a unit in rural area and received a subsidy of Rs 5 lakh under Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme. The details of the subsidy are as under: 1. 35% (Rs 140,000) against building investment of Rs 4 lakh 2. 35% (Rs 4.2 lakh) against machinery investment of Rs 12 lakh 3. 35% (Rs 2.80 lakh) against working capital of Rs 8 lakh What should be the treatment of subsidy in the books of accounts? Please refer to Sec 2(24) xviii also. — Narinderjit Singh A. The subsidy would be covered within the term 'Government Grants' defined by Paragraph 3.1 of Accounting Standard (AS) 12 which deals with Accounting for Government Grants. Paragraph 8 of the said Standard deals with the issue of Grants received for specific fixed assets. Paragraphs 8.1 to 8.5 prescribe two methods for dealing with such Grants. One of the methods prescribed is to deduct such Grants from the gross value of the assets concerned in arriving at its book value. The second method which has been prescribed is to treat such Grants as deferred income and recognise the same in the profit and loss account on a systematic and rationale basis over the useful life of the asset. Such allocation of income is usually made over the periods in proportion to the charge of depreciation on related asset. The amount of Grant which is received for working capital can be classified as compensation for expenses incurred in the accounting period and can therefore be recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss account for the period in which it becomes receivable. I may add that for income-tax purposes, the treatment will have to be in accordance with the Income Computation and Disclosure Standard VII dealing with Government Grants. According to the said Standard, the Government Grants relating to depreciable fixed assets shall be deducted from the actual cost of the asset concerned or from the written down value of the block of assets to which asset concerned or assets belonged to. The Grants against working capital will be treated as income of the period for which it is receivable. Section 2(24) (xviii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (The Act) would not apply to the above case as the subsidy against building and machinery will be deducted from the cost of the related assets and therefore, would be excluded as per the provisions of Explanation 10 to Sub-section (1) of Section 43 of the Act. Further, the subsidy has not been given for the purposes of corpus to the institutions specified in the said clause and therefore the above section is not applicable to the grants received in respect of fixed assets. The amount of grant received against working capital should be taxable under Section 28(iv) of the Act. Q. My father bought an agricultural land in 1980 which has come within municipal limit now. He sold his land in March 2017 and bought NHAI bonds too. But still he is left with some money and wants to do some business (not interested in buying agricultural land) and spend some money on home as well as on his two two children. Please advise (a) Whether capital gains tax applicable to him is of 1981 or he can adopt the base year of 2001? (b) Can he gift some money (in case yes, up to what amount) to his unmarried daughter or her wife or his son (me)? (c) Can he also sell some of his ancestral land and what will be the base year for that land? —amar teja A. a) The agricultural land having been sold in March 2017, your father has an option to adopt fair market value as on 1.4.81. The amendment with regard to change in base year is applicable for assessment year 2018-19 which would cover the period from April 2017 to March 2018 and onwards. b) Your father can gift any amount to his children. There is no taxability with regard to the amount so gifted either in the hands of a donor or in the hands of a donee. However, any gift to his wife would not involve any tax, but any income earned on such gifted amount would be clubbed with the income of your father. c) In case your father sells his ancestral land after March 2017, the applicable date for adoption of fair market value would be 1.4.2001. Q.Our father was allotted a house (91-E, Hussainpura (West), Gali No.2, Amritsar) in lieu of the property left in Pakistan, after migration. He died on 28.07.1979. We are two brothers, a widow of the third brother and four sisters. But none of us has sales deed exhibiting the occupant of this house. However, the following documents give support to our contention of our late father being the owner of the house under discussion: 1. Death certificate of our father (27.8.1979) 2. Property tax of the house showing occupant being my father. 3. Antkal certificate of neighbour in House No. 91-F showing location of our House No. 91-E/13 in the East. 4. Electricity bill payment depicting the name of my deceased father. 5. A letter obtained under RTI from the Public Information Officer-cum- Deputy Director Land Record, Punjab, Jalandhar, pressing the inability of the office to trace the sales deed of the house. These documents are with me and a photocopy can be sent, if advised. — Dr inder Mohan Talwar A. I have gone through the contents of your query. You have stated that your father was allotted a house in lieu of the property he left in Pakistan. It seems this is a case of allotment of an evacuee property which had been left behind by the persons who migrated from Pakistan. The allotment having been made by the Government of India, there should be an allotment letter prescribing the details on the basis of which your father was allotted the property at Amritsar. In case you do not have the original letter, a copy thereof should be obtained from the department concerned. There may not be any sale/ conveyance deed in such cases."
Contact sports may alter brains of athletes,"Toronto

People who play contact sports such as football and hockey — that have higher risk of body collisions — are more likely show changes in their brain structure and function, a study has found.

Researchers at St Michael's Hospital in Canada performed preseason brain scans of 65 varsity athletes — 23 from collision sports (with routine, purposeful body-to-body contact), 22 from contact sports (where contact is allowed, but is not an integral part of the game) and 20 from non-contact sports.

They found that the athletes in collision and contact sports had differences in brain structure, function and chemical markers typically associated with brain injury, compared to athletes in non-contact sports.

There is a growing concern about how participation in contact sports may affect the brain, said lead author Nathan Churchill, a post-doctoral fellow in St Michael's Neuroscience Research Programme.

Most of the research in this area has focused on the long-term effects for athletes in collision sports, such as football and ice hockey, where players may be exposed to hundreds of impacts in a single season.

Less is known about the consequences of participating in contact sports where body-to-body contact is permitted, but is not purposeful, such as football, basketball and field hockey.

This study looked at both men and women from a variety of sports, and found progressive differences between the brains of athletes in non-contact, contact and collision sports.

This included differences in the structure of the brain's white matter — the fibre tracts that connect different parts of the brain and allow them to communicate with one another.

Athletes in sports with higher levels of contact also showed signs of reduced communication between brain areas and decreased activity, particularly within areas involved in vision and motor function, compared to those in non-contact sports, such as volleyball.

However, these differences do not reflect significantly impaired day-to-day functioning, said Tom Schweizer, head of the Neuroscience Research Programme.

The study fills an important gap in understanding how contact affects healthy brains, as a step toward better understanding why a small number of athletes in contact sports show negative long-term health consequences.

The findings were published in the journal Frontiers of Neurology. PTI"
The Doctrine of,"LAHORE, THURSDAY, AUGUST 23, 1917

COMMENTING on the frequent attack made by certain Anglo-Indian critics on the educated classes of India who are vilified as not caring a bit for the great illiterate and voiceless masses, the New Times, Karachi, says that there is a sudden manifestation of Ati Bhakti or excessive devotion to the Indian masses exhibited by these critics. And yet it is the maligned educated Indian who invariably fights for the masses in the Councils and on platform when he pleads for a permanent or long-term settlement of land of taxes, for compulsory free education, for industrial expansion and equal opportunities to all. What have the Ati Bhaktas done in the same line? Another Anglo-Indian writer says that as the Indian masses are illiterate, no democratic rule can be established in India, though he admits that illiterate leaders in villages have formed very efficient Punchayats and deserve local powers."

Security concerns

Security agencies have expressed concern as mobs had attacked Haal (Pulwama), Nutnusa (Kupwara) and Vessu (Anantnag) camps during the unrest in 2016

This forced 2,000 employees, posted in different districts of the Valley, to shift back to Jammu

The government is awaiting the completion of 400 multi-storey flats at Vessu (Anantnag) and 96 units at Sheikhpora (Budgam)

The state government has decided to shut the transit camps for displaced Kashmiri Pandit employees in the Valley in phases after concerns were expressed by security agencies over their vulnerability to mob attacks. During the 2016 unrest, these temporary camps at Haal (Pulwama), Nutnusa (Kupwara) and Vessu (Anantnag) had come under intense attacks of mobs following the killing of Hizb militant commander Burhan Wani. This forced 2,000 employees, posted in different districts of the Valley, to shift back to Jammu. A majority of the Pandit youth who had returned to the Valley under the Prime Minister’s employment package in 2010 had been housed in the transit camps that were constructed in 2004-05 when late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was heading the PDP-Congress government. Sources said the government was waiting for the completion of 400 multi-storey flats at Vessu (Anantnag) and 96 units at Sheikhpora (Budgam) so that employees could be provided secure housing units. The Haal transit camp is also likely to be shifted as it has become unsuitable for living due to the damage caused by mobs. Sheikhpora already has flats which house Pandits and the new units will create more space for employees belonging to the minority community. “The Pandit employees will have to rejoin because there will be no compromise on this condition but some of them have genuine issues of accommodation and security consideration which will be taken care of. The construction of flats at Vessu and Sheikhpora will be completed by the year-end and employees will be shifted,” said a senior administrative official. The sources said Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had been sympathetic towards the woman teaching staff posted in educational institutions in the militancy-infested areas in the volatile south Kashmir. Officials said 723-kanal land had been identified to build housing units at places excluding Vessu and Sheikhpora. The Centre had sanctioned Rs 1,618.40 crore in 2008-2009 for it but the work was stalled due to the prevailing security conditions. “Their issue is being discussed at the highest level in the government and their problems will be sorted out. In fact, after our assurances, some of the employees, who were not willing to return, began resuming their duties,” said ML Raina, Relief Commissioner (M). However, taking up their safety, All Party Migrant Coordination Committee chairman Vinod Pandit said, “It is not that the displaced Pandits don’t want to return but the problem is of housing and education of children. Due to the prevailing situation who will guarantee their safety? They returned voluntarily to resettle but have faced worst situation. These issues need to be sorted out.”"

Action would be taken against those who try to disturb law and order in the state, he said. He said security forces had been pressed into service in border areas and the Centre had already been requested for 115 companies of paramilitary forces. Anti-social elements or any other person who would try to disturb law and order would be arrested, he added. He said leave of police personnel had been cancelled and Home Guards were being called on duty. “We have adequate police force. Police nakas are being laid where all vehicles will be checked. All borders of the state have been sealed and inter-state and inter-district activities of vehicles are being closely monitored,” he added. “Duty Magistrates have been deployed at all locations. There is need to deploy more duty magistrates in some districts, sanction for which is being released. Arrangement of cranes, ambulances, and fire brigades has been made at different locations. The officers concerned have been directed to take necessary steps to deal with any kind of situation,” he said.The district police today took out a flag march in the city. Police teams started the march from the Police Lines on the Pipli road and crossed through various parts of the city. The security drill was part of the preparedness exercise in view of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim’s appearance before a CBI court in Panchkula in a rape case on August 25. Dera followers have started gathering in support of their chief at various places in different districts. Ambala Range ADGP RC Mishra held a meeting with police and civil officials here today. Mishra directed the officials to monitor social media to check rumour mongering or provocative messaging. “Though the police are fully equipped, central security forces will be there for additional assistance in maintaining law and order in the region,” said Mishra.The district police and paramilitary personnel took out a flag march in Kaithal and Kalayat towns.

Assembly bypoll: 45% turnout in Delhi; 80% in Andhra Pradesh,"New Delhi, August 23

Polling for the Bawana assembly bypoll in Delhi ended peacefully on Wednesday with a total voter turnout of 45 per cent, much lower than in the 2015 elections in the constituency, where AAP, BJP and Congress are locked in a triangular contest.

“The entire polling process went on peacefully and no untoward incident was reported from any part of the constituency in north-west Delhi,” Chandra Bhushan Kumar, Chief Electoral Officer, Delhi said.

The polling officials said an EVM and 17 VVPAT machines malfunctioned and were replaced without any hindrance to voting.

“One EVM malfunctioned during the polling. 17 VVPATs also showed errors. All malfunctioning machines were replaced,” they said.

The voting percentage today was much lower than in the 2015 Assembly election in the constituency in which 61.83 per cent voting percentage was registered.

The officials conjectured that multiple elections taking place in the city in quick succession could be a factor for the low turnout in Bawana, adding that voter turnout was “generally low” in bypolls.

Eight candidates are in the fray for the bypoll. The counting of votes will take place on August 28.

BJP has fielded Ved Prakash who had won from the constituency in the 2015 elections as an AAP candidate. He had resigned from assembly membership and joined the BJP in March this year.

The AAP has fielded Ram Chandra, while Congress has put its bet on former three-time MLA from Bawana, Surendra Kumar.

Meanwhile, a high voter turnout of about 80 per cent was recorded in the by-election to Nandyal Assembly constituency in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, where the ruling TDP and opposition YSR Congress (YSRC) are locked in a fierce battle.

Heavy turnout of voters was witnessed in Nandyal rural and Gospadu mandals in the segment with women outnumbering men, sources said.

In Nandyal town, about 70 per cent polling was reported.

Barring a face-off between supporters of the TDP and YSRC at a couple of places, the by-election passed off peacefully, a senior police official said.

The counting of votes will be taken up on August 28.

The Nandyal result will be widely seen as a trend setter for the general and assembly elections in the state in 2019 and may also alter the political equations.

For the first time, Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) was used in the by-election.

VVPAT is a machine which dispenses a slip with the symbol of the party for which a person has voted for. The slip drops in a box but the voter cannot take it home.

The by-election was held following the death of sitting MLA Bhuma Nagi Reddy in March. Reddy had won the seat in 2014 as YSR Congress candidate, but jumped over to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 2016.

Reddy’s nephew Brahmananda Reddy is now the TDP candidate, while the YSRC fielded former minister Silpa Chandra Mohan Reddy who switched sides to the opposition party just days ahead of the bypoll.

Though there are 15 candidates in the fray, the main fight is between the TDP and the YSRC. — PTI"

Q. I am in BBA second year at present. I am very keen to pursue a PG degree in International Relations (MA in International Relations). Is it necessary to have subjects like history and political science in graduation to get admission in the MA course in IR? Should I switch to bachelor's in these subjects or in mass communication to be eligible for the master's course or continue with BBA? I am ready to lose one year of my BBA degree for this purpose. Which are the top colleges /universities for Masters degree in International Relations in India and what will be the job prospects for me post this degree?— priyanka khanna A.International Relations is a field of study that combines political science with the intricacies of globalisation, terrorism, ecological sustainability and global finance. Which means that besides political history your programme in IR will be a dynamic mix of political history, economics, foreign policy, anthropology and sociology with a major focus on nations, states and governments. Although International Relations forms part of the Master’s in Political Science programmes offered at a large number of universities, a relatively fewer number of universities offer a specific Master’s in IR: Selection to most of the reputed university departments is done on the basis of an entrance test. As long as you can tackle that, you should be fine. If you’re already in the second year, there’s no need to drop a year. Just get hold of the previous year’s papers and start reading up on the subject. As for career prospects, many top foreign correspondents and political journalists, diplomats, teachers, area study experts, researchers and analysts in MNCs hold a degree in this subject. And as the world becomes smaller and more interconnected place, the field of IR has increased in scope and gained greater significance. As a consequence, those aspiring to work in the areas of Peace & Conflict Resolution, Area Studies, International Justice, International Economic Development, Humanitarian Relief, Human Rights Advocacy, Political and Economic Risk Analysis would also find it useful. Some of the better places to pursue your masters in IR would include:Course: MA in Politics (specialisation in International Studies). , MA Economics (with specialisation on World Economy) Selection process is very competitive: 2000+ students compete for the 50-odd seatsCourse: Master’s programme in International Relations (2-yr)Course: Master’s in Political Science (with International Relations / English Literature)Course: Master’s in International Relations"
Green is their kind,"As the pitfalls of global warming and jungles of concrete swarm our planet, some unknown, unsung heroes are quietly working to make our environment and world a little better

Eesha Duggal

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
A canvas for fashion,"Installations and scenography are the new buzzwords at fashion shows across the country

Swati Rai

if 29 Rooms, the installation at last year’s New York Fashion Week in Bushwick, is anything to go by, it can safely be presumed that art in high fashion is a globally rising trend. Designed to inspire creativity and, of course, Instagram posts, the 80,000 square foot warehouse saw installations by artists as well as fashion designers, amongst them the likes of Michael Kors. Kors’ concept titled The Sidewalk is Your Runway, had people posing with his famed bags and posting the captures on social media. Fashion and its interpretation have changed over the years. This change reflects itself not just in the colour and texture, but also in the way fashion is presented to people today. Artistic installations and scenography for a fashionably ambient presentation are an off shoot of that. Bold designing steps see couturiers seeking artistic outlet to jazz up the ramp and, in turn, create an immersive experience for the onlooker. While we have had the trend impressing the fashion scene abroad, it is catching up in India too, be it at the last two India Couture Weeks or Lakme Fashion Week. Designers have been successful in creating scenes and vignettes both on and off the ramps. Recently, seven fashion icons — Sabyasachi Mukherji, JJ Valaya, Tarun Tahiliani, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Shantanu & Nikhil, Abraham & Thakore and Narendra Kumar Ahmed — were invited by Godrej India Culture Lab to reflect on the Partition of India through their designs. These were presented in a fashion-meets-art installation at the Lakme Fashion Week and would be permanently housed at The Partition Museum in Amritsar. At the recent ICW, designer Anamika Khanna, in her show entitled Happily Ever After, chose to have a multi-dimensional mannequin theme reflecting various stages in a marital journey — from betrothal to the nuptials. Wide-eyed stationary models brought alive the theme with scenes created to match the outfit and the occasion. An installation is also about a designer’s mind. Also at ICW, Gaurav Gupta brought to the ramp a bit of the fantasy world he inhabits. An esoteric world found itself taking shape and offering the audience a quick mood elevation. The ramp became a barren yet rich moonscape with huge glass blowouts radiating in a purple haze as the show opened. It felt as if one was suspended in the bubble for a moment. In his own words: “I added a new dimension to a mythological forest by creating a floating space in between. It sort of mirrored the fantasy space in my head, which I inhabit most of the time. There was foliage in glass on the 10 installations, measuring between 7 and 10 feet, which we created.” A more traditional take was Manav Gangwani’s latest couture collection, India@70. It showcased the god and goddesses of India and meenakari on Patolas and Paithani to reflect different cultural imprints of the country. Big and bold Kathakali masks worn by models accentuated the show. A model perched on the grand staircase of a hotel foyer reflected the Prime Minister’s Make in India campaign, showcasing an intricately designed silhouette of a lion. Sharing his design landscape, Gangwani says, “The fashion industry has evolved over the past few years. We now have so much inspiration around us in India. Monumental structures, cultural diversity and geographical differences have helped me curate this collection… I have taken inspiration from every region of India to create this collection and to give the audience this experience.” FDCI president Sunil Sethi isn’t surprised by the increasing room for art in fashion. “Deep down, all designers think of themselves as artists and this creative force comes out in their collections — be it in the set design or as an installation fashion show.” Still, he feels art is just an embellishment for a fashion show. Designs have to be the real powerhouse. “I feel that the philosophy or the thought process of a designer will remain hidden if the clothes in his/her collection fail to do so. It’s the clothes and not the art work that is important.” While crediting digital technology and advanced projection techniques for the innovation on ramp, he hints at the limited scope of the trend too. “Such scenography has more scope and visibility in couture and not so much in pret,” Sethi says."
Beyond fake dreams,"Hasan Suroor

The masses in both India, Pak need to wake up and smell the coffee

Hasan Suroor

NOW that we are done with the speeches and street parties, it might help if political leaders in India and Pakistan took a break from hyperbolic claims and nationalistic rhetoric and, instead, had a grownup debate about the state of their countries — and where they are headed. Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech, promised to turn India into a land of milk and honey by 2022 : “The poor shall have concrete houses, the farmer shall double his income, youths and women will get ample opportunities, an India (will be) free of casteism, terrorism, corruption”. Over in Pakistan, its president pledged to deliver “a true Islamic welfare state as envisioned by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah”. All this is la-la land stuff. An insult to the intelligence of their voters. It’s only on the subcontinent that responsible leaders can get away with this sort of guff; thrive on it. People have been sold porkies for 70 long years; it’s time to level with them and get real. And the reality is that both India and Pakistan are in a bad place — Pakistan, of course, is in a much deeper hole made worse by rampant terror, a monster it itself created to harass others and then lost control over it. But India, for all its robust democracy and economy, is also haunted by its own demons which like Pakistan’s were minted and nurtured at home. The country is being torn apart by culture wars unleashed by right-wing Hindu nationalists giving succour to the Muslim right, much to the frustration of moderate Muslims caught up between Hindu and Muslim fanatics. The vast majority of neither Indians nor Pakistanis has much to celebrate 70 years after Independence. Talat Masood, a prominent retired Pakistani army general, told the BBC that Jinnah “must be turning in his grave” how his vision of a secular and democratic Pakistan has been corrupted and turned into a fundamentalist theocracy. So, would be Gandhi over attempts to appropriate his legacy by the same people who are trying to subvert it. Freedom fighters who are still alive and those whose ancestors made personal sacrifices in the struggle for India’s freedom are horrified by the prevailing climate of hate, and the way Gandhi’s idea of a multicultural and tolerant India is being sought to be systematically destroyed in the name of Hindu cultural nationalism, a twisted form of Hinduism much like the distorted version of Islam in Pakistan. And the world is watching. The BBC coverage of PM’s Red Fort speech was heavily laced with references to murders of Muslims by cow vigilantes. “Cow vigilantes have been increasingly active since Modi took over...there have been a series murders of Muslims by Hindus,” reported its correspondent Justin Rowlatt. “Seventy years after Independence communal tensions are still alive.” The programme carried an interview with one cow vigilante Vijay Chauhan brandishing a pistol and threatening to “kill anyone” he suspected of killing or even transporting cows for sale. Not exactly a pleasing image of the “new India” the PM said he was building. Social media sites are buzzing with disillusioned voices. One well-known journalist wrote on Facebook: “My late father sacrificed his youth to work towards our freedom. He lost his health…and was subsequently jailed for long years. All these years of running around many times with little or no food left his body very weak...He died when he was barely 56 years of age. I wonder what he would have thought of today’s rulers and what their role was in the freedom movement.” In a new book by Russian Nobel Laureate Svetlana Alexievich about what the Russians think of the new post-Soviet Russia many say it has changed so much — mostly for the worse — that they don’t “recognise” it anymore. “This country is foreign to me. It’s foreign! Nothing is sacred anymore,” says a former army officer. For many of us, this could well be the description of the new post-liberal, Congress-mukt, Muslim-mukt, dissent-mukt nationalist India with its coarsening political discourse, frightened media, deteriorating community relations, and fraying institutions. It’s a still a work in progress, and given the breakneck pace at which it’s being rushed through, by the time they’re done with it, the country might have become so unrecognisable that it could need a brand-new entry in the Lonely Planet guides. Come the 80th Independence anniversary, and India would have become a truly foreign country for many of midnight’s children. With Hindu-Muslim segregation growing at an alarming rate, large areas across the country have already become no-go zones with Muslims not permitted in Hindu neighbourhoods and Hindus in Muslim ghettos. Those who lived through Partition speak ominously of eerie parallels between the current climate and the climate of fear and hate that prevailed on the eve of the historic split. “I fear an even greater upheaval than we witnessed in 1947,” warns one retired Hindu academic. Political scientist Neera Chandhoke, who has done a lot of work on segregation in Gujarat, fears another division. “In 1947, India was partitioned into two countries. In the 21st century, Indian society seems to be fated to undergo another sort of partition, spatial segregation born out of fear,” she wrote in The Hindu. Pakistan has already had a second dismemberment thanks to the supremacists in West Pakistan; Hindutva supremacists should tread cautiously and be very careful for what they wish for. In seeking to marginalise 189 million fellow citizens they are gambling with the very security and unity of India. Pakistan learnt this to its cost when it sought to marginalise its Bengali citizens. Not that it appears to have drawn any lessons from it as its politicians continue to trade in hate. While politicians in the two countries are engaged in competitive nationalism, the two feeding off each other, the pressing bread-and-butter issues seem to be nobody’s priority. It’s revealing that both India and Pakistan are at the bottom of the heap on most social indicators. Shamefully, more people in India live in poverty than in all of sub-Saharan Africa, according to a UN study, and in Pakistan 40 per cent of its population lives under the poverty line, official figures show. Ultimately, inclusion and tolerance are the best guarantee of security and progress. Modi coined a catchy slogan, “Sab ka saath, sab ka vikas”, but has done little to make it work. It’s time to put some meat on the bone if he’s serious about realising even a fraction of his 2022 vision of a new India."

Of the four critically injured in the accident, two have been referred to Etawah and another two to Saifai, Kumar said.

The accident has disrupted traffic on both ‘up’ and ‘down’ lines of the busy Delhi-Howrah route. Dozens of trains have been re-routed, including Rajdhanis coming from Bhubaneswar and Ranchi. Many trains, including the Gomti Express, have been cancelled. The accident that occurred at 2.40 am near Railway Gate Number 14 in Achhalda between Kanpur and Etawah railway station shook people out of sleep. This comes under North-Central Railways headquartered at Allahabad.

According to Home Secretary Anand Swaroop, an NDRF team has been rushed from Lucknow for rescue and relief operations.

A spokesman for NCR said rescue operations have been concluded and all injured were sent to hospitals nearby.

Additional forces and ambulance were rushed to the spot from Auraiya, Etawah and Kannauj while NDRF team was dispatched from Lucknow to provide succour to the passengers.

The Principal Secretary, Home, said the rescue work had been completed and all passengers moved to Achhalda railway station. A rescue train is arriving to take them to their destination of Delhi, he said.

Some of the injured were discharged from hospitals after first aid, the SP said, adding that there is no report of any casualty so far.

While an inquiry is yet to be ordered, a dumper loaded with ‘gitti’ suddenly appeared on the track, causing the accident. The loco pilot also received injuries.

The accident comes barely three days after the ghastly Utkal Express accident in Muzaffarnagar that killed 22 and injured 203.

Action was immediately taken in that incident and four engineers were suspended and the Northern Railways Chief Track Engineer; DRM Delhi; GM, Northern Railways; and Member (Engineering) Railway Board were sent on leave."
Bank strike hits transactions,"Tribune News Service

Mumbai/Chandigarh, Aug 22

A one-day strike by employees of nationalised banks who were opposing the government’s move to consolidate the financial institutions paralysed banking operations across the country. According to the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), the strike was total with all employees of public sector banks participating in the strike. The association said many banks did not open for the day and operations such as deposits and withdrawal of funds, cheque clearance, NEFT and RTGS operations were affected by the strike. The UFBU is an umbrella body of nine unions, including the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and the National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW). Apart from opposing the government’s moves to merge several nationalised banks in order to reduce the number of banks in the country, the unions also opposed writing off of non-performing assets (NPA) of corporate loans. The unions are demanding that the government should initiate criminal proceedings against corporate houses which have defaulted on bank loans instead of writing off part of the loans granted to them. According to the UFBU, 10 lakh bank employees from 21 public sector banks participated in the strike. In addition, 18 old generation banks, eight foreign banks and 56 regional rural banks in Mumbai and Maharashtra participated in the strike, All Indian Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) leader Vishwas Utagi said. Meanwhile, over 2,000 employees/officers participated in today’s rally held at the Bank Square, Sector 17, Chandigarh. Sanjeev Bandlish, convener, United Forum of Bank Unions, and general secretary, National Confederation of Bank Employees, criticised the attitude of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the government for their lacklustre attitude towards the genuine demands of the bank employees."
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
Indian-origin Malaysian man jailed for life in Singapore,"Singapore, August 23

A 30-year-old Indian-origin Malaysian man has been jailed for life in Singapore along with 24 strokes of cane-lashing for smuggling drugs.

Saravanan Chandaram, 30, who pleaded guilty to two charges of importing the controlled drugs, also received the maximum 24 strokes of the cane, the Straits Times reported.

The prosecution submitted a certificate to the court stating that Saravanan was only a drug courier and had substantively helped the authorities to disrupt drug trafficking.

This gave the judge the discretion to impose a life sentence instead of the mandatory death penalty.

Saravanan was found with 10 bundles containing at least 1.38 kilogrammes of cannabis, and at least 3.29 kilogrammes of cannabinol and cannabinol derivative.

On November 5, 2014, he rented a car and met a drug syndicate leader, known only as Aya, in Skudai in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, where he collected the 10 bundles of drugs.

Saravanan, who worked for Aya as his bodyguard and personal driver, hid the bundles under the armrest of the rear passenger seat.

Defence lawyer Singa Retnam, in his closing submissions to the court last month, said that Saravanan had borrowed Malaysian Ringgit 4,000 (Singapore dollars 1,270) from Aya as he did not have enough savings for his son's operation.

When Saravanan returned to Johor on November 5, 2014, he was asked by Aya to repay the money, but he could not do so immediately, the Strait Times report said.

He had no choice but to adhere to his boss's demands and agreed to deliver 10 packets of tobacco, for Malaysian Ringgit 2,000, according to the defence's submissions.

The defence said that Saravanan believed he was delivering 10 packets of tobacco, instead of cannabis.

However, the prosecution said that Saravanan's belief was unfounded when there were clearly suspicious circumstances surrounding the delivery of the drugs.

There were also inconsistencies in his account as he had initially said he was promised Singapore dollars 5,000 for the delivery, but later claimed he was promised Malaysian Ringgit 2,000.

The prosecution noted that Saravanan was being paid a disproportionately high amount of Singapore dollars 5,000 for a relatively simple task of delivery. —PTI"

A travel back in time,"Shailesh BR’s most recent work, Tarka, looks like an interpretation of childhood memories

Monica Arora

Shailesh BR’s work is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected that you may have seen amongst contemporary artists in the recent times, and that is what makes it all the more engaging and awe inspiring. He draws inspiration from several concepts in Sanskrit, a language he studied and mastered for some 14 years during his early childhood. His creations reflect the rural upbringing and simplicity of life as in his village, where even an electric bulb was regarded as a huge miracle. In an interview during a Khoj workshop in 2015, Shailesh had articulated, “I do not know how to work, but I sure can create for my own and from my own.”A post-graduate from Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU, Baroda, the artist uses the ordinariness of mundane objects to turn their notion or existence around. He recently put up his first solo show at the Vadhera Art Gallery in New Delhi as part of Foundation for Contemporary Indian Art (FICA)’s Emerging Artist Award Programme. This show was known as Tarka, being derived from Tarka Shastra or the art of debating, enquiring and logical reasoning as prescribed in ancient Sanskrit philosophy. Through his myriad creations, he has questioned the origin, life journey and end of several objects and that is what draws onlookers to this unique body of work. Occupying centre piece at the exhibition was the Kshir Dhara, a series of sculptures that explore repeated actions whilst performing religious ceremonies such as the grinding of chandan on a slab or application of tilak on the forehead. These are used as metaphors in sculptures made from material such as wax, motor, sandalwood, honey, motor, water, milk, copper. Created from rubber, motor, iron was The Tongue, a set of kinetic sculptures that represents the various sensory functions and organs of the body that pertain to sensations of touch, taste, smell, sight and so on. Similarly, the Hot Tongue, comprising of plaster, coil and iron mesh, seems to be a satirical statement on the art of glib talking and nonsensical jargon, which is innately ingrained in the political and bureaucratic machinery. The most evocative of all creations was the Philosophy Machine. Essentially a wooden rotating disc fitted with lamps arranged in a circle, it has a gas flame pipe to light the lamps at one end and a blower pipe to extinguish them. This remarkable creation is a representation of the circle of life and is a stunning commentary on the fact that death is inevitable. Philosphy Machine Drawings was a series of 48 drawings. These inhabit little corners at the gallery and are mostly arranged as asymmetrical drawings on vintage, sepia-tinted and yellowing paper that appear as blueprints or pages from a novella or a personal diary or an old school examination. In most, there is no attention paid to any spelling or grammatical errors and reflect a childlike innocence with several drafts, cuts, scratches and random musings. Also, the 46 tongue drawings are an extension of the sculpture and endeavour to decode the tongue as an organ of taste, articulation and hence, as an allegory for human emotions, sensory as well as of the mind faculties. It’s almost as if he had taken tiny bits of childhood memorabilia and when he saw similar objects during adulthood, he re-interpreted those in a completely different manner and re-arranged the conventionality and typicality associated with them."

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour.

[ + read story ]

Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation.

n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health.

n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details.

n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone.

n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you.

n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc.

You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it.

n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour.

n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour.

n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills.

Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

Iceland in a nutshell,"The landscapes, seascapes, lava fields, glacier and hiking trails of Snaefellsnes Peninsula make it worth exploring

Kanika Kalia

There is no doubt that Iceland is one of the most beautiful and traveller-friendly destinations in the world. Its dynamic landscape, mystery of geysers, legends of Vikings and beauty of northern lights has captivated travellers for years now. While most people visiting Iceland straightway shoot to the Golden Circle and south Iceland, the Snaefellsnes peninsula in west Iceland is truly a hidden gem just waiting to be explored. Why Snæfellsnes? Well for starters, it is a true testament to Iceland’s dynamic nature. It has almost everything that Iceland has to offer: breathtaking landscapes, alluring seascapes, lava fields, glacier, abandoned farms, and great hiking trails. No surprise that it’s often called ‘Iceland in a nutshell’. It makes for a great destination for a day trip (and even multiple if you have time). This is a much-less visited corner of Iceland compared to the typical touristy areas of the South Coast, and that being said, you will have some areas exclusive to yourself. Now, of course, in winters trying to explore this whole area in a day is literally like racing against the time. But if you have made up your mind and set off for a day of exploring, these tips will help you in planning.

Rent a car at the airport in Keflavík. This is the most convenient way of exploring the area. Though there are some tour companies that offer day trips to Snaefellsnes Peninsula , it will be best to drive it by yourself and do it at your own pace.

Depending on the number of days you intend to spend, base yourself out of Reykjavik.

According to google maps, the entire loop starting and ending at Reykjavik is almost about 500 km and takes six hours if you drive non-stop. But since there are so many scenic viewpoints and you are bound to make frequent stops, it will easily take 10-12 hours to explore the peninsular region.

For all you winter explorers, start your day early so that you may cover maximum in daylight.

There are not many restaurants in this area, so do not forget to pack lunch.

Fill your gas tank as and when you see a gas station. In winters, not all gas stations are open and you may not find one for hours.

Make sure you keep an eye on the weather and road conditions.

If you take the route via Hvalfjordur bay, you will have to pay the toll 100ISK. You can pay by card or in cash.

Things to see:

You can drive through Snaefellsnes Peninsula starting from Reykjavik in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, provided you reach the Kirkjufell mountain before sunset to enjoy a gem of the view. For this sole reason, it is recommended to drive anti-clockwise in winters. But Kirkjufell is not the only thing to see in this area. Here is list of stoppages you can make in your journey.

Mt. Helgafell: An easy 15-20 minute hike up Mt. Helgafell will reward you with a beautiful view. Legend says if you hike up Mt Helgafell keeping mum and not looking back, your three wishes come true. Definitely worth a try.

Eldborg volcanic caldera: A dirt road from the highway will take you to the closest parking spot near the crater. From there, it is about 15 to 20 minutes hike up.

Gerðuberg Basalt Columns: The beautiful hill gives an illusion of being on the sets of Game of Thrones. These basalt columns are nature’s masterpiece and give an illusion of castle’s fortification.

Bjarnarhöfn Shark Museum: This museum is not like any ordinary museum at all. What makes it unique? Well coupled with randomness and shabby appearance, this place will tell you about an intriguing Icelandic snack, fermented shark, called hákarl. Of course, you can’t leave the place without trying this peculiar delicacy.

Berserkjahraun (Lava field): While driving on Route 54, you will see lava field on both sides of the road. The landscape is breathtaking. To enjoy the beauty of these lava fields, you have two options. You can park your car somewhere near Berserkjahraunvegur road and go for a long walk. Or you can take a dirt road and explore it by car. If you do it by car, make sure your car has good tyres.

Vatnshellir: The 8000-year-old volcanic cave is bound to leave you speechless. There is only one way to explore this cave, and that is taking a group tour. In winters, this place often gets closed.

Kolgrafarfjördur Fjord: This fjord is known for the maximum concentration of marine life. In year 2003-4, there had been an incident of mass death of marine life in this fjord because of lack of oxygen and since then, it has been a popular stop for visitors. The area is beautiful and definitely worth spending some time and taking beautiful pictures.

Kirkujafell Mountain: The Kirkujafell Mountain is the climax of journey of Snaefellsnes Peninsula. It is the most photographed mountain of Iceland. When you reach this spot, you will understand God’s perfect set up: waterfall, mountain, sea — all in one sight. And if you are lucky, you will also find Icelandic horses running in the barn. Keep in mind that parking lot is small at this spot, so it does take some amount of waiting as this place remains crowded. For photographers, you will have to be in line to get the chance to photograph the mountain from the perfect angle."

AIADMK factions break new ground

Also in this section

A divided verdict

The two AIADMK factions have come together in Tamil Nadu. This unity is at best tentative and is predicted on an agreement to keep VK Sasikala out of any power-sharing arrangement. This is in itself a remarkable moment in the Indian party system: activists and leaders have discovered enough clarity and sufficient nerves to wrest back the party from someone who had usurped power in “Amma’s” name. Sasikala’s only claim to the AIADMK’s leadership and its cadres’ loyalty was that she was a domestic aide to their leader, Jayalalithaa. The claim was in conformity with the current political theology that holds that a party belongs to the leader and his/her family. The Gandhis, the Badals, the Karunanidhis, the Paswans, the Lalus, all rule in the name of the sanctity and indispensability of family lineage. Sasikala extended this principle to include the leader’s domestic help. The two AIADMK factions, one led by the incumbent Chief Minister, Edappadi K Palaniswami, and the other by a former Chief Minister, O Panneerselvam, have also got down to the nitty-gritty of sharing spoils of office. Now they will need to attend to urgent task of purposeful governance. The Sasikala faction has yet not thrown in the towel, even as it continues to command the loyalty of about 20 MLAs; the majority the two factions have cobbled together may be precarious and the DMK has already demanded that the Governor should ask the Chief Minister to prove his numbers. Dust will take some time to settle down in Chennai. Whether or not the united AIADMK decides to join the NDA camp will only be of transient importance; but what could be of a longer time significance is the implied defeat for the idea of a political dynasty. It was galling to modern India that a domestic aide, however useful and however loyal to a leader, should become not only the boss of a political party, but also aspire to occupy the chief ministerial chair. Family fundamentalism is violently at odds with the idea of modern democracy. This minor insurgency in Tamil Nadu has to be cheered."

Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 22

Tourism and Irrigation Minister Satpal Maharaj today announced an enquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds allocated by the Central government for initiating development works at Jageshwar and Katarmal temples.

“The enquiry will be conducted by Meenakshi Sundaram, Secretary, Uttarakhand Tourism. The development carried by the agencies hired by the previous government did not follow the guidelines set by the Archaeological Survey of India,” alleged Satpal Maharaj, while addressing mediapersons.

He said the work comprising development of tourism infrastructure did not adhere to the 200 metre limit set by the Archaeological Survey of India.

The Centre had sanctioned Heritage Circuit Project ‘Swades’ for developing tourism infrastructure in Jageshwar-Devidhura-Katarmal-Baijnath sites at a cost of Rs 83 crore. The highlights of the project include development of eco-log huts, sound and light show and upgrading of temple pathways.

The work was carried by the Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN), but it was stopped midway after the ASI raised objections.

He said a memorandum of understanding would be inked with the UP government on the water sharing and other issues pertaining to Jamrani Dam on August 24 and 25.

The multipurpose dam envisaged in 1975 is expected to provide drinking to Haldwani and Nainital, along with Bijnor and Rampur districts in Uttar Pradesh. The issue has been hanging fire since 2000 and is now nearing resolution.

The department is also holding talks with the Central government to upgrade Institute of Hotel Management to a Central institute. “We will be able to raise the number of seats from 220 to 240,” he said.

He e prehistoric tourism circuit at Lakotiyar in Almora would be promoted. “The prehistoric sites in Almora are more than 5,000 years old and we will develop a new prehistoric circuit to attract visitors,” he said."
RBI to issue Rs 200 notes: Finance Ministry,"New Delhi, August 23

The government on Wednesday gave its go-ahead to the Reserve Bank to issue Rs 200 notes that will ease pressure on lower-denomination currency bills.

The Finance Ministry, in a notification, said that on the recommendations of the Central Board of Directors of the RBI, “the Central Government hereby specifies the denomination of banknotes of the value of two hundred rupees”.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

The new Rs 200 notes are likely to be in circulation shortly.

According to sources, the exercise of printing Rs 200 denomination notes is being undertaken to further improve the currency situation in the country.

Following the demonetisation on November 9 last year, the Reserve Bank had introduced Rs 2,000 notes and also issued new Rs 500 notes with additional security features.

So with the introduction of Rs 200 notes, the problem people face due to high-value Rs 2,000 notes would be taken care of.

The Reserve Bank has also introduced new fluorescent blue Rs 50 banknotes bearing the motif of ‘Hampi with Chariot’ that depicts India’s cultural heritage.

In a surprise announcement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in November last year announced scrapping of old notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, wiping out over 86 per cent of the cash in circulation.

The move was aimed at checking black money, counterfeit notes and terror financing. — PTI"
The Tribune: World news,"PHOENIX: President Donald Trump, surrounded by thousands of supporters on Tuesday, defended his response to the violence at a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, and attacked the media for “giving a platform to hate groups.”

Phoenix, August 23

US President Donald Trump, surrounded by thousands of supporters on Tuesday, defended his response to the violence at a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, and attacked the media for “giving a platform to hate groups.” Trump told the friendly crowd at the political rally in Arizona that his words in the aftermath of the Virginia event had been “perfect.”

He revved up the crowd with criticism of journalists, who he said did not report what he had said. Many in the crowd turned and pointed at reporters in the room. Some chanted “CNN sucks.” Trump also suggested he might pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

Arpaio, 85, lost a re-election bid last year in the county.

“Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?” Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of “Pardon Joe!” “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One earlier on Tuesday: “There will be no discussion of that today at any point and no action will be taken on that front at any point today.”

Broad criticism

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed.

Protesters outside Tuesday’s rally yelled: “Shame, shame, shame” and “No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA” as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: “Build the wall,” a reference to Trump’s pledge to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

Many wore red hats with Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January.

Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday’s event, scheduled for 7 p.m. MST (0200 GMT Wednesday), while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville.

Neither John McCain nor Jeff Flake, Arizona’s senators, was expected to attend the Phoenix event, said a source familiar with Flake’s re-election campaign and published reports, underscoring Trump’s fractious relationship with some in his own party.

Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the rally.

Before flying to Phoenix, the state capital, Trump landed in Yuma, Arizona, near the Mexican border, for a tour of border security facilities. He is seeking congressional funding for the wall he wants built along the border to deter illegal immigration..

Heavy police presence

A heavy police presence deployed around the Phoenix venue.

Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump’s Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by supporters.

“The president is always welcome in Arizona,” Flake spokesman Will Allison said in an emailed statement.

Flake “hopes the president will speak constructively about moving forward with tax reform, border security, and other important issues facing our country,” Allison said.

Earlier this summer, Flake published a book questioning the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era, making him one of the few party members willing to criticize the president.

Last week, Trump sent a tweet voicing support for Flake’s challenger, Kelli Ward, in next year’s Arizona Senate Republican primary. In the tweet, Trump called Flake “toxic” and “weak.” The president has also made caustic remarks about McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and war hero, who is battling cancer. A spokesman for McCain could not be reached immediately.

The Phoenix event is Trump’s first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election. Reuters"
Go the genome way,"Gauri Chhabra

One of the quickest growing fields in bio-medical science is that of Genome Sequencing. It deals with the study of biological changes in living organisms. It is the branch of biotechnology that deals with the study of cells, structural and functional unit of living organisms. Nearly every cell in the human body — from the ones in the fingernails to the ones deep inside the brain-contains a complete set of DNA, the operating instructions that influence everything from a person’s hair colour to susceptibility to disease. For years, doctors have been able to test specific genes to detect the presence of mutations associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. But only recently have scientists been able to map out a person’s entire genetic code, or genome, by sequencing all 20,000 or so genes in one fell swoop. There has been a huge movement in affordable rapid genome sequencing recently and this will produce massive numbers of new genetic data on individuals, as well as populations. The challenge is now on for a new generation of scientists who are able to combine genetics and bioinformatics in an effort to understand how various genomic changes can cause life-threatening diseases such as cancer. This will enable the development of new treatments, through combining drug and gene therapy, along with prevention strategies.

Getting in

If you are interested in getting admission in bachelor courses, you have to complete higher secondary examination with physics, chemistry & biology. The duration of this course is three years. Some colleges also conduct an aptitude test for admission in genetics course. To get admission in master’s course, you must have done a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field from any recognised college or university. Some institutions also give admission in genetic courses on the basis of the merit list of the qualifying examination.

Career Scape

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors collect and analyse data about patients’ medical and genetic histories. You will also provide information and help families and individuals about the occurrence, risk and minimisation of inherited diseases. You can also have job duties in areas such as administration, research, teaching and lab work. Institutions such as hospitals, universities, laboratories, research facilities and government agencies can employ genetic counselors. Laboratory Geneticists: These are specialists in genetics with relation to laboratory medicine and DNA testing. You will research genetic material to assist and work for agricultural, pharmaceutical, clinical medicine and law enforcement organisations. Many laboratory geneticists have 4-6 years of postsecondary education, while lab directors may hold either a Ph.D. or an MD degree Clinical Geneticists: Clinical geneticists are generally licensed physicians, and may also be involved in the field of medical genetics. You can be specialised in areas such as oncology, pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology, and work in hospitals, medical centers or other research centers. In addition, clinical geneticists may manage a team of genetic counselors and work together to help identify and minimise the risk factors for certain hereditary diseases. Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors play a key role in helping patients and their families get the care that’s right for them. Genetic counselors work with doctors and other members of the health care team to help patients understand what their family history means to them, decide what genetic tests to have, and know how to use the test results to make the best treatment choices. This is especially helpful today as medicine becomes more personalised, and treatment plans increasingly are tailored to a patient’s individual needs.

The road ahead

What is Genome Sequencing?

The technique that allows researchers to read and decipher the genetic information found in the DNA of anything from bacteria to plants to animals is called genome sequencing.

Genomics involves measuring everything about a genome and the changes between genomes.

Genome sequencing involves the determination of the order of DNA bases. You may be wondering what makes these bases so important. In a strand of DNA, there are some simple units known as nucleotides. These nucleotides have a 'backbone' that consists of sugars and a phosphate group.

Commonly used techniques in genomics are DNA sequencing, microarrays, and PCR.

Genomics is being increasingly used in medicine to help diagnose disease since an individual’s DNA sequence can provide insights into the potential for developing specific diseases.

Genomics is one of many ""-omics"" disciplines that is becoming more prominent in biotechnology and research as a whole.

Discoveries in this field often allign with innovations in the technologies available to conduct analysis and perform sequencing or assays.

The very basic unit of the human genome is a single DNA nucleotide. This nucleotide is made up of minuscule atoms, which create a challenge for even an advanced microscope to be used for detection. Researchers still, however, need to be able to determine the sequence of bases in DNA.

Sri Lanka to set up crisis panel to arrest cricket slide,"Colombo, August 23

Alarmed by the Sri Lankan cricket team’s rapid decline in recent times, the government is setting up a crisis panel to address the concerns plaguing the former world champions.

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said on Wednesday he is to set up a special four-member panel consisting of senior officials who would convene a seminar within the next fortnight to look into the poor performance.

Sri Lanka’s national team is having a bad run since 2014, with the retirement of greats such as Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan.

They have lost their number one ranking in T20 while sliding badly in the Test and ODI tables.

This panel would involve former players, captains, former selectors, coaches, international experts, provincial cricket organisations and media.

They would discuss the poor showing by the national team and look to identify the problem areas, Jayasekera told reporters.

Bathinda, August 22

The debt-ridden Municipal Corporation Bathinda (MCB) has now decided to increase its revenue by raising the fee for approval of maps.

The increase will lead to rise in the development fee, labour and water charges.

The MCB had kept this proposal in the house for revising the rate in 2015, but at that time, the house kept the item pending.

Now again, the proposal would be tabled in the meeting of the General House on August 24.

In the report sent to the house, the building branch has stated that while constructing a building, about 1,200 to 1,500 rupees per square feet is spent, but the MCB is charging fee by making estimate on old rates of Rs 500 per square feet of ground floor and 400 rupees per square feet of first floor.

The building branch has argued that in the city, other government departments, which include Improvement Trust and Bathinda Development Authority (BDA), have estimate rate of Rs 900 and 800 per square feet.

Therefore, as per the proposal, different departments cannot have different rates in the same city.

So, the MCB has decided to revise its old rate of ground floor to Rs 900 and first floor to Rs 800 per square feet.

The MCB is set to revive the rate of map fees after about five years.

Earlier, the corporation had revised rates in 2012. At that time, the MCB had increased the floor rate from Rs 250 to Rs 500 per square feet and of the first floor from Rs 200 to 400 per square feet.

The Local Audit Department of the MCB had also objected to the old rates of the corporation.

Rates earlier revised in 2012

"Astronaut urine may be recycled into nutrients, plastic","Washington

Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make long duration space trips more feasible.

Astronauts cannot take a lot of spare parts into space because every extra ounce adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape the Earth's gravity.

""If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we will need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them. Atom economy will become really important,"" said Mark A Blenner, from the Clemson University in the US.

The solution lies in part with the astronauts themselves, who will constantly generate waste from breathing, eating and using materials.

Unlike people on Earth, Blenner said, spacefarers would not want to throw any waste molecules away.

Researchers are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.

Some essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, have a shelf life of just a couple of years, said Blenner.

They will need to be made en route, beginning a few years after launch, or at the destination.

""Having a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing what they need, when they need it, is the motivation for our project,"" Blenner said.

The biological system includes a variety of strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. These organisms require both nitrogen and carbon to grow.

Researchers discovered that the yeast could obtain their nitrogen from urea in untreated urine. Meanwhile, the yeast obtains its carbon from CO2, which could come from astronauts' exhaled breath, or from the Martian atmosphere.

However, to use CO2, the yeast requires a middleman to 'fix' the carbon into a form they can ingest.

For this purpose, the yeast relies on photosynthetic cyanobacteria or algae provided by the researchers.

One of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers. Those polymers could then be used in a 3D printer to generate new plastic parts.

Researchers are continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerised into different types of polyesters with a range of properties.

For now, the engineered yeast strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients, but the scientists are working on boosting output.

They are also looking into applications here on Earth, in fish farming and human nutrition. For example, fish raised via aquaculture need to be given omega-3 fatty acid supplements, which could be produced by Blenner's yeast strains. PTI"
"Paswan assures Capt on review of Rs 31,000-cr debt","Food Minister promises to plead case with Finance Ministry

New Delhi, August 22

Union Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today assured Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh that he would make a recommendation to the Finance Ministry about reviewing the state’s debt burden of Rs 31,000 crore, incurred on the purchase of foodgrains for the Central pool. During a meeting with Paswan here, the CM sought the Centre’s help to settle the debt burden by examining the matter afresh. Paswan said: “There was confusion over the findings of the Jha Committee, which was set up by the Centre in April 2016 to examine the state’s claims of Rs 20,000-crore foodgrain dues.” PK Jha, Additional Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution, had headed the committee comprising officials from the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Finance Ministry, and the state government. The Punjab and Central governments had not been on the same page over the expenses incurred on the transportation of grains, labour and packaging. This had resulted in delayed payments by the Centre. During the meeting, Capt Amarinder said the failure to resolve the issue ahead of the procurement season had compelled the state government to convert about Rs 29,920 crore (as on March 31 this year) into a “clean term loan”. Consequently, the state was burdened with an annual debt-servicing liability of Rs 3,240 crore for the next 12 years. He said the Rs 31,000-crore debt, which includes a component of Rs 18,500 crore, had arisen due to a difference in actual cost and provisional/final cost approved by the Centre. A state government functionary said the state wanted rationalisation of the interest amount.

'Will ask these hotels to put a board outside saying anybody staying there is staying at his own risk'

New Delhi, August 23

The Supreme Court on Wednesday vent its ire on the alleged illegal constructions at some hotels in the picturesque Himachal Pradesh town of Kasauli, warning that it would order the owners to put up signboards that the guests would stay there at their own risk.

“We will ask these hotels to put a board outside saying anybody staying there is staying at his own risk,” a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said.

“There is no point in having excess and illegal constructions,” the bench observed while hearing pleas against the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order to demolish or close down several hotels and resorts which were extended illegally without the requisite approvals.

During the hearing, senior advocate Parag Tripathi, representing one of the hotels, questioned the jurisdiction of the NGT to order the closure or demolition of illegal structures.

The apex court said it would hear the pleas filed by some of the hotels and resorts in November.

The top court had earlier granted stay on the NGT's order with respect to some of the hotels and resorts there subject to the condition that they would not use the alleged unauthorised constructions.

The NGT in its order had directed demolition of the temporary structures of various hotels, including Kasauli Regency, Bird's View Resort, Chelsea Resorts, Hotel Pine View, Narayani Guest House, Hotel Nilgiri, Hotel Divsikha and AAA Guest House.

It had also imposed hefty fines on several hotels for causing irretrievable damage to the ecology, polluting the environment and raising unauthorised constructions.

The NGT's order had come on a plea by the Society for Preservation of Kasauli and its Environs (SPOKE), an NGO.

The apex court had earlier observed that norms were not followed in the construction of some resorts and hotels in Kasauli. — PTI"

"Adamant on debate on law, order, BJP walks out","ASSEMBLY IN SESSION

Shimla, August 22

Adamant on holding a debate on the deteriorating law and order situation in the state in the wake of rape and murder of the Kotkhai minor girl, Opposition BJP today disrupted proceedings on the opening day of the monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha, compelling the Speaker to adjourn the house. It was immediately after the house had paid obituary to former Nahan MLA Sadanand Chauhan, who passed away recently, that Chief Whip of the BJP Suresh Bhardwaj urged the Speaker to allow a debate on the deteriorating law and order situation for which some legislators had moved an adjournment motion under Rule 67. “This government has failed to protect the life and property of the people so we demand that all business for the day should be suspended and discussion be held,” Bhardwaj urged. Attempts by the Speaker to diffuse the situation by holding talks with both ruling and treasury bench members in his chamber after adjourning the house briefly at 11.45 am failed as BJP members insisted on the debate under Rule 67. Even as the Speaker directed that business be taken up, BJP legislators trouped to the well of the house and raised slogans, “Gudia hum sharminda hain, tere katil zinda hain” and against the forest, land and liquor mafia active in the state. Bhardwaj said the situation was very worrisome as it was not just one Kotkhai rape incident but murders and rapes in Solan, Rohru, Kullu and Tissa, which warranted a debate. He added that the custodial death of one of the accused in police station had further deepened the mystery of the Kotkhai case. BJP MLAs alleged direct involvement of the Chief Minister in the case and said that efforts were made to shield the culprits which was obvious from the manner in which pictures of four accused loaded on CM’s Facebook account and later removed. While BJP legislators, including Jai Ram Thakur, Rajiv Bindal, Ravinder Ravi and Randhir Sharma urged the Speaker BBL Butail to allow a debate, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Agnihotri contended that a debate could not be allowed as the matter was sub judice. Butail too urged the Opposition members who were on their feet to give him time to seek a reply from the government and gather more details before time and date for the debate could be fixed. Randhir said that the debate was not on one incident but about the various crimes that were taking place all over. Finally, Leader of Opposition and former Chief Minister PK Dhumal tried to reason with the Speaker that there can be no other important business for the house than discuss how life and property of the citizens can be protected. “Under Rule 67, no reply is sought and the notices have been moved as per the rules and procedures of the house,” Dhumal insisted. Dhumal even suggested that the Speaker could adjourn the house and hold a meeting in his chamber to discuss the issue to which even the ruling benches agreed. There was complete pandemonium in the house for 20 minutes after the house reassembled. BJP members stood right in front of the benches of the Chief Minister and ministers and raised slogans and later surrounded the podium of the Speaker, forcing him to adjourn the house till tomorrow."
Drive smart with Telematics,"Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation. n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health. n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details. n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone. n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you. n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc. You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it. n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour. n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour. n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills. Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

Rooney calls time on England career despite being recalled,"London, August 23

England’s record goalscorer Wayne Rooney announced on Wednesday he is retiring from international football with immediate effect after manager Gareth Southgate tried to recall him to the squad.

The 31-year-old—scorer of 53 goals in 119 appearances for his country—told Southgate of his decision during a phone conversation yesterday.

Southgate had phoned Rooney—who had lost both the captaincy and eventually his place in the squad as he became a peripheral figure under Jose Mourinho at Manchester United last season—to congratulate him on his early season form for new club Everton.

Rooney has looked rejuvenated and happy—scoring in both their Premier League matches so far—since he re-signed for the club that nurtured his talent as a teenager before he left for United.

“It was great that Gareth Southgate called me this week to tell me he wanted me back in the England squad for the upcoming matches. I really appreciated that,” said Rooney in a statement sent to Press Association Sport.

“Having already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football.

“It is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton (Ronald Koeman) and those closest to me.

“Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me.

“But I believe now is the time to bow out.”

Rooney, England’s most capped outfield player ever, said his sole purpose now in football was to ensure Everton won trophies.

He had alluded to what his priority was in his post-match interview on Sky Sports on Monday after he joined Alan Shearer in scoring 200 Premier League goals—made sweeter as it came against Manchester United’s city rivals Manchester City.

“Leaving Manchester United was a tough call but I know I made the right decision in coming home to Everton,” said Rooney.

“Now I want to focus all my energies on helping them be successful.”

Rooney, who another former England great Gary Lineker said earlier today had been unlucky to be the only world-class player in many England sides, had one regret that he had never lifted a trophy with his country.

“One of my very few regrets is not to have been part of a successful England tournament side,” said Rooney, whose four goals in Euro 2004 propelled England to the quarter-finals before their hopes were extinguished when he broke a bone in his foot in the last-eight match with the hosts.

“Hopefully the exciting players Gareth is bringing through can take that ambition further and I hope everyone will get behind the team.

“One day the dream will come true and I look forward to being there as a fan—or in any capacity.” — AFP"
"College students protest, allege harassment over dress code","Principal says restrictions put to ensure discipline; protesters seek her dismissal

Tribune News Service

Jammu, August 22

Students of Government College for Women (GCW), Parade, today held protests against their alleged “harassment” in the name of discipline, dress code and punctuality by the college administration. The students also blocked roads at Library Chowk, Kachi Chawni and outside the college gate, leading to traffic jams. The protesters demanded immediate removal of the college Principal, Anita Sudan. They also levelled allegations against a watchman and faculty members of the college, saying that “they don’t know how to treat women with respect”. Besides, Muslim students alleged that they were asked not to wear burqa or hijab while entering the college. “We were denied entry into the college for wearing a hijab or burqa. The watchman talked to us rudely and asked us to deposit our hijab or burqa at the gate. This is sheer harassment of students in the name of dress code and discipline. We cannot leave our culture, come what may,” a college student opposite said. Another protesting student alleged, “Watchmen of the college don’t behave properly with students and pass lewd remarks. There are other women colleges in the city but there is no such problem there. Why are we beingsubjected to this harassment in the name of dress code? We are not kids.” The students boycotted classes and raised slogans against the principal of the college. Principal Sudan, however, denied the allegations, saying, “Some outsiders have instigated the students and it is a planned conspiracy to create trouble on the college campus.” “We received complaints of parents that their wards were not attending the college regularly. We looked into the issue and found that some students came to the college but left the campus on one pretext or the other. We decided to ensure punctuality and for this, we put restrictions on the entry and exit of students. We decided to close all gates of the college by 10.30 am and no students would be allowed to leave college before 1.40 pm, except during compelling situations,” the Principal said. She added, “As per college norms, the girls have to follow a dress code which is “white salwar, kameez and dupatta. We have about 6,200 students in the college. We can’t allow any student to violate this code as it helps us in their identification.” However, looking at students’ complaints against watchmen, four of them have been sent on forced leave, she said."
GST hurts India Inc profits,"GDP growth also likely to slow down in first quarter, say experts

Sanjeev Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 22

Profitability of India Inc has been hit by uncertainties due to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the destocking of goods that followed which is also expected to slow down the GDP growth for the first quarter of financial year 2018. Ratings agency, ICRA said today that GVA growth will slow down to 6.3% in Q1 FY2018 from 7.6% in Q1 FY2017 due to transitional challenges posed by GST, rupee appreciation and sector-specific issues. ICRA expects GDP to rise by 6.1% in year-on-year terms. CARE Ratings said in a report that the performance of a sample of 2,108 companies over the last quarter (April-June) 2017 period reveals a negative picture, with net sales showing slower growth and net profits growth showing deterioration. The agency said this slowdown in industry performance can be attributed to the uncertainties revolving around the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1, 2017. It said most companies were destocking goods before July 1 and operations were impacted quite markedly. A recovery in corporate earnings has become elusive with another weak quarter of India Inc results. Corporate results which are seen as an indicator of economic activity were expected to improve but the GST impact has led to a strong recovery in the economy post demonetisation getting pushed further into the fiscal year. Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note that earnings recovery remains elusive as the Q1FY18 earnings season marked another quarter of weak performance and a subdued start to FY18. It said the performance was also hit by GST-related de-stocking in several consumer-oriented sectors — auto, FMCG, healthcare and consumer durables. Destocking-driven volume and top-line miss exacerbated the impact at operating profit levels."
153-kg world’s largest samosa sets Guinness record in London,"London, August 23

The Guinness world record for the largest samosa has been smashed by a 153-kg gigantic version of the popular Indian tea-time snack prepared at a mosque here.

The enormous snack was made by a 12-member team of Muslim Aid volunteers at the East London Mosque yesterday.

After Guinness World Records officials approved their feat, the team distributed the gigantic samosa, which took over 15 hours to make, to homeless people around Whitechapel.

The previous record for the world’s largest samosa was of 110.8 kg set by Bradford College in northern England in June 2012.

A Guinness World Records spokesperson was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying that, “This is an impressive achievement by Muslim Aid and a lot of hard work and determination has gone into this attempt to ensure its success.”

“We are pleased to welcome them to the Guinness World Records family,” the spokesperson said.

Members of the mosque said they decided to make the samosa to highlight the “generosity of Muslim people during religious festivals like Eid”.

“We wanted to make a larger-than-ever version of this popular food to demonstrate visually how people of the Muslim faith work tirelessly throughout the year, and particularly during Eid, doing charitable acts to support the unfortunate in the community around them and further afield,” Muslim Aid’s Zac Hussain was quoted as saying.

“The samosa will feed the homeless near our offices in London. Meanwhile, donations via Muslim Aid will feed hundreds of thousands in the developing world,” he said.

The samosa needed to be triangular, contain flour, potato, onion, and peas and be deep-fried while maintaining its shape for it to be considered a successful attempt at the record. And, most importantly, it had to be fit for human consumption.

The huge samosa was set up on an oversized wire rack and then lowered into a custom built deep-fryer for the final result which was crisp and golden. — PTI"

A tad too sweet,"MOVIE REVIEW: BAREILLY KI BARFI

Nonika Singh

Ever since Anand L Rai invented patakha Tanu, which fit Kangana Ranaut like a glove, there has been a deluge of perky small-town female characters. So, Bitty (Kriti Sanon) of Bareilly Ki Barfi comes as no surprise. This daughter of a sweet shop owner is bold and vivacious, can break into a jig (break dance to be precise) at the slightest turn of music, smokes and drinks and has the courage to tell her suitors that she is no virgin. No wonder she can't find a suitable groom. After all girls like her, few and far between, are a ‘disaster.’

But before she decides to call it quits and run away from home, she stumbles upon a book Bareilly Ki Barfi that best describes a girl just like her with no value judgements attached to her behaviour which others, including her mother, call misdemeanors.

Thus begins her search for the author and director takes us on to the love path where identities are muddled and soon love has three facets, not just the visible Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti. If Kriti is just right for the exuberant Bitty and Khurrana is endearing and exasperating in turns as his character demands, Rajkummar Rao as the third angle and the underdog is brilliant. He gets even better when he transforms into the snazzy confident, almost brash guy. Only if he had some more screen time as well as something more (spoiler alert).

Nevertheless, for a considerable part the director keeps you invested in the story told simply as well as has you nibbling over the key question---who will get the girl? Fleetingly, the film reminds you of those delectable super fresh romances such as Sai Paranjpye’s Katha. But if those films skillfully and subtly delved into complexities and many shades of human nature, here the director decides to play super safe and love story ends the way you so hope and wish it won’t. The conflict resolution is a downer.

Thus Bareilly Ki Barfi, despite the surface gloss of rebellion, turns too sweet. If you like your love stories more sugar than spice be Bareilly’s guest. We would have preferred a sharper climax, the sparkle of which can otherwise be seen interspersed in-between and not just in Javed Akhtar’s witty voice-over that takes you enroute Bareilly ki galiyan, especially the Misra household that is peopled with few but animated characters and competent actors (Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi as parents). Dialogues such as Agar ladkiyan shakal dekhti to desh ke aadhe se zyaada ladke kunwaare hote have a zing. Indeed, Bareilly… has many delightful one-liners and amusing moments but the overall impact is not tantalizing enough to make it a wholesome fare one must bite into. Unless you have a sweet tooth…the saccharine-high barfi will leave you craving for more."
Blue plaque for first black actor,"Shakespearean theatre manager Ira Aldridge was honoured 150 years after his death

Chantal Da Silva

Britain’s first black Shakespearean actor has been honoured with the unveiling of a blue plaque in Coventry. Ira Aldridge became manager of the Coventry Theatre in 1828, after impressing the city’s residents with his acting talent on a tour. The actor, who died 150 years ago, put on performances that are believed to have inspired the people of Coventry to petition Parliament to abolish slavery. Aldridge was honoured by the city of Coventry, with the Lord Mayor Tony Skipper unveiling a blue plaque celebrating his legacy as the UK’s first black theatre manager. “It’s very important,” Professor Tony Howard, who leads Warwick University’s Multicultural Shakespeare project. “He’s been admired and respected for a long time as the first black Shakespearean actor, but many people are less aware of the fact that he had also been the first black theatre manager.” The ceremony marked the 150th anniversary of his death and was attended by actor Earl Cameron, who is widely celebrated as one of the first black actors to break the “colour bar” in the UK. Cameron was also trained by Aldridge’s daughter Amanda and was invited as a guest of honour at the plaque unveiling. Aldridge was born in New York in 1807 and worked as an actor in the US until the 1920s when he migrated to England after being brutally beaten in racist attacks. He rose to fame in the UK, managing to break down racial barriers, playing principal roles, including Romeo, Hamlet, Othello and later on, King Lear. The actual theatre that Aldridge managed was demolished long ago, but the permanent memorial will mark the site where it would have stood. “It’s a reminder of the fact that cities come and cities go; they go through periods of strength and depression. That’s why we have to honour those moments, when people do the unexpected,” Professor Howard said. “I think the city is very proud and very happy,” he added. Aldridge has already been honoured with a blue plaque in the London borough of Bromley at a home where he once lived as part of the English Heritage scheme. The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare’s globe will also be honouring the actor with an event called “Against Prejudice: A celebration of Ira Aldridge” on September 19.— The Independent"

Amritsar, August 22

The Amritsar rural police have shifted the Lopoke police station SHO to the Police Lines following the firing incident which led to the killing of a Dalit Sikh while leaving others injured at Tapiala village a day earlier.

The incident was an outcome of a dispute over land possessed by around 95 Dalit families in the village. The family of one Sukhbir Kaur claimed that the disputed 22 kanal and 15 marla of land belonged to her and that she had won the case in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, an organisation of farmers, today rebutted the claims of the accused while adding that the High Court had asked the government to find an alternate land besides ascertaining the actual legal heir of the property.

Rattan Singh Randhawa of the Sabha, while giving details during an interaction with the media, said the land actually belonged to Harnam Singh and Chanan Kaur. The couple did not have any child. The government acquired the land in 1974 from Chanan Kaur under the Indira Awas Yojna. Kaur was later murdered by one Narinder Singh who belonged to the family accused of involvement in Sunday’s firing at Tapiala village, said Randhawa.

In 1995, the accused allegedly got the property fraudulently transferred in their name. The villagers contested this with the district administration which again transferred the property in the government’s name. The then Deputy Commissioner, Commissioner and the Financial Commissioner ordered in favour of the victims, he added.

However, the accused family challenged the land transfer before the Director, Panchayat, which favoured the accused. When the same orders were not implemented, the accused filed a contempt petition in the High Court, Randhawa said.

He said the matter about the legal heir is pending with the court and the district administration. The Deputy Commissioner marked a probe to the ADC Development to inquire into this. He alleged that it was due to the apathy and lethargy of the district administration that led to the incident. The farmers and the labour unions demanded compensation for the deceased and the victims.

Meanwhile, members of the Punjab SC Commission today visited the village and started investigations. They also met the family members of the deceased and assured support and suitable compensation to the victims.

Parampal Singh, SSP, Amritsar Rural, confirmed that the Station House Officer (SHO) has been placed under suspension for dereliction of duty. He added that the government has announced Rs 7.50 lakh as compensation to the deceased’s family, Rs 50,000 for those who sustained bullet injuries and Rs 25,000 for those who had sustained minor injuries. He said compensation would also be given for the repair of houses demolished by the accused.

The police have arrested seven persons in this connection while raids were on to nab the remaining accused who were on the run."
Over 70% turn-out in Goa bypoll; CM complains to ECI against Cong,"Panaji, August 23

Goa’s Panaji constituency on Wednesday recorded 70 per cent polling while Valpoi registered 79.80 per cent turn-out in the Assembly by-elections in the BJP-ruled coastal state.

Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar accused the Congress of trying to sabotage polling and filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India (ECI). The Congress levelled counter-allegations.

Parrikar, who returned to the state from the Centre after the elections in February, is contesting from Panaji against Congress’ Girish Chodankar and Goa Suraksha Manch’s Anand Shirodkar.

In Valpoi, the BJP had fielded Health Minister Vishwajit Rane against Congress’ Roy Naik.

“Final polling stands at 70 per cent in Panaji and 79.80 per cent in Valpoi,” Chief Electoral Officer Kunal said.

The voting began at 8 am and ended at 5 pm.

Panaji had recorded 77.06 per cent polling during the February 2017 Assembly elections, while Valpoi had registered 86.29 per cent voting then, Kunal said.

Speaking to reporters after the polling was over, Parrikar accused the Congress of trying to sabotage the election process and said that he had submitted a complaint to the ECI.

He said that he would release documents related to his complaint, if the ECI did not take action within seven days.

Both the Congress and the BJP have filed complaints against each other with the Panaji police after an incident near a booth.

Chodankar’s election agent, Rohit Braz D’Sa, complained that BJP leaders Siddharth Kuncolienkar and Sheetal Dattaprasad Naik created ruckus near a polling booth.

The BJP in its complaint alleged that Goa Mahila Congress chief Pratima Coutinho and others intimidated its workers and tried to disrupt the election process.

Parrikar alleged that some Congress leaders, including Coutinho, were going around like “goons”, and violated the ECI’s prohibition of outside leaders camping in the constituency on polling day.

Congress denied this and levelled counter-allegations.

“Our workers were being targeted by the BJP leaders when they realised that voting does not favour their (BJP’s) victory,” Coutinho said. Counting would be held on August 28. — PTI"
Colour calculus,"’ART & SOUL

In Devinder Goswamy’s designs, each shape and colour seems engaged in a dialogue with the next

B.N. Goswamy

“Let no one destitute of geometry enter my doors”. — Plato “Colour is the place where our brain and the Universe meet….Colour has got me; I no longer need to chase after it. It has got me for ever.” — Paul Klee “Vertical and horizontal lines are the expression of two opposing forces; they exist everywhere and dominate everything; their reciprocal action constitutes ‘life’. I recognize that the equilibrium of any particular aspect of nature rests on the equivalence of its opposites…”

— Piet Mondrian

For the greater part of his professional life, D.G. (that is the best way to refer to him, at least at this point) was involved with the performing arts. Working with Doordarshan in a high executive capacity, he remained engaged with the world of music and dance and theatre; he also wrote a number of stunning plays, mostly in Urdu, and kept directing them for the channel. He planned and worked; worked and planned, but always in those areas. After superannuation, or close to it, however, he somehow got drawn to the visual arts: to painting, in particular. What took him there is not easy to determine, but once he went there, so to speak, he stayed there. Much in the manner of the great Swiss painter, Paul Klee, who said once that ‘colour has got me… it has got me forever’, colours and shapes ‘got him’, became his new world, as it were. It would be fair to say that he began a bit gingerly. Attracted by the idea of collaging — ‘composing a work of art by pasting on a single surface various materials not normally associated with one another’, as the formal definition has it — he would fill a surface with snippets of images by great masters: van Gogh’s chair, for instance, Manet’s lunching party, Seurat’s stippled ballerina, Bhupen Khakhar’s brooding face, all tilted, torn out of context, jostling one another to the point of unease. But this did not last long. Very soon, he turned towards the purity of shapes and the tactile seduction of textures. He would assemble all kinds of papers and cardboards and plastic sheets, and sit surrounded by them gazing at each, making up his mind, cutting them up in different shapes and sizes. And then compose them in his mind. The process of putting them together naturally followed: cerebration, decision, trial and error, and the like. Traditional materials held for him great attraction: the sacred mauli thread for instance, pieces of hessian, coarsely woven uparna-like fabric, strips of embroidered ribbons. Everything became grist to his churning, artistic mill. It would not be easy to dis-entangle the skeins of his thought: Were there childhood memories here? An innate reverence for the sacred? Sights of struggling small-town shopkeepers and their goods? Interestingly, the bits and pieces that he picked for turning into images were not all placed — collaged — at the same level on the surface: some rose, others dipped, still others peeped over the walls of their neighbours, and so on. Even the edges of the total composition remained uneven at times. But somehow it all worked. Hard-edged shapes — squares and triangles and circles and rectangular strips — in various colours and configurations one would have naturally expected to figure in D.G.’s completely abstract work, and they did, each shape and colour setting up a dialogue with the one next to it. Not every colour was intense, not everything glowed with an inner fire, but a quiet, whispered conversation one could hear snatches of. But there also were works in which one could see a kind of frenzy: two circles made up of strips of coloured paper that seemed to be whirling at a dizzying speed, paper strip piled upon paper strip and in the centre, at the heart of the circle, gaping holes through which other things, other sights, could be seen, even as a dark, lurking gloom surrounded everything. This is the way it has gone on, this work, over a number of years. One of the more recent works, a tall ‘canvas’ — that, however, is not the right word, I know — appears to me to have been something of a tribute to the genius of Paul Klee who played with colours and shapes in the subtlest of manners. In this, the work titled ‘As Darkness Lifts’, the eye moves slowly, leisured-fashion, from dark edges towards the centre where a certain light begins to glow. There is no aura, no intensity, in the centre but a gentle spread of light — rectangles and squares of different shades, yellows and reds and light greens, overlapping and dove-tailing — suggesting the breaking of dawn, as it were. Inevitably, perhaps, a couplet of Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi’s comes to mind, at least to my mind: Sansanaate hain andherey to laraztey kyun ho? Har nayi subah ki takhleeq yun-hi hoti hai. [Why do you shudder when shadows gather and darkness seethes? Surely, this is how each morn arrives, triumphant.]

Who owns Mars? Mining puts spotlight on out of this world property claims,"Toronto, August 21

Can anyone claim the red planet or natural resources on asteroids? Business leaders and legal experts say the question has become more than philosophical as a growing number of firms, often backed by capital and technology from Silicon Valley, have set their sights on the resources of outer space asteroids and Mars.

In order to avoid conflicts between competing companies and countries over outer space resources, more work needs to be done on Earth to determine who owns commodities taken from celestial bodies, analysts said.

""There is a huge debate on whether companies can simply travel to space and extract its resources,"" said Barry Kellman, a law professor who studies space governance at DePaul University in Chicago.

""There is no way to answer the question until someone does it,"" Kellman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Asteroid water for sale

US-based Planetary Resources, a firm backed by Google founder Larry Page and Virgin Group's Richard Branson, expects to be mining asteroids for water in the next 10 to 15 years.

The company will launch its first robotic probe mission to scout asteroids for resource deposits in 2020, said Planetary Resources' Chief Executive Chris Lewicki.

""If you obtain a resource and bring it with you, it becomes your property,"" Lewicki said, citing recently passed space laws in the US and Luxembourg that offer a legal framework to ensure that private operators can be confident about their rights over resources they extract in space.

""You can sell, keep or deliver (space resources) peacefully,"" Lewicki told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The firm plans to extract oxygen and hydrogen - the components of water - from asteroids to sell.

Lewicki is not planning on bringing those water resources back to Earth; he wants market them in space, creating a ""gas station"" for other exploration missions.

Hydrogen and oxygen, kept at a docking station orbiting around Earth, will be used to fuel other space ships.

Moving those fuels from Earth into outer space is expensive, he said, and having energy accessible to ships will make voyaging easier.

One modest sized asteroid, about as big as a football field, ""has enough oxygen and hydrogen to fuel every launch in the history of space (travel),"" Lewicki said.

""We are seeing a boom — that might be a bad choice of words — in access to space.""

Martian appropriation

Other analysts are not sure if companies can just fly up and start harvesting cosmic water, legally speaking.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 is the main international standard for what companies and countries are allowed to do when they aren't on earth, said Jacob Haqq-Misra, director of the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, a Seattle-based research group.

The treaty says that space is the ""provenance of all mankind"". Countries cannot claim ""national appropriation"" or sovereignty over the Moon or other celestial bodies ""by occupation or by other means"", the treaty says.

This clause could prove tricky for private firms who want to mine on asteroids or Mars, said Haqq-Misra, including Planetary Resources and SpaceX, the private rocketship company run by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

""If SpaceX, a US corporation, was to claim asteroid profits as its own, there is some ambiguity as to whether that constitutes national appropriation,"" Haqq-Misra told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

SpaceX declined to comment.

New laws

While the 1967 treaty is considered the global standard for sharing space, individual countries have recently passed laws allowing for property rights in the great beyond.

Luxembourg this month brought into force laws allowing private firms to own resources extracted from outer space in a move hailed by the nascent space mining industry.

Planetary Resources, for example, maintains an office in the small European country better known for its finance industry than space exploration.

The US in 2015 introduced similar legislation for private space resource ownership but it only applies to firms majority owned by Americans.

NASA, the US government's space agency, maintains a ""neutral position with regard to mining of minerals on Mars"", a spokesman said.

""If companies request assistance or want partnerships related to mining on Mars, we help to the best of our ability,"" NASA spokesman Guy Webster told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email without providing specifics on space resource ownership.

From sea to space

Along with national legislation and the 1967 treaty, there are other earthly regulations that could provide guidance for managing extraterrestrial resources, legal experts said.

Under the United Nations' Law of the Sea Convention countries have exclusive rights to exploit natural resources within around 200 miles (322 km) of their coastline, but ships and planes from other nations can freely pass through the waters.

This could serve as a template for space resource rights, where companies have exclusive economic rights in a given area around their landing point, but not ownership over an entire asteroid or planet, lawyers said.

""It's advantageous to work out a system where people can acquire property rights enforceable through a legal process,"" Andrew Brehm, an attorney with Scopelitis, Garvin, Light Hanson & Feary in Milwaukee.

""That being said, outer space is viewed in society as something similar to the ocean, where there is a collective interest,"" Brehm told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""A first come, first serve system does not necessarily work well when only certain countries or private entities can (currently) reach outer space.""

Even if countries can agree on a universal property rights regime for space, there are still plenty of earthly grievances for countries and companies to address, said Kellman, the law professor.

Specifically, analysts and legal experts do not know whether companies would have to pay taxes or royalties to anyone on earth for extracting space resources.

It is an issue space exploration firms have yet to deal with.

""For the moment, the company exists on earth, where all of the laws and regulations apply,"" Planetary Resources' Lewicki said. Reuters"

Failed mechanics,"MOVIE REVIEW: ANNABELLE: CREATION

Set in the 1940’s, “Annabelle: Creation” the prequel to “Annabelle,” which was in turn a spinoff of “The Conjuring,” is the third cinematic outing for the demon-host, a wooden doll made by the doll-maker Sam Mullins( Anthony La Paglia), who lost his daughter in an accident(the only strikingly shocking scene in the entire movie).

His wife Esther (Miranda Otto) has already become a victim of the demonic doll and is now living a secluded mysterious life within the confines of her own bedroom.

The Doll has been cloistered within a closet papered with Bible readings, in their sprawling California farm house for a few years now. And into this set-up they introduce a bunch of six orphans - Prepubescent Polio-stricken and wearing a leg-brace, young Janice (Talitha Bateman), her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), a motley group of pre-teens and their caretaker Nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman).

Could be they thought that inviting strictly catholic folk would absolve them of their descent into evil? But what about the young ones who have basically been set-up for scare-happy voyeuristic entertainment? That the religious Church going Mullins’ put young helpless children in harm’s way is a little hard to stomach.

Returning ‘Annabelle’ screenwriter Gary Dauberman contrives to have Janice curious enough to overcome her fears and investigate the mysteries of the old house, thus laying out the plot points that would eventually lead to her victimisation. Linda is also drawn in while the Nun and her other four wards have their own scary encounters to deal with. And there’s really nothing new to keep you absorbed here.

The fright tactics employed here are not effective enough even though they have old school generic effects written all over them. No doubt Sandberg’s narration follows the genre ritual of terrorising its female characters, but this time they are a little too young to be validated by such impunity!"

Jalandhar, August 22

The decision of the Supreme Court (SC) to ban the controversial practice of instant divorce in Islam has been hailed as a victory by a large number of Muslim women in the city.

Sweets were distributed and “Shukrana namaz” was offered by many women groups in various parts of the city to celebrate this much-awaited decision.

Though many Islamic scholars held the judgment to be confusing and said there should be no interference with personal law of Muslims, women expressed their happiness over it.

According to 27-year-old Sahira (name changed), she, along with her five-year-old daughter, was thrown out of her in-laws’ house in a humiliating manner as her husband wanted a son and when she could not give birth to one, he announced triple talaq for her. “I had nowhere to go as my parents had expired long ago. The decision though came late, but will save many women like me in future to be chucked out from the house for no reason,” said an elated Sahira.

Though triple talaq was banned by most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, the tradition had been continuing in India.

Meanwhile, welcoming the decision, Jalandhar-based Islamic scholar SS Hassan said the Supreme Court has endorsed the teachings of the Koran. “Instant triple talaq was never allowed in Koran. It has to be spread over three months, allowing a couple time for reflection and reconciliation. However, some unscrupulous people were using it on their discretion, which was against the Sharia Islamic law,” said Hassan.

Also calling it half battle won, Hassan said the actual victory against this practice would depend on the law that would be enacted soon by the Union government. “Only the implementation will tell as to how successful the decision was to secure the freedom, rights and equality for Muslim women,” said Hassan."
Kashmir leaders keep mum on SC’s triple talaq judgment,"Apex court lawyer from Valley, women commission head hail verdict

Jammu, August 22

Political leaders in Kashmir on Tuesday maintained a guarded silence on the Supreme Court’s verdict on triple talaq. Otherwise known for vociferously reacting to all national and international issues, the Kashmir-centric parties refused to come on record on the verdict. Even the leaders overactive on the social media preferred to keep mum on the issue due to “political compulsions”. Despite repeated attempts, none of the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party or the National Conference were ready to officially speak on the verdict, which by and large has been hailed by all political parties across the country. In contrast, the Jammu-based parties, including the BJP, reacted quickly to the Supreme Court verdict. BJP minister in the coalition Priya Sethi hailed the verdict as “historic”. “This is the first-ever verdict in favour of Muslim women,” she said, adding that the SC judgment was a victory for all those who believed that personal laws must be progressive and was a step towards gender equality. Chairperson of the State Women’s Commission Nayeema Mehjoor welcomed the verdict, saying that it was high time effective steps were taken to stop exploitation of religion. “I welcome this decision. The verdict has provided a chance to bring reforms in the system,” she said, adding that “it is high time this opportunity was seized to make a comprehensive law on talaq.” Nayeema said the verdict came as a big relief to the women victims of the instant triple talaq and hoped that the Muslim Personal Law Board would bring in reforms keeping in view the prevailing times. She said the verdict had not only provided an opportunity to the government to formulate a comprehensive law by evolving consensus among all political parties but had also given a chance to Muslim clerics to come forward to single out those elements who were exploiting religion. Eminent Supreme Court lawyer from Kashmir Shabnam Lone, while welcoming the verdict, said triple talaq was not only unconstitutional but also un-Islamic, as Islam held women in high regard. She, however, said the court had no power to direct Parliament to formulate a law. “The court can only interpret and verify the constitutional validity of any law,” Lone said."

New Delhi, August 22

The Bawana assembly by-election tomorrow is being keenly contested between three major political opponents — the BJP, AAP and the Congress – with each eyeing a victory hoping to reassert its popularity among residents in the capital.

Nearly three lakh people are eligible to cast votes at 379 polling stations set up across the constituency in Northwest Delhi. Results of the bypoll will be announced on August 28.

Though the AAP enjoys an overwhelming majority in the assembly, a victory in the bypoll would be a shot in the arm for the party after successive setbacks in the civic polls, the Rajouri Garden Assembly by-election and the assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.

The Kejriwal-led party has pitched Ramchandra from the constituency where he will take on the BJP’s nominee Ved Prakash whose resignation from the MLA post and followed by leaving the AAP had actually necessitated the bypolls. Prakash joined the BJP in March this year.

The BJP, which has just four members in the 70-member assembly, hopes to maintain its winning streak in the city while the other major contender Congress is hoping to open its account after being relegated to zero in the 70-member Delhi Legislative Assembly. The Congress has fielded its former three-time MLA from Bawana, Surender Kumar.

EVMs equipped with voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) will be used in the bypoll, as per a statement from the Chief Electoral Officer, Delhi.

The number of male, female and third gender electors are 1,64,114; 1,30,143; and 25, respectively. The average number of voters per polling station stands at 776. Of 379 polling stations in the constituency, 311 have less than 1,000 registered electors, while 68 have more than 1,000 registered electors, it said."
"Saudi-led airstrikes hit Yemen hotel, killing at least 41","Cairo, August 23

An airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition struck a hotel near Yemen’s capital on Wednesday, killing at least 41 people as the alliance stepped up airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and their allies in and around Sanaa.

The escalation comes amid a standoff in Sanaa between the two main components of the rebel alliance, Shiite fighters from the north known as Houthis and loyalists of ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. There are mounting fears of street violence.

There were conflicting reports on the identity of the victims of the hotel strike, with doctors saying they were farmers and officials and witnesses saying they included rebels. The coalition has been battling the rebels, who control Sanaa, since early 2015.

The fighter jets targeted a two-story hotel in the town of Arhab, about 35 kilometers north of the capital, Sanaa, officials said.

Bodies were still being retrieved from the rubble, witnesses said. Another airstrike hit a checkpoint manned by the Houthis, a few kilometers from the hotel, they added.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to reporters. The witnesses requested anonymity for fear of retribution.

Footage of the area aired on al-Masirah TV, a Houthi-run satellite news network, showed bodies hanging out of a simple cinderblock building.

Bystanders wrapped mangled corpses into blankets to try to carry them away.

The TV network said 41 civilians were killed and that the death toll was expected to rise further. Officials and witnesses told The Associated Press that the death toll had reached 60 and that the majority of those killed were Houthis rebels.

Physician Ali al-Rakmi, who was helping with rescue efforts, said there were more than 100 people inside at the time of the attack, all qat farmers. The plant’s leaves are chewed for a stimulant effect, a widespread tradition among Yemeni men.

Al-Rakmi said they had retrieved 35 bodies so far.

Fahd Marhab, head of the Umrah hospital, about 10 kilometres from the site of the airstrike, said there were no wounded and that all the people in the hotel were killed in the 3 am airstrike. He also said that they were mostly farmers.

Conflicting accounts are common in the aftermath of deadly airstrikes.

There was no immediate comment from the coalition.

The Saudi-led coalition is waging an extensive air campaign against the Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh, which together control much of northern Yemen, including Sanaa. They are trying to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

The airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals, and markets, killing thousands of civilians and prompting rights groups to accuse the coalition of war crimes. Activists have called upon Western countries, including the United States and Britain, to cease their military support for the coalition.

The conflict has killed over 10,000 civilians, displaced 3 million people and pushed the impoverished nation to the brink of famine.

The coalition has recently stepped up airstrikes in and around Sanaa, targeting army compounds and other Houthi locations. — AP"

Secure garden,"GROUND REALTY

Jagvir Goyal

A spurt in cancer cases in North India and awareness about the ill effects of excessive use of pesticides has made people look for organic food or make effort to grow their own vegetables. While a company has launched vegetable and fruit purifier which has not been much successful, trend of growing own vegetables is fast catching up in urban areas. ‘Plant to Plate’ is becoming a tagline for the urban elite. As a result everyone wants to have his own kitchen garden, grow vegetables and enjoy healthy and pesticide-free food. As far as one is living on the ground floor, there is no problem in developing a kitchen garden. One can always find a corner or some space in the front or back courtyard to develop the kitchen garden. And there are no structural issues involved. The challenge lies in developing a kitchen garden while living on the first floor or higher elevations, in flats or apartments. Here, the front or back balconies are considered to be most suitable locations for developing kitchen garden because plenty of sunlight and air are available. What is more important to watch are the structural features of the kitchen garden. Let’s have a look at the related engineering aspects of this new trend:

Structural features

Developing a kitchen garden in a balcony or on the terrace means deposition of extra earth load over the balcony or terrace slab. This extra load on the slab causes stresses in it and at the slab supports. Application of water to the plants may cause retention of water on the balcony or terrace leading to dampness in the area. Then establishment of proper drainage system has also to be taken care of. Thus, there are three major structural features: Structural design, water proofing and drainage arrangements. design: The design of the floor slab over which a kitchen garden is to be developed, needs to be rechecked by taking into account the extra load of earth and other items that shall be rested over the slab. Often the weight of earth is counted but the weight of extra pots that are laid there is ignored. Weight of pots is significant and needs to be considered as ‘pointed load’. It is better to use stands for the pots instead of placing them directly on the slab to disperse their load over a wider area.To cause lesser load on the slab, wooden, plastic, aluminium or fibre pots should be selected. The weight of soil should be considered as saturated slab so that weight of water also gets counted. Normally, the thickness of soil mixed with manure layer thickness is 8 inch to 10 inch. By rechecking the design, it should be ensured that the slab and its supports can wear the extra load being put on it without causing any cracks in them. Cantilevers: If a kitchen garden is being developed in a balcony, be extra cautious. Most of the balconies are designed as cantilevers and cantilevers are infamous for their failure in the history of civil engineering. A cantilever is simply projecting from a wall without any other support below it. If the cantilever slab is found to be unsafe for extra load being caused on it, supports below it should be provided before developing kitchen garden in the balcony. It should also be seen that making all this arrangement of extra supports below the cantilever slab is not uneconomical. Waterproofing: Needless to say that waterproofing of kitchen garden slab is as important as its structural design. To provide waterproofing, proper treatment should be given to the slab before laying the garden. The slab surface should be cleaned well with wire brushes and then treated well by applying polymer-based flexible water proofing layers on it. While doing this, if any cracks are noted in the slab, these should be treated well by converting them into small V-shaped crevices and then filling them with a polymer modified mortar. For waterproofing, it is better to lay a layer of 6mm thick 1 : 3 cement sand mortar over the slab after adding waterproofing compound to the mortar. Over the mortar layer, a layer of tiles can be laid in slope as per drainage plan. Drainage arrangement: In case of balconies and terraces, it is common practice to provide proper slope to the slab area during their construction, for drainage of rain water through rain water pipes. A concrete ‘gola’ at the junction of the slab and parapets is also provided in normal practice as these junctions are the vulnerable leakage points. While developing a kitchen garden in balcony or on terrace, a 2 inch thick layer of water-borne aggregate or shingle or pebbles should also be laid over the tiles in the same slope by maintaining the two-inch thickness uniformly so that the slope of tiles is acquired by the stone layer also. This whole system shall provide effective drainage arrangement. All these loads should be considered while rechecking the structural design of the slab. Geo-membrane provision: For creating best kitchen garden arrangement, it is better to lay a thick layer of geo membrane on the tiles before covering them with the pebbles or stones. However, this is optional as the geo-membrane layer will causeadditional cost. Otherwise, a HDPE net layer can be laid over the stones. This geo membrane or HDPE net layer will prove helpful in holding back the soil while excess rain water in balcony gets drained off to the rain water pipes. Next, the soil layer can be laid as the base for it is now ready to receive the soil. The water connection: Provision of a water connection in the balcony or terrace is essential for a productive kitchen garden growing vegetables. Generally, we keep a tap on the terrace or balcony to draw water. Same tap can be used for watering the vegetable plants in kitchen garden. Outsourcing the job: As growing on vegetables is becoming a craze among people, many companies who undertake development of kitchen garden now exist in every city. An online search will tell you about their existence. And howsoever small space be available with you, they would develop your kitchen garden in it. Even a 4 x 4 feet space is converted by them. Contact them and assign them the job. However, just ensure that all structural aspects are taken care of and joy of having a kitchen garden is not marred by structural cracks or dampness or leakage or failure of balconies. — The writer is former HoD and engineer-in-chief, civil engineering department in

Trump was a ‘creep’ during our prez debates: Hillary Clinton,"New York, August 23

Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called US President Donald Trump a “creep” in her new book, saying he made her “skin crawl” at a debate during their bitter presidential campaigns.

She says Trump made her feel ""incredibly uncomfortable"" and was breathing down her neck, while pacing behind her.

Both candidates traded insults during the 2016 vicious campaign, and President Trump still uses the nickname ""Crooked Hillary"" to describe the former first lady.

Reading an extract from her forthcoming book 'What Happened' on US news network MSNBC, the 69-year-old former US secretary of state said she did not know how to react as they took to the stage for their second presidential debate last October.

""Do you stay calm, keep smiling, and carry on as if he weren't repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly: 'Back up you creep, get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women, but you can't intimidate me, so back up.'""

The debate took place just days after a 2005 recording was made public, in which Trump bragged of grabbing women by their genitals and getting away with it because of his status.

After an uproar, Trump, 71, apologised and dismissed the conversation as ""locker-room talk"".

In her forthcoming book, Clinton says this made her feel even more uncomfortable on the night.

""This is not OK, I thought,"" she writes. ""It was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me. Two days before, the world heard him brag about groping women,"" she says.

""Now we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces,"" Clinton says.

She says she chose to respond by gripping her microphone tightly, but she sometimes wonders if she should have told Trump to back off.

""It certainly would have been better TV,"" she says.

""I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off [...] Maybe I have overlearned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world,"" she adds. — PTI"
A plea for proportional representation,"CP Bhambhri

To keep 160 million Muslims of India out of elected assemblies is dangerous politics. The system of proportional representation to state assemblies can ensure the active participation of Muslims in democratic politics. It can enable them to become stakeholders in mainstream democratic politics.

CP Bhambhri

INDIA has held 14 Lok Sabha elections and innumerable elections for 29 state assemblies and seven Union Territories on the basis of the progressive system of universal adult franchise, under the supervision of constitutionally created “neutral” Election Commision (EC) The EC has conducted regular elections by following a simple first-past-the post system in which any candidate or party which secures a simple majority of votes polled is declared elected. The Constitution makers had modified this system of elections by introducing a system of reservations of seats in elected representative legislatures by fixing a quota of 15 per cent for the Scheduled Castes and seven and half per cent for the Scheduled Tribe population. This can be described as an Indian variant of the system of proportional representation for defined vulnerable minorities or specific deprived social groups. Seats are allocated on the basis of proportion of the percentage of the total population of these groups. It is a historical legacy that the implementation of proportional representation (PR) is called the system of “reservations” or “quotas” for SCs and STs in representative assemblies. The Constitution makers stopped short of extending this special reservation to the Muslim community in spite of the fact that Muslims had many apprehensions while opting for Indian citizenship after the creation of Pakistan in 1947. Muslims of India constituted the largest minority community and had several doubts about their future life with dignity in a Hindu-majority country. The inter-community relationship between Hindus and Muslims was vitiated by post-Partition violence. Even saner elements in this atmosphere of violence were haunted by the reality of post-Partition independent India. A few Muslim members, along with some other members of the Constituent Assembly like KT Shah or DH Chandra Sekhariya, raised the demand for proportional representation of seats in the Parliament and state legislative assemblies. In every democracy, minorities have expressed reservations about first-past-the-post electoral system of voting because a single vote for every citizen and a simple majority for an elected representative can result into the rule by ""majority"" and the marginalisation of ""special minority communities"". Every important theoretician of liberal representative democracy has been compelled to grapple with the issue of protection of special minority communities because the first-past-the-post system can lead to brute majoritarianism of religious or racial majority groups. The debate on the electoral systems in various democracies in Europe has continued till the end of the 20th century. European democracies have followed either the first-past-the-post or proportional representation in elections to deal with the problems faced by minorities in specific countries. England follows the first-past-the-post system. Present Germany and many European democraciesduring the inter-war period followed some kind of proportional representation to ensure that every special social group was represented in the legislatures French writer Maurice Duverger in his classic, Modern Political Parties, published in the early 1960s, grappled with the merits and demerits of these two electoral systems because his own country and other European countries during the post-War II phase of reconstruction of democratic political systems were discussing which electoral system would be most suited to the requirements of a plural society. Therefore, it was not unusual for the Indian Constituent Assembly to debate and resolve the issue of allocation of seats on the basis of proportional representation for a religious minority community in legislatures. Had the Constitution makers not conceded the principle that special problems faced by Dalits deserve special reservations of seats for SCs and STs in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies? Why not extend this principle to Muslims, the country's largest minority community? The two-nation theory had haunted the Constitution makers, who were suffering from the trauma of the violent post-Partition inter-religious riots. Perhaps, it was considered wise not to concede this demand of Muslims for the fear of opening a pandora's box of social conflicts. The need to reopen the issue of proportional representation and the allocation of seats to Muslims on the basis of their percentage of population in the country has assumed importance because of a fundamental change in the political situation of India, especially after the electoral victory of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014. The ongoing march of the BJP seems unstoppable. Important North Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and north-western states of Maharashtra and Gujarat are ruled by this Hindu political formation. In every northern and north-western state there is a sizeable Muslim minority population that is insecure and feels threatened by the emergence of aggressive forces of anti-Muslim Hindutva. After the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and in elections for the state assemblies, Muslims have been disempowered. The BJP is in government on the basis of the majority of Hindu legislators. Muslim MPs and MLAs do not find any place in the BJP-ruled governments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is supported by 282 Lok Sabha MPs belonging to the BJP and not a single Muslim finds a place in the ruling party. Not only this. The BJP did not nominate a single Muslim candidate for the 2017 UP Assembly elections. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, like Narendra Modi, occupies the highest political office in the state government only on the basis of the elected Hindu legislators of his party. The BJP and the Sangh Parivar maintain that Muslims do not vote for their party. Hence, there is no reason to nominate Muslims as party candidates for elections to the state assemblies. The system of proportional representation is an institutional arrangement where the minority community, as a matter of right, gets an opportunity to show its presence in elected assemblies. There is an apprehension in the minds of many secular-minded democrats that proportional representation may create a wall of separatism between the majority and minority community and it may become difficult to break the barriers between religious communities. The pros and cons of the proportional representation system have to be rationally discussed if the first-past-the-post system is keeping Muslims out of representative assemblies. The only way to bring the Muslim minority community into the democratic process is proportional representation. The present trust deficit between the Hindu-majority party governments and the 160-million Muslim minority community is worrisome. If Muslims are not made to participate in the democratic process, a section among the community may take to undemocratic methods to resolve their problems. In his farewell address, the former Vice President Hamid Ansari brought into sharp focus the ""insecurities"" faced by minorities in 2017 India. Unfortunately, the top BJP leadership, instead of taking Ansari's warning seriously, reacted in a sarcastic manner. A high-level functionary of the RSS/BJP advised Ansari to go to a country where he may feel ""secure"". Ansari's reference was to the present anxieties of the Muslim minority community but the Hindu leaders rejected his opinion contemptuously. Proportional representation is a better option for deepening the democratic process and it can provide rights to a religious minority group to develop stakes in the country's democratic governance.

Joint FIR as modus operandi in all ATM withdrawals is the same

Ludhiana, August 22

Ten cases of cyber fraud, involving the withdrawal of cash from the bank accounts of city-based persons, have come to light. The police have registered a joint FIR at the Model Town police station.

According to sources, a total of Rs 5 lakh (approximate) has been fraudulently withdrawn in these cases.

One of the complainants, Amit Kumar, who works in a private firm here, said he had received a message about withdrawal of Rs 12,000 from his bank account. “I was stunned to see the message because I did not withdraw money. The amount was withdrawn from an outstation ATM booth while the ATM card was in my possession. Someone seemed to have cloned my ATM card,” the victim said.

He said he had recently used his card for buying petrol at Grain Market, and it could be possible that the petrol pump staff had swiped his card on the skimming device. “I have informed the police about it,” he added.

The sources said all those complaints had reached the Police Commissioner for registration of an FIR.

The investigating officer, ASI Dharminder Singh, from the Model Town police station, said since the modus operandi of the cyber criminals was the same in all complaints, the police had registered a single FIR on the basis of a collective complaint. “We are verifying the role of some suspected petrol pump employees and if the police get any clue, legal action will be taken accordingly. So far, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons only,” the ASI added.

The police had nabbed five petrol pump employees for their connivance with a cyber criminal, Mukul."

Activities of an estimated 1.20 lakh followers of Dera Sacha Sauda in the districts of Kurukshetra and Jind are being watched by the intelligence and police forces.

Police sources said nearly 65,000 residents in Kurukshetra district alone were believed to be Dera followers.

Followers, including women, continue to gather at various places in the two districts but no untoward incident has been reported.

Officials in Jind and Kurukshetra said there was no input of anyone engaged in any unauthorised storage of petroleum products, arms or other material.Jind DC Amit Khatri said all seven ‘Naam Charcha Ghar’ (congregation/prayer centre of the Dera) in the district were under observation.

He said people from other sects and communities had also been roped in the peace committee to ensure order in the district.

Khatri said there were nearly 55,000 dera followers spread all over the Jind district. He said the situation was under control. Most of the followers from Jind are heading towards Panchkula where a CBI court is expected to deliver a judgment on Friday, said the DC.

Indian-origin CEO racially abused by Trump supporters in US,"New York, August 23

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump's Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

""After Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don't look like him.""

Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters.

Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should ""get your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.""

The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take ""that other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,"" referring to the US envoy to the UN.

""She's (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don't tell us that you gave him a chance. We don't give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We're going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,"" the woman said.

In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should ""go clean up your own (expletive) country, it's a filthy mess.""

Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said.

""It was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,"" he said. ""I wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.""

""Even though my race is a complete non-issue in my day- to-day life, the sad reality is there's a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,"" he said in the report.

""I wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there's this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected.""

Gandhi added that the fact that Trump ""equated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up"" as he called Trump's moral leadership on the issue ""reprehensible.""

He said while his sharing a ""bigoted"" voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so.

""My heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let's be honest — I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I'm suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don't have resources really are suffering.""

""I know I'm on the right side of history here,"" he said.

Decrypting your home loan eligibility,"Harshil Mehta

Home is where the heart is. Though owning a home may mean different things to different individuals, one thing is common —we all want to own a home. Given the expense involved, most people prefer to avail a home loan to finance this dream, which is one of the most important decisions and undertakings in his life. Applying for a home loan can often seem like a complex process but one must be aware about some of its key aspects. Some important factors to be considered while applying for a home loan are as follows:

Income

This is the most important factor with a strong bearing on home loan eligibility. If the applicant is a salaried employee, then banks and financial institutions will consider his salary and age. This basically means that the loan eligibility will be evaluated on the basis of his income and the number of years the individual has worked. Lenders also reconfirm the individual’s repayment capability and the tenure of his job. One can also club his spouse’s income to enhance his home loan eligibility and can apply for a joint home loan.

Age factor

While applying for a home loan, banks and financial institution check the age of the borrower as this assesses the number of years the applicant would work. It is often believed that a joint home loan is easily available, but this is not the case always. Age of the co-applicant is also vital while applying for a home loan. For example, Brinda Roy, 29 years old takes a home loan with the co-applicant being her mother who is 60+, then the loan tenure will be calculated mainly on the basis of the age of the older person. The tenure of the loan will be restricted from 10-15 years depending on the bank or financial institution. If Brinda was individually applying for a home loan then her eligibility would depend more on her individual credit score than her age.

Debt

If an individual is applying for a home loan with other outstanding loans such as a car loan or personal loan it may affect his home loan eligibility. If one already has an existing home loan with over 12 unpaid instalments, banks and financial institutions generally take this into account while calculating the borrower’s eligibility. In such a situation, it is important to prepay full or half of their existing outstanding loans to improve their eligibility and ensure that their new application for the home loan remains unaffected.

Credit score

To qualify for a home loan, a good credit score is very important which usually ranges from 400 to 900. Banks and financial institutions prefer to lend to borrowers with credit score higher than 750 since it reflects stronger credit worthiness. This gives a clear picture about the applicant’s credit history, past payment behaviour and makes way for attractive interest rates for the borrower. Before applying for a home loan, it is most critical to check eligibility criterion. It is also very important for the applicant to know the amount they are eligible for and at what interest rate, which will help you to optimise chances of loan approval. Additionally, improving one’s loan eligibility will also have positive impacts on one’s personal financial planning and help move towards better financial security in life. The writer is CEO, DHFL.

Life insurance: Key to protection and legacy,"Sujoy Manna

India as a country is extremely emotional and family oriented. Our predecessors used to always save up and postpone their wishes so they could plan well for their loved ones' future. Life insurance also has a lot of sentimental value because it is an effort by the life assured to ensure that his loved ones don't have to suffer after his demise. The financial benefit is reaped only by the family. However, due to definite coverage term of term plans in India, there still remains a risk of the benefits not being transferred to the family in case the life assured outlives the policy term. In such a case, their wish to pass on the planned amount i.e sum assured to the loved ones remains unfulfilled. This gap can be filled by products that offer life-long protection. Such a feature would ensure that the family benefits from the deceased's financial planning after he is not around. Moreover, there would be no term of protection. Even if a person dies at an age of 100, the family would receive this sum, hence making it a part of the legacy left behind. Such a product would be apt for people who not only want to compensate for their income after they're gone but also want to leave a lump sum as a legacy for the comfortable living of the beneficiaries.

Legacy protection

Wealth preservation has gained precedence over asset management in recent times, especially taking into account the economic volatility that is prevalent currently in the global market. This creates a greater emphasis on legacy planning in order to transfer wealth to the next generation. This is what most financial advisers don't tell you when they talk about life insurance - legacy planning. It is a financial tool we ideally don't associate with wealth transference, since most of the time it is only viewed as a tool to secure funds for financial obligations or to replace the family's income. But, inherently, life insurance is a legacy. You leave behind wealth for the generations to come, so that they are financially secure. And you can do all of this without compromising your current lifestyle. In a way, we can call it 'legacy protection'.

Conclusion

Finally, as we mentioned earlier, life insurance gives you 'legacy protection'. In many ways, it protects the legacy that you wish to leave for your loved ones, while at the same time makes sure you don't compromise on your present. It not only protects their financial future, but also makes sure they have enough to leave a legacy of their own. The writer is Vice President -Products, HDFC Life.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
Amendments to deal with today’s ills,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

Is it true that the Reserve Bank of India has amended the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to expand its jurisdiction? If so, can you please give some details?

Yes, the 2017 amendment to the Banking Ombudsman scheme has widened the scope of the scheme and brought under the ambit of the Ombudsman, a number of hitherto excluded issues pertaining to the banking operations.

To be more specific, the amendments finally provide for redress of a large number of highly vexatious problems faced by bank customers in recent years such as fraudulent withdrawal of money through electronic banking as well as stolen and cloned debit and credit cards, besides mis-selling of insurance, mutual funds and other investment products. Similarly, the amendments have also brought under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman issues such as erroneous reporting of credit information to the Credit Information Bureau and the failure to rectify such factual inaccuracies. These are all issues on account of which consumers have for long suffered not just financial loss but also harassment and mental anguish. And in the absence of any redress at the ombudsman level, they have had to fight long battles before the consumer court. Finally, consumers can seek resolution of their disputes in these matters through the Ombudsman.

The revised ombudsman scheme, which came into effect from July 1 this year, includes in the list of ‘Grounds for complaint’, non-adherence to the instructions of the Reserve Bank vis-à-vis mobile banking/electronic banking services in respect of delay or failure to effect online payment or fund transfer and unauthorised electronic payment/fund transfer . Similarly, one can complain against banks for sale of unsuitable, improper financial products such as insurance and mutual funds, besides lack of transparency in such sale and delay in facilitating after sales service.

Another positive change brought about in the Ombudsman Scheme is the provision to award compensation for harassment and mental anguish, besides loss of the complainant’s time and other expenses, up to a limit of Rs 1 lakh. Despite the low limit, I really welcome this because earlier the Scheme provided for such compensation only in cases of credit card operations. So, extending this to all complaints is really good. Second, the compensation awarded for any loss suffered as a direct consequence of the bank’s omission or commission (or the pecuniary jurisdiction to pass an award) has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to 20 lakh.

Are there any pre-conditions that one must remember while filing a complaint before the Ombudsman?

One of the most important conditions is the requirement of the complainant going to the Ombudsman only after exhausting the complaint redress system available with the bank. The Scheme requires the complainant to first write to the bank (preferably the nodal officer) and approach the ombudsman only if there is no response within a month or if the response is not satisfactory. Consumers must remember this because a number of cases before the Ombudsmen are rejected for this reason.

Otherwise, filing a complaint before the Ombudsman is easy — you can even send it electronically. You do not need any lawyer and the process of resolution of the complaint is very simple. First and foremost, the Ombudsman will try to promote a settlement through conciliation or mediation between the parties and if it is agreeable to the complainant, will pass an order. If not, the Ombudsman will pass an award after giving both the parties an opportunity to present their case. One can also file an appeal against the order of the Ombudsman before the Appellate Authority.

The complaint has to be filed before the Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the bank branch concerned is situated. However, in case of credit card and other types of services with centralised operations, a complaint can be filed before the Ombudsman under whose territorial jurisdiction the billing address of the complainant is located. You can get the details of the scheme as well as the addresses of the 20 Ombudsmen in the country from the website of the Reserve Bank of India."

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
Vigilance to seek CM nod for action against two IAS officers,"Sanjeev Singh Bariana

Tribune News service

Chandigarh, August 22

The Vigilance Bureau will seek permission from Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to proceed against two senior IAS officers who allegedly played a major role in illegal allotment of works in the Irrigation Department. The VB had, last week, chargesheeted six engineers and a contractor in the case pertaining to allegedly twisting of e-tendering rules for projects worth more than Rs 1,000 crore to favour a contractor, Gurinder Singh. Indicating the involvement of certain Akali leaders in the case, a senior VB officer said: “Questionable projects of this scale could not have been cleared without the involvement of secretary-level officers and backing of their political bosses. We need the CM’s permission to proceed against IAS officers.” The VB, in its report already submitted for the registration of a case against the contractor and six engineers, including two former chief engineers, said: “Senior government officers misused their official position and connived with Gurinder Singh to cause a huge loss to the state.” The report also said: “The role of senior bureaucrats, who were heading the department at that time, would also be probed thoroughly.” Interestingly, the names of senior officers, who were connected with irrigation projects during the tenure of the previous government, also cropped up in context with opposition to the appointment of Suresh Kumar as Chief Principal Secretary to the CM recently. The VB is also looking into allegations of partiality against Pushpinder Garg, Chief Vigilance Officer of the department, for ignoring complaints against Gurinder Singh. He is said to have “filed” all communication he received seeking a probe into the matter. The role of contractors Pushpinder Singh Sidhu and Khara Contractors, who had allegedly submitted manipulated tenders, is also being probed official sources said."
"AAP, with NRIs’ help, adopts debt-ridden farmers; gives them aid","Varinder Singh

Tribune News Service

Bathinda, August 23

With the help of NRIs, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has come to the rescue of beleaguered families of those farmers who committed suicides due to debt caused by farm loans in Punjab.

The AAP alleged that the Centre and the state government were responsible for the plight of the farmers and farm labourers in the country and have launched “Peedat Kisan Khet Mazdoor Muhim” movement to help them.

Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Wednesday disbursed one-time financial aid of Rs 50,000 each to 20 families whose male members had committed suicides in the Malwa region.

“The party has adopted 50 other such families and they would be given a monthly aid of Rs 2,500 for a period of at least five years from today onwards,” Khaira said.

While, 50 families have been “adopted” by two California-based doctors, Dr Harjeet Singh Gill and Sangram Singh Gill from Jhingar Kalan village near Dasuya, through the AAP, the one-time financial help of Rs 50,000 each for the 20 suicide victim families of the Malwa region has been extended by NRIs based in the US, Canada, the UK and other countries.

Khaira said: “The party is not in a position to get the farm loans waived or to compensate any loss of life, but it has taken an initiative to motivate the NRIs and other people to come and help distressed farmers at a time when the Central and the state governments have “failed” to provide any relief to them.”

“We are not doing a favour on farmers, but it is our duty. There are more than 50 lakh Punjabi NRIs. If each of them comes out with a help of just one dollar they would roughly be contributing a good amount of Rs 35 crore for the help of small and marginal farmers. I urge all NRIs and people belonging to all sections of the society to come forward and help these farmers,” said Khaira after handing over cheques to farm-suicide victims.

He said: “The BJP Government has turned a blind eye towards big industrial houses and influential families who owes Rs 2 lakh crore to banks and financial institutions. But it cannot waive farm loans, which is around Rs 1 lakh crore. If the government can extend special tax concessions to the hill states then why can’t it help farmers.”

Khaira alleged that more than 200 Punjab farmers have committed suicides during the five-month-old Congress rule in the state.

“Farmers and farm labourers are increasing taking to suicide path for they have got frustrated over false promises made by the Congress just for the sake of usurping power in Punjab. Capt Amarinder Singh already knew that Punjab owed a huge Rs 2 lakh crore debt well before the Punjab Assembly polls. Still, he went ahead with his promises of complete waiving of loans of farmers in the run-up to the polls. Now, the Congress is washing its hands off by saying that Punjab has no money for complete payment of farm loans,” Khaira said.

AAP co-convener Aman Arora and MLAs, Prof Baljinder Kaur, Rupinder Kaur Ruby and Najar Singh, were also present."
Soldiering on to Everest,"BOOK REVIEW: NORTON OF EVEREST: THE BIOGRAPHY OF E.F. NORTON, SOLDIER AND MOUNTAINEER

Lt-Gen Baljit Singh (retd)

“They were men, the likes of which we will never know again...... collect butterflies in the dawn, paint watercolours in late morning, discuss Keats and Shelley over lunch and still be prepared to assault the flanks of Everest or indeed the German frontlines, by dusk”. — Dave Wade in the Foreword. The biographer observes that “it was a statistical miracle” for Edward Felix Norton (EFN) to have survived World War I. But even EFN’s climb to the highest on Everest in 1922, even higher in 1924 and his advice to Col John Hunt that culminated in summiting the Everest, an year before his demise, was equally miraculous. EFN’s military career began after graduating from the Military Academy, Woolwich, and posting to the R Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) at Meerut, in 1902. For most part of the next 10 years, he would professionally profit immensely from the Indian Army’s frequent skirmishes with the North West Frontier tribes along the restive Durand Line. A year later, Major Norton would graduate from the Staff College, Camberley , and proceed to France to lead his R Battery, RHA, from the very first battle at Aisne in 1914 on to Marne, Ypres, Loos, Cambrai, Somme, Arras and onward to the last German spring offensive of 1918. His unflagging performance found recognition through conferment of the DSO, an MC and Mentioned in Dispatches for gallantry, thrice. After World War I ended, it was a natural choice to post EFN to the Staff College, as an instructor till 1921. Sometime in February-March 1922, EFN set sail for India once again, but this time as a climbing member of the First British Everest Expedition. On May 19, 1922, George Mallory, Howard Sommervell and EFN reached 26,985 feet height when bad weather forced a retreat. The British returned to the Everest in 1924 and EFN would assume leadership from the ailing Brigadier Bruce. The second attempt by this expedition was launched by EFN and Sommervell on June 4, 1924. Unfortunately, Sommervell’s choking cough so incapacitated him that placing him under the shelter of a rock-spur, EFN proceeded on an incredible solo climb of Everest. EFN’s record of getting to 28,126 ft, without the use of oxygen, wouldn’t be bettered till 1978. But even in Everest fall-out, there was a personal gain for was EFN — his marriage with Joyce, daughter of William Pasteur, a well-known physician throughout Europe and a house-hold name among Alpine climbers. Outside his family, there was not a word about EFN as a talented painter. The world learnt from Joyce during the Alpine Club dinner only in 1991 that EFN had carried a small sketch book on each Everest expedition and executed a few hundred, on-the-spot paintings. Shortly prior to Pearl Harbour, EFN was appointed Lieut Governor and C-in-C, Hongkong, where he earned fresh laurels but had an accidental, near fatal fall which necessitated his evacuation to India. He recouped sufficiently but retired on health grounds in 1942, with the acting rank of a Lieut Gen. Back in England, he would now gracefully oversee the affairs of his beloved R H A, as their Colonel Commandant from 1947 to 1951. The life story of this impressive and intriguing man, Norton of Everest, makes for an engrossing read."

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
The Tribune: Movie Reviews,"Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill.

Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment.

The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill.

Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise.

Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man.

Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed.

The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots.

Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

US Navy sacks Seventh Fleet commander after deadly warship collision,"Tokyo, August 23

The US Navy confirmed on Wednesday it had sacked the commander of its Seventh Fleet after a deadly collision between a destroyer and a tanker off Singapore, the latest of several accidents involving an American warship in Asian waters.

Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin was relieved “due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command”, a navy statement said.

The Navy is undertaking a fleet-wide global investigation after Monday’s incident involving the USS John S. McCain, which left 10 sailors missing and five injured after a gaping hole was torn in the warship’s side.

The Seventh Fleet, headquartered at Yokosuka in Japan, is the centrepiece of the US military presence in Asia, undertaking sensitive missions such as operations in the South China Sea and around the Korean peninsula.

Aucoin, who had held the post since September 2015, had been in the navy for almost four decades and US media reports said he had been due to retire in weeks.

He was replaced by Rear Admiral Phil Sawyer.

Monday’s accident was the second fatal collision in two months - both involving ships from the Seventh Fleet - after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a cargo vessel off Japan in June, leaving seven sailors dead.

There have been four accidents in total in the Pacific this year involving American warships, sparking concerns the US Navy could be overstretched as it tackles China’s rising assertiveness and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

The latest happened before dawn in busy shipping lanes around the Strait of Singapore, leaving a big hole in the hull of the warship and flooding it with water.

A massive search involving planes and aircraft was launched and US Navy divers joined the hunt Tuesday, scouring the ship’s flooded compartments.

The divers had found remains of some of the sailors, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, Admiral Scott Swift, said yesterday without giving further details.

Malaysian authorities, which have deployed 10 ships and two helicopters for the search, also said they found a body and a US Navy helicopter collected it today.

Five countries - the US, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia - are now involved in the search covering an area of about 2,600 square kilometres (1,000 square miles).

The accident happened as the McCain headed for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a “freedom of navigation operation” in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August, sparking a furious response from Beijing.

On Monday the Chief of US Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered commanders within a week to set aside time, perhaps “one or two days,” for crews to sit down together for discussions.

A “comprehensive review” of practices would also begin.

The admiral did not rule out some kind of outside interference or a cyber-attack being behind the latest collision, but said he did not want to prejudge the inquiry.

His broader remarks suggested a focus on “how we do business on the bridge.”

The damaged vessel is named after US Senator John McCain’s father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.

The tanker involved in the collision, which was used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighed over 30,000 gross tonnes, sustained some damage but no crew were injured and it did not leak oil. AFP"
The Guru of light,"The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn this work

Kuldip Singh Dhir

Birth of Guru Nanak marks an enlightening era in the darkest period of medieval India. Nugatory rituals, superstitions, dogmas, fatalistic outlook, caste divisions, gender discrimination and diffidence to stand up against injustice, oppression or tyranny had rendered people hapless invertebrates. He took upon himself the task of redemption from all this as an assignment from the heavens. The motive force for this lifelong mission was his intimate communion with the Ultimate which forms the leitmotif of this biography. This mystic connection becomes apparent for the first time when Nanak disappeared at the Bien river to reappear after three days.

His message was of oneness of the transcendent. He argued politely but compellingly against futile customs and orthodoxy, liberating people from senseless beliefs, hatred, malice, cowardice, immorality, and delusions which had created a plethora of problems. Profoundness of his simple and persuasive teachings had an immediate impact. Extra-ordinary story of the Guru has been told time and again, but it does not take long to appreciate that this narrative is privileged to stand apart. It relates to the reader as much through the emotive word as through scintillating brush-strokes. Its storyline leans on factual details available in the Sikh scripture Vars of Bhai Gurdas, Janamsakhi traditions, Mahima Parkash and Twarikh Guru Khalsa. Sumeet has vetted these with the help of Bhai Vir Singh, Macauliffe, Dr Ganda Singh, Prof Harbans Singh, Dr Gopal Singh, Prof GS Talib, Dr JS Garewal and McLeod.

The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn the leaves of this work. These are based on author’s own paintings and those of renowned artist Devender Singh, who happens to be his father.

These visuals speak in terms of multilayered creativity and boundless imagination, transcending determinate Cartesian barriers of everyday language. Flesh-and-blood characters, hermeneutical implications, mystical aura and creativity coalesce in this text. Abstract depiction of birth of the Guru, his refusal to wear the sacred thread, the Bien episode, discussion with Pir Dastgir and Sidhas, description of the Divine court (Sodar), the celestial song (arti), moods evoked by various Ragas / months of the year, and socio-cultural reality portrayed in the hymns are a testimony to it.

Starting with the birth of the Guru, Sumeet ends the introductory chapter with Nanak preparing for his missionary journeys after the Bein episode. We have a glimpse of his birth place Nankana Sahib, the birth of the extraordinary child, his family, and his father’s efforts to mould Nanak in the social, religious, cultural and educational framework of his times failing badly. The child prodigy astonishes everybody with rational thinking impeachable knowledge and precocious queries. The four chapters that follow present Nanak disseminating his message of oneness of God, dignity of labour, universal love, peaceful coexistence and socially responsible life, couching it in hymns of postmodernist plural tone.

Nanak acknowledges that his message was derived from a divine vision saying: “As the word comes, so do I describe it.” The people and places, customs and beliefs, habits and habitats, flora and fauna, natural environs and landscape, mountains, rivers and desolate lands, ascetic’s yogis and preachers of diverse faiths all come alive as if with a magical touch. He sang the divine praises all along. He often directed his Muslim companion Mardana to play on his rabab as he vividly sang the bani or Divine Word descending upon him from the skies.

Guru’s settled life in Kartarpur, his handing over his mission to Bhai Lehna, anointing him as Guru Angad and an insightful summary of Nanak’s teachings have been taken up next. The last three chapters give us a peep into the mind and message of the Guru by taking up three of his masterpieces, Japji, Asa di Var and Bara-mah. This unique biography combines skillfully narrative with the descriptive, real with the imaginary, and word with the brush-strokes to capture the persona of Guru Nanak."

Gauri Chhabra

One of the quickest growing fields in bio-medical science is that of Genome Sequencing. It deals with the study of biological changes in living organisms. It is the branch of biotechnology that deals with the study of cells, structural and functional unit of living organisms.

Nearly every cell in the human body — from the ones in the fingernails to the ones deep inside the brain-contains a complete set of DNA, the operating instructions that influence everything from a person’s hair colour to susceptibility to disease. For years, doctors have been able to test specific genes to detect the presence of mutations associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. But only recently have scientists been able to map out a person’s entire genetic code, or genome, by sequencing all 20,000 or so genes in one fell swoop. There has been a huge movement in affordable rapid genome sequencing recently and this will produce massive numbers of new genetic data on individuals, as well as populations. The challenge is now on for a new generation of scientists who are able to combine genetics and bioinformatics in an effort to understand how various genomic changes can cause life-threatening diseases such as cancer. This will enable the development of new treatments, through combining drug and gene therapy, along with prevention strategies.

Getting in

If you are interested in getting admission in bachelor courses, you have to complete higher secondary examination with physics, chemistry & biology. The duration of this course is three years. Some colleges also conduct an aptitude test for admission in genetics course.

To get admission in master’s course, you must have done a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field from any recognised college or university. Some institutions also give admission in genetic courses on the basis of the merit list of the qualifying examination.

Career Scape

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors collect and analyse data about patients’ medical and genetic histories. You will also provide information and help families and individuals about the occurrence, risk and minimisation of inherited diseases. You can also have job duties in areas such as administration, research, teaching and lab work. Institutions such as hospitals, universities, laboratories, research facilities and government agencies can employ genetic counselors.

Laboratory Geneticists: These are specialists in genetics with relation to laboratory medicine and DNA testing. You will research genetic material to assist and work for agricultural, pharmaceutical, clinical medicine and law enforcement organisations. Many laboratory geneticists have 4-6 years of postsecondary education, while lab directors may hold either a Ph.D. or an MD degree

Clinical Geneticists: Clinical geneticists are generally licensed physicians, and may also be involved in the field of medical genetics. You can be specialised in areas such as oncology, pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology, and work in hospitals, medical centers or other research centers. In addition, clinical geneticists may manage a team of genetic counselors and work together to help identify and minimise the risk factors for certain hereditary diseases.

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors play a key role in helping patients and their families get the care that’s right for them. Genetic counselors work with doctors and other members of the health care team to help patients understand what their family history means to them, decide what genetic tests to have, and know how to use the test results to make the best treatment choices. This is especially helpful today as medicine becomes more personalised, and treatment plans increasingly are tailored to a patient’s individual needs.

The road ahead

Genetics has become popular, and there are many areas in biology and medicine that require genetics. Therefore, this is one field which offers immense opportunities.

What is Genome Sequencing?

The technique that allows researchers to read and decipher the genetic information found in the DNA of anything from bacteria to plants to animals is called genome sequencing.

Genomics involves measuring everything about a genome and the changes between genomes.

Genome sequencing involves the determination of the order of DNA bases. You may be wondering what makes these bases so important. In a strand of DNA, there are some simple units known as nucleotides. These nucleotides have a 'backbone' that consists of sugars and a phosphate group.

Commonly used techniques in genomics are DNA sequencing, microarrays, and PCR.

Genomics is being increasingly used in medicine to help diagnose disease since an individual’s DNA sequence can provide insights into the potential for developing specific diseases.

Genomics is one of many ""-omics"" disciplines that is becoming more prominent in biotechnology and research as a whole.

Discoveries in this field often allign with innovations in the technologies available to conduct analysis and perform sequencing or assays.

The very basic unit of the human genome is a single DNA nucleotide. This nucleotide is made up of minuscule atoms, which create a challenge for even an advanced microscope to be used for detection. Researchers still, however, need to be able to determine the sequence of bases in DNA.

Chandigarh, August 22

As the defence counsel for the accused in an abduction case questioned the presence of girls at the Night Food Street at 3 am, the Judge asked him what the boys were doing there. Two accused, Rajinder and Taran, were arrested yesterday for forcibly sitting in the car of two women and misbehaving with them in the wee hours of August 20. The two were sent to judicial custody. As the police sought one-day remand for the accused, the defence counsel started questioning the presence of girls in the area at that time. He said, “A question arises as to what the girls were doing there at 3 am”. To this Civil Judge (Junior Division) Suman Patlain said, “What were the boys doing there? Can’t girls feel hungry at night?” She said the parameters had to be same for girls as well as boys. In the wee hours of Sunday, two boys had allegedly misbehaved with two girls after forcibly sitting in their car and asking to be dropped at Sector 17. The duo was arrested under Sections 365, 354 and 34 of the IPC."

Washington

Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make long duration space trips more feasible.

Astronauts cannot take a lot of spare parts into space because every extra ounce adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape the Earth's gravity.

""If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we will need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them. Atom economy will become really important,"" said Mark A Blenner, from the Clemson University in the US.

The solution lies in part with the astronauts themselves, who will constantly generate waste from breathing, eating and using materials.

Unlike people on Earth, Blenner said, spacefarers would not want to throw any waste molecules away.

Researchers are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.

Some essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, have a shelf life of just a couple of years, said Blenner.

They will need to be made en route, beginning a few years after launch, or at the destination.

""Having a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing what they need, when they need it, is the motivation for our project,"" Blenner said.

The biological system includes a variety of strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. These organisms require both nitrogen and carbon to grow.

Researchers discovered that the yeast could obtain their nitrogen from urea in untreated urine. Meanwhile, the yeast obtains its carbon from CO2, which could come from astronauts' exhaled breath, or from the Martian atmosphere.

However, to use CO2, the yeast requires a middleman to 'fix' the carbon into a form they can ingest.

For this purpose, the yeast relies on photosynthetic cyanobacteria or algae provided by the researchers.

One of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers. Those polymers could then be used in a 3D printer to generate new plastic parts.

Researchers are continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerised into different types of polyesters with a range of properties.

For now, the engineered yeast strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients, but the scientists are working on boosting output.

They are also looking into applications here on Earth, in fish farming and human nutrition. For example, fish raised via aquaculture need to be given omega-3 fatty acid supplements, which could be produced by Blenner's yeast strains. PTI"
‘Creamy layer’ income cap for OBCs raised to Rs 8 lakh per annum,"New Delhi, August 23

The income limit defining 'creamy layer' for OBC reservation has been raised to Rs 8 lakh per annum from existing Rs 6 lakh even as the Union cabinet on Wednesday approved setting up of a panel for sub-categorisation within the other backward classes for even distribution of reservation benefits.

The government also ruled out having a relook at the present reservation system.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters here that the Union Cabinet was today formally apprised of the decision to hike the limit for central government jobs.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hinted in Assam recently that the bar defining creamy layer would be raised and the procedure of formally informing the cabinet about the decision was completed today.

The ministry of social justice and empowerment had proposed that OBC families which earn more than Rs 8 lakh per year should be classified as 'creamy layer' — the ceiling which bars members of the other backward classes from availing reservations in employment.

Responding to a question, Jaitley said a proposal to extend the decision to public sector undertakings was under ""active consideration"" of the government.

There had been three revisions of the creamy layer bar.

It was fixed at Rs 1 lakh in 1993 and hiked to Rs 2.5 lakh in 2004 and Rs 4.5 lakh in 2008. The present ceiling of Rs 6 lakh came into being in 2013.

Jaitley also announced the decision of the cabinet to set up a commission to work out sub-categorisation within other backward classes for a ""more equitable distribution of reservation benefits amongst the OBCs"".

He said 11 states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Jammu region only of Jammu and Kashmir have already carried out sub-categorisation of OBCs.

""There will be more equitable distribution amongst the OBCs themselves (of the benefits),"" Jaitley explained.

The proposed commission, to be set up under Article 340 of the Constitution, will submit its report within 12 weeks from the date its chairperson is appointed.

According to a press release issued by the government, the panel will examine the ""extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes and communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list"".

It will also work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters -- in a scientific approach -- for sub-categorisation within such OBCs.

The commission will also undertake an exercise of identifying the respective castes/communities/sub-castes/ synonyms in the central list of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.

Responding to a question, the Finance Minister ruled out having a relook at the reservation system in the country.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had in September, 2015 pitched for a review of the reservation policy, contending it has been used for political ends and suggested setting up of an apolitical committee to examine who needs the facility and for how long.

""Neither there is any proposal before the government, nor would there be a proposal (before it in the future),"" Jaitley told a press conference on cabinet decisions.

He was asked whether the government will review the reservation system as suggested by Bhagwat. — PTI"
Curbing crime — city’s first woman SSP has task cut out,"Amit Sharma

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 22

“Curbing crime against all vulnerable sections of society will be my priority,” said the first woman SSP of Chandigarh, Nilambari Vijay Jagadale, a 2008-batch IPS officer, who joined the UT police today on deputation for three years. Jagadale, who joined amid the recent cases of crime against women, said her focus would not just be on curbing crime against women but on tackling crime against all vulnerable sections, including children and senior citizens. Jagadale said she would seek a report regarding the ongoing investigation into all recent cases of crime against women. Questioned over her plans to check petty crime, including snatchings, in the city, the SSP said a strategy would be made after studying the snatching incidents, particularly the time and areas from where these are reported. “The area will be mapped and a plan made accordingly,” she said. Nilambari, who has served as the SSP in three districts of Punjab -- Fazilka, Pathankot and Ropar, said ensuring transparency and good governance would be among her priorities. The new SSP said she was looking forward to cooperation and suggestions from city residents, which would go a long way in improving policing. “I will revisit the schemes related to community policing, which were introduced by my predecessors,” she said. She also plans to start police-public interaction to bridge the gap and redress grievances of city residents. The SSP held a meeting with all area DSPs and SHOs today and briefed them about fair policing. The SSP said they would ensure that people did not face any problem in getting complaints lodged."
"At Arizona rally, Trump defends response to Charlottesville violence","Phoenix, August 23

US President Donald Trump, surrounded by thousands of supporters on Tuesday, defended his response to the violence at a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, and attacked the media for “giving a platform to hate groups.” Trump told the friendly crowd at the political rally in Arizona that his words in the aftermath of the Virginia event had been “perfect.”

He revved up the crowd with criticism of journalists, who he said did not report what he had said. Many in the crowd turned and pointed at reporters in the room. Some chanted “CNN sucks.” Trump also suggested he might pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

Arpaio, 85, lost a re-election bid last year in the county.

“Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?” Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of “Pardon Joe!” “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One earlier on Tuesday: “There will be no discussion of that today at any point and no action will be taken on that front at any point today.”

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed.

Protesters outside Tuesday’s rally yelled: “Shame, shame, shame” and “No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA” as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: “Build the wall,” a reference to Trump’s pledge to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

Many wore red hats with Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January.

Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday’s event, scheduled for 7 p.m. MST (0200 GMT Wednesday), while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville.

Neither John McCain nor Jeff Flake, Arizona’s senators, was expected to attend the Phoenix event, said a source familiar with Flake’s re-election campaign and published reports, underscoring Trump’s fractious relationship with some in his own party.

Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the rally.

Before flying to Phoenix, the state capital, Trump landed in Yuma, Arizona, near the Mexican border, for a tour of border security facilities. He is seeking congressional funding for the wall he wants built along the border to deter illegal immigration..

A heavy police presence deployed around the Phoenix venue.

Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump’s Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by supporters.

“The president is always welcome in Arizona,” Flake spokesman Will Allison said in an emailed statement.

Flake “hopes the president will speak constructively about moving forward with tax reform, border security, and other important issues facing our country,” Allison said.

Earlier this summer, Flake published a book questioning the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era, making him one of the few party members willing to criticize the president.

Last week, Trump sent a tweet voicing support for Flake’s challenger, Kelli Ward, in next year’s Arizona Senate Republican primary. In the tweet, Trump called Flake “toxic” and “weak.” The president has also made caustic remarks about McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and war hero, who is battling cancer. A spokesman for McCain could not be reached immediately.

The Phoenix event is Trump’s first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election. Reuters"
Warehousing on growth track,"REAL TALK - ANSHUL SINGHAL, CEO, EMBASSY INDUSTRIAL PARKS

In India, there are three to four classes of real estate — residential, commercial, hospitality and retail — which are the main focus areas of private developers. Globally, there is another class called industrial real estate. In fact, in Europe, US, Japan and China, industrial real estate is one of the largest classes of real estate. In India, it is still at a nascent stage. However, people have realised that with the implementation of GST, Make in India and policy-level changes in government, industrial real estate is now opening up to be a profitable sector and a lot of foreign investment is coming in. Tracking the growth opportunities that have emerged post the imlementation of GST The India Warehousing Show was organised recently. This year, Embassy Industrial Parks was associated as the Official VIP Partner of the show. Anshul Singhal, CEO, Embassy Industrial Parks, who was the keynote speaker at the Warehousing Leadership Summit talks about how the industrial segment is going to be the next big thing in Indian realty. Excerpts from an interaction: What are the growth prospects for the warehousing segment in India? India’s logistics and warehousing sector is poised for accelerated growth, led by GDP revival, ramp up in transport infrastructure, e-commerce penetration, the GST implementation, besides several other initiatives like ‘Make in India.’ Indian 3PL market is expected to grow with CAGR of 6 per cent over the next five years. The biggest indicator of its future is that the government of India plans to build multi-modal logistic parks across the country with an investment of Rs 33,000 crore in a bid to bring down costs incurred on logistics, it will also lay low the overall freight cost, reduce vehicular pollution and congestion, and will enable reduction of warehousing costs of the country. How is GST going to benefit this vertical? With the implementation of GST, domestic warehousing industry will see consolidation. Facilities will relocate to consumer-driven and transportation network areas from the current tax-friendly locations. We even expect sectors like e commerce, automotives, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals; FMCG will own/lease larger warehouses at prime locations like Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Already the warehousing activity along the western corridor has moved towards a more systematic mode of operation leading to an inflow of more institutional funding and formal sources of capital. A recent survey about leading warehousing occupiers in the country revealed that consolidation and expansion will be the key theme driving warehousing demand in the region. This will result in increased demand for larger and better quality warehouses leading to the emergence of new warehousing hubs as well as expansion of the existing hubs. The survey also revealed that 30 per cent of respondents said that they will further expand their footprint in the warehousing market of Delhi-NCR alone in the post GST scenario. GST will ensure that India for the first time will be exposed to consolidated large space central warehousing parks instead of the current scattered poor quality stand alone spaces. Which are the key pockets of growth according to you? Modern warehousing facilities that allow for consolidation of distribution hubs will be a vital component in the growth story. Key markets obviously will be close to cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune — that are a mix of consumption centres and have active industrial presence. What are the major challenges that this segment is facing at the moment? Land acquisition is a major challenge for any real estate player. When we are looking at buying 50 acres to 200 acres of land and develop it, we hope for some reforms that make this process for industrial and warehousing purposes a lot easier. Second challenge is approvals. What we have today has definitely improved from what it was five years back and it has become friendlier in the Modi government but I think we have scope for improvement there. The policies can become more user friendly. The important thing to understand here is that the more time approvals take, the more the capital sits idle as we cannot start construction and generate revenues onto the land. What are your group’s expansion plans in this segment? Embassy Industrial Parks aims to build 20 million sq ft of industrial and warehousing space over the next five years across India at a total investment of about $1 billion. Being a forerunner in this sector, Embassy Industrial Park is also one of the few companies contributing to success of Make in India initiative and has signed three MoUs with the State governments. We have already signed lands which are at various stages of acquisition in Chennai, Delhi, Pune, Mumbai & NCR and we are actively working to acquire lands in Gujarat and Kolkata. We have a JV with Warburg Pincus with Warburg is investing Rs 1,000 crore of equity out of the total Rs 1,600 crore of equity investment. Which means we can raise another approximately Rs 4,000 crore as debt, our investment alone will be Rs 6,600 crore in this sector. This totals to $1 billion.

The Tribune,"NEW YORK: An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

New York, August 23

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump's Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

. @RavinGandhi1 I am told on a daily basis to go back to India. Like you, I was born here and proud of my roots. Thanks for speaking out. — Ameya Pawar (@Ameya_Pawar_IL) August 22, 2017

""I recently told the New York Times I was 'rooting' for certain aspects of Trump's economic agenda,"" Gandhi wrote in the op-ed.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""After Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don't look like him.""

Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters. Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should ""get your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.""

The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take ""that other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,"" referring to the US envoy to the UN. ""She's (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don't tell us that you gave him a chance. We don't give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We're going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,"" the woman said. In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should ""go clean up your own (expletive) country, it's a filthy mess.""

Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said. ""It was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,"" he said. ""I wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.""

""Even though my race is a complete non-issue in my day- to-day life, the sad reality is there's a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,"" he said in the report.

""I wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there's this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected."" Gandhi added that the fact that Trump ""equated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up"" as he called Trump's moral leadership on the issue ""reprehensible.""

He said while his sharing a ""bigoted"" voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so. ""My heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let's be honest — I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I'm suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don't have resources really are suffering.""

""I know I'm on the right side of history here,"" he said. ""That's how I sleep at night."" —PTI"

"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","TORONTO: Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

Toronto

Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

The system, built by researchers at University of Waterloo in Canada, analyses images of skin lesions and provides doctors with data on telltale biomarkers of melanoma, which is deadly if detected late, but highly treatable if caught early.

It deciphers levels of biomarker substances in lesions, adding consistent, quantitative information to assessments currently based on appearance alone, researchers said.

In particular, changes in the concentration and distribution of eumelanin, a chemical that gives skin its colour, and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, are strong indicators of melanoma, they said.

The artificial intelligence (AI) system — trained using tens of thousands of skin images and their corresponding eumelanin and hemoglobin levels — could initially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, a significant health-care cost, researchers said.

It gives doctors objective information on lesion characteristics to help them rule out melanoma before taking more invasive action.

""This could be a very powerful tool for skin cancer clinical decision support. The more interpretable information there is, the better the decisions are,"" said Alexander Wong, a professor of systems design engineering at Waterloo.

""There can be a huge lag time before doctors even figure out what is going on with the patient. Our goal is to shorten that process"" Wong added. PTI"
Not just repairing smiles,"ORTHODONTIST

Tanvir Singh

Dentistry is the branch of medicine that is involved in the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions of the mouth and related structures and tissues, particularly in the jaw and facial area. To meet the ever increasing demands of the dental problems dentistry now possesses seven speciality branches amongst them one is orthodontics. Orthodontics deals with the correction of malocclusion and also provides the preventive treatment that can decrease the need of orthodontic treatment. People requiring orthodontic treatment have malocclusion. The malocclusion can be defined as an occlusion in which there is a malrelationship between the arches in any of the planes or in which there are anomalies in tooth position beyond the normal limits. The malocclusion effects oral health, increases prevalence of dental caries and can cause temporoman dibular joint disorders. Good dental appearance makes people confident and people presumed that it is a step towards success. Because of this fact, demand of orthodontic treatment is increasing.

Role and responsibilities

Modern orthodontic practices have grown largely over the past 20 years reducing the procedures of tooth extractions,, For orthodontic practitioners and following and updating themselves with the latest technology can help you deliver an enhanced level of treatment and amazing results. There are no substitutes for the skilled, experienced, and well-trained orthodontic practitioner. The improvements in tools and techniques enable orthodontists to achieve great results with far less discomfort and in a much shorter treatment time than was ever before possible. Ortho treatment needs to consider not only the severity of malocclusion traits, but also age group and dentition period of the children to be treated . This way, treatment initiated early on during the late mixed dentition or at the beginning of the permanent dentition can avoid further damage to the latter.

Assimilating change

The most important changes in the orthodontic industry is self ligating wires that affect tooth movement. Unlike traditional ligating systems, new passive self-ligating brackets use a slide mechanism that opens to allow the provider to place the wire inside and then close it, creating a slot where the wire is free to glide inside. This approach not only reduces friction and pressure, but also results in more effective forces that make treatment more comfortable for the patient. Inspite of the growing needs of orthodontic treatment required number of skilled orthodontists who are able to practice modern orthodontics are very few. Field of orthodontists is a fast growing branch incorporating modern techniques to decrease the discomfort and at the same time provide best results in less time which helps people to achieve the best smile that one can have. — The writer is a practicing Orthodontist"
SC anguished over illegal constructions at Kasauli hotels,"'Will ask these hotels to put a board outside saying anybody staying there is staying at his own risk'

New Delhi, August 23

The Supreme Court on Wednesday vent its ire on the alleged illegal constructions at some hotels in the picturesque Himachal Pradesh town of Kasauli, warning that it would order the owners to put up signboards that the guests would stay there at their own risk.

“We will ask these hotels to put a board outside saying anybody staying there is staying at his own risk,” a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said.

“There is no point in having excess and illegal constructions,” the bench observed while hearing pleas against the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order to demolish or close down several hotels and resorts which were extended illegally without the requisite approvals.

During the hearing, senior advocate Parag Tripathi, representing one of the hotels, questioned the jurisdiction of the NGT to order the closure or demolition of illegal structures.

The apex court said it would hear the pleas filed by some of the hotels and resorts in November.

The top court had earlier granted stay on the NGT's order with respect to some of the hotels and resorts there subject to the condition that they would not use the alleged unauthorised constructions.

The NGT in its order had directed demolition of the temporary structures of various hotels, including Kasauli Regency, Bird's View Resort, Chelsea Resorts, Hotel Pine View, Narayani Guest House, Hotel Nilgiri, Hotel Divsikha and AAA Guest House.

It had also imposed hefty fines on several hotels for causing irretrievable damage to the ecology, polluting the environment and raising unauthorised constructions.

The NGT's order had come on a plea by the Society for Preservation of Kasauli and its Environs (SPOKE), an NGO.

The apex court had earlier observed that norms were not followed in the construction of some resorts and hotels in Kasauli. — PTI"
Tobacco users prone to poorer academic performance,"Kochi

A study that surveyed more than 7,500 high school and higher secondary school students in Kerala's Ernakulam district has found that tobacco users are prone to poorer academic performance.

It also proves that tobacco is a 'gateway drug', one that leads users to other potent drugs.

Lead author Dr TS Jaisoorya said in a release that they took up the study to evaluate psychological issues among school going adolescents who often have multiple vulnerabilities.

A high 76.3 per cent of lifelong tobacco users — those who had smoked or used smokeless tobacco throughout their life — had failed in a subject compared to 57 per cent of non-users, the release said.

Further, 24.7 per cent of such users had failed a year of studies as against 9.1 per cent non-users.

The study also found that tobacco users had significantly higher usage rates of alcohol and illicit drugs.

Alcohol use among lifelong tobacco users was found to be 67.8 per cent as compared to 11 per cent in non-users.

In the case of illicit drugs, the rates of use were 33 per cent versus 6.1 per cent in tobacco users and non-users, respectively.

These findings recently published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research are part findings of the larger study looking at psychological issues among adolescent school students, done by the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS).

The National Health Mission (Kerala) and Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Kerala also associated with the study.

In what could be good news to enforcement officials, the study reports decreasing trend of tobacco use among adolescent high school students compared to previous studies done among students in South India, and in Kannur district.

In the survey, 6.9 per cent students reported having used tobacco in any form, with the proportion of males using tobacco being 12.5 per cent and females 1.2 per cent.

Most users still initiated early with the mean age of initiation among users being 14 years.

Further, a majority of users (67 per cent) were using it hazardously in their school years signifying that they had a very high risk of progression to addiction, the release said. PTI"
"Indian-origin former CEO charged with fraud, ordered to pay $294,000","New York, August 22

An Indian-origin former CEO of a penny stock company, charged with making false claims in press releases and engaging in manipulative trading, has been ordered to pay a hefty fine of USD 294,000. Adesh Kumar Tyagi was the former CEO, sole director, and majority shareholder of Systems America, subsequently renamed Cloudeeva. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) obtained a final judgment against Tyagi who had been charged with making false claims in press releases and engaging in manipulative trading in company stock. The final judgment, entered by consent on August 17 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, permanently enjoins Tyagi from violating federal securities regulations and imposes a conduct-based injunction. In addition, the final judgment orders Tyagi to pay approximately USD 294,000 in disgorgement and interest. The court’s entry of judgment against Tyagi resolves this litigation in its entirety. The SEC’s complaint had alleged that Tyagi falsely claimed in press releases he issued between July 2010 and September 2011 that the company had hundreds of customers and supported customer operations in nearly 20 countries when, in fact, the company had only two main clients in 2010 and did not support operations in any foreign countries in 2010 and 2011. Tyagi also allegedly falsely claimed in an initial disclosure he published on behalf of Systems American in 2010 that he was not a party to any material litigation. He claimed that no officer or director of the company had been named as a defendant in a criminal proceeding, when he had been named as a defendant in two pending criminal proceedings. Tyagi had pleaded guilty in November last year to certain aspects of the misconduct at issue in the SEC’s complaint. PTI"

Jind DC Amit Khatri said all seven ‘Naam Charcha Ghar’ (congregation/prayer centre of the Dera) in the district were under observation. He said people from other sects and communities had also been roped in the peace committee to ensure order in the district.

Khatri said there were nearly 55,000 dera followers spread all over the Jind district. He said the situation was under control.

Most of the followers from Jind are heading towards Panchkula where a CBI court is expected to deliver a judgment on Friday, said the DC.

However, official sources said the Dera followers had specific instructions to gather in a larger number in Panchkula and Sirsa, where the controversial Dera is headquartered.

Meanwhile, Kurukshetra SP Abhishek Garg said the deposition of firearms with the police was satisfactory and the police were fully geared up for to handle any situation. Garg led a flag march in the district this afternoon that passed through various towns."
The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Beep, beep, cut, cut… as long as the lord of controversies Pahlaj Nihalani remained at the helm of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he and the films he censured/censored made headlines.

Nihalani's exit and lyricist poet and ad guru Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the new CBFC chairperson is indeed not just a routine change of guard. There is much to read here, may be a lot to cheer, if Nihalani’s words “god bless those who are celebrating my departure” are to be taken seriously for once. If there was little doubt about Nihalani’s absurd ways of working, there can be no questions about Joshi’s finesse as a poet and sensitivity as a writer. But can one man’s elevation and another’s sacking be the answer to all issues that ail filmmakers?

Director Hansal Mehta, whose film Aligarh ran into trouble with the CBFC, doesn’t think it’s fair to put the blame of all that’s wrong with the outdated cinematograph Act on just one person. Certainly tempers ran high when Mehta’s Aligarh, a film on homosexuality, was given an adult certificate, stalling possibilities of the film’s promotion. Time and again producers or directors found themselves at the receiving end. The list of movies that had to bear the brunt of CBFC, running in hyperactive mode under Nihalani, is endless: Udta Punjab, Spectre, Lipstick Under My Burkha, Babumoshai Bandookbaz…. Rare was a film that did not have a run in with the man obsessed with sanskar, Indian ethos and values. Lip locks, abuses, use of words like intercourse… anything and everything even a reference to a city or state could raise his hackles.

But with Nihalani out of sight, Mehta can perhaps rationalise that may be Nihalani was just implementing rules, or following the information and broadcasting ministry orders. If the latter is true, uneasy lies the time ahead. Ashoke Pandit, former member of CBFC (during Nihalani’s tenure) however, is more scathing in his assessment. He believes, “Rules were merely a fig leaf with which Nihalani tried to cover his misdeeds. Which rules say there had to be a banned list of cuss words? Or that words like Kanpur and Kishore Kumar can't be referred to. Nihalani wanted directors to make films as per his individual sense and sensibility. Which filmmaker would agree to that?” Besides, he reminds that the same films he censored were ultimately either cleared by FCAT or the courts.

Pandit believes Joshi is the right man for the job. “In sync with today's times, Joshi understands the world cinema and has worked with the very best makers in the country.” Mehta, however, feels that the CBFC should not be personality driven, instead be guided by crystal clear guidelines. That’s precisely why he would not jump the gun and hail the newly constituted CBFC as the panacea.

Actor Aahana Kumra stands pleased and fearless like the bold character she played in Lipstick Under My Burkha, the film that was even denied certification and is rumoured to be the real trigger for Nihalani's ouster. She says, “I am hopeful that with Joshi as the chairperson and actors like Vidya Balan on the board, path-breaking films, especially women centric subjects, will be viewed favourably.” Producer director Prakash Jha who has been at loggerheads with the CBFC has only one word answer — no censorship.

Is absence of censorship a guarantee of good cinema? May be not… after all there is censorship in Iran and the country's makers have been producing world-class cinema. In a democracy that India is, artists feel strongly against censorship which they insist connotes backwardness, just as George Bernard Shaw would say, “The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.”

Whether Joshi can ensure that scissors are laid to rest remains to be seen. Right now Joshi, too, doesn't have the answers, only claims to have the right intent. And that's what really matters feels Pandit. “If Nihalani had the inclination to change, instead of bothering about nitty-gritties, he would have worked towards implementing Benegal committee recommendations which have been around for a year now.” Mehta is not sure whether the Benegal committee guidelines are a fit-all solution or that there can be a please-all policy. But Pandit reasons, “If implemented, Benegal guidelines would be a good start for sure.” Propelled by Joshi’s vision who clearly doesn’t endorse micromanagement, he foresees happy times for the Indian cinema. Round one of sniping and snipping may have lasted too long but for now votaries of cinema seem to heave a sigh of relief and reassurance."

Nair’s 90 helps India A clinch series-levelling win in South Africa,"Potchefstroom, AugUST 22

Skipper Karun Nair anchored a tricky chase with a polished 90 as India A beat South Africa A by six wickets in the second Test to level the two-match series 1-1. Chasing a target of 224, India A took 62.3 overs to cross the line as Nair got rid of his wretched form, hitting 13 boundaries in his 144-ball knock. Opener Ravikumar Samarth (55) hit his second half-century of the match and added crucial 74 runs for the third wicket with Nair. The 93-run stand for the fourth wicket between Nair and Ankit Bawne (32) sealed the game for India. When Nair was finally dismissed, India needed just two runs for victory. It’s the bowlers, however, who deserve more credit for setting up the victory as they dismissed South Africa for just 177 runs in their second innings. Right-arm pacer Ankit Rajpoot (3/15) and left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem (3/47) were the most successful bowlers for India. Brief scores: South Africa A: 322 and 177 (S Cook 70; S Nadeem 3/47, A Rajpoot 3/15); India A: 276 and 226/4 (K Nair 90, R Samarth 55). — PTI"
What’s on the mind of Dera Premis flocking to Panchkula,"A sea of Dera Sacha Sauda followers has swarmed Panchkula in the past two days. Despite the hurdles created by police and civil administration of Punjab and Haryana along the routes leading to Panchkula, the number of the followers continues to swell. Braving the early-morning rain with bags slung across their shoulders, these followers walk all the way from Zirakpur to Panchkula, past numerous police blockades.Soni, a young woman, who has come here along with five other women from her village near Ambala, says they were asked to alight from the bus by Punjab Police at a naka near Banur. “But we had to be here for our guru. So we walked and walked. Five hours and 10 check points later, we reached here,” she says.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

As the followers, also called Premis, wear a pendant around their necks, with Insaan inscribed on it, they can be easily spotted in a crowd. With the administration using this identity to prevent followers from reaching here, some of them claim to have removed the pendants to avoid identification and come here. Ram Kumar of Pakka Saharna village in Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, says till he reached Bathinda on a train, there was no problem. “Then I learnt that the police were trying to identify dera followers and immediately put my pendant in my pocket. That’s how I managed to reach Zirakpur on Tuesday night. From there I walked all the way to Panchkula,” he said.



Pressure-building tactic?

Is it just a matter of faith? Or is it an organised pressure-building tactic by the politically astute Dera head? As The Tribune went about getting a ground report on what drives these people to leave the comfort of their homes and converge on the roads, we found it was a combination of both. These followers--which the Panchkula administration claims to be more than one lakh now--have received messages by word of mouth for converging here. Driven by their faith in the dera head they carry some eatables, a bottle of water and a small bedspread. Sitting on the beadspreads, they are least bothered about their meals. “Though Premis from villages in Dera Bassi and Lalru are getting langar for us, it’s not a big deal for us to stay hungry for a few days for our Pitaji,” says Ram Singh, who has come from Fazilka, adding that they won’t let their guru’s name being sullied like this.



Veiled threat

The threat, though veiled, of taking things in their own hands in case of a verdict against the Dera chief, is definitely there. No wonder a team of officials led by Panchkula DC Gauri Parashar and ADC Rajesh Jogpal was seen visiting the followers and requesting them to maintain peace. Apprehending trouble, even the umbrellas of these followers have been confiscated even as cops continue to stand guard outside most parks and marketplaces of the town. The tension in the air is palpable. Balbir Singh of Bhagtanwala near Bathinda, says the problem is more political in nature. “It irks the political powers that our Pitaji has such a cult following, and the politicians have to go to him begging for votes during each election. That’s why they are trying to discredit him through this “fake” case. But we will not keep quiet,” he dares, even as a fellow Premi cautions him against “revealing much” to the media. “We are fighting against the lies spread by the powers that be.” These followers also draw solace from the fact that many among the lower ranks of police are their fellow Premis, so police action, if any, would not be that grave. Raj Kumar, who has arrived here from Hisar, says though the private vehicles in which the Premis were coming were impounded for being overloaded, these cops let them pass through many check posts."
AI system to help detect skin cancer in early stages,"Toronto

Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

The system, built by researchers at University of Waterloo in Canada, analyses images of skin lesions and provides doctors with data on telltale biomarkers of melanoma, which is deadly if detected late, but highly treatable if caught early.

It deciphers levels of biomarker substances in lesions, adding consistent, quantitative information to assessments currently based on appearance alone, researchers said.

In particular, changes in the concentration and distribution of eumelanin, a chemical that gives skin its colour, and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, are strong indicators of melanoma, they said.

The artificial intelligence (AI) system — trained using tens of thousands of skin images and their corresponding eumelanin and hemoglobin levels — could initially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, a significant health-care cost, researchers said.

It gives doctors objective information on lesion characteristics to help them rule out melanoma before taking more invasive action.

""This could be a very powerful tool for skin cancer clinical decision support. The more interpretable information there is, the better the decisions are,"" said Alexander Wong, a professor of systems design engineering at Waterloo.

""There can be a huge lag time before doctors even figure out what is going on with the patient. Our goal is to shorten that process"" Wong added. PTI"

CM flouting foreign travel ‘ban’: Khaira,"Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 22

Leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Khaira said today that Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh was setting a wrong precedent by undertaking a foreign tour less than six months after assuming office. “The Congress had mentioned in its election manifesto that all ministers, MLAs and officials would not go abroad at the state government’s expense during the first two years. The Chief Minister seems to have forgotten this pre-poll promise,” Khaira said. Capt Amarinder will lead a delegation of officials, farmers and industrialists for WATEC-2017, a conference being hosted by Israel from September 13 to 16. “Trips by then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal to Israel during the Akali-BJP rule didn’t yield much,” the Aam Aadmi Party leader added. The two-year foreign travel ‘ban’, aimed at cutting government expenditure, has a rider. Overseas trips can be undertaken “in cases where it is so mandated or provided under any bilateral arrangement or agreement”. Raveen Thukral, media adviser to the CM, said: “During a recent meeting, Israeli envoy Daniel Carmon invited Capt Amarinder to visit his country. Punjab is keen to use Israeli expertise to promote horticulture, dairy farming, bee-keeping, irrigation and water conservation.”"
Social & sensible,"Tushar Tyagi, whose 15-minute film Kaashi is about the struggle of a poor girl to afford a toilet, believes movies can create mass awareness

Amarjot Kaur

As an independent filmmaker, 28-year-old Tushar Tyagi picked up two of Narendra Modi’s social campaigns, including Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, for his up and coming film Kaashi. Despite these excessively advertised campaigns by the government and now in the mainstream cinema with the movie Toilet, Tushar has no inhibitions calling his film the government’s mouthpiece, “but that’s only if it does contribute something to the society. The subject comes from my personal experiences and observations. Also, I am not taking sides,” he makes it clear. “Kaashi is a 15-minute film about the struggle of a girl from a family too poor to afford a toilet and how she manages to collect enough money from cash prizes she wins at school competitions, like racing, painting, and sewing. It’s from this that she gets a toilet constructed at her house,” he says, sharing that in the film, Urvashi Singh plays the lead role of Kaashi, and Ishrat Khan plays the role of her mother. “Also, the language the film’s shot in is UP’s regional dialect—what they call khadi boli.”

Pursuing a passion

Tushar says that he studied film direction and filmmaking from New York Film Academy soon after he completed computer engineering from the College of Engineering, Roorkee in India. His first film Gulabee, which he made during his course at The New York Film Academy, won a total of 24 awards, including Royal Reel Award at Canada International Film Festival, a special mention at Dada Saheb Phalke film festival, and Jury award at Richmond international film festival. “Like every Indian parent, my father wanted me to become an engineer, that’s why I took to engineering initially. Also, for my second film Hari, I won the honourable mention at La short award, the Jury prize at Woods Hole Film Festival and Award of recognition at Hollywood international moving picture film festival,” he adds. His recent film A Broken Egg won the audience award at NYC Indie film awards.

The inspiration

It wasn’t just the idea of going back to his roots that propelled Tushar’s intention to make Kaashi. Much of his inspiration comes from his childhood memories of visiting his maternal village during summer vacations. “I would visit my grandparents at a village called Nawali in UP, near Moradabad. I would see a lot of people doing their business in fields near the village and my grandfather would drive with his vehicle’s lights switched off. When I went there last year, I found that nothing had changed after all these years. That’s when I decided to make a film, which is shot in the same village,” he says. Elaborating on the making of Kaashi, Tushar says that he shot the film with a team of 20 people, some of who he had flown in from Mumbai, and he started the shooting in November last year. Presently, he is in talks with regional ministers so that his film is shown in different villages. “Movies can create mass awareness and they travel fast. At this point and time, the film is travelling in the film festival circuit,” he signs off.

Railway board chairman AK Mittal quits; AI’s Ashwani Lohani to take his place,"Air India chief Ashwani Lohani was on Wednesday appointed chairman of the Railway Board, after incumbent AK Mital resigned following two recent train accidents, officials said.

The announcement by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet came hours after Union Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu indicated he had offered his resignation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the accidents.

""Necessary communication in this regard has been sent to the Ministry of Railways,"" the appointments committee said.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Senior IAS officer Rajiv Bansal will take over Lohani's role at Air India.

An officer of the railway mechanical service who had earlier served as the divisional regional manager in Delhi, Lohani was also the India Tourism Development Corporation chairman and headed the Rail Museum in the Capital.

Mital, a 1976-batch officer of the Indian Railway Stores Service, submitted his resignation to Prabhu last evening and it was accepted this morning by the minister, officials said.

Two days before he retired in 2016, Mital, said to be close to Prabhu, was given a two-year extension. He was scheduled to retire in 2018 and would have been the longest serving chairman of the Railway Board if he had continued.

Senior railway officials said Mital was not happy that senior officials of the ministry had to face the brunt of the outfall of the Utkal Express derailment. A day after the accident, Prabhu had sent three senior officials, including a member of the Board, on leave.

Mital, who previously headed three major railway zones – Southern Railway, South Central Railway and Central Railway as general manager -- felt the action against the officials ""affected the morale of the seniors"".

Ministry sources said there was ""high drama"" after Mital's resignation, with board members requesting him to reconsider his decision.

They said some senior officers approached Prabhu, who said the matter no longer concerned his ministry alone.

Sources also said the PM had a meeting with Prabhu and senior rail officials on Wednesday afternoon, when he made it clear that seniors would be held responsible for such lapses.

Prabhu was also asked to toughen his approach towards bureaucrats, the source said.

They added that three other people were in contention for the post of the board chairman. They were Ghanshyam Singh, (Member, Traction), Mohd Jamshed (Member, Traffic) and Ravindra Gupta (Member, Rolling Stock).

However, it was Lohani who was finally chosen for the post.

Around 100 passengers were injured as ten bogies of the Kaifiyat Express derailed in the Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh early today, four days after 13 coaches of the Utkal Express went off the rails near Khatauli in UP, killing 22 people and injuring 156.

In the last five years, nearly 53 per cent of the 586 train accidents have been caused by derailments. The worst such accident occurred in November 2016 when 150 passengers were killed when the Indore-Patna Express derailed near Kanpur.

PV Sindhu advanced to the pre-quarterfinals after defeating South Korea’s Kim Hyo Min in the second round of the World Championships here today. Sindhu notched up a 21-16 21-14 win over Kim in a 49-minute match to extend her head-to-head record against the Korean to 4-1 in five meetings. The 22-year-old, who received a bye in the opening round, will face either Russia’s Evgeniya Kosetskaya or Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi, the 13th seed, in the next round. B Sai Praneeth also registered a straight-game win over Hong Kong’s Wei Nan to reach the second round of the men’s singles event. Praneeth, seeded 15th, fought back from 5-9 and 14-16 down in the opening game and then erased a deficit of 10-13 and 15-17 in the second game to see off Wei Nan 21-18 21-17 in a 48-minute match. The 25-year-old Hyderabadi will next take on Indonesia’s Anthony Sinisuka Ginting, who is the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics and Junior World Championships bronze medallist. “I was expecting a tough match.

India’s top mixed-doubles pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy, seeded 15th, defeated Indo-Malaysian combo of Prajakta Sawant and Yogendran Khrishnan 21-12 21-19. However, there was disappointment in store for India in the other mixed-doubles matches as B Sumeeth Reddy and Ashwini Ponnappa, and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Maneesha K suffered contrasting losses to bow out of the event. Reddy and Ashwini went down fighting 17-21 21-18 5-21 to the Chinese pair of Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping, while Rankireddy and Maneesha lost 20-22 18-21 to Denmark’s duo of Mathias Christiansen and Sara Thygesen.

The last time Sindhu had faced Kim, at the 2016 Australian Open, she had suffered a straight-game defeat. The Indian came out firing on all cylinders today as she dished out a dominating game to zoom to a 8-0 lead in the first game. Kim won four straight points but the Indian grabbed a comfortable 11-5 lead. The Korean reduced the gap to 8-12 after the break but a determined Sindhu continued to move ahead and reached 16-10. She eventually took a 20-14 lead. Kim saved two game points before the Indian sealed the opening game. In the second game, Sindhu opened up a 8-3 lead. The Korean managed to reduce the margin to 8-10 but the Indian did not allow Kim to take the lead. Eventually, she took the game 21-14.

Jayaram wins

Experienced shuttler Ajay Jayaram also produced a dominating performance to storm into the second round with a 21-14 21-12 win over Austria's Luka Wraber. The women’s doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and N Sikki Reddy defeated Indonesian-Malaysian combo of Ririn Amelia and Anna Ching Yik Cheong 21-15 21-13 to start on a bright note. —PTI"
When stalking goes beserk,"GOOD MOTORING

Several things can go wrong on the road. You must know how to counter these

H. Kishie Singh

There was a very unpleasant ‘happening’ in Chandigarh recently: the Varnika episode. However, there are some important lessons to be learnt. The one thing that stands out is that Varnika Kundu is a very brave girl. But what saved the day was the girl’s presence of mind. That is the first lesson. Had Varnika panicked for one moment, the outcome would have been very different. According to media reports, the situation was extreme: two drunken goondas out for fun. Even under such a life threatening situation, Varnika followed a set procedure. The goondas allegedly followed her car and then drove alongside. Frightened and alone, she made all the right moves. She zig-zagged through the sectors — this is called evasive action. She was trying to get on to Madhya Marg when the goondas blocked her way. She reversed and zoomed off. They followed her. When she got to the next traffic light, a goonda got out again, banged on her window and tried to open the door! The police were waiting at the red light and nabbed the man in action. While being chased, she had the presence of mind to call the police. Another lesson learnt. Keep your phone handy, within easy reach. Make sure the last call was to the police before you start driving so you don’t waste time in scrolling. Do this before you start driving. Make sure your seat belt is on. Even if the goonda does manage to open the door and tries to drag you out, the seat belt will defeat his nepharious designs. Here is another very effective safety device. An after sales fitment is a remote open-lock switch. When the car reaches 20 kmph, all four doors lock automatically. Also, worth taking up is the fact that women have a habit of leaving their bags on the seat, where it is easily visible. Better keep it on the floor boards, out of sight. If in full view, the street urchins will not hesitate to open the door at a red light, grab the bag and disappear! A pepper spray is another effective deterrent. It should be instantly available at hand. Speed of action is your weapon. Even if the goonda opens the door or shatters the glass, welcome him with a blast of pepper spray. Blinded and in pain, he will stagger away. This is all the time you need skedaddle. Another deterrent you need is a whistle, easily bought at a children’s store. A shrill blast, continuous or spasmodic, establishes authority. It also alerts people of the danger and draws attention. If you are driving late at night, put it around your neck. Even if you are separated from your cell phone and pepper spray, this will be in easy reach and ready to use. A shrill, ear-splitting shriek from the whistle will stop the goonda in his tracks. The cell phone and pepper spray should be in a secure place. All cars have cubby holes for easy storage. Don’t put them on the passenger seat next to you. Should you have to slam on the brakes, these items will go flying onto the floor boards. If you have to fumble, the goonda will have the upper hand. There are so many things that can go wrong. Think about them and how to counter them. Goondas are bullies. The minute they face resistance, they crumble. Learn from Varnika, girls, and feel proud. Chandigarh has given you a braveheart!

"Boycott makes racist remark, apologises","London, August 22

Controversial England batting legend Geoff Boycott made a grovelling apology on Tuesday for remarking he needed to “black up his face” to get a knighthood at an event last week. The 76-year-old astonished his audience with his comment during a question and answer session in one of the intervals at last week’s first Test between England and West Indies. Boycott, who played a pivotal role in organising the 1982 England rebel tour of South Africa when its sporting links had been cut with the rest of the world because of the apartheid regime, said knighthoods had been bestowed on West Indian cricketers like “confetti”. “Mine’s been turned down twice. I’d better black me face,” Boycott is reported to have said according to a guest at the event cited by The Daily Mirror.

"Talaq to…talaq, talaq, talaq","A five-member Supreme Court Bench has struck down several hundred years old Triple Talaq, a move that is being widely appreciated. Muslim folks from Tricity share their opinions

Manpriya Singh

It definitely takes longer, with a little more formalities, to return a faulty product delivered by Amazon. Then why should it take just three words spoken in haste to end a marriage? Well, so question the new-age Muslims (especially women). But mind you, we are tampering with several hundred years old integral religious practice to do with a personal law. Nevertheless —Unconstitutional! Unconstitutional! Unconstitutional! So said the Supreme Court Bench comprising five different judges from five different faiths—striking down Triple Talaq by a 3:2 majority. Ever since, it’s been trending, trolling and everything in between. Enough being said, with a lot more to say on the subject, we go in search of a cross-section of Muslim community from the Tricity.

Cheers to progression

It’s a good decision. I totally agree with and respect Supreme Court banning the controversial Islamic practice. As a working woman and a mother, I feel we work just as hard, sometimes more and the least we expect in return is equality if not special privileges. So I am happy with the decision. My round of applause to the bench that has given the verdict! — Binder Kaur, Muslim government school teacher, married to a Muslim

Women empowered

It’s a very pro-women development, so I am totally happy with the Supreme Court ruling rendering the Triple Talaq unconstitutional. We can’t talk about women empowerment until we talk about women equality, so it’s a positive step in that direction. Also it takes care of instances where divorce would happen in a fit of rage or other such similar circumstances. — Jannat Jahan/Niana, former municipal councilor, married to a Muslim

Wait & watch

There’s a part of me that totally agrees with the Supreme Court decision. It’s especially a breather in case where men divorce their wives in a fit of rage. I, especially a father of a baby girl, feel it’s a pro-women step. But at the same time, the detailed verdict of Muslim bodies will be out on this one and as a member of the Muslim community, I will agree with what they have to say too.

— Master Ali, craftsman

The flip side

B-town—who tweeted, who didn’t!

People murder their wives also in a fit of anger. At least it’s better than that! Further in pursuit of court verdicts, people end up ruining their youth, their life and a significant 10-15 years. At least, this way they can immediately move ahead with their separate lives. It’s a 1,400-year-old law; must have been made keeping some things in mind. I am not saying one should uphold the Triple Talaq law as it is without amendments. If a husband says Triple Talaq, there should definitely be further probe as to under what circumstances and why he said it, but to totally quash someone’s religious practice is not a done thing. — Muslim cleric in a Sector 20 mosque, who refused to be namedOtherwise quite knowledgeable about current affairs and vocal about general developments, interestingly, the likes of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan are yet to tweet, re-tweet or say anything at all on the social media on this issue. Meanwhile, there are some who minced no words and took no time in hailing the verdict.: Some decisions are not for pappus or even bhakts. The decision of triple talaq is for the win of women empowerment.Welcome judgment by Supreme Court to declare triple talaq as unconstitutional. This will start a new chapter in the empowerment of Muslim women.A win for democracy! Historic day for women’s rights in our country.Since Supreme Court has declared triple talaq “unconstitutional”, why does Parliament have to enact a new law to void it.

Saving Child Life.,"LAHORE, THURSDAY, AUGUST 23, 1917

THE British people have been making every arrangement for the better protection of child life, and on the 2nd July a large meeting was held at the Guildhall presided over by the Lord Mayor to discuss further measures for child welfare. Her Majesty the Queen herself is deeply interested in the question. Mr. H.A. Fisher deplored the ignorance of mothers in regard to the health of children. The problem depended on having less drink, less vice, better housing, purer milk and better sanitation. ""The number of closed windows to be seen in any street of any town at night"", said he, ""was some measure of the degree of that ignorance."" He asked for more maternity centers, more clinics and more health visitors."

When asked whether the government is considering phasing out Rs 2,000 notes, he said: “No, there was no such discussion”.

Punjab Dera management asks police not to level ‘baseless’ allegations,"Parvesh Sharma

Sangrur, August 23

The Punjab management of Dera Sacha Sauda has reacted strongly to the allegations that their followers had started storing petrol, diesel and weapons at Naam Charcha Ghars (congregation/prayer centres). The management asked the police not to foment trouble in Punjab without any basis and invited senior police officers to check all their centres to prove the allegations.

“It’s a baseless allegation that our supporters are storing petrol and weapons at our centres. As cops are standing guard at all our centres, how can our supporters store anything illegal? Senior police officers should first verify such allegations before issuing any letters on their false information,” said Harinder Insan Mangwal, member of the 45-executive dera committee of Punjab. Mangwal, along with other senior members of the management, on Wednesday visited various centres in the district and asked all to respect the verdict of the court. They also asked followers to be alert about any “false information” being spread by miscreants through social media. “Around 35 lakh followers from Punjab alone would reach Panchkula to hear the decision of the court on August 25, but it should not be taken negatively as the followers are attending all court hearings along with the dera head, who has been implicated in false cases,” alleged Mangwal. The letter, issued by the IGP (Law and Order) on August 22 to all SSPs, commissioners of police and IGPs, shared by the dera followers, says, “It has come to the notice that the Dera Sacha Sauda Premis have started storing diesel, petrol in drums at Nam Charcha Ghars in Faridkot district. They have stored sharp-edged weapons and stones on the roofs of Naam Charcha Ghars. On August 25, if the court would give a verdict against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, then devotees can use petrol and weapons to harm government/public properties. Therefore, you are directed to make required security arrangements.” “We respect Punjab Police and judiciary. But cops do not have any right to level such baseless allegations,” said Mangwal."

SC dismisses review plea of jailed AIADMK leader Sasikala,"New Delhi, August 23

The Supreme Court has dismissed a plea of jailed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala seeking review of its verdict convicting and sentencing her to a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case.

The apex court also rejected her plea for an open court hearing of the review petitions.

“We do not find any error in the common judgment impugned, much less an apparent error on the face of the record, so as to call for its review. The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed,” a Bench of Justices S A Bobde and Amitava Roy.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Sasikala and other convicts, gave written submissions and propositions which were taken on record by the top court.

The apex court perused the review petitions and dismissed the pleas filed by Sasikala and other convicts in the case.

Besides Sasikala and two others—V N Sudhakaran, former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s foster son, and Elavarasi, widow of Sasikala’s elder brother—had challenged the setting aside of a Karnataka High Court verdict acquitting her and restoring the trial court verdict in totality.

Late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was also an accused in the case.

The trial court in Bengaluru had convicted Sasikala along with Jayalalithaa, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi in the case for amassing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.

On February 14, the AIADMK leader, Sasikala, was convicted in the case by the apex court, dashing her ambition to become the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister.

The top court verdict held her guilty of entering into a conspiracy with late AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa.

Consequently, she was not able to enter into electoral politics for a period of six years after serving the four-year jail term.

Sasikala, the close aide and shadow of Jayalalithaa for almost three decades, was locked in a power struggle for the top post with then acting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam.

The apex court had set aside the Karnataka High Court order acquitting all the four accused and “restored in toto” the trial court’s decision in the 19-year-old disproportionate assets case.

The special trial court had found disproportionate assets worth Rs 53.60 crore, which Jayalalithaa and the three others could not account for.

The CBI had alleged that the unaccounted wealth was to the tune of Rs 66.65 crore.

Sasikala had been in prison in 1996 when the case was registered.

In 2014, the special trial court convicted and awarded her a four-year sentence with a fine of Rs 10 crore. Jayalalithaa was then awarded four-year jail term, besides a fine of Rs 100 crore.

The apex court, which abated the proceedings against Jayalalithaa after she died on December 5 last year, held that the criminal conspiracy was hatched at her Poes Garden residence in Chennai. — PTI"
Funds from 2% liquor cess to benefit disabled,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 22

The Department of Excise is likely to impose two percent cess on Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL). The funds generated would be given to the Department of Social welfare for initiating activities for persons with disabilities. The move has been proposed by the Department of Social welfare, which wants to create a corpus fund for the purpose. Two corpus funds — Kishore Nyaya Nidhi and Mahila Surakasha Nidhi — have already been set up for the benefit of women and children. Now, the Social Welfare Department, which is grappling with paucity of funds, has approached the Department of Excise for help. Dr Ranbir Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Excise, said, “We have held discussions on the issue today and now the modus of tax collection is being worked out. The proposal will be brought before the Cabinet and then a government order will be issued.” The state government had imposed two percent cess on liquor in the aftermath of the 2013 natural disaster. The funds collected by the department were used for the welfare of the flash flood victims."

"Temporary jail has sports authorities worried about pitches, stadium","Deepankar Sharda

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 22

The Chandigarh administration’s order to convert the Sector 16 cricket stadium into a temporary jail on Friday — the day a Panchkula court is set to announce the verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh — has sent the UT sports department into a tizzy. The officials are concerned about the pitches and the field. “We cannot ignore the order. Ideally, there should be no problem, even if the police arrest a big number of the people. But we have to take care of the pitch. We have to be extra cautious,” said Dr Mahender Singh, joint director sports. However, a groundsman, seeking anonymity, said that it would be difficult to protect the pitch if the number of arrests was high or in case of rain on that day. “It will be difficult for us to manage the crowd. The police have to keep the arrested away from the pitch. We will not be fighting with the crowd, which will already be upset,” said the groundsman. Notably, in the recent past, the sports department had stopped leasing out the stadium for matches and restricted the player’s movement in order to restore the pitch and the outfield. “If something happens on August 25, our hard work will be washed away,” a sports council member said. “The administration should shift the venue to the Sector 42 complex, which is huge and able to handle such events.” Notably, as per MET department’s predications, there will be thunderstorm and rain on Friday, which could add to the authorities’ woes."

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour.

[ + read story ]

Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation.

n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health.

n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details.

n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone.

n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you.

n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc.

You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it.

n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour.

n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour.

n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills.

Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

"Karti Chidambaram appears before CBI, to be examined again on Aug 28","New Delhi, August 23

The CBI is understood to have posed over 100 questions to former finance minister P Chidambaram's son Karti during his over eight hours of questioning in connection with a corruption case.

Karti, who arrived at the agency headquarters on the directives of the Supreme Court around 10.20 am, was questioned for over eight hours, CBI sources said.

They said he will be examined again on August 28.

Over 100 questions on various aspects of the case were drafted by investigators which were put to 45-year-old Karti, the sources said.

The agency wanted to examine him in connection with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to media group INX Media for receiving funds from Mauritius when his father P Chidambaram was the Union finance minister.

It is alleged that a firm ""indirectly controlled"" by him received money from INX Media, run by Indrani and Peter Mukerjea.

The CBI had issued a notice to Karti to appear for questioning in June but he had sought more time. Later, a look out circular was also issued against him to prevent him from leaving the country, CBI sources said.

Karti had then approached the Madras High Court which stayed the circular. The Supreme Court later put on hold the high court order.

During a hearing before the apex court, Karti had told the court he was willing to appear before the CBI. The court then directed him to appear on August 23.

A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud allowed Karti to be accompanied by a lawyer at the CBI headquarters during the questioning.

The CBI had registered the case on May 15 against Karti, his company Chess Management Services, INX Media, Advantage Strategic Consulting Services, its director Padma Vishwanathan and the Mukerjeas.

The Mukerjeas, charged with killing Indrani's daughter, Sheena Bora, are currently in jail.

P Chidambaram had issued a strong statement in response to the FIR, saying the government was using the CBI and other agencies to target his son.

The FIPB approval was granted in ""hundreds of cases"", the senior Congress leader had said. — PTI"

Though Prabhu did not specifically mention that he had “offered to resign”, there has been intense speculation that he may have offered to resign considering the language of his tweets.Reports said Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani will replace him. “I am extremely pained by the unfortunate accidents, injuries to passengers and loss of precious lives. It has caused me deep anguish,” the Railway Minister said.“New India envisioned by PM deserves a Railways which is efficient and modern.

Joint FIR as modus operandi in all ATM withdrawals is the same

Ludhiana, August 22

Ten cases of cyber fraud, involving the withdrawal of cash from the bank accounts of city-based persons, have come to light. The police have registered a joint FIR at the Model Town police station.

According to sources, a total of Rs 5 lakh (approximate) has been fraudulently withdrawn in these cases.

One of the complainants, Amit Kumar, who works in a private firm here, said he had received a message about withdrawal of Rs 12,000 from his bank account. “I was stunned to see the message because I did not withdraw money. The amount was withdrawn from an outstation ATM booth while the ATM card was in my possession. Someone seemed to have cloned my ATM card,” the victim said.

He said he had recently used his card for buying petrol at Grain Market, and it could be possible that the petrol pump staff had swiped his card on the skimming device. “I have informed the police about it,” he added.

The sources said all those complaints had reached the Police Commissioner for registration of an FIR.

The investigating officer, ASI Dharminder Singh, from the Model Town police station, said since the modus operandi of the cyber criminals was the same in all complaints, the police had registered a single FIR on the basis of a collective complaint. “We are verifying the role of some suspected petrol pump employees and if the police get any clue, legal action will be taken accordingly. So far, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons only,” the ASI added.

The police had nabbed five petrol pump employees for their connivance with a cyber criminal, Mukul."
"Statins may help fight typhoid, malaria","Washington, August 22

Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims. Scientists from Duke University in the US have discovered that a gene variant which affects cholesterol levels could increase the risk of contracting typhoid fever. They also showed that a common cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) could protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the nasty infection. The findings, which appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease. They also point to possible avenues to protect those who are most vulnerable to pathogens - like the Salmonella bacteria - that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells. ""We need to try this approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before we can consider taking this into the clinic,"" said Dennis C Ko, assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine. ""What is so exciting is that our study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,"" Ko said. Ko and his team used hundreds of cell lines from healthy human volunteers and exposed them to the exact dose of Salmonella Typhi, which had been tagged with a green fluorescent marker. They then looked for genetic differences that distinguished cells that had higher rates of bacterial invasion from those that did not. The researchers found that a single nucleotide of DNA in a gene called VAC14 was associated with the level of bacterial invasion in cells. When they knocked out the gene, the cells were invaded more readily and more of the cells glowed brightly with green bacteria. They also unexpectedly found that those more susceptible cells had higher levels of cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes that Salmonella binds to invade host cells. Researchers tested DNA from subjects in a group of 1,000 Vietnamese people, half of whom had typhoid fever and half did not. They found that the VAC14 gene variant was associated with a moderately elevated risk of typhoid fever. ""Discovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins for high cholesterol,"" said Ko. ""We wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,"" he said. Monica Alvarez, a graduate student in Ko's lab and lead author on the study, added a cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) to their water and then injected the fish with Salmonella Typhi. She found that the treated animals were more likely to clear the bacteria out of their system and survive. — PTI"

Bathinda, August 22

The debt-ridden Municipal Corporation Bathinda (MCB) has now decided to increase its revenue by raising the fee for approval of maps.

The increase will lead to rise in the development fee, labour and water charges.

The MCB had kept this proposal in the house for revising the rate in 2015, but at that time, the house kept the item pending.

Now again, the proposal would be tabled in the meeting of the General House on August 24.

In the report sent to the house, the building branch has stated that while constructing a building, about 1,200 to 1,500 rupees per square feet is spent, but the MCB is charging fee by making estimate on old rates of Rs 500 per square feet of ground floor and 400 rupees per square feet of first floor.

The building branch has argued that in the city, other government departments, which include Improvement Trust and Bathinda Development Authority (BDA), have estimate rate of Rs 900 and 800 per square feet.

Therefore, as per the proposal, different departments cannot have different rates in the same city.

So, the MCB has decided to revise its old rate of ground floor to Rs 900 and first floor to Rs 800 per square feet.

The MCB is set to revive the rate of map fees after about five years.

Earlier, the corporation had revised rates in 2012. At that time, the MCB had increased the floor rate from Rs 250 to Rs 500 per square feet and of the first floor from Rs 200 to 400 per square feet.

The Local Audit Department of the MCB had also objected to the old rates of the corporation.

Rates earlier revised in 2012

Earlier, the corporation had revised rates in 2012. At that time, the MCB had increased the floor rate from Rs 250 to Rs 500 per square feet and of the first floor from Rs 200 to 400 per square feet.
