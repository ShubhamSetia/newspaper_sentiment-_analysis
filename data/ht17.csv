"Microsoft: 500M Windows 10 devices, half of 2018 goal","Microsoft says a half billion devices are now running Windows 10, its latest operating system.

That’s up from 400 million disclosed last September, but far short of a goal of 1 billion by 2018. Microsoft has already acknowledged it won’t hit 1 billion in time . Getting halfway has taken nearly two years.

Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after a disastrous Windows 8 launch and heavy competition from phone systems such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Getting more devices on Windows 10 will help encourage companies to make more apps and services for it.

CEO Satya Nadella disclosed the figure Wednesday at a Microsoft conference in Seattle.

After getting Microsoft on track to prioritizing mobile devices and internet-based services, Nadella says artificial intelligence will get a bigger focus."
India vs Sri Lanka - Not easy to bat on SSC wicket: Ajinkya Rahane,"about the video

India amassed 622 for nine before declaring their first innings and then returned to remove both the Sri Lankan openers to tighten their grip on the second Test on Friday. For the second successive time in the three-match series, India won the toss, elected to bat and amassed 600 or more in their first innings before unleashing their bowlers on their hosts. Like in their comprehensive defeat in the series opener at Galle, Sri Lanka made a feeble reply to finish day two on 50 for two at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground. Indian batsman Ajinkya Rahane said that the Lankans will have a tough job to handle India’s spinners on Day 3 on Saturday. (Video: Sanjjeev Samyal) (Hindustan Times)"
Makeshift the ground on which we stand: Eunice de Souza (1940-2017),"Even before I met Eunice de Souza, she had me overawed, and more than slightly terrified of her. I later found out this was the natural state of being for generations of her students, who encountered the stylish, unconventional, constantly challenging professor of English in her classrooms throughout an influential 30-year career at St. Xavier’s College in Mumbai. But I studied abroad and was never her student. Instead, de Souza first confronted me in books, most memorably her debut volume of poetry, the mesmerizing ‘Fix’ (Newground, 1979).

That slender collection of just 24, mostly short, poems accosted my consciousness like an ear-splitting thunderclap. It was at once confounding and irresistible, utterly beguiling but also deeply unsettling. For starters, I couldn’t get over the Arun Kolatkar-designed cover, with its silver monochrome portrait of unblinking Eunice close up, with an X etched on her forehead, the instantly obvious reference being to Charles Manson, who had carved up his own face to “secede from the human race.” And then, as I turned the pages gasping at poem after razor-sharp poem, de Souza radically and permanently disturbed my sense of self, cutting mercilessly to the bone to upend any number of cosy certainties.

The cover of Fix (1979) (www.Amazon.in)

In just a couple days after her death, a host of moving tributes have illuminated what it was like to have Eunice as a colleague, as an inspirational (and irascible) teacher, as mentor and friend and ally. Almost every one of these testimonials has been written by a woman. But what was it like to have to deal with Eunice de Souza as an unconsciously (innocently?) privileged Goan Catholic male, thus the prime target of her most acid verse? Let me tell you, it never stops being highly uncomfortable. For me, reading Eunice de Souza has always felt uncannily like having my pants pulled off in public, and then receiving an unending succession of stinging kicks to the rear. At first you gasp and squirm, but then eventually become resigned to the inevitable. Finally, as I once confided to Eunice at the end of a long evening, I’ve come to expect and rather enjoy the unmanning and pasting. That quasi-masochistic confidence delighted her no end.

Forgive Me, Mother(Fix, 1979)

Forgive me, mother,

That I left you

a life-long widow

old, alone

It was kill or die

and you got me anyway:

The blood congeals at lover’s touch

The guts dissolve in shit.

I was never young.

Now I’m old, alone

In dreams

I hack you.

If there is a unifying theme to Eunice de Souza’s life and lengthy intellectual progression, it is liberation, rigorously essayed at almost any cost. Her emancipatory journey began immediately after school, when she decamped from Poona’s increasingly stifling Goan Catholic community to study at the University of Bombay (she earned a BA (Hons) in English Literature in 1960). Having lost her father at the age of three, the future poet hated growing up in a small-minded, gossipy and judgemental small town universe, where she stood out for being raised by a widowed, embittered mother under somewhat straitened circumstances. That alienating experience never left her, and underlies a considerable portion of her oeuvre.

Unerringly independent of mind, and already possessed of blood-curdling sardonicism, de Souza rapidly achieved notoriety amongst the parochial Aunties and Uncles of Goan Catholic Poona. My mother and uncles grew up with her, and can easily recall the stirs she generated by speaking out in school, and for cultivating adult relationships with proto-bohemians like the Shantiniketan-trained artist, Angelo da Fonseca. Not much later, she wrote a poem that stayed unpublished for decades, “I want a father/always have./God won’t do/He’s too judgemental./And so I found you/ Like my father, absent.”

This, in her own words, is another major theme of de Souza’s life. That is, her ambivalent passion for male company, complete with vulnerability to every kind of disappointment, and a correspondingly deadly eye for weakness, hypocrisy and cant. She truly loved men, that much is more than clear from her writings. But that sentiment was balanced with brutal honesty about their fumbling and foibles, as well as an incandescent ire about the injustice of the way the world works to undermine and sideline her own sex. In important early poems from ‘Fix’ like ‘Bandra Christian Party’, ‘Marriages are Made’ and, most vividly, ‘Catholic Wife’, one or another pompous Goan Catholic “pillar of the church” stands in for all patriarchal hypocrites, while “the pillar’s wife says nothing.”

In 2012, speaking to a rapt and adoring audience in Panjim, the pocket-sized Latinate capital of Goa, de Souza explained, “When I wrote a number of poems, critical in some ways of Goans, I had Poona Goans in mind because those were the ones I knew. Rather like Irish Catholic families, they encouraged parents to have large families, they were concerned with the colour of one’s skin, the wickedness of even knowing about sex. To know about sex was to be ‘sophisticated,’ and that was the most damning word one could apply to a girl. It was some time before I recognized that these were shortcomings we shared with every other community. Nevertheless, I was told by a student that a priest has denounced them from a pulpit at St Peter’s in Bandra. When I told the poet Adil Jussawalla this he said if I continued in the way I was going, I would soon be denounced from St Peter’s in Rome!”

By that point, the feared dragon lady of St Xavier’s was several years into retirement, and allegedly mellowed beyond the recognition of her former pupils. If that is indeed true, I am extremely fortunate it is when our own connection took place. With some trepidation about what might ensue, I was responsible for inviting Eunice for her first-ever reading of her poems in her ancestral homeland on the sidelines of a path-breaking, monumental art exhibition, ‘Aparanta: The Confluence of Contemporary Art in Goa’ curated by Ranjit Hoskote in 2007. In the event, she was disarmingly charming in person, and altogether radiant on stage. None of us could get enough, and she knew it.

Very late one evening on that trip, on a candle lit terrace overlooking the Arabian Sea, de Souza spoke with great feeling about ‘ways of belonging’ that characterized the many-layered relationship she had with her roots, with complicated implications for how Goa finds meaning within modern India. That conversation led to a new, unique Goa Art + Literature Festival focused on what is usually called “the margins” - Goa, Kashmir, the North East states, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as genres like poetry, translations and graphic novels. Eunice repeatedly presided at the annual event with notable pleasure, earning herself a legion of new fans including Khasi rock legend, Lou Majaw (who followed her around like a hefty puppy for days), and then-Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah (who was photographed looking like a mouse transfixed next to Eunice, rendered helpless by her feline, feminine wiles).

India has been scandalously cavalier to the pioneering Indo-Anglian poets, for outdated and hopelessly misguided nationalistic reasons. It was several years after Arun Kolatkar’s death that his genius was adequately recognized, typically disgracefully only after his work was published to great acclaim in the USA. There is no doubt in my mind the same will happen to Eunice de Souza’s poems, which have a rare universal quality that seem to me inherently resistant to becoming dated. They will last, with impact undimmed, as one of the vital modernist artistic achievements of independent India.

However, it is as anthologist that Eunice truly stands alone. Over decades of spirited labour, she unearthed and revived the work of a prodigious number of overlooked and forgotten writers. Our understanding of the breadth of Indian literature is incalculably enriched by books like ‘Purdah: An Anthology’ (OUP, 2004), ‘Women’s Voices: Selections from Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Indian Writing in English’ (OUP, 2004), and ‘Early Indian Poetry in English: An Anthology 1829-1947’ (OUP, 2005). As she explained in the introduction to the latter volume, she was motivated to “re-map” comprehensively. “Literary battles take place in every culture, colonized and colonizing, and class, region, gender and religion all come into play when deciding who or what creates a nation’s identity, who speaks for it. It is my impression that, in India at least, the battle too often takes precedence over the actual reading of texts. In fact, come of it takes place without texts being read at all.”

Eunice de Souza’s last collection of poems (www.Amazon.in)

It is both typical and maddening of Eunice to have departed a lifetime of burrowing through mountains of archives, while leaving behind just a few slim books of poetry for us who remain. I remember her laughing inscrutably at my suggestion that she was the only writer in the world whose collected works actually dwindled quite appreciably over the years, as lines were re-assessed then deleted, and some poems discreetly abandoned in toto. She was the knife whittling to the irreducible, always trying to distill an encompassing world view to a few spare lines. That microcosmic impulse is particularly evident in her last book of poems, the wry, luminous ‘Learn from the Almond Leaf’ where a poet at the height of her powers returns often to the prospect of the end. All those who knew Eunice de Souza realize this wasn’t an accident. It’s just that she couldn’t trust anyone else to do clear-eyed justice to her epitaph.

Another Poem About Death (Learn from the Almond Leaf, Poetrywala 2016)

I keep hearing sounds

Of wind and water.

There is no wind.

There is no water.

There is no air.

I see the pallor on her face

The hardening hand

I know

There is no one there.

Ravi Shastri wants India to be best fielding side at 2019 Cricket World Cup,"Ravi Shastri has laid emphasis on Indian cricket team’s fielding, highlighting it as the key area heading into the 2019 World Cup in England.

Shastri was appointed as India’s head coach following Anil Kumble’s controversial exit from the post owing to his “untenable” relationship with Virat Kohli.

(Read | Why MS Dhoni may not make it to 2019 Cricket World Cup)

While the team travelled to West Indies without a head coach, Shastri was welcomed back by Virat Kohli and Co. with a 3-0 Test series win in Sri Lanka.

“A disciplined approach is what counts. Look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik and one in the third game from Mohammed Shami, we’ve not faltered. How many catches did we drop? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid altogether,” he said.

(Read | Hardik Pandya happy to be even 10 per cent as good as Kapil Dev was for India)

“When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding XI in the world walking out. Only the fittest of the lot will survive and thrive going forward and that’s right up there in the list of priorities.”

Ravi Shastri feels his return to the Indian team has been smooth because he is in charge of the side he had put in place in his previous stint as team director.

“I said at the start of the (Sri Lanka) tour that I’m walking into a set-up which I had put in place and was working on until a year ago. That’s the same set-up I’ve walked back into,” said Ravi Shastri, who represented India in 80 Tests and 150 ODIs.

(Read | Upul Tharanga to lead Sri Lanka in ODI series against Indian cricket team)

“The trust is there. I can’t speak of the time when I wasn’t around, but what I can say with a sense of absolute belief is that nothing has changed between how things were during my last stint and now.”

With Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane all crossing the three-figure mark, KL Rahul slamming crucial fifties and the lower middle-order making those useful contributions in Sri Lanka, Shastri expects good days ahead during overseas tours.

“To be honest, with a batting unit like this one, the last thing you’d do is lose sleep. The core is such a good one and I’m glad the way Shikhar [Dhawan] is timing the ball. He’s got two big hundreds that have put him in the frame of mind that he loves to be in,” Shastri told a leading newspaper.

(Read | Seasoned India can now focus on bigger battles)

“Cheteshwar [Pujara] has been batting like a dream and he’s in a zone where he has set his targets going forward. And as if all of this wasn’t enough, you saw a knock of a different kind here the other day.

“Hardik Pandya’s century simply changed the course of an entire Test in less than an hour. We were thinking of going ahead by 60 to 80 runs when the tail was batting and look where we ended. Five batsmen got a hundred in this series and close to 10 cricketers got 50-plus scores, which is a first in Test cricket for any team,” he added.

(Read | India vs Sri Lanka ODIs: Upul Tharanga pleads for patience after Test debacle)

Shastri also heaped praise on Hardik Pandya and Wriddhiman Saha: “Hardik may still be new to Test cricket but he’s showing what a quick learner he is. As Virat [Kohli] said, he’s been the biggest positive of this series. He was working on the cutters for the first time on the morning of the day’s play with Arun and he didn’t flinch once in going out and testing it the same day.

“As for Saha, he has been excellent, be it his wicketkeeping, batting or catching. He had always been an unwavering guy in domestic cricket for years and that hard work is showing. He’s grown so much in confidence and remember, he’s walking into MS’ [Dhoni] shoes. He’s done phenomenally well to grow out of that shadow.”"
Cannes 2017: Fatih Akin’s In the Fade is all about a mother’s terrible sorrow,"Turkish moviemaker Fatih Akin, who lives in Germany, was back at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest outing, In the Fade. His last Croisette visit was as long ago as 2007, when he brought his The Edge of Heaven to clinch the best screenplay award. A story about loneliness, desperation and a sense of hope and hopelessness, The Edge Of Heaven was a great hit in Cannes.

But unfortunately, not In the Fade. Which seems to have divided opinion. An Indian journalist, revered and reviled for his right-wing extremism, saw Akin’s work as one propagating and promoting suicide bombing. This writer did not. Nor did a French lady, who works in one of the country’s government departments. She felt that it was “a beautiful story of a German mother’s angst at having lost her six-year-old son and her Turkish husband in a Neo-Nazi attack”.

In Germany and in some other places in Europe, radical Nazi tendencies are on the rise. There was a time when one saw posters proclaiming this political ideology even in Cannes - and cities like Paris.

So, Akin’s movie - if at all it has to be read as a political comment - must be viewed as one that underlines the futility of killing. Revolving around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground (NSU) - which has been targeting immigrants, especially Muslims, In the Fade draws us into a compelling, deeply disturbing drama about a mother (played with a touch of brilliance by Diane Krugger) -- who fails to get justice in Germany’s legal system when her little son and husband of Turkish origin are killed in a blast set off by a bomb outside his shop. The culprits are a young German couple. And after the courts falter and sets the couple free, the mother seeks revenge, planting a bomb under a caravan that the two use. She also kills herself.

In the Fade is the story of a German mother who seeks revenge for the killing of her son and husband of Turkish origin.

Akin, whose parents came to Hamburg in the 1960s, says he is very angry with that notorious group which perpetrated a series of murders in Germany between 2000 and 2007. He told the media here the other day: “The NSU scandals were huge in Germany in 2011. I was very angry when I heard what happened and that anger drove me to write this. As I started writing, other layers and characters were created to make the story believable. So it’s a character-driven movie more than a revenge or political thriller. It’s more about the evolution of grief, and what happens to a mother when you take her kids away from her. How does she continue to live?

“It disturbs me to be an enemy, just because I am who I am: the son of Turkish parents with brown hair and brown eyes. Or that you live in the West, and that you could be a target simply because of where you are from. We do not defend a political ideology but somehow we are targets. The only thing I can do is strike back with a film. My movie is a strike-back.”

The film revolves around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground.

In the Fade is narrated in three chapters. The first one is all about Katja (Krugger), who marries Nuri (Numan Acar), in prison. He is serving time for a drug-related offence. But he is soon out, and the couple live a happy life with their six-year-old son. The second chapter is all about the horrific nail-bomb attack in which the father and son are killed. The third segment takes us into revenge and retribution.

Akin’s work, competing for the Palm dÓr, is well shot, neatly executed and had the ability to keep this critic glued to his seat. Intelligently conceived, Akin’s In the Fade has the same power and punch that we saw in his earlier The Cut - a bold plot about the 1915 Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people were butchered.

The question now is, as we go closer to the Palm dÓr, whether Akin’s vengeful tale will shake the Pedro Almodovar jury to give it a prize. There are of course other equally strong contenders like Redoubtable (a lovely take on Jean-Luc Godard), the American Civil War drama, The Beguiled, and Francois Ozon’s Amant Double about a torrid love affair between a psycho-analyst and his young patient.

MP: Fugitive ‘king of Dewas’ surrenders over farmer’s murder in 2015,"Vikram Singh Puar, the 27-year-old son of the deceased “king” of the former Dewas royals in Madhya Pradesh, surrendered on Wednesday after being on the run for more than a year for his suspected role in a murder.

He has been accused of leading a fatal clash with 12 armed supporters over a land dispute in Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas.

Puar and his gang allegedly tried to take away the wheat harvest of a farmer, Pratap Lodhi, on March 19, 2015. Lodhi and his family members resisted and, in the ensuing clash with firearms and lathis, the farmer was gravely wounded. He died on March 22.

The young former royal was on the run since then and a special court granted him anticipatory bail for 15 days in June 2016 as his father, former BJP minister Tukojirao Puar, was in his death bed.

His bail application was approved so that he could perform last rites of his father who died of brain haemorrhage on June 19. A day later, Puar was crowned “King of Dewas” at a private ceremony in the family’s palace.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Babulal Gaur and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had attended the senior Puar’s funeral.

The new “king”, however, escaped and remained in hiding until he surrendered before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.

Dewas police arrested Puar at a local hospital where he was admitted earlier in the day. The magistrate sent him to judicial custody till January 7.

Superintendent of police Shashikant Shukla said Puar’s police remand was not sought because “there was nothing to recover from him”.

But several questions remained unanswered: Where was the fugitive hiding? What was he doing? Who was he with? Who all helped him helped him during the period?

A murder charge has been registered at Barotha police station in Dewas after the farmer’s death. But a court acquitted 12 of the 13 accused last December, making the case weak against Puar, legal experts said.

"Chinese automaker SAIC announces India entry, will start making cars in 2019","SAIC Motor Corporation Ltd on Wednesday announced plans to enter India and start manufacturing cars by 2019, becoming the first Chinese automaker to venture in what will be the world’s third biggest auto market by 2020.

SAIC, formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, will start making cars at its fully-owned manufacturing facility by 2019. SAIC is still negotiating to take over the General Motors’ Halol factory which closed operations on April 28 this year.

In India, SAIC has already registered its local subsidiary, MG Motors India. The company has roped in former GM India executives to lead its India operations -- Rajeev Chhaba will be president and managing director while P Balendran will be the executive director.

The largest automobile company in China stands 46th in the Fortune Global 500 list, with annual revenue of over $100 billion. The state-owned automaker has joint ventures in China with Detroit-headquartered GM and Germany’s Volkswagen, with brands such as MG, Roewe and Maxus under its belt.

Outside China, SAIC is present in several global markets including UK, USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Middle East, South East Asia, Thailand and Indonesia. It even has an ‘Overseas Innovation Center’ in Silicon Valley, California.

What models will SAIC bring to India under the MG badge remains a mystery. Founded in 1924, the Morris Garage has seen several change of hands before China’s Nanjing Automobile Group acquired it in 2005. It came under the SAIC umbrella after SAIC merged with Nanjing in 2008.

“The introduction of the iconic British Sports Car Brand ‘MG’ in India is an important part of SAIC Motor’s global strategy. Our aim is to provide best-in-class vehicles, integrating sophisticated British design and quality, breakthrough product features and a pleasing ownership experience,” the company said in a statement.

“As a new-age auto company focused on innovation and technology, the company offers various solutions and technological capabilities required in the development of ‘new energy vehicles’, to cater to the changing needs of global customers and the overall ecosystem,” the statement added."

Donald Trump’s Washington DC hotel makes $1.97m in 2017,"US President Donald Trumps company has turned a $1.97 million profit at its opulent Trump International Hotel so far in 2017, the media reported.

Earlier this year, the Trump Organisation had projected that it would lose $2.1 million during the first four months of 2017 as it established a new hotel and convention business in the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Instead, the hotel, with the White House down the street, is already turning a hefty profit and charging more for its rooms than most or all of the city’s other hotels.

Driving the profits are the extraordinary prices guests have been willing to pay for rooms, including members of Trump’s cabinet, as well as big spending on food and beverages in the meeting areas, bar and restaurant -- spots frequented by members of the President’s inner circle and other Republican leaders.

This year, guests have paid an average of $652.98 a night to stay there, beating the company’s expectations by 57 per cent, according to documents posted online by the General Services Administration.

Since Trump entered the White House in January, the hotel has emerged as a Republican Party power centre and popular destination for conservative, foreign and Christian groups holding meetings in Washington, earning the company $19.7 million through April 15, according to his financial disclosure with the government.

Trump International visitors have spent $8.2 million on food and drinks so far at the hotel this year, beating expectations by 37.2 per cent, reports The Washington Post.

“We are very proud of the success of the project,” the President’s son Eric Trump, who took over the company with his brother Don Jr., said in an email."

"Breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women every year by 2020","Lack of early diagnosis of breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women a year by 2020, says a study, one of whose researchers is of Indian origin.

One of the most commonly diagnosed type of cancers among women in India, breast cancer claimed 70,218 lives in 2012, the study published in the Journal of Business Research showed. It also revealed that the average age of death from the disease has shifted from 50 years to 30 years.

The magnitude of the problem is enormous and has major policy implications for the Indian government, said Vijay Pereira, Associate Dean (Research) at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. Pereira said there were complex challenges at national, state and community levels.

“What is clear is that healthcare at state-level must transform to deliver quality care and awareness,” Pereira said. The researchers found lack of awareness about self-examination and cultural barriers played a major role. Women sought medical care extremely late. Women do not get access to health services and are reluctant to consult male doctors, neglecting their health due to family obligations. They are over-dependent on other family members. All of these cause delay in diagnosis, the researchers said.

Thus, educating Indian men about the significance of early diagnosis for breast cancer, could be the key to halt the disease which is turning into an epidemic, the researchers suggested. “India is still a patriarchal society. Although women are now in responsible jobs and earning for their families, it’s the men who are the head of the household,” said Judith Fletcher-Brown, from the University of Portsmouth in England.

Even educated professional women do not discuss private matters about their bodies with their husbands, fathers or brothers. So it’s essential to direct health messages towards men, Fletcher-Brown said.

Rapid economic development and greater urbanisation are also responsible for the rise in breast cancer rates, the researchers noted. Besides, women tend to have children at a later age and breast feeding is less, which increases their chances of developing the disease. Working women in urban India often have a more western diet leading to obesity. That also increases the risk. The study said community health nurses had the greatest impact in raising awareness of early breast cancer symptoms. In addition, schools and media were also found to be good channels through which awareness could be raised in young women.

"Amit Shah blows poll bugle, eyes 350+ seats in 2019 Lok Sabha elections","BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday blew the bugle for 2019 Lok Sabha election, setting a target of winning over 350 parliamentary seats.

In the run up to the elections, Shah will soon appoint palaks (mentors) for the 120 Lok Sabha seats where the BJP has never won in the past. Most of them are in southern and north-eastern India.

Their job will be to oversee the BJP’s preparedness and identify suitable candidates in these constituencies.

Senior ministers of the Modi government will also be given the task of supervising five or six such Lok Sabha seats and convert them into BJP seats.

While law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will take charge of Assam, health minister JP Nadda and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan will oversee West Bengal and Kerala, respectively.

Prabharis (in-charge) will be appointed for the 261 Lok Sabha seats where the party lost in 2014 elections. These prabharis will be party leaders from outside those constituencies. The BJP had won 282 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 elections.

Shah briefed a select group of BJP leaders — including nine Union ministers — at the party headquarters about his blueprint for 2019, which turns focus on states such as West Bengal, Odisha, Kerala and the northeast. A 10-minute presentation on Shah’s efforts to galvanize the party, BJP’s current situation and its prospects in the polls was made to the BJP leaders at the meeting.

The BJP had won all the Lok Sabha seats from Rajasthan and Gujarat last time, and is near its peak in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Soures told HT that Shah told party leaders to look for greener pastures to compensate any loss in these areas.

The BJP has high hopes from Odisha, where it could win just one of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, and West Bengal, which accounts for 42 parliamentary segments, of which two are with the BJP.

Shah told BJP leaders that Modi’s personal popularity has grown over the last three years, but the party cannot afford any laxity. He asked the party leaders to ensure anti-incumbency does not set in, and suggested that the organisation work closely with the local bodies to address grievance at the lowest level. “All surveys show BJP winning more than 300 seats if elections were held today,” said a BJP leader who attended the meeting."
UK to ban sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040,"Britain on Wednesday it will outlaw the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040 in a bid to cut air pollution but environmental groups said the proposals did not go far enough.

Environment minister Michael Gove announced the move as part of the government’s keenly-awaited 3 billion pounds (USD 3.9 billion, 3.4 billion euro) air pollution plan, which will demand that councils propose measures by March next year to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels.

The ban on petrol and diesel cars as well as vans follows a similar proposal by the French government, and will also include hybrid vehicles that have an electric motor and a petrol or diesel engine.

“The Conservatives had a manifesto promise to ensure that by 2050 there would be no diesel or petrol vehicles on the road and today we’re confirming that should mean no new diesel or petrol vehicles by 2040,” Gove told BBC Radio 4.

Britain’s High Court demanded that the government produce plans to tackle illegal NO2 pollution, largely caused by diesel emissions, and a draft report was published in May, but the full report was delayed by last month’s snap general election.

The government will provide local councils with 255 million pounds to bring NO2 levels to legal levels, with possible solutions including the removal of speed humps, reprogramming traffic lights and changing road layouts.

Campaigners want cities to impose entry fees on diesel drivers, but councils will only be allowed to do so if no other measures are available, with ministers wary of “punishing” drivers of cars who bought their vehicles in good faith, according to media reports.

“Diesel drivers are not to blame and, to help them switch to cleaner vehicles, the government will consult on a targeted scrappage scheme, one of a number of measures to support motorists affected by local plans,” a government spokesman said.

Gove added that he did not believe “that it is necessary to bring in charging.”

Campaign group ClientEarth warned that health issues “caused by exposure to illegal air pollution are happening now, so we need urgent action.”

Fellow campaigners Greenpeace also warned that the plans did not do enough to combat the immediate issue of NO2 pollution in cities

“While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,” said Areeba Hamid, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace UK.

“Providing a long term vision is not enough, (Michael) Gove still needs protect our health right now from toxic fumes polluting our streets.”

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that the move could cost jobs.

“Currently demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles is growing but still at a very low level as consumer have concern over affordability, range and charging points,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

“Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, we could undermine the UK’s successful automotive sector if we don’t allow enough time for the industry to adjust.”

Air pollution contributes to the death of more than 40,000 people per year in Britain, according to official figures, with nitrogen dioxide a particular problem.

Norway, which is aiming to end the use of all cars running on fossil fuels by 2025, offers generous tax breaks for electric vehicles as well as free parking and the use of bus lanes."

Hyundai Motor to launch electric vehicle with 500 km range after 2021,"Hyundai Motor Co said on Thursday it will launch a long-range electric vehicle with a driving range of 500 km (311 miles) per charge after 2021, seeking to address investor concerns that it is lagging rivals in the green car race.

The automaker and affiliate Kia Motors Corp, which together rank fifth in global vehicle sales, also said they are planning 31 eco-friendly models by 2020, up from a previously flagged 28.

The new additions include three plug-in hybrid vehicles, which come on top of eight battery-powered cars and two fuel-cell vehicles.

Battery-powered cars offered by the likes of Tesla are gaining traction faster than fuel cell vehicles backed by Hyundai and Toyota Motor Corp.

Last year, Hyundai launched its first mass-market pure electric car IONIQ, but the vehicle’s per-charge driving range is much shorter than offerings from Tesla and GM.

The automaker said will introduce an electric version of its Kona small sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a driving range of 390 km in the first half of next year.

It also confirmed a Reuters report that it is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges.

Hyundai unveiled a near production version of its new fuel cell SUV with a driving range of more than 800 km per charge under European standards, nearly double the 415 km for its current Tucson fuel cell SUV.

The mid-sized SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, followed by US and European markets.

A fuel cell electric bus is slated to be unveiled late this year, while a sedan-type fuel cell car is also planned."
Independence Day 2017: 9 films you won’t believe are about finding freedom,"Freedom has different meanings for different people. As India celebrates 70 years of independence, here’s looking at how freedom as a concept has been dealt with by the Hindi film industry. A woman caught within the bounds of patriarchy wants nothing more than making her own identity. A school kid burdened with the pressure of picking a certain career would love to pursue his dreams. Similarly, a businessman cowed down by the tax structure and bureaucracy would ask for a better system. In short, the idea of freedom varies from person to person. So, on this Independence Day, we decided to revisit films that promote the freedom of choice in unique ways.

Here are some films we selected:

I Am: Onir’s film narrated four stories set in different cities. Be it Juhi Chawla’s Megha or Sanjay Suri’s Abhimanyu, each story focussed on tales of personal suffering and belongingness. All four leading characters keep revisiting their past and how it shaped up their personalities. Then comes the time when they realise how they need to get out of their previous selves. Eventually it happens and the audience realises the value of coming out of your personal dark and accept the person you are.

Aligarh: A Marathi professor Ramchandra Siras (Manoj Bajpayee) working at the conservative Aligarh Muslim University faces a tough time because of his sexuality. The frail teacher tries to live a private life, but everybody seems to be taking a peek into his drawing room. Soon the level of suppression begins to touch a disturbing level. Eventually he dies, but leaves behind a voice against the oppression and how the society couldn’t protect an individual’s freedom to privacy.

Lipstick Under My Burkha: This again is the story of four women whose roles have been thrust open them by the society. If Konkona Sensharma doesn’t have the courage to confront her cheating husband, Aahana Kumra doesn’t know where she is heading in her love life as her partner doesn’t respect her. Similarly, Ratna Pathak Shah’s Bua ji is condemned for having a crush on a young swimming coach. The last story involves Plabita Borthakur, a college student, who thinks jeans is a way to claim her freedom from a conservative society. Director Alankrita Srivastava’s movie suggests that these women might be ready to take on the world.

Chauranga: Bikas Mishra’s debut feature tackled one of the most disturbing aspects of the Indian society - casteism. A dalit boy wants to study in a school like his elder brother, but he is not ready to bend his knees in front of Dhaval (Sanjay Suri), an upper-caste village strongman. His life gets more prone to problems when he falls for Dhaval’s daughter. It’s an intriguing tale of oppression, realisation and rebellion.

English Vinglish: Shashi Godbole’s (Sridevi) husband has never treated her more than a domestic help. Her inability to speak English becomes so much of a hindrance that even her children think her lesser for it. Things change drastically for her once she finds her lost confidence and courage to confront her demons. Ultimately, in a very powerful scene, she exposes the lack of depth in the characters of people around her. Gauri Shinde’s film describes how the freedom to live a life of your choice is important.

Rocket Singh Salesman Of The Year: One of the most underrated films of recent years, this was a man’s battle against corporate greed. Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) works overtime and goes way beyond his limits to set up a company that adheres to high standards and human values. Harpreet’s anxiety to break free from the clutches of his bosses and a valueless work culture was an internal fight that resembled many of us.

Queen: Rani (Kangana ranaut), a typical West Delhi girl, finds herself in a tough spot when her fiancé tells her that he no longer wishes to marry her. He has relocated to London and Rani maybe too desi for him now. She chooses to travel to Europe alone and this turns out to be the journey of her lifetime. She finds herself and realises that there is more to her life than being defined as someone’s wife.

Pink: A defining film of the year gone by, the Taapsee Pannu-starrer brought the concept of consent in the public discourse. Given the rampant crime against women in India that is a debate we need to have. In a key scene in the film, Kirti Kulhari accepts that she took money for soliciting. Even as the frame captures people’s reactions, she argues how even this doesn’t make the other person a master of her body."
"With pastures for cattle shrinking, India may have to import milk by 2021","India may have to import milk in four years, if it cannot increase fodder supply for its 299 million cattle, as rising pressure on land reduces pastures nationwide.

Spurred by rising incomes, a growing population and changing food preferences, the demand for milk and milk products will grow to at least 210 million tonnes by 2021–22, a rise of 36% over five years, according to government estimates. To meet this demand, production must grow by 5.5% per annum, according to the State of India’s Livelihood (SOIL) report. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, milk production grew at 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

To boost milk yield, India would need to generate 1,764 million tonnes of fodder by 2020, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of government data. But existing sources can only manage about 900 million tonnes of fodder–a shortage of 49%.

Demand for private consumption has risen from 5% per annum in the period 1998-2005 to 8.5% per annum between 2005 and 2012, according to an Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, report.

This demand and supply gap has pushed up milk prices by an average of 16% per annum, according to the according to the 2015 SOIL report.

States with top milk yields have more pastures

In the decade to 2015, milk production went up 59% from 92 million tonnes to 146 million tonnes in 2015. But fodder shortages may knock India off its position as the world’s top milk producer (it contributes nearly 17% of global production).

The milk productivity of India’s livestock is less than half (48%) of the global average: 987 kg per lactation compared to the global average of 2,038 kg per lactation.

The availability and quality of fodder has a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of milk productivity, the data show. All the three states that topped milk productivity in terms of gram per day–Rajasthan (704), Haryana (877) and Punjab (1,032)–had earmarked more than 10% of their cultivable land for pastures, according to the 2015 SOIL report. The national average is 337.

Currently, all three types of fodder are in short supply–green (63%), dry (24%) and concentrates (76%). Only 4% of total cultivable land in India is used for fodder production, a proportion that has remained stagnant for the last four decades.

Demand And Supply Of Fodder: An Estimate

Considering the demand for milk, land under fodder production needs to be doubled, according to this December 2016 report of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture.

Shortages are forcing states to now source fodder from elsewhere. “The quality of fodder is a concern. We are now looking to source fodder from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh),” said Sudhir Mishra, who runs a dairy farm in Ranchi (Jharkhand).

But major portions of grazing lands have either been degraded or encroached upon, according to the Parliamentary Committee report.

However, the availability of crop residues, the largest single source of fodder, has been impacted by increasing pressure on land and the replacement of traditional cereal crops, especially coarse ones. Crop residue includes coarse and fine straws, leguminous and pulses straws.

Given the importance of food and cash crops, it is very unlikely that the area under fodder cultivation will increase substantially, the parliamentary committee report said.

“If India fails to achieve substantial production growth, the country would need to resort to significant imports from the world market which has the potential to cause prices to spurt since India is a large consumer,” said 2015 SOIL report.

To cut costs, easy access to fodder is important for small farmers

Feed cost constitutes about 60-70% of operating expenses on dairy farms. Nearly 70% of India’s milk production comes from small and marginal farmers, who depend on homegrown fodder. Unlike big operators like Mishra, they cannot afford to buy fodder from other states.

Take the case of Dundappa Patil, a 10th-class pass from Belagavi in North Karnataka, who took a loan of Rs 35,000 for dairy farming eight years ago.

The process of applying and getting a loan for the enterprise was simple and quick because Patil was covered by a scheme for unemployed youth in Karnataka. He went through a crash course in dairy farming in Belagavi and in less than a month, set up business with four buffalo.

Patil’s target was to sell 20 litres of milk every day to a local co-operative society. But the yield per buffalo on Patil’s farm was less than 2 litres a day; his buffalo produced less than half the milk he hoped they would.

“I realised that just buying a good buffalo was not enough, quality and quantity of fodder too had to be good,” he said. “You have to be ready to spend a lot of time and money on sourcing fodder.”

Patil said he and other villagers were using a common pasture on a hill 5 km from the village. “But that is seasonal and not enough for the all the village cattle,” he said.

So, he tried buying the fodder, but then the business did not look viable.

The contribution of livestock to the incomes of landless and small farmers ranges between 20-50%, and the poorer the family, the greater the potential of dairy farming’s contribution to livelihood, according to the SOIL report.

Unlike agriculture, which tends to be seasonal, dairy farming provides returns through the year. It can minimise the risks agricultural households face when they run short of cash.

In Belgavi, that scenario did not work for Patil because he could not overcome the fodder shortage–an issue India must address if it is to be self-sufficient in milk and dairy farming is to succeed.

Eventually, after a year, Patil sold the buffalo and repaid half the loan. The bank waived the rest after failing to recover it. Today, he is a construction worker in Belagavi city.

Sharad Yadav in deal with Lalu to launch son from Bihar’s Madhepura in 2019?,"Janata Dal (United) Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Yadav, at odds with the official leadership of his party, is understood to have struck a deal with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad to field his son as the RJD candidate for the Madhepura seat in the next Lok Sabha poll.

Yadav has expressed his disagreement with JD (U) president Nitish Kumar’s decision last month to jettison the 20 month old grand alliance government in Bihar last month and to form a new one with the BJP, with himself has CM.

Much against the wishes of the JD (U)’s official leadership, Yadav has commenced a tour of Bihar on Thursday, dubbed the Jan Samvad Yatra, to “gauge public mood”. He has been sharing stage with RJD leaders and has been openly critical of the JD (U) leadership..

RJD insiders said Lalu had ‘agreed’ to field Sharad’s son Shantanu Bundela, a post graduate from London University, from Bihar as a quid pro quo for the JD (U) veteran’s ‘rebellion’ against Nitish Kumar. “The move suits both the Yadav stalwarts’ common agenda to keep CM Kumar on tenterhooks”, said a party leader.

However, no official confirmation of this move was available immediately.

Sharad’s supporters point out he had already been sidelined in the JD U). As such, getting for his son the Madhepura in north Bihar, which he had represented four times but, as JD (U) candidate, had lost to RJD’s Rajesh Ranjan aka Pappu Yadav, in 2014, sounded like a good deal.

Madhepura, a Yadav stronghold and land of BP Mandal, whose Mandal commission report formed the basis of job reservation for the other backward classes, in the early 1990s, is “available” in the sense that Pappu was expelled from RJD in May 2015 for questioning Lalu’s ‘family-centric’ politics.

The Madhepura seat was won by Sharad four times between 1991 and 2009, whereas Lalu, who broke away from the original Janata Dal, to form the RJD in July 1997, won the seat in 2004. In 2014, RJD’s Pappu Yadav won it, defeating JD (U)’s Sharad.

Despite being represented by political heavyweights, development has largely eluded Madhepura. An electric locomotive factory cleared during Lalu’s tenure as railway minister (2004-09) is still in a limbo. As its MP, Sharad has also faced flak for being away from the constituency and doing little for its development.

Old associates of Sharad are of the view that his ‘move’ to launch his son as RJD candidate was a gambit, considering sitting MP Pappu, who wields influence in Madhepura, had given no indication he was ready to give up the seat.

“Also, it won’t look very good for Sharad to launch his son in politics, considering he has always opposed dynastic politics”, said a Sharad supporter.

But at the veteran socialist leader hit Muzaffarpur district of north Bihar on Friday, his mood remained defiant. He accused party chief Nitish Kumar of intimidating his (Sharad’s) supporters. “They are handing out the threat of expulsion from the JD (U). This is intolerable”, he said."
‘End of combustion engine-powered car’: Volvo to go all electric from 2019,"Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday all new models launched from 2019 will be fully electric or hybrids, spelling the eventual end to nearly a century of Volvos powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids.

Volvo’s plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.

“This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,” Volvo Cars chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully or partially electric.

“These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,” Volvo said.

“This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.”

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division.

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made."
Janmashtami 2017: Actor Nitish Bharadwaj recollects his days from the Mahabharat,"If Krishna is usually cherished for his raas leela, then he’s also remembered for his sermon of Bhagvad Gita, and his significant role in the Mahabharata. Mention the classic TV series Mahabharat by BR Chopra and actor Nitish Bharadwaj’s strong portrayal, fluent dialogue delivery and impeccable body language comes to mind.

On the occasion of Janmashtami, the actor recollects that it was his knowledge that made him accept the offer of playing Krishna in the TV show. “My knowledge of the scriptures, Sanskrit language, reading of various analyses of Mahabharata from Marathi literature, and most importantly [it was] my mother’s faith in me that I can perform Krishna with all my strengths,” says Bharadwaj.

It isn’t, however, just the serious tales from the sets that remain afresh in his mind. He says, “It was day one of Roopa Ganguly’s shoot on the sets. Everyone was eager to meet her as the stories of her beauty had preceded her entry on the sets. I know of people who had planned to impress her. I was sitting in one corner, reading Osho’s book on Krishna. Roopa made the entry, met Ravi Chopra, Dharam Chopra (the DoP of the serial), saw me and came straight to sit with me and introduced herself. While she was telling me of a Bengali novel, she read about Draupadi and Krishna, almost the entire cast was green with envy or jealousy and were giving me dirty looks. I was greatly amused!”

The actor says that playing the character of Krishna on screen, changed him as an individual, off scren too. “It sensitised me to understand various aspects of Krishna’s persona, his beliefs and the virtues he stood for. But, it was the school of life, which took me on a roller coaster ride later, and taught me to apply Krishna’s principles to my life events. It’s the application of knowledge, which changes you as a human being. It is up to a man to choose to remain sane or go insane in times of distress,” he explains.

“Krishna is a timeless phenomenon. So, it is important to bring out the relevance of his philosophy in each era.” — Nitish Bharadwaj, actor

Krishna’s philosophies inspired Bharadwaj to the extent that when he was offered to re-enact the role for a Delhi group The Films and Theatre Society (FTS), he agreed “because the writer agreed to make the script relevant to today’s times. Krishna is a timeless phenomenon. So, it is important to bring out the relevance of his philosophy in each era.”

Today, when he performs in the Capital and his audience meets him backstage post performance, he feels elated: “I would be a hypocrite if say it doesn’t affect me. I love it. Artistes thrive on appreciation of work. But my thoughts at such moments are of gratitude to Lord Krishna, Maa Bhagawati and my parents. I am always humbled by people’s love and respect, and constantly remind myself of my social responsibility, which Krishna calls Loka Sangraha.”

And, what’s the relevance of Janmashtami in his life? “Janmashtami is the birth of every virtue that Krishna stood for — breaking the shackles of bondage, surviving in most adverse conditions, challenging the system if it is going wrong, establishing harmony in social order, justice, equality, uproot an obsolete and unfair political order to establish new ones wherein everyone has a voice, true meaning of submission to the Lord, Nishkaam Karma Yoga (dispassionate Karma), and the sense of duty with detachment. We must give birth to these virtues in our own heart and act in life proactively.”

"Kuldeep Yadav in mix for 2019 ICC World Cup spot, says chief selector MSK Prasad","The core group of Indian team management wants to have a proper plan in place for young chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who is expected to play a big role for the national team across formats in the long run.

With Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja plying their trade in English county circuit, young Kuldeep will lead the spin attack against Sri Lanka.

However skipper Virat Kohli, chief coach Ravi Shastri and chairman of selectors Ravi Shastri want to handle the UP youngster with a lot of care.

Kuldeep is certainly in mix for the 2019 World Cup in England.

“We have a keen eye on both short and long term objectives. We cannot ignore the forthcoming home cycle wherein India will play Australia and New Zealand in limited- overs’ cricket and we also have to build for England in 2019,” Prasad told mediapersons yesterday.

“We wanted to start this process with the limited-overs’ tour to West Indies’ itself, but we couldn’t do it because of the short change-around time after the Champions Trophy. We had to send the same team to the Caribbean as we did to England,” Prasad added.

While limited overs cricket can’t be ignored, India’s gruelling away season will kickstart with a tour to South Africa in early 2018.

“We also have to consider Test cricket and India have three tough challenges in South Africa, England and Australia in 2018. We have to prepare for all formats simultaneously, and in hindsight, this county stint for our senior bowlers opens a great window of opportunity for us,” Prasad added.

While he is still the third choice spinner in Test squad, Kuldeep seems to have made it his own after some good performances.

“A chinaman bowler is slightly different from what people usually face so they can make an impact longer than other bowlers. But you still have to keep working on your game, keep finding ways to make batsmen think twice and take those wickets, giving the team breakthroughs.

Kohli has a word of caution for Kuldeep -- work hard in order to maintain consistency in form and top level fitness.

“Kuldeep will have to keep working hard on his game. He is a great talent, we know that, but to keep that fitness and form going, he has to keep working hard. He has the desire to do so. We have faith in him, and he has delivered every time he has played. So it is a great sign for him,” said the skipper."
"THE CLASS OF 2018: When parents are short on time and money, kids struggle in school","""Every time a parent asks how the student is doing, they do better,"" says Sanu. ""As SMC members, we have a direct channel with their teachers, too. So kids know that we are not only reliant on their words to know how they are performing. I can easily ask their teachers."" Both Sanu and Devi agreed that getting to know teachers cultivates in their children a certain sort of productive ""fear"".

As the education levels of Chandrashekhar's children has surpassed his own, he says he has become less involved in their lives.

Where Sanu and Devi are assertive, Chandrashekhar is diffident. ""My kids are more educated than me now,"" he says. ""How do I help them out at home? All I do is ask them once in a while how they are doing at school, if they have done their homework. That is all.""

Yet Chandrashekhar's son, Arvind, who is in Class 9 at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, says he benefits from personal attention from his father. ""When my father asks me about school, it makes me feel like he cares. It matters what I do and how I perform in school. I think I work extra hard on the days he asks.""

Saransh Vaswani, the co founder of Saajha, a not for profit organisation that works to enable parents to participate in the learning of their children and the School Management Committees, confirms that frequent interactions between parents and students are crucial — no matter how educated the parents are.

""It's okay if you are not literate,"" he says. ""You could interact with your child while you are cooking, talk to them about shapes and colours. We have even given parents and students simple worksheets to fill out together. Simple things like, match the 'ba' with 'batak'.""

But like Chandrashekhar, his wife, Vimala Devi, and his other child, Jyoti, 21, also work long hours at intensive jobs, leaving them with only so much time and energy to interact with the Nikki and Arvind afterward. Vimala Devi and Jyoti each work at a garment factory in Okhla. Vimala Devi makes Rs. 6,000 a month; Jyoti makes Rs. 7,000. They work from 8am until 8pm most days, leaving Nikki to do household chores in addition to their schoolwork.

""I come back late from work. I don't even have time to ask about her studies sometimes,"" says Vimala Devi of Nikki.

Vimala Devi passed through only eighth grade; Chandrashekhar didn't make it past Class 5. Jyoti, who makes a strong effort to help her siblings, had to quit school during Class 8.

Jyoti's foreshortened time in school was a direct result of her family's poverty. She now plays the role of a surrogate parent to her siblings.

The end of a dream

Jyoti's foreshortened time in school was a direct result of her family's poverty.

""I always wanted to study and become 'something', 'someone',"" she recollects. ""From the seventh grade, I knew I wanted to become a doctor. My mom used to fall ill often, you see? So I wanted to treat her.""

This dream ended in 2008 when her father fell ill with multiple masses in his kidneys. She was in seventh grade. The family had to leave their small village in Uttar Pradesh for Delhi so that her father could seek treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

""When we moved to Delhi, we soon realised that we could not afford the expenses if I did not work too,"" says Jyoti. She joined her mother at a factory making, she says, ""chamkeeli things"", shiny trinkets that were decorated with small mirrors and sequins.

""I remember having to beg her boss to give me a job as well,"" says Jyoti. ""I was not 14 yet, so it was illegal to employ me. Saab finally relented and allowed me to work there, helping with some of the handiwork, for around Rs. 1,200 per month. They used to make me hide in boxes or send me out to play at the time of inspections.""

Though the new job meant that Jyoti could support her parents and siblings, it also meant that she would never become a doctor.

""Now I try to live out my dreams by playing a doctor at home when somebody falls ill,"" Jyoti says. ""Even when neighbours fall ill, I talk to the doctors about it and then prescribe the medicines they suggest.""

Though many parents realize that education is central to the future success of their kids, it is a long-term investment with no immediate returns.

The financial straits of Chandrashekhar's family is typical of other families in the pahadi school. The average household income is about Rs.10,000 to Rs. 20,000 a month, according to Sonu Nijhawan, the vice principal.

Teachers say they regularly see how the academic futures of their students are thwarted by the poverty of their families.

""One instance that I will never forget is that of Madhu,"" says Neelam Sanjeeta Minj, the teacher who is in charge of the school's management committee. ""One of our bright students, though she had only secured a 68% in her tenth grade. Her family was originally from a village in Rajasthan, and her father worked as a halwai here in Delhi. She had to discontinue her studies and go back to her village because her father was not earning enough to sustain a family here in Delhi. I still remember her crying.""

Much though many parents realise that education is central to the future success of their kids, it is a long-term investment with no immediate returns. For poorer families, it often must be sacrificed.

""I keep telling Nikki to study,"" Jyoti says. ""I even ask her to not do the household work. I say I will make dinner after I get home; I usually ask her to make use of the time to study.""

Wondering about the future

""Hum toh padh nahin paye, humare bache to padhe (We were not able to study, but we would like our kids to study)."" This belief, according to Minj, is the driving force behind many success stories of kids whose ""stubborn"" parents insisted they get an education.

Jyoti is largely uneducated herself, works a difficult job, and comes home exhausted. Still, she has intuited what Minj learned from experience, and is determined, as a kind of surrogate parent, to provide her siblings with the unflagging attention and support that they need.

""I keep telling Nikki to study,"" she says. ""I even ask her to not do the household work. I say I will make dinner after I get home; I usually ask her to make use of the time to study... I sometimes yell at them when I see them squander away the opportunity given to them by goofing around. You are allowed to play, of course, but you need to study.""

Nikki dreams of teaching Hindi someday, and regularly practises by helping classmates with their homework. If she succeeds in becoming a teacher, it would radically change her family's circumstances.

Nikki has noticed her sister's efforts. ""'Padhle (study) Nikki, padhle.' This is something you will hear often in this house,"" she says. She dreams of teaching Hindi someday, and regularly practises by helping classmates with their homework. If Nikki succeeds in becoming a teacher, it would radically change her family's circumstances. A senior secondary school teacher in Delhi government schools can make as much as Rs. 55,000 a month.

Nikki's teachers say that she is receiving high marks, but getting that job at a government school wouldn't be easy: she'd have to complete an MA and BEd in Hindi and pass an additional set of tests even to be considered.

Jyoti has devoted herself to the difficult task of supporting the education of her siblings. But she is also acutely aware of how different Nikki's future might be different from her own. The eldest child wonders what her life would have been like if she hadn't dropped out of school.

""My siblings, especially the youngest brother, call me uneducated at times,"" Jyoti says. ""It is usually when I insist he go finish his homework or schoolwork. But when he calls me 'unpadh', I get angry, upset, all at once. I sometimes take it out on my parents. I ask them why they let their other kids study, but did not send me to school. I know it was not a choice they were happy making. It was something they were forced to do. But sometimes, I ask anyway."""
Okja movie review: The first great film of 2017 has arrived. Protect it fiercely. 5 stars,"Okja

Director - Bong Joon-ho

Cast - Ahn Seo-hyun, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins

Rating - 5/5

If getting booed at the Cannes Film Festival is considered a badge of honour, it is a badge Okja must wear with pride.

It joins a list of films – a list that will probably have you performing an almost comical double-take in a moment – that for various bizarre reasons, found themselves at the receiving end of the famously snooty French crowd’s ire.

In ’76, it was Martin Scorsese’s bleak and brutal Taxi Driver. In ’94, it was Quentin Tarantino’s cultural watershed Pulp Fiction. And in 2011, it was Terrence Malick’s masterpiece, The Tree of Life. Each of these classics was heckled at their Cannes screenings. And each of these films, despite the heckling, won the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or.

In 2017, the honour (the booing, but sadly not the Palme) went to Okja, the new film by cult South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho – although for reasons we’ve never heard before. Despite ending with one of the most unexpectedly forceful tonal shifts in recent memory – the film goes from being a magical, Miyazaki-esque fable, to a horrifying skewering of mankind in the space of 30 minutes – the most controversial moment in Okja’s Cannes premiere came before it even began. When the Netflix logo ‘duh-dum-ed’ its way onto the screen, the old-school crowd let its disapproval (and fear of the future) be known. Critic David Ehrlich, tweeting from inside the Palais, described it as a ‘prison riot environment.’

It’s natural, as spoiled, needy human beings, for us to want better, never satisfied with what we have. Similarly, it is natural, while the glorious Okja unfolds before your eyes, to wonder just how different it would be on a big screen. Would it be better? Would it be worse? Would the lush Korean landscapes be more breathtaking? Or would the cracks in the CGI be more visible?

Tilda Swinton as Lucy Mirando in OKJA

We will never know. And that is OK. Because despite making the cardinal sin of not being made available to your local multiplex, Okja does what most event movies and summer blockbusters, proudly shot in IMAX, can’t. It cares about its characters, its tone, its craft, and it has enough confidence in you, the audience, to stick with it, even when it becomes too challenging, and even when the mirror it holds up to your face reveals all the blemishes you’ve been trying to hide.

Its story begins several years ago, in a colourful prologue. Tilda Swinton plays the CEO of a powerful multi-national corporation, who, with great fanfare, announces the discovery of a new pig-like creature that her company will breed, and then ship off to 26 far-flung corners of the world, to live with local farmers.

10 years later, in a remote mountain-top farm in South Korea, one of the creatures, now grown up, bounds across the gorgeous countryside, a young girl by its side. She is Mija, the granddaughter of one of the farmers chosen to care for the animal, and she has named it, also a girl, Okja. This is their world. It is all they have. And it is all they need.

Wordlessly, with the aid of some truly wonderful creature design and visual effects, Bong conveys the essence of his film these opening scenes. It is a story about nature and nurture. It is a story about being an innocent child trapped in a harsh world run by adults who’ve been ruined by it, by greed, and by success.

But above all else, it is a story about the evil of mankind, and the depths to which we are capable of sinking. Much like his previous movie, the monumentally underrated Snowpiercer (another film in which he gave Tilda Swinton a memorably despicable character to play), Okja, too is a science fiction story, just as nihilistic, just as furious at our hypocrisy, and just as unforgettable.

OKJA

Like Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, it addresses real-life horrors by replacing images seared into our minds with fantasy, with animals, and with humour.

And fantasy is what Mija needs, when one day, a sweaty, moustachioed, obnoxious American hikes up to her farm. He is Dr Johnny Wilcox, employee of the Tilda Swinton’s MNC, played by a screechingly over-the-top Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes bearing terrible news. In one fell swoop, he destroys Mija’s world. He has come to take Okja away from her.

Jake Gyllenhaal as Dr. Johnny Wilcox in Okja.

Mija’s grandfather, a poor farmer, has already made the deal. It’ll keep food on their bellies. Perhaps it’ll pay for her education too. He’s only coming through the promise he made to her dead parents. He’s taking care of their daughter.

But Mija isn’t the sort of girl to take injustice lying down. She isn’t the sort of girl to resign herself to her fate – or to let Okja fall prey to hers. She packs a bag, breaks open her piggy bank, and journeys across the world to New York, where she plans to break into the headquarters of the Mirando Corporation, and rescue Okja.

Along the way, she is joined by members of the ALF (Animal Liberation Front), played by Paul Dano, Lilly Collins and Steven Yeun, who, despite having their own twisted agenda, are the closest the film comes to having decent people (besides Mija, of course).

OKJA

In a fair world, Okja would have the power to make even the most belligerent meat eaters consider vegetarianism. It would make us question the truths we ignorantly accept. It would make us seek answers, challenge the consumerist culture we so blindly embrace. It would inspire change. But – and Okja would be the first to remind us of this – the world is hardly a fair place.

As an animal lover, I wouldn’t wish the very particular emotional jolt this movie delivers on my worst enemy. Be warned: There is very little hope here. There is only bleakness. But there’s no turning away from Okja. We must spread word about it. We must champion it. Because it is the first great film of 2017.

Eunice de Souza (1940-2017): No Tears in the Eye of the Storm,"Eunice de Souza (1940-2017) never had the slightest patience with the claims of a normality imposed by consensus or authority. Not one to be trapped in a ghetto, whether ethnic, academic or political, she early embraced the rapture of all that was strange and liberating. In her poem ‘Return’, she revisits the moment when she first heard the French Jesuit and translator Guy Deleury, then resident at the Christa Prema Seva Ashram, read the Marathi saint-poet Tukaram’s abhangas:

Tuka, forgive my familiarity.

I have loved your pithy verses

ever since that French priest

everyone thought mad

recited them, and told us

of his journey with your people.

…

You made life hard for your wife

and I’m not sure I approve of that.

Nor did you heed her last request:

Come back soon.

Deleury, with his lifelong devotion to Tukaram and to India’s Bhakti literature of ecstasy and protest, was an emancipatory part of de Souza’s growing up in Poona, where she was born in 1940. Demonstrating her refusal to conform to what she experienced as the stifling pieties and norms of her Goan Catholic birth community, she sought out unusual, even eccentric figures like Deleury (who later renounced his priestly calling and entered secular life) and the Santiniketan-trained Goan émigré artist Angelo da Fonseca, whose radiant Indianisation of Christian iconography had prompted orthodox opinion to cast him into exterior darkness. Such presences, and the pathways they opened up, nourished de Souza’s imagination.

At the same time, as a young poet and academic, de Souza articulated the difficulties confronted by a woman making her way in the India of the 1960s and 1970s, a postcolonial society in which feudalism and patriarchy continued to dominate public life and the accepted perception of gender destiny. As a student in the Midwest at the beginning of the 1960s, de Souza would surely have caught the thrum of dissidence that would soon challenge the American ascendancy in the name of race, gender and sexual choice during the civil rights movements. Although she returned to India in 1963, these revolutions in thought and practice inspired her at a distance. While the label ‘confessional’ is a reductive and inadequate one, de Souza’s encounter with the work of such poets as Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and Adrienne Rich offered her models of poetry that opened up forms of public expression for women, forms that allowed for the naming and saying of personal experiences that had no place in a patriarchal framework.

Eunice de Souza with former chief minister of Kashmir Omar Abdullah at the Goa Art & Literature Festival, 2012. ((Siddesh Mayenkar/Herald Review))

De Souza’s feminism was mapped along a spectrum from the sardonic to the ferocious. Some of her targets were more fortunate than others. Tukaram, loved for his startling and often irreverent poetry of mystical transport, is gently rebuked for his indifference to his wife’s struggles. But in the precisely titled ‘Autobiographical’, de Souza appears to pay the patriarchy back in its own coin before recording the insight that structural violence replicates itself in an internalised counter-violence of the individual that is every bit as corrosive and depleting:

I thought the whole world

was trying to rip me up

cut me down go through me

with a razor blade

then I discovered

a cliché: that’s what I wanted

to do to the world.

In the later ‘Songs of Survival’, she registers a move towards a more stoic, ironic stance, not resignation so much as wisdom:

Practice grave courtesy:

there are no tears in the

eye of the storm.

Survive to know you can.

There is little to be said

for suffering.

It has been tempting for many readers to interpret de Souza’s poetry as the unfolding chronicle of an embattled self constantly crafting idioms of belonging in a hostile world. While this account has its own relevance, a survey of her expanded practice reveals the opposite of self-absorption. Her approach to the world was versatile and founded on a restless curiosity. Throughout her career, de Souza was active as a literary critic, editor, researcher, and columnist. She wrote art criticism for some years, and retained a lively interest in the visual arts. She wrote books for children and compiled benchmark anthologies such as These My Words: The Penguin Book of Indian Poetry, a collaboration with her lifelong friend and colleague Melanie Silgardo.

To mourn de Souza is also to mourn a period and a milieu in Bombay’s cultural life when the arts had not become narrowly professionalised and mutually separated, and when compelling intellectual and artistic synergies exploded across the scene. Writers and painters, architects and filmmakers, activists and advertising professionals met, formed friendships and collegialities, often collaborated, or inspired one another’s enterprises. Poets like Nissim Ezekiel transited between academia and the visual arts. Poets like Arun Kolatkar and Dilip Chitre straddled the worlds of literature and advertising. Poets like Adil Jussawalla were active in academia, journalism and publishing. These cultural experimenters and their contemporaries were responsive to theatre and music, often working together with colleagues to develop work beyond the page. Many of them were engaged in translation, as a bridge between languages and language-universes separated by historical circumstances. They were committed to keeping the transmission lines of literature open, whether through little magazines or small presses, as the splendid recent research of scholars like Laetitia Zecchini and Anjali Nerlekar has shown.

While the Clearing House publishing collective has, correctly, received retrospective acclaim for its role in this history, the 1960s and 1970s were animated by numerous, often intersecting, mutually replenishing reading circles and publishing platforms of varying longevity. Among these were the circle around Nissim Ezekiel at the PEN, the salons that Kamala Das convened, imprints such as Pras Prakashan, and successors to Clearing House such as Newground and Praxis, which published de Souza’s early collections of poetry. The critical, vigorously recalcitrant, self-renewing energies of this background continued to pulse through Eunice de Souza’s work until the very end. Wintry as its wisdom sounds, her last book of poems, Learn from the Almond Leaf, published last year, offers us unquiet, incandescent meditations like ‘A Smattering of Rain’:

A smattering of rain,

Earth lets off steam.

A hawk falls.

A volcano upchucks.

Watch it!

Earth’s heart is still

smouldering.

What's it like to get trolled all day long? Take a look.,"What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included."

BCCI seeks government nod involving Pakistan in 2018 Asia Cup after U-19 snub,"The BCCI will seek the government’s clearance to conduct the 2018 Asia Cup, involving Pakistan, in India despite losing the hosting rights of the U-19 event due to Pakistan Cricket Board’s objections.

“We had written to the government for the U-19 Asia Cup three months ago and we did not get a response. So the event had to be shifted to Malaysia. Now for the senior event, we will again write to the government as there cannot be an Asia Cup without an India or Pakistan,” a BCCI official, who did not wish to be quoted, told PTI.

“The India-Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup is the marquee clash. If that doesn’t happen, the tournament is meaningless. And let me make it clear, it is not about playing Pakistan in a bilateral event, it is a multi-team event like any ICC event,” the official added.

Despite the tensions between the two countries, India and Pakistan have been playing each other in world events and recently battled it out twice in the Champions Trophy in England in June. The women’s team, which reached the final of the women’s World Cup, too played against Pakistan in the round robin stage of the tournament.

“Like any ICC event, Asia Cup also involves other teams and an India-Pakistan clash is unavoidable,” said the official.

He further said that the Asia Cup, which was earlier planned for June, will now be played in the second half of the year.

“The rain could be a factor in June, therefore it was agreed to shift the tournament to September or October. The the final dates will be announced soon.”

At the Asian Cricket Council meeting in Sri Lanka last week, it was decided that the U-19 Asia Cup will have to be moved out of India to Malaysia and will be held in November.

Pakistan, where no big team has played post the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009, had opposed playing in India citing security seasons. Sri Lanka, however, have agreed to tour Pakistan next month.

“We waited for government clearance for three months and after no clarity, the ACC decided to shift the tournament to Malaysia,” the official said confirming that the Indian U-19 team will be playing Pakistan in the event to be held in Malaysia."
Cannes 2017: Naomi Kawase’s Radiance is radiantly refreshing,"The Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, is a Cannes Film Festival veteran, and has had several of her movies play here. She has also been on Cinefondation and Short Film Jury in 2016. Her 2015 Sweet Bean (An in Japanese) - which was part of the festival’s A Certain Regard -- was a extraordinarily touching story of an old woman who helps a dorayaki shop to become popular with her yummy bean paste.

Equally moving is Kawase’s latest, Radiance (Hikari in Japanese), where the auteur takes us into the world of the blind and partially-sighted -- tracing the relationship between a photographer whose vision is fading and a woman who pens movie audio descriptions.

Kawase uses disability most artfully to weave a love story between Misako (Misaki Ayame) - who is writing a description for the visually challenged -- and Nakamori (Nagase Masatoshi), a celebrated photographer. He is one of Misako’s listeners. On the verge of blindness, he is caustic and angry. Misako has her own tragedies to grapple with: a father who mysteriously disappeared several years ago and a mother sinking into dementia. Perhaps these misfortunes push her to understand Nakamori’s frustration.

Radiance is a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr.

Radiance -- Kawase’s fifth work to debut in the festival’s Competition and a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr -- draws us softly into Nakamori’s and Misako’s world that sees disillusionment, rage and arguments till a chance meeting pulls them towards each other. An emotionally charged scene in which he feels her face is far more erotic than a kiss they share later.

Brilliantly photographed in soft light, Radiance is a work that haunts us with its delicate treatment and subtle messages. Something that is a typical Kawase, whose Radiance loyally follows in the path of her many films in the past, particular Sweet Bean.

Even as users like you and me are becoming more used to a ‘smarter’ lifestyle, there are still some tiny yet persistent problems that slow you down. Come India’s 70th Independence Day, let’s use these simple steps to make our lives digitally smarter.

Pesky calls, texts

Who doesn’t get annoyed by calls from unknown numbers offering new schemes? Funny thing, all these pesky calls come especially when you are middle of something important. Well, we all have faced it. Fortunately, there are a few workarounds.

One of the first things you might want to do is getting registered to Telecom Regulatory authority of India’s (TRAI) National Do Not Call Registry (NDNC) aka Do Not Disturb (DND). In order to get your number on the DND list, you need to send an SMS ‘START 0’ to 1909 or you can simply make a call at toll-free number 1909.

Users receive an SMS informing about registration in the NDNC. Do note that DND activation takes up to 2-3 days. You can check the status of your DND registration in the NDNC list by clicking here.

You can also use the TRAI service for getting rid of pesky SMSes. The regulator has divided the promotional messages in primarily seven categories – banking, real estate, education, health, consumer goods and automobiles, entertainment and tourism. To block SMS from, say banking, send an SMS “STOP 1” to 1909.

If you are an Android user, you also have the option to download TRAI’s DND app from Google Play store.

Registering on the DND list may filter out a lot of pesky calls and texts, but you think it’s still paltry, you may give a shot at Truecaller app. Available for both Android and iOS, Truecaller allows users to see live caller ID and identify unknown calls, block spam SMS and calls. TrueCaller works better on Android than iOS.

Battery life

There are a very few smartphones that can actually run an entire day. A lot of us are usually scrambling for a charging port or a charger by end of the day. One of the easiest ways is to simply carry a portable powerbank. There are tones of affordable power banks available online. For an example, I use Xiaomi’s 10,000mAh portable charger, which is available online for Rs 1,199.

The Xiaomi Mi Powerbank is business card sized. (Xiaomi )

In case you are not carrying a powerbank or intend to buy one, you can still optimise the battery life of your smartphone through a few simple tricks. Before we elaborate, Android users can go to Settings> Battery > Use any of the battery modes depending upon your requirements. Nowadays, most of the Android phones come with a dedicated battery optimisation mode that help elongate battery life of the smartphone. Apple iPhone users can also do the same by going to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode.

In order to draw more juice from the battery, you can try out following things:

1 Disable location, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and data

2 Reduce the screen brightness to minimum

3 Deactivate apps that have been set to auto-sync or always on

4 Kill the background apps

5 Airplane mode (will disable cellular connectivity)

Documents organisation

For a lot of works including some government applications, a scanned copy is necessary. Not all of us have scanners at home. Well, even if some of us do, we cannot carry our scanners all the time. For an example, I had to send scanned copies of offer letter, appointment letter and relieving letter to my new employer. While I had the hard copy of those documents, the scanner at my office wasn’t working. So here’s what I did.

I downloaded the HP Smart app, which actually allows me to remotely control my Wi-Fi enabled printer/scanner/copier at my home. While one can remotely send command to the printer to scan the copy, one can also click a photo of the document through the smartphone camera, save it as PDF (a more accepted form of scanned documents) or .JPEG image. The documents can be arranged, renamed and shared it over the email, Google Drive and social networking apps like WhatsApp and Messenger. You can also try out Adobe Scan app for iOS and Android.

Some of the smartphones, like Gionee’s, come preloaded with a Document mode within the camera app as well.

Limited phone storage

You may think limited phone storage is a third-world problem or of those having lower-end phones. Well, you’re right, mostly. I use an iPhone 6 16GB model and most of the time its storage is almost full. I plead guilty for not deleting a lot of older photos, and even my iCloud photos backup has ran out of the storage. Well, Google Photos is the best option available at the moment.

Available for both Android and iOS, the Google Photos app allows you to back up your photos, access on-the-go and the best thing is you get unlimited storage if you choose the option to compress photos to 16-megapixel. Videos that are higher than 1080p resolution will be resized 1080p. You can check your Google storage plan here.

Google lets you back up unlimited photos and videos for free in ‘High Quality’. (Google)

Besides Google Photos, you can always use apps like Apple iCloud Library, Amazon Photos, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox among others to backup your data.

In order to further optimize the space on your Android smartphone, you can try out Lite versions of the apps like Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Flipkart, Snapdeal and LinkedIn. Of course, the experience is not on par with the main versions of the app, but these Lite apps work well on lower-end phones and slower 2G data network.

If you like to listen to music a lot on-the-go but face the problem of limited storage on the smartphone, I’d recommend you stream music from apps like Saavn and Gaana. These apps allow you to save the music and listen later offline. A paid subscription should not hurt much, I assume. Or, you can simply use YouTube’s offline feature.

While iPhone users don’t have the luxury of microSD cards, Android users, on the other hand, can very well use them to optimise built-in storage on the smartphone. If your smartphone runs on Android Marshmallow and above, you can use microSD card as an internal storage. Once you insert a microSD card, you will get two options -- use microSD card as internal storage and use microSD as portable storage. Choose the former. Do note, not all the smartphone brands allow using microSD as internal storage.

Email clutter

If you are a professional or student, emails are pretty much part of your day-to-day routine. But of course not all the emails need to be seen immediately or responded. While Google and Microsoft do a pretty decent job at categorising the emails for your, still you will need to do a bit more with them.

Google’s Inbox is a pretty decent service that helps improve productivity. The service shows you highlights instantly without needing to dig through emails, add reminders to the top of your inbox and even set snooze emails reminders that should come back to your inbox whenever you want. One of the best things is it allows you to bundle group messages and get rid of the clutter. You can also further customise the bundle by grouping emails from social network, promotions, purchases, and so on.

If your Gmail storage is full, you can delete emails containing heavy files with this simple process – just enter has:attachment larger:1M to search for emails that contain files more than 1MB in size. You can also narrow down the search to specific date and even larger files if you want. Don’t forget to clean your trash folder for Gmail to reflect your actual storage."

Asian crisis: Virat Kohli-led India need series with Pakistan | Opinion,"There couldn’t have been a more apt Independence Day gift for India than the first clean sweep in an away Test series. This was also the first time a subcontinent team was blanked at home by a neighbour in a series of three or more Tests. That part, despite India’s obvious joy, is slightly worrying.

While credit must be given to Virat Kohli’s team for breaching Sri Lanka’s defences in 2015 before bulldozing them this time, it’s also an indicator of the slow death of Asian rivalry and invincibility. Pakistan can’t host a Test tour, Bangladesh --- despite their limited-overs success --- are not out of Test infancy, while Sri Lanka look scarily depleted and clueless after the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Muttiah Muralitharan.

(Read | India dismiss Sri Lanka to complete 3-0 rout, script historic cricket series win)

That leaves India as the undisputed subcontinent masters. Beat them at home and no team would be faulted for feeling on top of the world. India too wouldn’t mind the extra bit of attention England or Australia may devote to them. But what happens to the balance of world cricket?

At the turn of the century and even some years later, the subcontinent had its own way of sowing doubts in the minds of touring teams. Win in Lahore and the visitors would get a fitting reply in Karachi. If the touring seamers got movement at Eden Gardens, Chepauk shocked their batsmen with sharp turn. And by the time a tour of Sri Lanka arrived, many teams simply gave up. There was no respite from the subcontinent’s miseries even if one tour’s challenge was negated.

(Read | Sri Lanka’s spineless show vs India leaves players, board with mountain to climb)

That’s why Ricky Ponting’s Australia is considered one of the best ever to tour the subcontinent, after beating Sri Lanka 3-0 and India 2-1 in 2004. This drubbing of Sri Lanka at the hands of ‘good friends’ India sends out a message that barring one country, the subcontinent may not stoke fear anymore. Zimbabwe have already given considerable shape to that fear by winning the ODI series in Sri Lanka in July before giving them a run for their money in the solitary Test.

That is why we need Pakistan to host tours as soon as possible. The ICC has tried to balance the Asian power struggle by pitting India and Pakistan often in the Future Tours Programme (FTP). According to the FTP, Pakistan were scheduled to host India in December, 2015 (three months after India beat Sri Lanka 2-1 away) and tour them right after the ODI series against Australia this year.

(Read | Virat Kohli says dressing room unity powering India’s dream run)

Had that happened, Kohli’s India would have been in for stiffer competition. Instead, an out-of-depth Sri Lanka will fill in for them in November.

Playing Pakistan of course needs government permission. But it won’t be a bad idea given the level of cricket produced when the two teams meet in ICC events. If not tour Pakistan, India could at least play them at the UAE, Pakistan’s adopted home. That could still lend some perspective to India’s successful run in Tests where they have to tour Australia, England and South Africa once in three years or so. Otherwise we may be consigned to watching more ill-matched Asian rivalry."
Janmashtami 2017: Shri Krishna aka Sarvadaman says he hasn’t seen the show till date,"With an irreplaceable smile, when actor Sarvadaman D Banerjee narrated couplets from the Bhagavad Gita, for the 90’s Indian television series Shri Krishna, the world outside TV came to a standstill. But, Banerjee says: “I never wanted to do TV. I was working in films because a single shot in a film stays for 100 years. Then, Ramanand Sagar [the creator of the show] called me. I knew this invitation would offer me a role in TV and thus I didn’t want to go. I believed TV isn’t an art; even today it isn’t one.”

When he finally relented to meet Sagar, he found himself in a studio where the set for shoot was ready. “I entered and a stack of papers was handed over to me saying, ‘These are your dialogues...’ I tried to run away, but then Ramanand Sagar turned up and the rest is history.”

Sarvadaman D Banerjee in a still from the show Shri Krishna.

The show that went on-air post the cult series, Ramayana, was initially supposed to run for 2-3 years. “And it ran for 10 years! I shot the entire serial in a state of meditation. I signed the show in 1990 and by 1994, with the rising popularity of the show rising, I felt that an atom bomb had fallen into my bedroom. But till date, I have never bothered to see the show,” says the actor.

He feels his “karmic potli” was over post Shri Krishna, and hence he didn’t get much work. “After a few years of shooting Shri Krishna, I once asked Sagar: When will you direct me? He said: Whenever I see you, I see the supreme, so I just end up folding my hands. There’s isn’t a better compliment that a director can give.”

India aim to wrap up Test series vs Sri Lanka in Colombo,"about the video

Lokesh Rahul’s imminent return leaves skipper Virat Kohli with an unenviable task of dropping opener Abhinav Mukund as India aim to clinch the three-match series against Sri Lanka with another resounding victory in the second Test starting in Colombo tomorrow. The selection conundrum is a testimony to the superb bench strength of the team. Lokesh Rahul’s absence hardly affected the performance with India thrashing the hosts by 304 runs, starting the series with a bang. Meanwhile, back in the side, fit-again Sri Lank captain Dinesh Chandimal hopes to revive his team’s fledgling fortunes in the second Test with a match-winning effort, similar to the one he produced against India two years ago.

"Why Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina did not make Indian team for Lanka series - truth revealed","Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are not in a state to ‘endure’ the rigours of international cricket, quite literally. The senior duo failed to match the required score in a ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the National Cricket Academy and were not considered for India’s ODI and Twenty20 away series against Sri Lanka.

While the 35-year-old Yuvraj Singh has failed to impress in the recent opportunities that he got, the 30-year-old Suresh Raina last played for India in a T20I against England in February. But with fitness issues coming up, both will have plenty of work at hand.

The Indian team regularly undergoes a series of fitness tests with ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test being the most important of them. It is an advanced version of the ‘beep’ test that was used by teams of earlier generations.

READ | Rohit Sharma aims to continue be a nightmare for Sri Lanka in ODI cricket series

Below team’s standard

According to reports, for the current Indian team, the acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. Captain Virat Kohli, one of the fittest Indian cricketers, scores around 21 in the test.

However, both Yuvraj Singh and Raina scored well below the permissible level of 19.5 with Yuvraj barely managing to touch 16, which was the biggest reason for his ouster.

“The current team think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, skipper Virat Kohli and chairman of selectors MSK Prasad have made it clear that fitness standards are non-negotiable. On an average, the Australian cricketers score 21 in Yo-Yo test. Here Virat, Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey regularly hit that score while others are either touching 19.5 or is hitting above that score,” a BCCI official told PTI.

READ | Ravi Shastri wants India to be best fielding side at 2019 Cricket World Cup

“Earlier, when the traditional beep test was in vogue, the Indian players of the 1990’s would have scored around 16 to 16.5 barring a few like Mohammed Azharuddin, Robin Singh or Ajay Jadeja.

“But now it’s different as the skipper himself is hitting the benchmark, which the Australian cricket team sets it,” the official added.

How Yo-Yo Test works

Cones are placed to mark out two lines 20 meters apart. A player starts with his foot behind one of the lines, and begins running when instructed.

A player continues running between the two lines, turning when signalled by the recorded beeps.

After each minute or so, the pace gets quicker. If the line is not reached in time, the player must run to the line turn and try to catch up with the pace within two more ‘beeps’. The test is stopped if the player fails to catch up with the pace within the two ends.

The entire process is software-based where the results are recorded.

It must be noted that the same test for football and hockey team will produce entirely different results. Both have higher benchmarks, considering the speed and endurance level involved with the sport.

"All Bihar districts to be free from open defecation by 2019, says CM Nitish Kumar","The Bihar government has set a deadline of March, 2019 to make the districts free from open defecation.

The government has also set a target of making 4,555 gram panchayats open-defecation free by the end of the current financial year 2017-18.

During the review meeting of Lohia Swachh Bihar Abhiyan, chief minister Nitish Kumar asked officials to speed up the process of achieving the target.

Nitish held a high-level meeting on Saturday evening to review the progress of work of rural development department and Panchayati Raj department.

While reviewing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), Kumar said the water conservation project, which was implemented in Nalanda district, should be considered a “role-model” and it should be implemented in all the districts of the state especially in south Bihar.

He also asked officials to take up the matter of afforestation in order to increase the forest coverage area in the state.

THE CLASS OF 2018: Why doesn't this co-ed school have any girl students?,"The Government Co-education Secondary School in Naya Bazaar, is 'co-ed' only in name. In the seven years since the school moved into its new building, a girl is yet to seek admission.

Co-education schools are a rarity in Delhi's government school system, accounting for a mere 17 per cent of the city's 1,009 schools in 2015. Most of the remaining schools are run in two shifts, where girls study in the morning and boys in the afternoon.

Educationists are increasingly convinced of the importance of boys and girls studying together from a young age; particularly in a city like Delhi where violence against women is common, and most young men and women live in gender-segregated spaces.

""Any project where homogeneity is brought about artificially can never prepare students for challenges they will face in society,"" said Minati Panda, chairperson of Zakir Husain Center for Educational Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

So why don't girls study at the Naya Bazaar school?

The history of this school building offers an insight into not just the constraints of Delhi's school system, but a perspective on how girls and young women are pushed out of public spaces almost by default.

The building at Naya Bazaar began as a government girls school. But in 2004, the building was closed for repairs and the students and staff were shifted to the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Pul Bangash.

In 2009, a co-ed school in the Bara Hindu Rao neighbourhood had to be moved to make way for flyover.

""I am not sure what happened to the girl students in Bara Hindu Rao, but when I came here in 2012, the school already had only boys as students,"" said Gauri Shankar, the principal at Naya Bazaar.

The gender balance, Shankar said is further skewed by the fact that three of Naya Bazaar's feeder schools are boys school at the primary level. ""We are ready to give admission to girls but most of them go to Pul Bangash school as this school is in the middle of market area.""

Now, no parent wants their girls to go to a school full of boys.

""I didn't know if Rahul's school was co-ed,"" said Pawan Gautam, whose son studies at the school, ""There are no girls in his school, so I didn't want to send my daughters there.""

Only 17% of Delhi's 1009 are co-educational by default, rather than design.

Why so many single-sex schools?

Most of Delhi's schools are single sex by default rather than design. The primary reason, officials from the department of education said, is this allows the department to run two schools from the same building.

""The population of Delhi has increased many-fold, and we have to create opportunities for these students,"" said Saumya Gupta, director education. ""Girls go the morning shift as you can't ask parents to send girls in the evening, and boys come in the evening.""

Officials said many parents prefer to send their daughters to a girls' school.

""Most of our schools are decades old and maybe at that time locals demanded their daughters to be sent to a girls school,"" said an official, who did not wish to be named. ""Such local conditions still exist in certain areas although we need to break these stereotypes.""

Yet, graduates from these schools wish for a more liberal education.

Amit Kumar, who studied at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Sangam Vihar, said he struggled to adjust at a co-ed college.

""I had almost negligible interaction with girls,"" he said. ""When I moved to college, it was a different world where boys and girls studied in the same classroom.""

""It was difficult to adjust and interact with the girls. Maybe if I was from a co-ed school it would have been easier to adjust.""

Experts agree.

""It is desirable to have co-education so that students can learn to engage with the opposite sex in a natural way while they are growing up,"" said Poonam Batra, a professor at the Delhi University's education department.

A 2014 study published in the journal 'Sex Roles', found that teachers in single-sex school tended to rationalise segregated schools on the basis that girls and boys learn differently, thereby perpetuating gender stereotypes.

The Department of Education insists that change is around the corner.

""We are opening 16 new schools in this academic session and all are co-ed,"" said Gupta, the education director.

But for now, Naya Bazar, the co-ed school that never had any girls, is being turned into a boys school, perpetuating a cycle that everyone in the department says they want to break out of."
New 2017 Honda Civic spotted at Tapukara factory: When is it coming to India?,"Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) offers a mid-size sedan City and also a high-end luxury sedan Accord Hybrid, but the love and eagerness for the new Civic in India has been surprising.

And after spotting this 2017 avatar of the Civic at Honda’s Tapukara factory in Rajasthan, we are convinced: The Civic will make a comeback.

The 2017 Civic is launched in various global markets, and it is expected to come to India soon. (Gulshankumar Wankar / HT Photo)

“So far we have not heard any negative feedback about the Civic,” Yoichiro Ueno, president and CEO of HCIL, told HT during our visit to the factory on Wednesday.

“I see a lot of people in my neighbourhood still driving the old Civic with lots of care and love. May be the cars are getting older. So if a replacement car is launched, those customers will also love it,” he added.

The Honda Civic was first launched in 2006 in the lower D segment. The Civic was available in the 1.8-litre i-VTEC petrol engine, in both manual as well as automatic transmissions.

It won several industry awards including the Indian Car of the Year (ICOTY) 2007 and topped the JD Power Initial Quality Study in 2010.

But sales in the lower D segment, of Toyota Corolla and Hyundai Elantra, fell by 29% in 2012-13 over the previous year; Honda itself managed to sell only 685 Civics -- almost 70% fewer -- during the same period. So Honda pulled the Civic out of the market in 2013.

Globally, the 2017 edition launched in various avatars has garnered great feedback -- Civic Coupe, Civic 4-door sedan, Civic 4-door hatchback and a sports version Civic Type R.

So when is the new Civic coming to India?

The most convincing answer Honda could give us was: “Soon may be. We are getting a lot of enquiries. We are finishing our assessment. It takes time.”

Market speculations say the new version would come around the festive season later this year or during the Delhi Auto Expo in February 2018.

Multiple HCIL personnel told HT the model spotted at the Honda factory was imported from Japan for “research purposes only”, “to evaluate the parts” and “testing”.

It could be this specimen that would be replicated to make the future Civics for India. HT also learnt that the new Civic would be made at Honda’s Greater Noida factory, where the carmaker produces the premium sports utility vehicle CR-V, the compact urban hatchback Brio, the compact sedan Amaze and the new Honda City."
"Born on August 15, 1947: The search for Delhi’s Midnight’s Children","The house stood at the dead-end of a narrow, serpentine alley in Khair village. We knocked on the wooden gate.

It was the third day of our search for Delhi’s Midnight’s Children – born on the August 15, 1947. It had brought us to a nondescript village on the south-western periphery, around 30 kilometres from the city centre.

A young woman peeped through the gap between the doors. “I am looking for Shish Ramji? Is he your relative?” we asked.

“Why are you enquiring about him?” she replied, with a question.

“We are looking for a girl child who was born on August 15, 1947 in Khair village. Her father’s name was Shish Ram as per government records.”

“Shish Ram was my husband’s grandfather but he died long ago,” she said. “My father-in-law would be able to tell you something. He lives outside the village next to the pond near the bus stand. His name is Azad Singh. He retired from DDA. Ask anyone there, they will tell you the exact location.”

But the meeting with Azad Singh did not yield much.

“Yes, Laxmi (name changed) was my elder sister who was born on August 15 in 1947 but she died a few years later. Then I was born in 1950,” he told us.

Before meeting Singh, we had visited 25 addresses, taken down on a notebook from the municipal records, but there had been no breakthrough.

The only exception was Gurgaon-based archaeologist and author Himanshu Prabha Ray. We located Ray through the internet. She was born in an Army Hospital in Delhi Cantonment on the day India attained freedom.

Birth registration in Delhi

Before a proper mechanism to register birth and death could be evolved, it was the duty of the chowkidar (watchman) to inform the police station concerned or the tehsil about these developments in their respective areas or a midwife used to record them. Hospitals and maternity centres would register births and deaths handled by them. This system continued for decades even after the independence.

“With no organized public transport, it was not possible for chowkidars to go to police station or tehsil office to record birth. Owning a bicycle was a big deal. Therefore, the chowkidars reported birth/death once in a week or 10 days by which time some of the dates slipped his memory. So, it was completely dependent on the chowkidars’ memory,” said MS Shehrawat, 69, Advisor (Public Relations) of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). The oldest birth listed in council’s record is from 1917.

Tracking down 70-year-old addresses

According to government data, 132 births (including 62 girls) were registered in Delhi on August 15, 1947. The population of Delhi was around seven lakh at that time. Apart from the New Delhi Municipal Council, set up in 1927, to manage civic affairs of the new capital ‘New Delhi’, there were seven municipal sub-committees looking after smaller regions such as Delhi Fort area, Civil Lines, Shahdara, Mehrauli, Narela, West Delhi, and Najafgarh.

An undated photograph of Walled City (PIB)

As per the documents, at least 46 children were born in the Walled City on Independence Day.

We thought tracking down these 46 would be easier because in Old Delhi had stronger community ties unlike the urban population in gated colonies in other parts of the city.

However, the records mentioned only the father’s name and the place of birth – hospital or locality.

A city transformed

Even for someone born and brought up in the Old City, the addresses are hard to track. In the past seven decades, not just the demographics, the topography has changed as well. For instance, Pahari Bhojla near Turkman Gate used to have ‘13XX’ series for house numbers around 1947 as per the municipal records, but these now begin with ‘21XX’.

Similarly, serial numbers in most localities in Shahjahanabad such as Kucha Sohan Lal (Sita Ram Bazaar), Suiwalan, Gali Gadhiya (Kalan Mahal), Shahganj (Ajmeri Gate-GB Road), Kucha Dakhni Rai (Darya Ganj), and Kucha Pandit (Lal Quan) have also been revised.

“Before the formation of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 1958, there were 10 different notified committees functioning for different areas in the city. They have their own arrangement for allocating house numbers. When the MCD came into being, house numbers were changed. This was primarily for property tax, which required standardization of house numbers,” said MC Sharma, former Delhi Mayor.

Haji Mian Faiyazuddin, 79, who runs a guest house in Jama Masjid area, said his residence number in Kucha Meer Ashiq was also changed twice in 1950s.

Another major hurdle was that several families have shifted outside the Walled City. Even their neighbours did not know their whereabouts. Their properties have changed hands twice or thrice like the Saxenas’ of Kucha Sohan Lal in Bazaar Sita Ram, famous for beautifully carved facades of palatial mansions and family of kulfi makers.

The Saxena family, which used to reside in a part of the haveli, had a baby boy on August 15.

“The family sold the house to its previous owner long ago, I don’t remember when. They had two-three children whose name I have also forgotten. No one from the family has visited this place for years,” said RN Saxena, 87, a resident of Kucha Sohan Lal.

In the last 70 years, new constructions --transformation of single storey structures and mansions into mutli-storeyed apartments – has taken its toll on landscape and livability index of Shahajananad.

Extinction of ‘Jalal Manzil’ (in Gali Wakil Abdul Aziz, Kucha Pandit) is one such example. The municipal record has an entry of a birth on Independence Day at this address.

“There were hardly 10 houses in this street. At present, there are more than 100. I have not heard of Jalal Manzil ever though I am born and brought up here,” said Mohd Farid, 45, who runs a salon in Kucha Pandit.

In spite of this, we tracked down Saifuddin Azad at Basti Harphool Singh in Sadar Bazar. His son, Moinuddin, said that he had died around 18 years ago.

When our efforts in the Walled City failing to bear fruits, we tried out luck in the villages of Delhi in south-west and north-west districts.

Makeover of villages

Soon, we realized our folly.

Mubasi Ram, 90, a resident of Mukundpur, said the villages had started changing rapidly by the end of 1990s.

Flashy multi-storeyed houses have come up on agricultural land in Bhalaswa, Pitampura, Mukundpur, Rithala, and adjoining areas. Several old timers, who could not afford a house in the city like Ram, moved out and built their houses on the outskirts. The villages have now become home to migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

“The landlords built plush bungalows but people like me built houses outside the village limit,” Ram said.

Mubasi Ram (HT Photo)

Our next stop was Najafgarh sub-division in south-west district.

The cluster of villages in Najafgarh – Khair, Mitraon, Dhansa, Jaffarpur Kalan, Ghalibpur, Dhichaon Kalan, and others – retain families who have been living here for generations.

As per the government record, one Bihari Lal family had a boy on Independence Day in Mitraon, 70 years ago. A village elder directed us to retired squadron leader Shree Bhagwan, whose father’s name was Bihari Lal.

According to the villagers, there were two men in Mitraon, who would go by the same name around 1947 and Bhagwan’s father had a child around that time. His father, we were told, had fought in Second World War for the British.

Bhagwan was bit surprised and curious when told about our quest. “I don’t know about my date of birth in government record. I was admitted in the village school by my uncle in 1954, where the birth date was registered as June 6, 1947. At that time, no one would bother to check the municipal records,” said Bhagwan, who is the eldest among five siblings.

Lilu Ram (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)

Later, we met Lilu Ram, a tailor in Bijwasan village, whose date of birth is also August 15, 1947 in the municipal record. He, too, expressed ignorance. “My birth date in school had been registered as January 26, 1947. The record, however, correctly identifies my father as Kishori,” Ram said.

Record mismatch

A senior municipal corporation officer, who is privy to the birth and death registration, said this ‘mismatch’ might be attributed to two factors -- system for birth registration prevailing during that period and the unwillingness of parents to register the birth of their children.

When the registration of births or deaths was made mandatory in 1969, the process was streamlined as per provisions of registration of Births and Deaths Act.

“Earlier, parents and relatives would not take it seriously and birth date was casually mentioned while admitting children in schools. But the fact is that births and deaths are being registered by all municipalities in Delhi since 1850s. We have records dating back to 1869,” he said. “Do you want to see them?”

Maybe some other time."
"The Big Sick movie review: Kumail Nanjiani, Anupam Kher star in the must-see rom-com of 2017","That two people could overcome centuries-old cultural obstacles, the perils of modern dating and a critical illness and end up together is a great story. That those two people also managed to adapt their own great story into a great movie is a miracle.

It’s the wonder of The Big Sick , the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Sweet-natured, funny and genuine, you’re not likely to have a more pleasant time at the cinema this summer.

At the centre is Kumail Nanjiani, the deft comedian who audiences might know from HBO’s Silicon Valley. He actually uses his full, real name in the film, which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon and based on their wild courtship. Emily has ceded her part to an actor, Zoe Kazan, who continues her very persuasive campaign to be the rom-com dream girl for those who fancy themselves better than rom-coms.

Kumail is a struggling stand-up comedian who pays the rent for his awful Chicago apartment by driving for Uber. When he’s not on the stage, or in the car, he’s at home with his family in the suburbs. They’re Pakistani and Muslim and have all had arranged marriages and expect Kumail to do the same. He’s managed to live a bit of a double life for a while - dating who he wants while also holding up the pretense of being a good Pakistani son. But everything changes when he meets Emily, the white grad student who he falls for and then loses when she realizes that he’s been hiding her from his family.

To be fair, they would literally disown him if he chose Emily over the scores of Pakistani ladies that “just drop by” their family dinners like clockwork, headshot and bio in hand. So Emily and Kumail break up. They have to. It’s a standard rom-com beat and obstacle. But then something happens: Kumail gets the call that Emily has been hospitalized, and the movie pivots into something entirely different and infinitely richer than most in the genre.

Suddenly he’s the one making the call to put her in a medically induced coma while also informing her parents, Terry and Beth (Ray Romano and Holly Hunter) of their daughter’s health turn. Beth is none too happy to have her daughter’s ex-boyfriend lurking around during their family crisis, either. Hunter plays Beth, at first, with that scary and all too recognizable indifference of a mother who doesn’t care to humour the man who hurt her daughter. But, like everything, that evolves.

One of the really wonderful and telling things about The Big Sick is how fleshed out the world is around Kumail and Emily - from Kumail’s comedy friends (Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler), to his family (Anupam Kher, Zenobia Shroff, Adeel Akhtar and Shenaz Treasury) and Emily’s parents, no supporting character is made into a caricature. Even the potential wives are given distinct and memorable personalities. Their presence is mined for comedy, but the women aren’t punchlines. It’s a delicate balance that The Big Sick gets just right.

If there is anything to pick on, it’s that we never get to know Emily as well as Kumail. It’s not her fault, she’s in a coma for most of the film, and we get a fair amount of colour at the beginning, but her arc leaves a bit to be desired.

Michael Showalter’s direction isn’t flashy or stylish, either. His camera is there in service of the story and the characters and it doesn’t get in the way.

Some stories are too good to be true, and some true stories are too good for the movies. Luckily for us, The Big Sick is neither.

A week of upsets at Wimbledon may signal the end of an era,"Rafael Nadal’s dreams of a third Wimbledon title were shattered on Monday when he lost in the fourth round to 26th-ranked Gilles Muller. Then, on Wednesday, two more former champions and tournament favourites – Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic – went down to lower ranked players (Sam Querrey and Thomas Berdych, respectively). Murray and Djokovic were both thwarted by injuries, and Nadal, famous for his seemingly endless reserve of stamina, succumbed in the 28th game of the fifth set. Taken together, the three upsets – each one against a former champion now in his 30’s – may signal the coming of an end of an era in men’s tennis. To be sure, three upsets do not make a trend. And Roger Federer, the oldest of the Big 4, may yet manage to win his record eighth Wimbledon on Sunday. But a trove of data, compiled by sports statistician Jeff Sackman, also suggests that the previous decade of men’s tennis – characterized by a handful of top players’ domination of the field – may be very different from the years to come.

Upsets in Grand Slams In 2003, a 21-year-old Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title. The intervening years have been marked by near total dominance in the men’s field, with four players – Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray – winning 48 of the 56 Grand Slam tournaments. If it has been one of the greatest eras of men’s tennis, it has also been one of its most predictable. Since Federer first became Wimbledon champion, upsets have become increasingly rare in the men’s field. If we define an upset as a match in which the winner’s rank was at least 10 lower than the loser’s, we find that the frequency of Grand Slam upsets dropped from about 26% in 2003 to about 21% in 2016. Every year since 1991, upsets on the men’s side were more common on the women’s side. But in 2008, men’s upsets finally became less common than women’s, and have remained so ever since.

While it is possible that the trend will continue into the future, it is at least as likely that the coming years will see a regression to the mean. That is particularly true because the men who have dominated tennis for the last several years are getting too old to keep winning all the time.

Tennis is old The Big 4 have been dominating men's tennis for more than 10 years now. The youngest of the four is Novak Djokovic, who turned 30 in May. The oldest, Roger Federer, will be 36 in August. They are not only the best players on the tour right now, but also among the oldest. And it’s not just the Big 4 – the top 50 players are on an average older than they've been in the past 30 years. Women, too, are getting older. And as the top players have aged, younger players have had to wait longer to make it into the top ranks.

"At Rs 89.95 cr, Toilet Ek Prem Katha is the second most successful Hindi film of 2017","Akshay Kumar’s Toilet Ek Prem Katha is all set to cross the Rs 100 crore mark in the coming week. Its success has ended the drought for a big hit in Bollywood. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh says the film has garnered Rs 6.50 crore on Wednesday taking the total tally to Rs 89.95 crore in less than a week.

Before Toilet Ek Prem Katha, Akshay Kumar’s Jolly LLB 2 entered the Rs 100 crore club at the box office. However, this film inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s Clean India Campaign is likely to outrun Jolly LLB 2 at the BO.

#ToiletEkPremKatha is a SMASH HIT... Fri 13.10 cr, Sat 17.10 cr, Sun 21.25 cr, Mon 12 cr, Tue 20 cr, Wed 6.50 cr. Total: ₹ 89.95 cr. #TEPK — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) August 17, 2017

Said to be made at a budget of Rs 24 crore including the advertising, Toilet Ek Prem Katha took the box office by storm and emerged victorious. Its total profit percentage is 274.79. That’s a huge return, but this is still far less than the profit percentage of Prabhas’ Baahubali 2.

Irrfan Khan’s Hindi Medium collected Rs 69 crore against the production cost of Rs 22 crore, which makes it a close third.

Otherwise, the most commercially successful Hindi film this year is Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees which collected Rs 133 crore. But its high production cost restricted it from becoming a very profitable venture.

In fact, most of the big starrers including Salman Khan’s Tubelight and Shah Rukh Khan’s Jab harry Met Sejal have bombed at the box office.

With most of the big films already released, Bollywood is now looking at its new-age stars to pull off a good show at the box office. For example, Sidharth Malhotra’s A Gentleman and Varun Dhawan’s Judwaa 2 will be hitting the screens soon, and they will be expected to score good numbers.

Meanwhile, the advocates of good content and not superstardom will be following the business graph of Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon’s Bareilly Ki Barfi that releases this Friday."
"Chipmaker Nvidia, Volvo, AutoLiv team up to develop self-driving vehicles by 2021","Chipmaker Nvidia Corp on Monday announced it was partnering with Volvo Cars and Swedish auto supplier Autoliv to develop self-driving car technology for vehicles due to hit the market by 2021.

Volvo is owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd .

The Silicon Valley-based Nvidia also announced a non-exclusive partnership with German automotive suppliers ZF and Hella for artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving.

Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called “brain” of the autonomous vehicle.

The company, whose many partners already include Tesla Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and tier one supplier Robert Bosch, announced its latest deals at an automotive electronics show in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

Nvidia’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform is used by Tesla in its Models S and X and upcoming Model 3 electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG’s Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020.

In a call with reporters, Nvidia’s senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans.

The system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia’s Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called “Level 3” driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car.

Volvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its “Drive Me” autonomous pilot program.

Volvo’s production vehicles built on Nvidia’s platform, as announced on Monday, are planned for sale by 2021."

Rohit Sharma aims to continue be a nightmare for Sri Lanka in ODI cricket series,"No one knows how to deflate the Sri Lankans more than Rohit Sharma. He may be in and out of the Test team but in ODIs Rohit has been quite frankly, a nightmare for Sri Lanka in recent times. Holder of the highest ODI score 264 that came against Sri Lanka, Rohit couldn’t have got a more familiar opponent to make his comeback from a thigh injury.

Elevation to vice-captaincy means this series is going to be more special for Rohit. “It is a huge honour to be appointed as the vice-captain. Ten years ago, I was only thinking of playing for India. I am not thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment as of now. The last few years have been really good, we just need to continue that,” said Rohit.

Captaincy comes naturally to Rohit. Three titles in the Indian Premier League apart from an exemplary record was reason enough for the selectors to consider him for the job. International cricket is a different ball game compared to the IPL, but Rohit said “the excitement and the energy level is the same”.

“So yes, nothing changes too much. I am the vice-captain here, there I was the captain, so I was more in front. Here I have to play a little behind-the-scene role.”

“I have no idea about the squad for this ODI series but what they had in the Champions Trophy was a very good side. They beat us quite comfortably. So you know in one day cricket they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing for the past few years,” said Rohit.

“As far as I am concerned we need to look at what we need to do as a team and bring out the best on the field. That’s what we did in the recent Test series. We just focused on what we need to do as a group and that has always been the talk. We need to focus on our ability and strengths.”

Having recently completed 10 years in international cricket, Rohit said it’s been a roller-coaster ride. “Those 10 years have gone really fast. It has been up and down but that’s how it is for any sportsman. You get to learn a lot more when you have your ups and downs. It teaches you a lot many things,” he said.

“Before those ten years, I never thought I would play for India. I was just enjoying my cricket, playing for my school, for Mumbai. (Only) When I started playing Ranji Trophy, I realised that I have that goal at which I can look at. And once I was picked up for Indian team, there was no looking back. Even now when I stand here being the vice-captain, it feels pretty good. There’s lot more to do and I look forward to it.”

At the same time, he has had to cope with the disappointment of not being able to cement his place in the Test team. “Nobody likes to sit out. But again, it all depends on the team dynamics, what the captain and the coach wants to play. And you got to accept the fact and move forward. It was great to watch everyone displaying that skill. (Winning) 3-0 outside India is a great achievement.”"
Pradeep Sharma is back: Rise and fall of the fearsome 1983 batch of the Mumbai police,"When a Mumbai police team of Ishaq Bhagwan, Raja Tambat, Fatehsingh Gaikwad and Yashwant Bhide gunned down dreaded gangster Manohar Arjun Surve alias Manya Surve outside Ambedkar college at Wadala in the city in 1982, few realised it would set a precedent for a promising bunch of police officers who were being trained at the time by the legendary Arvind Inamdar at the Police Training Academy in Nashik.

This bunch -- that included B Raju Pillai, Vijay Salaskar, Pradeep Sharma, Praful Bhosle, Ravindra Angre and Vinayak Saude – passed out in 1983 and many got their first postings at police stations across Mumbai, where they witnessed sporadic shootouts including the encounter killing of dreaded gangster Rama Naik in 1984.

The so-called 1983 batch rose to prominence in the mid- and late 1990s. In fact, the first encounter any officer of this batch carried out was in 1993 when inspector Shankar Kamble took along the young sub-inspectors Salaskar and Sharma, with the approval of then additional commissioner of police Hassan Gafoor, to catch the AK-56 wielding gangster Subash Makdawala. In the encounter that followed Sharma shot Makdawala dead.

From then on there was no looking back for these 1983 batch officers, who became trigger happy. Barring the late B Raju Pillai, who was responsible for 40 encounter killings, and Vinayak Saude, the rest revelled in being known as “encounter specialists.” Pillai preferred a low profile though he was the one who almost killed dreaded Chhota Rajan gangster DK Rao near Dadar. Rao survived the encounter with eight bullets lodged in his body.

With the Mumbai police desperate to check the gangs led by Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Rajan, Arun Gawli, Amar Naik, Ashwin Naik and others, these officers were given a free hand and they

turned Mumbai into a killing field. Their media briefings were a farce: “We tried to arrest the gangster, he fired on us. We retaliated and he was killed.” No questions were asked ostensibly because they were killing underworld gangsters.

It appeared as if these officers were trying to upstage each other. The body count kept rising -- 50, 80, 100. Soon murmurs started, questioning the veracity of some of these encounters. There were also allegations that cops were playing favourites and were getting too closely involved in gangland rivalries. Slowly the tide turned against these feared cops and one after the other, they fell out of favour. The hunters became the hunted.

Praful Bhosale was suspended for his involvement in the murder of Khwaja Yunus, but was reinstated later. Ravindra Angre for various reasons was dismissed from service in 2014. Pradeep Sharma was dismissed for alleged underworld links in 2008, but was reinstated on August 16, 2017. Salaskar, who fell to the bullets of the 26/11 terrorists, too had his set of controversies.

One of the cops who has maintained a low profile, on condition of anonymity, told HT, “Encounter was once a necessary evil and everyone has to understand that it was an evil. But some were trigger happy and used it for their own vested interests.”

Statistics show encounters were not the only solution to fighting crime. Between 1999 and 2001, the detention of gangsters under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act was the highest — 1,290. During the period, the police seized 1,433 firearms, including several 9 mm pistols and AK-47s from gangsters, 212 persons were detained under MCOCA, and 896 members of the gangs of Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Rajan, Arun Gawli, Amar Naik and others were arrested.

Though senior cops acknowledge the contribution made by these ‘encounter specialists’, they refuse to recognise them as the only officers who contributed to breaking the backbone of organised crime in Mumbai. Many were apprehensive the underworld gangs would return with full force following the ouster of the encounter cops, but such fears proved unjustified.

Top cops say the force always had dedicated and sincere officers in their ranks, who have ample experience tackling organized crime. A senior IPS officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “There are people in the force who have proved their capability more than once to investigate, detect and secure conviction for criminals. We don’t really need encounter cops.”"
"My birthday brings joy and troubled memories: Ex-JNU prof born on Aug 15, 1947","Himanshu Prabha Ray, a former professor at the Centre for Historical Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), was among 132 children in Delhi born on August 15, 1947.

“I do not remember being given any special privileges. The only advantage was that my birthday was always a holiday,” said Ray, who was born at the Military Hospital in Delhi Cantonment.

Grown up listening to stories by her mother about the raising of the Indian flag at midnight and celebrations on the streets on August 15, Ray said it was also a very stressful and troubled period for her parents because of the turmoil of Partition.

“My mother used to be worried about my father’s safety because of violence. Even though my parents were not harmed, my mother was deeply disturbed by the mutilated bodies that she had seen. She would often talk about it. Thus, it was an occasion to celebrate but also an event that brought troubling memories,” she said. Her father was a doctor in the army.

Besides being an academician, Ray is also a well-known author, researcher, and archaeologist who participated in excavations at historic sites at Purana Qila (New Delhi in 1971-72, 1972-73), Mathura (Uttar Pradesh in 1973-74), Arikamedu (near Puducherry in 1990- 1991) and also in Lopburi Province (Thailand in 1989) and Mahasthan (Bangladesh in 1993).

Ray also served as chairperson of the National Monuments Authority (NMA) and edited a series of books on archaeology.

A recipient of several awards, she graduated in English and did her post-graduation in Sanskrit from Panjab University. She also holds a diploma in Archaeology and M Phil (Archaeology) degree from University of Cambridge. She did her PhD in early historical trade from Jawaharlal Nehru University.

“Freedom to me means decolonization of the mind, which continues to be a challenge, since most of what is taught in universities and educational institutions are theories derived from the West. We need to find and define our own space in the global arena,” Ray said.

Secularism

“Secularism is respect for all religions and by no means denigration of any. It is ironic that though terms such as ‘diversity’ and ‘plurality’ are bandied around in public discourse in our country, very little of this finds its way into teaching or in school education.”

Nationalism

Nationalism means pride in one’s country and oneself and again one sees little evidence of this in the debates that have taken place on the subject."

Binge on these five super TV shows to escape the disaster that has been 2016,"Demonetisation. The US election outcome. Pollution. Leonard Cohen no more. Kashmir. Kanpur train derailing… And these are events that have occurred only over the last few weeks. The list gets longer and longer as you go back month-on-month to the disaster that has been 2016. So if you, like us, are feeling overwhelmed and need a different world to flee to – even if figuratively – here are five fantastic TV shows to binge-watch that promise an escape, alright. So get streaming and wake up (to a better reality, hopefully) when December ends.

Stranger Things

This Netflix-original that debuted in July this year, and which is possibly one of the best shows of 2016, is a sci-fi thriller with a liberal dose of mystery, drama and jumpy horror moments thrown in. But what makes Stranger Things so special – apart from the nail-biting plot and stellar cast – is the possibility it offers of an alternate universe where everything is just the same as yours, yet quite not so. The ‘Upside Down’ may not exactly be the kind of world you were hoping to escape to, but it is exciting no less.

Black Mirror

The third season of this highly acclaimed satirical sci-fi series released last month and the ratings have already been through the roof. Unlike the first two seasons that had three episodes each, this has six marvels, each with a different plot and cast. And each is a terrifying study into our world today – obsessed with technology, social media and keeping up appearances online – and the world we might be living in if we aren’t careful enough. As series creator Charlie Brooker said in a 2011 The Guardian interview when the show first premiered, “They’re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes’ time if we’re clumsy”.

The 100

Another science fiction, this one is a post-Apocalyptic action drama that rolls both utopia and dystopia into one action-packed, heart-thumping show. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war wipes out civilisation on earth, a spaceship housing the last lone survivors starts running critically low on life support. So it sends back 100 juvenile lawbreakers back to earth in the hope of repopulating the planet. You’ll be making a mistake if you plan to leave the rest to imagination.

The Returned

Adapted from the 2012 French series Les Revenants, this supernatural thriller that released last year will give you all the creeps, and then some feels. A sleepy little mountain town is suddenly thrown into complete chaos when several locals come back from the dead. No, literally! As if resurrecting from their other worlds wasn’t enough, they also haven’t aged and are unaware of their own deaths. The shock of their families is only understandable, but what is difficult to comprehend are the strange happenings that begin to occur in the town following their arrival. [PS: You might want to watch the French original, as the English one was called off air abruptly. Talk of strange happenings!]

The Night Of

This crime thriller that premiered in August this year had even Shah Rukh Khan hooked, reportedly. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that there is not even a hint of any other world in this – it’s simply set in present-day New York. Sometimes, a different world can exist in your own mind, where the sequence of events is vastly different from what is presumed by others to have occurred – especially when there’s alcohol and a cocktail of drugs involved. This is what happens when after a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder. Add prevailing racial tensions in the mix, and you’ve a total mind-bender.

Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”,"Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”

The government’s rankings of the cleanest cities in the country, released last week as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, had some surprising outcomes. “Is Varanasi really cleaner than Bhubaneswar?” my editor asked in an article earlier this week. Others have asked some version of the same question: How were these rankings produced? And is the methodology sound? The rankings consider three broad categories of data: documentation provided by civic authorities, feedback from citizens, and independent ground assessments. Intuitively, one might think that the ground assessments — which involve unbiased people observing how clean the city actually is — would be the most important source of data. But the way the Ministry of Urban Development calculated the rankings, ground assessments are the least important. Instead, 45% of the ranking comes from documentation provided by the cities, 30% comes from citizen feedback, and the remaining 25% is derived from the ground assessments. What if these categories were weighted differently? We’ve built a tool that lets you find out. Adjust the weights of the three categories below, and see how the rankings change.

Or, use these buttons.

Reset Documentation only Ground assessment only Citizen feedback only All three are equal

View chart City Your rank Gov't rank Change in rank Each dot represents a city or civic authority. Hover over a dot for details. Scores get higher with your weights or lower with your weights.

So what if we scrap the documentation and citizen feedback, instead relying entirely on the ground assessment? Bhopal rises to the top of the list, while Indore falls to 11th. Varanasi actually improves, rising from 32nd to 28th, while Bhubaneswar improves from 94th to 70th, still far behind. If we only consider citizen feedback, Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, rises from 136th to the top of the charts. Apparently, Neemuch’s citizens think their city is very clean, even if the government and independent assessors disagree. And if only documentation matters, Chandigarh becomes the country’s cleanest city, rising from its former rank of 11th. Why did the government choose to weight documentation so heavily? “In initial years, you have to push municipalities to do work,” said Quality Council of India’s Anay Agarwal, who directed the survey project. “Even if results are not visible on the ground, they have to be awarded — in terms of higher ranking — for starting the work.“ In other words, by weighting the rankings as it does, the government wants to encourage cities to demonstrate an institutional commitment to staying clean. By this thinking, cities that provide documentation of their clean-up efforts demonstrate a commitment to the process, even if the results have yet to show up on the ground.

La Liga 2017/18: 5 new signings to watch out for,"The Spanish league lost Neymar in a record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain but still has plenty of star players on display, including the two touted as the best in the world — Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Barcelona also kept Luis Suarez, Real Madrid held on to Gareth Bale, and Atletico Madrid still has Antoine Griezmann.

The top three teams did not make any blockbuster additions, but some talented players will keep the Spanish league attractive.

Here are some of the players worth watching in Spain when the league kicks off Friday:

Gerard Deulofeu

A product of Barcelona’s youth academy, Deulofeu is expected to take over Neymar’s spot in Barcelona’s attack along with Messi and Suarez.

The 23-year-old Spaniard was bought back from Everton, which he had joined in 2015 after failing to make an impact with Barcelona’s first team.

🔊 Deulofeu: ""I feel good and I have trained hard for the last two weeks to get fit."" #FCBlive pic.twitter.com/Rxs1jos42t — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 4, 2017

He had spent seasons on loan at Everton (2013-14) and Sevilla (2014-15) before being bought by the English club.

Deulofeu spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, scoring four league goals in 17 games.

He played well enough to convince Barcelona to activate its re-signing clause and bring back the forward, who can play on either flank.

Manuel ‘Nolito’ Agudo

The veteran forward is back in Spain after a short stint with Manchester City last season.

Nolito signed with Sevilla and will reunite with manager Eduardo Berizzo, who coached him for two seasons at Celta Vigo.

The 30-year-old Nolito replaces Victor “Vitolo” Machin, who transferred to Atletico Madrid.

Nolito, who played briefly for Barcelona in the early 2010s, was a member of Spain’s squad at the 2016 European Championship in France.

Spaniard winger Jesus Navas is also moving from City to Sevilla, returning to the team he played until 2013. Sevilla also added Colombian forward Luis Muriel, who was with Sampdoria.

Paulinho

The 29-year-old Brazilian midfielder was Barcelona’s first signing after Neymar’s departure, arriving on a four-year contract in a transfer worth 40 million euros ($47 million).

A regular in Brazil’s national team, Paulinho played for Tottenham for two seasons before moving to Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande in 2015.

The versatile midfielder thrived with Brazilian club Corinthians before moving to the Premier League, standing out for his prowess as a defensive midfielder and his ability to help out in attack.

His signing came as a surprise to many because of his age and because he is not known for playing the ball-possession game characteristic of Barcelona.

Paulinho is expected to fight for a starting spot with Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic.

The Catalan club also reinforced its defense by signing 23-year-old right back Nelson Semedo, the former Benfica player who was in Portugal’s squad at this year’s Confederations Cup.

Victor ‘Vitolo’ Machin

Vitolo was signed by Atletico Madrid but will spend the first six months of his new contract playing for boyhood club Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.

Atletico is not allowed to register any new players until 2018 because of a FIFA-imposed ban for having broken rules regarding the transfer of underage players. Coach Diego Simeone will only be able to count on the former Sevilla forward as from January.

The 27-year-old Vitolo was part of Las Palmas’ youth program before joining Sevilla in 2013. He helped the southern Spanish club win three Europa League titles from 2014-16 and has been capped 11 times by Spain, scoring four goals.

Theo Hernandez

The 19-year-old French left back was in the center of a dispute between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid, choosing European champions Real instead of the team where he played most of his youth.

Atletico said Hernandez rejected several of its offers to renew his contract, which ran until 2021.

Hernandez impressed last season while playing for newly promoted Spanish club Alaves on loan from Atletico. Alaves finished ninth in the Spanish league and reached the Copa del Rey final, which they lost to Barcelona.

Hernandez will likely have to fight for a starting spot with veteran Marcelo at Real, where he will be coached by countryman Zinedine Zidane.

Madrid also secured the signing of 21-year-old Dani Ceballos, the former Real Betis midfielder who was named the best player at the Under-21 European Championship this year. Madrid also bought 20-year-old center half Jesus Vallejo, who was on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt last season."
A decade of soaring Delhi University cutoffs,"If you scored less than 70% in Class 12, this year you have close to 26 options across Delhi University colleges. Only subjects offered — Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu.

A decade ago, you had at least 120 — the options, slight more diverse, with subject choices such as History and Political Science as well.

As senior secondary board examinations across the country keep seeing rising scores due to moderation, Delhi University cutoffs keep increasing to accommodate only a limited number of students on the top.

While the Commerce courses have historically been in the 85+ bracket, the rise of Humanities has emerged only in the recent years. Today, courses like History and Political Science require as many marks as one would need for popular courses like Economics.

This year, over 60% of Delhi University cutoffs for the general category have crossed the 90% mark. In 2008, this figure was merely at 8%.

Additional Research: Manas SharmaNote: Data was collated from the Delhi University website and HT archives. All cutoffs are from the first list and indicate the minimum score required in the general category. There is no data for several courses such as B.A. (P) in 2013 due to the introduction of FYUP. All popular courses have been included except for English and Journalism because those had an entrance test earlier. The data does not include St. Stephen's College and Jesus and Mary College."
Return to Harry Potter makes JK Rowling the world’s richest author in 2017,"We hope JK Rowling has reserved a particularly large vault at Gringotts bank. A bumper year for the Harry Potter novelist has magicked her back to the No 1 spot on Forbes’ list of the world’s richest authors, almost a decade after she last topped it.

Forbes – which uses a mix of print, ebook and audio sales data, television and film earnings and expert industry opinion to come up with its list – estimates that Rowling earned $95m in the year to 31 May. This figure is the equivalent of more than $180 per minute, thanks to the sensational sales of her play script, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. When the Harry Potter sequel was released last summer, it sold more than 680,000 print copies in the UK in the first three days alone, and became the fastest selling book since the final Harry Potter novel.

Rowling’s earnings have been boosted with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film set in the Harry Potter world for which she wrote the script, which was published in November. Her original publisher, Bloomsbury, has also been releasing illustrated versions of the Potter novels, to mark 20 years since the publication of the first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.

Forbes producer Hayley Cuccinello admitted she was surprised to see Rowling’s earnings increase $76m over 12 months, attributing the surge to the recent successes from the Harry Potter franchise on stage and screen. “But unless Rowling releases another bestselling book in time for next year’s list,” said Cuccinello, “her earnings will almost certainly dip dramatically and she’ll likely relinquish first place.” Rowling, who last topped Forbes’ list in 2008, comes in this year $8m ahead of second-placed James Patterson, the thriller powerhouse who has headed the list for the last three years.

India vs Sri Lanka ODIs: Upul Tharanga pleads for patience after Test debacle,"Sri Lanka white-ball captain Upul Tharanga has called for patience and support from the fans following their humiliating Test series defeat to India.

Upul Tharanga will lead Sri Lanka in five one-day internationals and one Twenty20 clash against India, having been whitewashed in the three Tests under the stewardship of red-ball skipper Dinesh Chandimal.

After losing the opener by 304 runs, Sri Lanka were beaten by an innings and 53 runs and an innings and 171 runs in the final two games.

Sri Lanka will bank on former cricket captain Angelo Mathews (C) and one-day and T20 captain Upul Tharanga (L) in the upcoming ODIs and T20s. (AFP)

Chandimal labelled the defeat the “worst series ever” but Upul Tharanga is confident Sri Lanka can bounce back in the limited-overs meetings and is adamant the right steps are being taken for the team to be successful.

“Every team goes through a rough patch,” he said in a statement on Sri Lanka Cricket’s official website. “This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.

“Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years – don’t forget this now when we are going through a rough patch.

“Obviously there are some things we can’t openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes – however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.

“Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.

“The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation – so your support is something that matters greatly to us.

“Yesterday (Monday) despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us – this is what we need.”

Sri Lanka named their squad for the limited-overs series on Tuesday, with all-rounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana recalled.

Sri Lanka ODI/T20 squad: Upul Tharanga (captain), Dushmantha Chameera, Akila Dananjaya, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Vishwa Fernando, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamara Kapugedera, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Kusal Mendis, Thisara Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara, Lakshan Sandakan, Milinda Siriwardana."

India vs Sri Lanka: Nuwan Pradeep’s hamstring injury adds to hosts’ woes,"Already short on bowling strength, Sri Lanka’s chances of putting up a fight in the second Test against India suffered a massive blow when their only pace bowler, Nuwan Pradeep, was ruled out for more than a month after breaking down with a left hamstring injury. (DAY 2 HIGHLIGHTS)

“Nuwan is out for one or two months,” said Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne on Friday. He had a fair bit of bowling to do to make up for Pradeep’s absence, and took the wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara. (SCORECARD)

Hamstring injury

Having walked away clutching his hamstring after bowling 17.4 overs towards the end of the first day, Pradeep didn’t come on the second day as Sri Lanka’s plans to field one pacer backfired. Pradeep, after years of grappling with injuries, had taken a six-wicket haul in the first innings of the first Test in Galle, but shouldering the bowling attack seemed to have taken the toll on him.

Karunaratne, however, defended the selection for the second Test. “We prepared (for) this pitch to turn, that’s why we’ve played only one seamer. We would have batted had we won the toss, but unfortunately we didn’t. Now with Nuwan’s injury, there’s no opportunity to get a wicket with the new ball, or get a wicket through reverse swing when it gets older. We will have to defend with the spinners.”

With India having amassed 622/9, Sri Lanka are looking down the barrel trying to save the game. The threat of R Ashwin looms over them, with the off-spinner issuing a warning with two early wickets. Karunaratne, who was out for 25, knows the challenge his batsmen face, having fallen to Ashwin twice in two innings.

Not sure of Ashwin

“It’s not easy. He’s a good spinner. He has variations. When I was batting, I was playing for the straighter one. It’s turning a lot. You can play for the turn and the straighter one. I’m trying to play more balls from him because if I batted a long time, he will try to do something else and we can capitalise on the loose balls. That was my target while batting against Ashwin,” said Karunaratne.

In the Galle Test, Ashwin had castled the Sri Lankan opener for 97, and on Friday, induced Karunaratne to nick to Rahane at slip. “I had a plan for Ashwin. Last time I got out to him twice. Both times I got out to his straighter ball. My plan was to play for the straighter one. If it turns, you can’t help.”

The day started well for Karunaratne as he picked his maiden Test wicket by trapping Cheteshwar Pujara leg before.

“I started my career as a bowler, not a batsman, so I can bowl.”"

"Maharashtra: Two men fall into a 2000-feet deep valley, video captures fall","Two revellers died after falling into a 2,000 feet deep valley in Amboli Ghat in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra.

A video of their fall has gone viral on social media, even as their bodies are yet to be recovered.

The incident took place at Kawale Saad Point in Amboli Ghat, a popular picnic point, on August 1, police said.

“Imran Garadi (26) and Pratap Rathod (21), who were part of a group of seven, fell into the valley. Their bodies are yet to be recovered,” said Sunil Dhanawade, Senior Police Inspector of Sawantwadi police station.

The victims and their friends worked at a poultry farm in Kolhapur, he said.

While others left the Kawale Saad Point after spending some time, Garadi and Rathod lingered back. When they didn’t join the group, their friends approached Sawantwadi police.

Police found out about the mishap from local people and shopkeepers, and roped in trekkers of Hill Riders Group to search for the duo.

The bodies were spotted down in the valley, but were yet to be recovered as heavy rain, water cascading down the hill and mist made the operation difficult, the officer said.

The video which is circulating on social media shows the two men, bottles in hand, climbing the fence around the edge of the valley and backtracking once or twice. Then the two are seen standing on the edge, beyond the fence, and slipping down."
From exploits of 1983 batch of police to credit card fraud: Top 5 stories from Mumbai,"Encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, whose career spanning 25 years in the city’s police force saw him kill 113 underworld gangsters, was reinstated by the Maharashtra government.

"Congress’s Kisan Sammelan to test its unity, poll readiness for 2018","Congress’s Kisan Sammelan (farmers’ convention) in Lahaar of Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district, close to Gwalior, will signal its readiness for the 2018 assembly polls and also whether the party’s ‘Dabra’ spirit can be revived.

The ‘Dabra’ spirit is the holy grail for Congress unity. In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.

The parallels are obvious. The ‘show’ at Laahar will be Madhavrao’s son, Jyotiraditya’s, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.

The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.

Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singh’s constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.

Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, “Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.”

Loud and Visible

The preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.

Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.

Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindia’s rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.

Tapping into Farmers’ Anger

With the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers’ crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.

There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.

State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers’ issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. “It started with Scindiaji’s satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.”

After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singh’s constituency.

BJP puts up brave front

The BJP too realises the Congress’s game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers’ anger through a slew of measures — visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.

The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.

BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.

“They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers,” he said."
Independence Day 2017: How Akshay Kumar redefined patriotism for millennials,"When I was a child, Independence Day celebrations were never complete without watching Raajkumar-Nana Patekar-starrer Tiranga. If it was not the chest-thumping patriotism of Tiranga, it was Manoj ‘Bharat’ Kumar who was the staple of Independence Day.

The films would aim to put in touch with our ‘Indianness’ – with a generous dose of jingoism – mostly at the cost of western countries or the neighbours across the border. The western values were targeted and ‘mere desh ki dharti’ celebrated. Now, as we celebrate the 70 years of independence, the ethos have changed just like the mascot of nationalism in Indian cinema.

Today, the de facto face of Indian pride in cinema is Akshay Kumar and no film says it as clearly as his latest, Toilet Ek Prem Katha. The film sees him taking on the society, hand-me-down sanskriti and even his own family to fight for the right for proper sanitation.

Akshay Kumar in a still from Toilet Ek Prem Katha.

And that is the beauty and innovation of Akshay’s patriotism - he hails the Indian culture but fights the evils embedded within the society. Unlike a Bharat Kumar, Akshay’s characters do not demonise the western culture, instead they tell the world that when it comes to making India great – thoda hai, thode ki zaroorat hai.

So whether it is Airlift and India evacuating its people from a war-torn Kuwait or Rustom where even infidelity was due to a man’s love for his country, Akshay’s film has India and patriotism at its heart. His upcoming, Padman and Gold, will just take this narrative further.

Clearly cast differently from Manoj Kumar, Akshay’s characters do not wage war against enemies from outside, instead, they intend to cleanse our system from within. Akshay’s first in the series was OMG! Oh My God! (2012). Directed by Umesh Shukla, the film challenged blindly following traditions and beliefs deeply rooted in Indian culture. Though it targetted all religions, the movie faced flak for being “anti-Hindu”. This was much before the hyped Aamir Khan film, PK, saw the light of the day.

Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal in Oh My God!

Akshay began churning out films like Holiday (2014), Gabbar Is Back (2015), Baby (2015), Airlift and Rustom (2016) every year, along with the usual masala entertainers he is known for. Akshay took on everything from corruption to terrorism in these films to bring India the sweet climax it always desired but could not achieve in real life.

Unlike a Manoj Kumar, who had to explain his behaviour and attire at each step in Britain (Purab Aur Pashchim), when Akshay strolled through the lanes of London (Namastey London and Patiala House), he did so unapologetically. But whatever his character wears, he is rooted to his mitti.

Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif in a still from Namastey London.

Asked about Akshay’s brand of patriotism, film scholar and author of the book The Making of Don, Krishna Gopalan earlier told Hindustan Times, “If Manoj Kumar is Bharat Kumar, Akshay Kumar would be Mr Hindustan. The two actors are part of different eras. The India of Manoj Kumar was not as confident while the India of Akshay Kumar does not deal with any inferiority complex. Akshay has established with his films that it is cool to be an Indian.”

Much like his onscreen persona, Akshay in real life also promotes causes such as women learning self defense or starting an online portal for kin of soldiers killed in encounters.

Scriptwriter Jaideep Sahni, who has worked with Akshay in Neeraj Pandey’s Special 26, said, “I believe Akshay has a certain awareness and there is a social responsibility that he carries with his persona; he has even taken initiatives like promoting self-defense for women and saving the girl child.”

DSSSB teachers recruitment 2017: Delhi assembly resolves to put it on hold,"The Delhi Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution to put on hold the recruitment of teachers till a criterion is readied to give weightage to guest teachers, in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling.

The resolution was moved by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member Rajesh Gupta.

The move came after the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) released an advertisement for recruitment of teachers stating the existing guest and contract teachers would get “age relaxation” for the number of years they taught in government schools.

The advertisement, however, did not talk about any weightage to be given to them in the recruitment process -- which the government has been advocating.

Replying to a discussion, Education Minister Manish Sisodia said there were around 50,000 teachers teaching about 16 lakh students at government schools in Delhi, out of which around 17,000 were guest or contract teachers. It would be an injustice to them if they were not given weightage in the recruitment process.

Sisodia, also the deputy chief minister, alleged that the move to recruit teachers without giving guest teachers a weightage was aimed at derailing the education system in the city.

“I was shocked to see the advertisement... I was never consulted regarding this. When asked, I was informed that Services does not come under the Delhi government’s purview,” the minister told the house.

“This is the biggest conspiracy to derail the works of this government and also to derail the education system in the city which is being praised all over the world.”

He said the government was of the view that along with giving age relaxation to the existing guest or contract teachers, they should also be granted weightage or preference against the services they have rendered. But the advertisement does not talk about any such facility.

“I have written to the LG Anil Baijal and urged him to put the current recruitment process by DSSSB on hold till the Directorate of Education formulates a policy for giving weightage to guest teachers based on the judgements by the Supreme Court,” Sisodia said.

Sisodia further said that the move would lead to the removal of trained and experienced guest teachers and adversely impact the teaching at government schools.

AAP MLA Madan Lal said that with the help of guest teachers, the schools system was going well and “some people want to end this”.

“Like they intervened with Mohalla Clinics when we were doing good work, now they’re intervening in education,” he said."

13:26 hrs IST: Three boundaries off Ashwin’s over. That will give the Lankans some confidence. They are 39/1.

10:42 hrs IST: A big LBW shout from Umesh Yadav, but the ball was going down the leg side. SL 85/4

10:40 hrs IST: The forward short-leg position is quite dangerous for any fielder and the proof was there when KL Rahul got hit on his helmet. SL 84/4

10:37 hrs IST: Dickwella is using his feet to reach the length of the ball. This can be effective considering the cracks on the pitch. SL 78/4

10:00 hrs IST: Ravindra Jadeja to bowl the first over of the day. SL 50/2

09:59 hrs IST: Ravichandran Ashwin got a lot of assistance from the pitch yesterday and he will surely be the key for India.

09:57 hrs IST: We are minutes away from the start of the match. This will be a crucial day in determining the course of the game with both teams looking to establish their dominance.

09:32 hrs IST: The pitch looks quite solid, but some cracks will form over time and that can be really good news for the Indian spinners.

09:22 hrs IST: Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal negotiated the Indian bowlers well and the onus will be on them to stabilize the Sri Lanka innings.

09:12 hrs IST: Sri Lanka pacer Nuwan Pradeep picked up an injury during the match and it will be interesting to see how big a part he plays in his team’s efforts of getting a positive result from this Test match.

09:07 hrs IST: Ravichandran Ashwin also made history as he took the fewest Tests to the double of 2000 runs & 200 wickets. He surpassed Ian Botham to claim this distinction.

08:55 hrs IST: Ravichandran Ashwin was the star of Day 2 for India. A brilliant half century followed by two important wickets have placed the visitors in the driver’s seat.

08:20 hrs IST: Hello and welcome to HT’s live coverage of Day 3 of the second Test between India - Sri Lanka at Colombo.

Earlier, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane had both scored centuries, before fifties from Ravichandran Ashwin, Wriddhiman Saha and Ravindra Jadeja helped India cross the 600-run mark.

On Day 3, India will look to grab some quick wickets and end the hosts’ first innings, having already carried a lead of 572 runs from Day 2. It will be interesting to see if skipper Virat Kohli decides to enforce follow-on in case Sri Lanka fail to reach the score of 423.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will look to take their time at the crease and add some runs to the board as they seek to avoid a second straight loss in the series."

"Wimbledon 2017: Roger Federer and Marin Cilic win, set up finals clash","US censure for Hizb has come a little late in the day

Aug 17, 2017 19:00 IST"
Riding the horse of life to death: Vijay Nambisan (1963-2017),"In the early 1990s in Bombay, poetry, or prose for that matter, was not about getting prizes. Or even being recognized in a bookshop or a restaurant. It was a defiant and dangerous personal vocation. Something like the helpless inner voice that urges a prospective Christ to climb his cross as a matter of course, and drive the first nail with his free hand.

Poetry was a romantic, seemingly interminable act of self sacrifice. First it required a measure of self abuse. Then with luck words came. And they would sound real. For better or worse, that has changed . Writing is a career now. A performance. A mime of the self. A frantic if studied method to hang on to what may not be there anytime now: an award, a fellowship, a flung nickel, an air ticket. And it involves one of the most tiring tasks an intelligent human can embark on: self promotion.

Vijay Nambisan was capable of neither. In one of Vijay’s prose works, Language as Ethic, he argues from the heart—and shores up those arguments from his phenomenal intellect — that at the core of communication is not even words and images, but integrity. Devoid of it, language assumes a political and manipulative nature. On the surface of it, the premise sounds like the plea of an honest man to all to be good. But it explains, typical of Vijay’s work, as in a flash, why a whole culture is incapable of facing up to truth at just about every level. And a people’s proneness to collective delusions.

In the Bombay of the ‘90s there was a bunch of people from different generations who, more or less, spoke the then young Vijay’s alien language: poetry. Dom Moraes, Arun Kolatkar, Adil Jussawalla, Nissim Ezekiel, Eunice De Souza, Jeet Thayyil to name a few. In my perception, at that time, among the senior poets Dom was closer to youngsters like us than the others. Dom was particularly encouraging of Jeet, Vijay, and me, regular visitors to Dom’s residence in Sargent House, Allana Road, Colaba.

In the Bombay of the ‘90s there was a bunch of people from different generations – like writer-poet Dom Moraes (left) and publisher David Davidar– who, more or less, spoke the then young Vijay’s alien language: poetry.

Dom had written, perhaps excessively kind, introductions and blurbs for the three of us, and recommended us to David Davidar, who published the now landmark Penguin Gemini series. As far as I can recall — and there is not much I am able to forget — most of us were on some mood altering substance or the other most of the time, and had a certain contempt for what Vijay described as the Corporate Poet. And he did not mean just poet. He was against suits, boots, hats. And an equal measure of contempt for time; why else would we all try so desperately to fast-forward our clocks?

One of the accidental meeting points of the younger lot of poets was the Debonair magazine, whose office then was in Worli, housed in an unpretentious building. It would be always hot inside. And then there would be areas where it was wintry. The air conditioning was uneven. At the time, Anil Dharker was running it, and, like a classic literary editor, he was open to new writers. The poetry editor for a while, if I recall correctly, was Imtiaz Dharker.

When Dharker quit, Adil Jussawalla took over. It was at this time that I first met Vijay. I had gone there, mid-morning, to follow up on an article; Vijay was in Adil’s cabin. He saw me and came out, grinning like he had met a cousin long lost. We went down to the bar round the corner and had a few. Sometime in the twilight hours, we parted, and all I could take away from that meeting was that I was supposed to meet him the next morning, at his paying guest room, close by.

I went, nursing the by now familiar hangover, and knocked on the door. Vijay opened it, but his face had undergone drastic restructuring. The night before he had fallen flat down the stairs on his chin, and was lighter for three or four teeth. There was blood on the stairs. I went back, in search of phantoms similar to Vijay. But could not find too many — even over the years.

I mention these details of the inner workings in the literary alleys of Bombay of that rather unchronicled decade because Vijay stuck to that life, took several more falls. Lost more than his teeth.

The others moved on or tried to move from that unforgiving, transgressive life, in which words had to be bought with a little bit of life in exchange, an unsustainable trade.

Vijay bought into solitude, sometimes hating it, sometimes, choice-less, loving it. It gave him, I imagine, a martyr’s identity. He was the knight of poetry, and he was going to ride the horse of life to death. The smarter among his friends veered away from that track.

Through it all, Vijay wrote. Not much, but a little that said a lot. For him it was hard to separate a way of living from a way of writing. To create, he had to destroy. And his own body seemed the closest at hand.

He knew what he was doing. And, to me, it felt like a kind of vengeance. I was not sure vengeance against what. Most likely against himself. Between suicide and murder, he would choose the first. He knew his ways of life hurt people who loved him the most; his family; his very caring wife, Dr Kaveri Nambisan, a fine novelist herself. A few times, he went off alcohol; but he unerringly came back to, as he puts in a different contest, in Reminders of Gain : The call of the arrow/Summons the bow//

There are the usual articles doing the rounds that Vijay was a recluse. That word is a much-prostituted one in literary descriptions because it is used as if reclusion is a kind of extreme glamour of the eccentric. But then this is a place where the press described him as “the first all India poetry champion in 1988.”

The truth was that Vijay was dysfunctional. The only place he could be himself and find a transcendental value was in the world of words. He was close to a few people. That kept shifting. For a while, or so I think, he was quite my comrade in arms; in alms, too. The early years in Bombay for instance. Then we drifted. In his later phase, he was perhaps close to Jeet.

Vijay Nambisan was close to poet and writer Jeet Thayil. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)

In between, I moved to Pune to head the Times of India’s edition there. Vijay and Kaveri had taken up a house in Lonavla, where he said the “clouds passed through his head, if he opened the window.” I never did make it to Lonavla.

In the car from office to my house once, Vijay said, “You have become a different man.” All the while I wondered how to tuck him in bed, given his slightly accusatory mood. This was around the time he had done a rare, cadenced translation of selected portions of Poonthanam’s Jnana Paana, (Song of Wisdom).

Poonthanam was a great 16th century Bhakti poet who more or less wrote the rules of the Malayalam language and literature. He was a devotee of Krishna, especially after the accidental death of his infant child. Poothanam’s rival in Krishna bhakti was Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, a rather superior — he was one of India’s first astronomers, and he was a great mathematician and linguist as well — brahmin who wrote, Narayaneeyam in Sanskrit. Poothanam’s work made literature accessible to the Malayalee non-brahmin. One of the great questions in Malayalam literature has been: Which work is better? Or which works better?

When Vijay said he was going to translate these ancient poets to English, I remember asking him, who’s going to read it. Vijay asked for some salt. Because he sweated a lot, he would mix salt in alcohol. It was all quite scientific at one level. I got him salt. He blew some smoke in my direction and grinned his famous grin. He didn’t care. That’s what he meant. The market did not enter into the world of his words. His integrity was a voice that he could ever rely on to impel him to triumphs and disasters.

Later, he said the translation was no easy job. Though Vijay, like quite a few IIT-ians, had a photographic memory, he was not fluent in reading or writing Malayalam, even though he asserted his provenance and ethnicity wherever possible.

What he did was to ask his father — who, when I met him once at his home in Bangalore, seemed both proud and worried about his prodigal son — for literal translations and then trans-created it beautifully into rhythmic wisdom.

Consider the opening lines of his work: “O yesterday the things we did not know would come!/And O the things we do not know will come today!/Now we behold those soon pass away!/ We are not told how long they’ll stay with us”.

There is a touch of Hamlet here: “There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come — the readiness is all.”

At the time when the book came out, it was mostly criticized for his self-confessed ignorance of the vernacular, and his own agnosticism. To my mind, it was a spectacular act of literary courage, though not easy to distinguish from self indulgence, and dare.

Through it all Vijay drank. Went into detox. Came out. Wrote. Smoked. He smoked, I had often thought, as an antidote to alcohol. It was a break from what he was doing to his liver. For this, he had to destroy his throat and lungs. Either way, he would pay a price.

He paid it. Because the rest of the world of his 90s had changed. They had become gentrified. All the more reason he had to stay the course. He was the last man standing. What he thought of the change he said a few years ago in Outlook: “Eighteen of the happiest months in my life were spent in rural Bihar. It may sound like reverse snobbery, but I can’t help that. My wife and I were honoured members of the community, no one tried or wanted to shoot us, and the nuns looked after us like friends. What more could we want? A Learjet?”

This was the stay that went into the writing of his funny and insightful work: Bihar is in the Eye of the Beholder. It explained, as perhaps only a poet could, the intricate workings of a place that failed to work. And still survived like a trick that explained the tawdry magic of India. This book too was commissioned by David Davidar of Penguin, with whom Vijay had a productive relationship.

That’s saying a lot. Vijay’s ties changed with the tides of his mind. People betrayed him, by just not calling him up. In his mind, and I believe he is right, he was one of the few genuine artistes who deserved recognition, but would do nothing outside the covers of his books, to wangle it.

His latest collection, which was released last year, First Infinities, has some remarkable poems. It was perhaps justly brought out by an alternative publishing house, Hemant Diwate’s Poetrywala. Some of the poems suffer from a certain vulnerability to fall into the rhymes and rhythms, which take the poet away from the place he intended to end up in when he set out. But more often than not, the music ends in notes you did not think resided in them. It’s only the fine permutation of the words that makes possible a beauty which was not there till Vijay thought it up:

Snow

Crisp in the winter’s morning,

Softly all through the night,

What is this without warning,

Falling and white?

I have never seen snow

But I can imagine it quite –

Not how it tastes, but I know

It falls and is white.

One morning I’ll open the door

To bring in the morning’s milk,

And all around there’ll be snow –

Fallen and still.

How I’ll roll in the stuff!

How I’ll tumble and spin!

Until the neighbours cry, Enough!

And send me back in.

These are times when people die to live. Vijay lived to die. And write. I am glad I walked part of the way with him. He was the light. And he burnt furiously while he was there.

Rating: 2.5/5

History is written by the victors.

In the 340-room opulent Delhi house lives master of the country’s fate Lord Mountbatten, who has no clue about what’s going inside it. Seemingly a misfit for the job, he has arrived in India to finalise its partition into two states, one for Hindus and Sikhs and the other for Muslims.

Riots have already broken and thousands have been killed in Punjab and Bengal province, and thus Viceroy Mountbatten wants to get over with the physical division of the border as soon as possible. Little does he know that he is just a pawn in a much bigger scheme of things orchestrated by Winston Churchill years ago! In fact, somebody in the film says this in as many words, ‘Churchill had a vision.’

Visionary or not, Churchill, of course, plays an important part in Gurinder Chadha’s film, which heavily borrows from a couple of books including Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins’ Freedom At Midnight.

There are spoilers ahead.

The idea is to develop a theory around a war document of 1945, which brings out Churchill and thus England’s overall aggressive policy towards South Asia. As per Viceroy’s House, titled Partition 1947 in Hindi, the great Indian dissection was a tactic to restrict the Russian influence in the mineral oil zone. It would have given our old, tyrant masters a firm chance to control Jinnah’s Pakistan and thus its neighbour Afghanistan. Apparently, it was much more difficult to lead Jawaharlal Nehru and his futuristic policies in the same way.

All this is known to the audience way before Louis Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville, Robert Crawley in TV series Downton Abbey), who despite being the King’s relative knows nothing about the imperial policies. His anger and grief after realising how he has been played soon transform into a volatile remorse, which makes him more human towards the Indians and the local culture.

When Michael Gambon’s Lord Ismay tells him that he and nobody else is the chief architect of India’s division because the arrangement is called the Mountbatten plan then, for a moment, you might take his side. After all, he is just a poor war veteran, who, along with Lady Edwina Mountbatten (Gillian Anderson), is running an outreach programme in the Indian capital for poor, sufferers and people who eat with their hands.

In short, his blissful ignorance of a conspiracy of such high magnitude is the director’s ploy to shift the rage towards the players sitting in England rather than those who are getting the partition executed on the ground in India. You don’t know whether to laugh or cry when Cyril Radcliffe, the engineer of the Radcliffe line between India and Pakistan, says how this is his maiden India tour.

Feasibility aside, this points a finger towards the local leadership’s cluelessness towards the proceedings. How did Gandhi and Nehru miss it when Jinnah got it long before them? Then there is a conversation where Jinnah tells Mountbatten how they both wanted this to happen for their own interests.

But before that, Chadha exposes Jinnah’s high-handedness and his lust for a separate country.

The stories from the interiors of the Viceroy’s House come crawling out via some Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims working for Lord Mountbatten. Two of them are Jeet Kumar (Manish Dayal) and Aaliya (Huma Qureshi). Their history goes all the way to Lahore where Jeet helped Aaliya’s freedom fighter father(Om Puri in one of his last roles) in the prison. This partition is also a question mark on their future, safety and belief in a common culture in times of fanaticism.

At best a highlighted sidetrack, they never take the centre-stage as the pain of one of the biggest migrations in the history of mankind engulfs us all. From Lahore to Delhi, the ochre sky is filled with shrieks and stories of inhumanity except for Lord Mountbatten, who as per the film is still passionate about the safety and wellbeing of the Indians. What a wrong choice to carry out the divisive English plans!

You’ll also meet Gandhi ji (Neeraj Kabi) who forces Mountbatten to taste his curd made of goat’s milk, or some Cambridge-educated gentlemen who are no less refined than the English lords. A couple of AR Rahman tunes enhance the mood here and there, but fail to contribute anything significant to Chadha’s version of the Indian partition.

In 106 minutes, Gurinder Chadha ably paints the anxiety and painful relocation of millions on the both sides of the border. Her handling or rather handing out a clean chit to England’s last Viceroy to India seems over-simplification of the historic episode though.

Cannes 2017: Now Godard reframed by The Artist director Michael Hazanavicius,"One remembers French director Michael Hazanavicius’s The Artist, a beautiful black and white portrait of the silent Hollywood. He has now returned to the Cannes Film Festival – six years later that is – with his yet another gripping work, Redoubtable. A wonderful tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Redoubtable has been adapted from a biography of the celebrated auteur penned by his former wife, Anne Wiazemsky.

A still from Redoubtable.

Hazanavicius’ movie revolves around the time when Godard was helming what is famously known as his revolutionary work, La Chinoise. The time was 1967, a turbulent period in French history, which saw a workers’ demonstration followed by a serious student unrest.

As the Festival enters its sixth day on Monday, Redoubtable has been one of the few films that impressed this critic. It has been executed with remarkable finesse, has noteworthy performances and it narrates the story of a marriage gone sour at times when the French literary circles were driven by unending contradictions. Godard was an integral part of it.

What is the story all about? Godard’s short but passionate marriage to an actress – who later became a fiction writer -- Anne Wiazemsky. She was almost 20 years younger than Godard, and was everything that the man was not. He was brooding, critical, restrictively conservative when it came to her (there is a scene where he asks Anne not to do a movie because every scene has a nude shot of her’s and well, the poor director changes his script to have only the hero strip – a hilarious take that it then becomes) and so damn difficult when it came to other aspects of life and living.

In fact, much of the film is based on Anne’s biography, titled Un An Apres (One Year Later), and much of the celluloid work is seen from her point of view. She narrates much of it, indeed.

Godard was 37, and Anne barely 19, and the auteur was passing through a troublesome phase in his career. He was making La Chinoise, a movie influenced by Mao. She was acting in it, but when the the film runs into rough weather critically, Godard gets moody and irritable and argumentative. “Nobody can win an argument with you” says one of his friends.

The movie’s failure was followed by the unrest in 1968 – a year that saw Godard and his friends like Francois Truffaut storming the Cannes Film Festival and forcing it to pull its curtains down, One is told that Truffaut, who had been declared persona non-grant by the Festival because of his acerbic criticism of French cinema, sneaked into Cannes to cause mayhem. Both felt that Cannes should not run when there was so much suffering all around.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe.

At home, Godard was facing his own little tempest, and the relationship with Anne was hitting the rocks.

All this has been pictured most realistically – with a touch of wit and sarcasm (one often felt that the film was also an indictment of all things wrong with the French society then). We clearly see Godard’s fear of ageing , his nagging doubts about his own creative ability and his narcissistic tendencies. All these rob his life and marriage of peace – the political storm outside his home adding to his own disquiet.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe. For much like Satyajit Ray and Tagore – who have been deeply ingrained in the psyche of an average Indian (certainly Bengali) – Godard and Truffaut will remain forever in these parts of the world.

And this is precisely what Hazanavicius told the media soon after his movie was screened on Saturday night. “Anybody making cinema today owes something to Jean-Luc Godard. He unlocked so many doors, created so many spaces and made cinema possible for many people”.

Anne’s account gives the movie a kind of rare insightfulness. “The intelligence of Anne Wiazemsky’s account lies in the way she manages to retain the aspect of an intimate diary. She doesn’t recount the story from the point of view of the woman she is now, but rather the woman she was then. There is a real Jean-Luc Godard who exists, but no one really knows him. My aim is not to create a carbon copy of Godard. I am inventing Jean-Luc Godard out of the Jean-Luc Godard created by Jean-Luc Godard. Anne Wiazemsky’s account is another variation of a Jean-Luc Godard also created by Jean-Luc Godard”, the director quipped.

Finally, one can say with a lot of conviction that Hazanavicius has managed to make a film on a subject as heavy as Godard with a breeze. Nowhere did this critic feel Redoubtable too heavy or languid. Rather, it was lighthearted and even funny. Not an easy task, though.

Upul Tharanga to lead Sri Lanka in ODI series against Indian cricket team,"Senior batsman Upul Tharanga will lead a 15-man Sri Lanka squad in the the five-match ODI series against India that begins in Dambulla on Sunday.

Tharanga endured a horrendous Test series against India, scoring only 88 runs in six innings, in which Sri Lanka were routed 0-3.

The upcoming series will be the left-handed batsman’s first in charge of the team after Angelo Mathews gave up the ODI captaincy post the 2-3 loss against Zimbabwe at home in July.

While Mathews is still part of the squad, seasoned pacer Lasith Malinga has also made a comeback.

There are two other changes from the Sri Lankan squad which featured in the last three ODIs against Zimbabwe.

Pacer Nuwan Pradeep and all-rounder Asela Gunaratne are out due to injuries and their places in the side has been taken by young fast bowler Lahiru Kumara and left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara, who both featured in the Test series against the Indians.

Upul Tharanga has called for support from his countrymen ahead of what should prove to be another tough outing against the higher-ranked India.

“Every team goes through a rough patch,” he said.

“This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are. The support of our fans plays a big role in lifting the morale of the team.

“We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us,” Tharanga added.

Sri Lanka last played India in an ODI series in November 2014-15 (in India) and were blanked 0-5.

Abandoned bunkers of 1962 Indo-China war attract tourists to Nelong Valley,"Far from the latest Sino-India standoff in the eastern border, Uttarakhand’s Nelong Valley along the border with China continues to attract discerning travellers to its picturesque Ladakh-type landscape and abandoned bunkers of the 1962 Chinese aggression.

Perched at around 11,000 feet close to the China border, the valley lies in the Gangotri National Park area in Uttarkashi district - around 315 km from Dehradun.

Once a buzzing hotspot for the Indo-Tibet trade, the valley was closed for civilians and tribals residing in villages were shifted out from there at the time of the 1962 Sino-India war.

Though the battle did not play out in this region, bunkers were erected in the valley from the security point of view, local experts say.

The valley then remained out of bounds for civilians for over five decades post the 1962 war, before a part of it was ultimately reopened by the Uttarakhand government for tourists in 2015.

“No longer in use, these bunkers in the open-for-civilians-area of the valley are now attracting tourists...visitors feel very excited to set foot in the abandoned bunkers and to get a feel of how the soldiers would have survived during the harsh, climatic conditions,” said Tilak Soni, an Uttarkashi-based adventure and tourism expert who strove for the reopening of the valley.

Vinod Panwar, who visited the Valley recently, said: “The entire valley is like a thrilling surprise package, tucked in the Himalayas…but I especially enjoyed peeking inside an old bunker dotted along the route, getting the feel of a soldier’s life.”

Uttarkashi district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava said over 464 tourists have visited the valley since April this year, which is “double the number from the last year”.

Almost 90% of the tourists applied for the special permit (which is required for visiting the valley) online through a single window clearance system introduced by the district administration in April this year.

Underlining the valley’s numerous attractions, including the bunkers and an intricate wooden bridge that was used by locals for Indo-Tibet trade prior to the war, Srivastava said, “We are planning to develop the entire region from heritage tourism point of view and to offer a whole range of interpretation about different attractions of the Valley to further enhance tourists’ experience.”"
