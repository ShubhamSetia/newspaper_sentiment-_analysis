Emotional Barca start with win,"Catalans honour terror attack victims in Betis win; Real Madrid beat Deportivo

Barcelona, August 21

Barcelona got their La Liga season off to a winning start, beating Real Betis 2-0 at a emotional Camp Nou following a pair of terrorist attacks in Catalonia. Twin vehicle attacks on Thursday killed 14 people and wounded around 120 in Barcelona’s bustling Las Ramblas boulevard and the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils. A minute’s silence was held before kick-off, whilst Barcelona players wore black armbands and shirts with ‘Barcelona’ replacing individual names on the back. “What happened was terrible, we hope this stops now because we are not afraid,” Barca winger Gerard Deulofeu, who set up both goals, said. “This victory is for those affected.” The decision for the match to go ahead with increased security measures put in place was part of a desire to “recover normality” in the words of Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont. A defiant attitude was on show in the stands, although in common with many matches against weaker opposition, the 99,000 capacity Camp Nou was far from full. After the attack some fans, especially tourists, returned their tickets, the club said without giving figures. “Their money was refunded to everyone, the circumstances are special and understandable,” a club spokesman said.

‘Not afraid’

Fans in the Barca singing section borrowed a line from the club’s anthem in a banner that read: “No one can ever break us,” whilst chants of “we are not afraid” rang out after the minute’s silence. “I thought there would be like a collective hysteria but I see everything is normal,” added Sandra Lorenzo, 41, as she sold drinks next to the stadium. “I have worked here for 25 years at every match. They are not going to make me stay at home.” Prior to the attacks, Barca had endured a difficult start to the season on the field as the Catalans were swept aside 5-1 on aggregate by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. Coach Ernesto Valverde admitted on Saturday events in the past few days had put the club’s problems into perspective. However, despite also missing the injured Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta, Barca rose to the challenge of raising the city’s spirits with a dominant display. Captain Lionel Messi led by example with Deolofeu and Paco Alcacer struggling to fill Suarez and Neymar’s shoes up front. Messi smashed an early freekick off the post and his presence was enough to pressure Alin Tosca to turn Deulofeu’s low cross into his own net for the opener nine minutes before halftime. Deulofeu was the provider once more when Barca doubled their advantage three minutes later as Sergi Roberto slotted home from close range. Messi also posed the biggest threat of a low key second- half as he struck the woodwork twice more with rasping shots from outside the area. Real cruise to 3-0 win Madrid: Real Madrid’s winning streak shows no signs of abating as the European champions began their defence of La Liga with a comfortable 3-0 win at Deportivo la Coruna. Gareth Bale, Casemiro and Toni Kroos were on target for the visitors, but Madrid’s night at La Riazor ended on a sour note when captain Sergio Ramos was shown the 23rd red card of his Real career. Deportivo were left to rue to big chances missed in the first 10 minutes.

Neymar slams Barca bosses

Paris: Paris Saint-Germain’s world record signing Neymar launched a scathing attack on his former club’s directors. The people in charge at the Catalan giants “are not the people who should be there, for the direction of Barca,” Neymar said after scoring twice on his home debut as PSG thumped Toulouse 6-2 in Ligue 1. “I want to speak the truth, I’m very sad with them,” said the Brazilian star who cost the Paris club a world record ^222 million to prise from Barcelona. “I spent four beautiful years there and I parted happy. But with them (the club’s directors), no. For me, they are not the people who should be there, for the direction of Barca,” said Neymar. “Barca deserve much better and the whole world knows it.” Despite securing the massive fee for Neymar, Barcelona are struggling to replace him before the transfer window closes. The club have had bids in excess of ^100 million for Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho and Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele turned down. And the club have been criticised for splashing out ^40 million for Paulinho. — AFP"
"If we enter India, it will be chaos: China","Beijing, August 22

China on Tuesday said there will be ""utter chaos"" if its troops entered India on the pretext that Indian border infrastructure posed a threat to Beijing.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said India's logic that Chinese road building in Doklam on the border posed a threat to New Delhi was ""ridiculous and vicious"".

It said China would in no way allow any country or individual to infringe upon its territorial sovereignty.

""The Indian side illegally crossed the boundary on the excuse of ... Chinese road building. The reason is ridiculous, vicious and facts are clear,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.

""You may think about it. If we tolerate India's ridiculous logic, then anyone who dislikes the activity at his neighbour's home can break into its neighbour's house.

""Does that mean when China thinks that large-scale construction of infrastructure at the border area of India is posing a threat, it can enter Indian territory? Wouldn't that be utter chaos?"" Indian and Chinese troops have been locked since June in a stand-off at Doklam in the Sikkim section of the Bhutan-China border.

This is the longest stand-off between the two armies since 1987 when they faced a similar situation at Somordong Chu Valley in Arunachal Pradesh.

It all began when Indian troops stopped Chinese troops from building a road in Doklam, citing the disputed status of the territory.

Doklam is claimed by Bhutan, which has protested against Chinese road building.

China says the construction of the road is just since Doklam has been Chinese territory since ancient times.

New Delhi backs Bhutan's claims and sees a Chinese road in Doklam as a threat because the region is very close to the Siliguri Corridor, which connects India's northeast with the rest of the country.

"Fearing trouble, students leave Sirsa varsity hostels","Sushil Manav

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 21

Anticipating trouble in view of the verdict in the case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, a majority of students in four hostels of Chaudhary Devi Lal University in Sirsa have left for home. Sources said a majority of girl inmates of Kalpana Chawla Girls Hostel and Mata Harki Devi Girls Hostel left for home on Saturday. Some left on Sunday and others today. “Ever since news of the verdict and possible violence started coming in, girls were showing signs of fear. Parents of some girls called us and expressed their concern,” said a woman teacher. In Sardar Patel Hostel and Lala Lajpat Rai Hostel, both boys’ hostels, 20 to 30 per cent students left for home. Sources said many others planned to leave for home in the coming two days. “Attendance was very thin today in most of the departments where hostel inmates were more in strength,” said another teacher. She said the next four days were likely to be unannounced holidays. At Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal Vidyapeeth, Chief Warden Ramesh Mehta said parents of students, particularly girls, were showing concern for the past two or three days. Meanwhile, the government today directed V Umashankar, Additional Chief Executive Officer, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, and Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, to assist the Sirsa administration with immediate effect, in addition to present duties. Umashankar was the Sirsa DC in 2007 when the dera-Sikh violence erupted after Ram Rahim Singh was booked for blasphemy. Bijender Singh, SDO (Civil), Sirsa, held a meeting with members of the peace committee and sought cooperation in maintaining peace. SDM Satbir Singh Jangu held such a meeting in Fatehabad."
Colour calculus,"’ART & SOUL

In Devinder Goswamy’s designs, each shape and colour seems engaged in a dialogue with the next

B.N. Goswamy

“Let no one destitute of geometry enter my doors”. — Plato “Colour is the place where our brain and the Universe meet….Colour has got me; I no longer need to chase after it. It has got me for ever.” — Paul Klee “Vertical and horizontal lines are the expression of two opposing forces; they exist everywhere and dominate everything; their reciprocal action constitutes ‘life’. I recognize that the equilibrium of any particular aspect of nature rests on the equivalence of its opposites…”

— Piet Mondrian

For the greater part of his professional life, D.G. (that is the best way to refer to him, at least at this point) was involved with the performing arts. Working with Doordarshan in a high executive capacity, he remained engaged with the world of music and dance and theatre; he also wrote a number of stunning plays, mostly in Urdu, and kept directing them for the channel. He planned and worked; worked and planned, but always in those areas. After superannuation, or close to it, however, he somehow got drawn to the visual arts: to painting, in particular. What took him there is not easy to determine, but once he went there, so to speak, he stayed there. Much in the manner of the great Swiss painter, Paul Klee, who said once that ‘colour has got me… it has got me forever’, colours and shapes ‘got him’, became his new world, as it were. It would be fair to say that he began a bit gingerly. Attracted by the idea of collaging — ‘composing a work of art by pasting on a single surface various materials not normally associated with one another’, as the formal definition has it — he would fill a surface with snippets of images by great masters: van Gogh’s chair, for instance, Manet’s lunching party, Seurat’s stippled ballerina, Bhupen Khakhar’s brooding face, all tilted, torn out of context, jostling one another to the point of unease. But this did not last long. Very soon, he turned towards the purity of shapes and the tactile seduction of textures. He would assemble all kinds of papers and cardboards and plastic sheets, and sit surrounded by them gazing at each, making up his mind, cutting them up in different shapes and sizes. And then compose them in his mind. The process of putting them together naturally followed: cerebration, decision, trial and error, and the like. Traditional materials held for him great attraction: the sacred mauli thread for instance, pieces of hessian, coarsely woven uparna-like fabric, strips of embroidered ribbons. Everything became grist to his churning, artistic mill. It would not be easy to dis-entangle the skeins of his thought: Were there childhood memories here? An innate reverence for the sacred? Sights of struggling small-town shopkeepers and their goods? Interestingly, the bits and pieces that he picked for turning into images were not all placed — collaged — at the same level on the surface: some rose, others dipped, still others peeped over the walls of their neighbours, and so on. Even the edges of the total composition remained uneven at times. But somehow it all worked. Hard-edged shapes — squares and triangles and circles and rectangular strips — in various colours and configurations one would have naturally expected to figure in D.G.’s completely abstract work, and they did, each shape and colour setting up a dialogue with the one next to it. Not every colour was intense, not everything glowed with an inner fire, but a quiet, whispered conversation one could hear snatches of. But there also were works in which one could see a kind of frenzy: two circles made up of strips of coloured paper that seemed to be whirling at a dizzying speed, paper strip piled upon paper strip and in the centre, at the heart of the circle, gaping holes through which other things, other sights, could be seen, even as a dark, lurking gloom surrounded everything. This is the way it has gone on, this work, over a number of years. One of the more recent works, a tall ‘canvas’ — that, however, is not the right word, I know — appears to me to have been something of a tribute to the genius of Paul Klee who played with colours and shapes in the subtlest of manners. In this, the work titled ‘As Darkness Lifts’, the eye moves slowly, leisured-fashion, from dark edges towards the centre where a certain light begins to glow. There is no aura, no intensity, in the centre but a gentle spread of light — rectangles and squares of different shades, yellows and reds and light greens, overlapping and dove-tailing — suggesting the breaking of dawn, as it were. Inevitably, perhaps, a couplet of Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi’s comes to mind, at least to my mind: Sansanaate hain andherey to laraztey kyun ho? Har nayi subah ki takhleeq yun-hi hoti hai. [Why do you shudder when shadows gather and darkness seethes? Surely, this is how each morn arrives, triumphant.]

Who owns Mars? Mining puts spotlight on out of this world property claims,"Toronto, August 21

Can anyone claim the red planet or natural resources on asteroids? Business leaders and legal experts say the question has become more than philosophical as a growing number of firms, often backed by capital and technology from Silicon Valley, have set their sights on the resources of outer space asteroids and Mars.

In order to avoid conflicts between competing companies and countries over outer space resources, more work needs to be done on Earth to determine who owns commodities taken from celestial bodies, analysts said.

""There is a huge debate on whether companies can simply travel to space and extract its resources,"" said Barry Kellman, a law professor who studies space governance at DePaul University in Chicago.

""There is no way to answer the question until someone does it,"" Kellman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Asteroid water for sale

US-based Planetary Resources, a firm backed by Google founder Larry Page and Virgin Group's Richard Branson, expects to be mining asteroids for water in the next 10 to 15 years.

The company will launch its first robotic probe mission to scout asteroids for resource deposits in 2020, said Planetary Resources' Chief Executive Chris Lewicki.

""If you obtain a resource and bring it with you, it becomes your property,"" Lewicki said, citing recently passed space laws in the US and Luxembourg that offer a legal framework to ensure that private operators can be confident about their rights over resources they extract in space.

""You can sell, keep or deliver (space resources) peacefully,"" Lewicki told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The firm plans to extract oxygen and hydrogen - the components of water - from asteroids to sell.

Lewicki is not planning on bringing those water resources back to Earth; he wants market them in space, creating a ""gas station"" for other exploration missions.

Hydrogen and oxygen, kept at a docking station orbiting around Earth, will be used to fuel other space ships.

Moving those fuels from Earth into outer space is expensive, he said, and having energy accessible to ships will make voyaging easier.

One modest sized asteroid, about as big as a football field, ""has enough oxygen and hydrogen to fuel every launch in the history of space (travel),"" Lewicki said.

""We are seeing a boom — that might be a bad choice of words — in access to space.""

Martian appropriation

Other analysts are not sure if companies can just fly up and start harvesting cosmic water, legally speaking.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 is the main international standard for what companies and countries are allowed to do when they aren't on earth, said Jacob Haqq-Misra, director of the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, a Seattle-based research group.

The treaty says that space is the ""provenance of all mankind"". Countries cannot claim ""national appropriation"" or sovereignty over the Moon or other celestial bodies ""by occupation or by other means"", the treaty says.

This clause could prove tricky for private firms who want to mine on asteroids or Mars, said Haqq-Misra, including Planetary Resources and SpaceX, the private rocketship company run by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

""If SpaceX, a US corporation, was to claim asteroid profits as its own, there is some ambiguity as to whether that constitutes national appropriation,"" Haqq-Misra told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

SpaceX declined to comment.

New laws

While the 1967 treaty is considered the global standard for sharing space, individual countries have recently passed laws allowing for property rights in the great beyond.

Luxembourg this month brought into force laws allowing private firms to own resources extracted from outer space in a move hailed by the nascent space mining industry.

Planetary Resources, for example, maintains an office in the small European country better known for its finance industry than space exploration.

The US in 2015 introduced similar legislation for private space resource ownership but it only applies to firms majority owned by Americans.

NASA, the US government's space agency, maintains a ""neutral position with regard to mining of minerals on Mars"", a spokesman said.

""If companies request assistance or want partnerships related to mining on Mars, we help to the best of our ability,"" NASA spokesman Guy Webster told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email without providing specifics on space resource ownership.

From sea to space

Along with national legislation and the 1967 treaty, there are other earthly regulations that could provide guidance for managing extraterrestrial resources, legal experts said.

Under the United Nations' Law of the Sea Convention countries have exclusive rights to exploit natural resources within around 200 miles (322 km) of their coastline, but ships and planes from other nations can freely pass through the waters.

This could serve as a template for space resource rights, where companies have exclusive economic rights in a given area around their landing point, but not ownership over an entire asteroid or planet, lawyers said.

""It's advantageous to work out a system where people can acquire property rights enforceable through a legal process,"" Andrew Brehm, an attorney with Scopelitis, Garvin, Light Hanson & Feary in Milwaukee.

""That being said, outer space is viewed in society as something similar to the ocean, where there is a collective interest,"" Brehm told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""A first come, first serve system does not necessarily work well when only certain countries or private entities can (currently) reach outer space.""

Even if countries can agree on a universal property rights regime for space, there are still plenty of earthly grievances for countries and companies to address, said Kellman, the law professor.

Specifically, analysts and legal experts do not know whether companies would have to pay taxes or royalties to anyone on earth for extracting space resources.

It is an issue space exploration firms have yet to deal with.

""For the moment, the company exists on earth, where all of the laws and regulations apply,"" Planetary Resources' Lewicki said. Reuters"
"Arjuna Award devalued, made cheap: Past recipients","Former recipients of the Arjuna Award on Tuesday lamented that its dignity has been lowered and the government is now “throwing” the honour away.

Former India hockey captain Ashok Kumar, who is son of legendary Dhyanchand, legendary middle-distance runner Sriram Singh Shekhawat, who holds national record of 1:45.77 in 800m since 1976, and former India volleyball skipper Suresh Mishra all voiced the same sentiment.

“The dignity has to be maintained. Why do you need to give Arjuna every year. Is it necessary? We are now throwing the awards away,” Ashok told PTI.

“They (government) have set their own parameters. The value attached with the award should be increased. There should be a cap that only Asiad and Olympic medal winners should be selected for the Arjuna honour,” Ashok, member of 1975 World Cup winning Indian team, said.

Ashok, himself a 1974 Arjuna awardee, also denounced the current procedure, where athletes have to send application to be considered for the honour.

“You can’t beg for award or demand it. Why should I blow my own trumpet that I have achieved something. When someone goes out for competition, it happens with the permission of the government. They know the achievements so it should be the government which should pick athletes rather than players sending applications,” he said.

India’s ace squash player Saurav Ghosal also felt the same.

“I think the concept of recommending or nominating someone for the awards is flawed. It just doesn’t sound right that player needs to be recommended or needs to apply for the award. The committee should pick the winners on their own on the basis of performances. Applying for the awards is like asking for a grant,” the 2006 Arjuna awardee said.

Asked if he feels any undeserving candidate has been selected, Ashok said, “I am not talking about any specific athlete but the system.”

Shekhawat, who won gold medal in 1974 Tehran Asian Games and a silver at 1970 Bangkok Asian Games, shared how tough the fight used to be for Arjuna among achievers of that era.

“When Arjuna Awards were decided for year 1972, I was Asiad medallist but still did not get it. There was only one slot and the award was given to V S Chauhan. We both were national record holders but since he was senior to me, he was chosen,” Shekhawat, who was chosen for honour in 1973, recollected.

“The selected athletes should be a medal winner at least at the Asian Games level,” he suggested.

Suresh Mishra, who also coached Abu Dhabi police volleyball team for 15 years in 80s and 90s, said there should be only Arjuna Award and the decision to make a Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna the highest honour was not correct.

“Which name is bigger, Arjuna or Rajiv Gandhi. It’s an insult to Arjuna Award. It has been degraded,” he said.

Arjuna Award was instituted in 1961 and Khel Ratna in 1991-1992.

Former India hockey captain Zafar Iqbal though chose to differ, saying giving awards was a way to encourage athletes.

“The award is not only for the athletes but also for the masses who follow. It encourages everyone. It has been fair. I don’t think it’s devalued,” the 1979 Arjuna awardee said.

Former hockey defender MP Singh suggested that achievements at Commonwealth Games should not be considered.

“The level of competition is not that high at CWG Games. And the government should make a policy for sports which do not figure in Asian Games and Olympics,” he said.

Close to 20 Arjuna awardees had gathered at the launch of an NGO, Sports: A way of Life, founded by 25-year-old Kanishka Pandey and pledged support for its programme, Sports Literacy Mission. — PTI"

Women’s college students in Jammu protest against dress code,"Jammu, August 22

Angry over bring forced to follow a dress code, hundreds of students of the Government Women’s College here on Tuesday boycotted their classes and staged protests against the management's ""unnecessary diktats"".

Shouting slogans and demanding immediate removal of the college principal, they also blocked the main road for nearly an hour soon after the institution opened at 9 am, the police said.

The blockade was removed after district and police officials rushed to the college at Parade, in the heart of the city, and pacified the protesters assuring them of appropriate action within 24 hours if their allegations were found true.

The protest, however, continued through the day despite assurances as the agitators accused the principal and teachers of harassing them on one pretext or the other.

""We are made to sit outside the class as punishment for not following a dress code, like not wearing a proper uniform and making two plaits. The students are deliberately failed in the class tests and even lewd remarks and abusive words are used against them,"" alleged the agitating students.

Additional District Development Commissioner Arum Manhas said the issues of removal of a peon at the main gate of the college and passing of lewd remarks came up during the discussion between the protesting students, the college management and district administration and police official.

""It was decided that the peon who is deployed at the main gate would be immediately removed. As far as the second allegations of passing of lewd remarks, there was no credible evidence, and the students were asked to lodge a written complaint with Sub-divisional Police Officer (North) Varun Jandiyal who was asked to probe the allegations and submit report within 24 hours,"" he said.

Meanwhile, on the allegations of harassment and high-handedness by the college management, Principal Anita Sudan said she had taken several decisions on the recommendations of the parents to ensure discipline in the institute.

""Four of our college girls had gone missing in the recent times and one of them was later recovered from Allahabad.

Parents of the girls regularly visit me and complain that they drop their wards outside the institute in the morning but they do not attend the college.

""I had asked the girls to come in proper uniform and called for strict enforcement of college timing. The students are levelling wild allegations,"" Sudan said.

She said no student had lodged any complaint about misbehaviour or passing of lewd remarks by anyone with her till date.

""When I came today and saw the students protesting, I called them to my chamber and asked them the reason. Some girls claimed that the guard at the main gate allegedly misbehaved with one of the girls but when I called him, they could not identify him,"" she claimed. — PTI"
Trump warns Pakistan against supporting terrorism,"Washington, August 22

The US on Monday ruled out a hasty withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan as President Donald Trump warned Pakistan of consequences if it continued to provide safe havens to terror groups and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Trump, in a prime-time televised address to the nation, laid out his South Asia policy saying a “critical part” of it was to further develop US’ strategic partnership with India. He said after a ""comprehensive review"", it had been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia would change dramatically.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I've said many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance, the dates we intend to begin, or end, military operations,"" Trump said in his address. ""We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities,"" Trump said as he announced his South Asia policy in front of about 2,000 people from all five services and top officials of his administration. Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continued to do so. ""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,"" Trump said. ""Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,"" he said, in a apparent warning to Pakistan. The US President reached out to India seeking an enhanced role for New Delhi, especially in the economic field, to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan. India, the world's largest democracy, is a key security and economic partner of the United States, he said. ""We appreciate India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development,"" Trump said."

"After SC bail, Lt Col Purohit says eager to rejoin Army","Mumbai, August 22

A day after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit said he wanted to rejoin the Army as soon as possible. ""I want to wear my uniform. It is outermost layer of my skin. I am wedded to it. I am very happy to get back into the service of the best organisation in the country if not the world, the Indian army,"" he told reporters outside a sessions court here. Purohit -- whose bail formalities are yet to be completed -- had been brought to the court for a hearing on framing of charges. ""I have two families -- the Army and my family which includes my wife, my two sons, sister and mother. I cannot wait to return to them,"" he said. The Army didn't ""let me down"", said Purohit. ""It's been the tradition and ethos of the Army not to let down its men,"" he said, adding, ""I never even once felt that I was out of the Army."" He praised his wife for helping him in his legal fight. Asked if he will seek action against the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad for allegedly ""planting (explosive) RDX on him"", Purohit said he was part of an institution, and if those claims were true, his ""seniors"" (in the Army) will deal with the matter. ""I am too small a fry to fight this,"" he said. Asked if he blamed anybody for his plight, the officer said no one was to blame but his ""destiny"". ""The Army is the only institution in the country which is not shaken by the ripples of what is happening in society,"" he said.

Release likely tomorrow

He, however, will have to spend one more night in jail before he is released.

Purohit was produced before the special NIA judge S D Tekale here today. The court is hearing the accused on framing of charges in the Malegaon blast case.

In the afternoon, Purohit's lawyers in Delhi approached the Supreme Court, seeking modification of bail conditions.

""The SC accepted our request and allowed us to avail of cash bail instead of producing sureties,"" said advocate Shrikant Shivde, Purohit's lawyer.

Purhoit's lawyers then initiated the procedure for getting a release order, which the special NIA court issued in the evening.

Police escorted Purohit back to Taloja jail near Mumbai a little after 6.30 pm. An Army vehicle had reached there to take Purohit, but it left after realising that he may not come out today as formalities for his release will take some more time.

The apex court had yesterday granted bail to Purohit, who has been in jail for almost nine years for his alleged role in the 2008 Malegaon blast case. Six people were killed in a bomb blast on September 29, 2008 at Malegaon, a communally-sensitive textile town in Nashik district of north Maharashtra. The apex court said there were ""material contradictions"" in the charge sheets filed by the ATS and the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which were required to be tested at the time of trial. — PTI"
Blue Whale threat: Haryana tells schools to counsel students,"Gurugram, August 22

All private and government schools have been issued an advisory by the Haryana Children Protection Commission (HCPC) to counsel students about the risk of ‘Blue Whale Challenge’ and other similar online games. The HCPC has asked schools also to keep a close tab on those students who were showing “abnormal”behaviour. The advisory directed the management of all schools to educate students from Classes 5 to 12 and make them aware of the deadly, hazardous and negative impact of ‘Blue Whale Challenge’, which has reportedly claimed lives of several people worldwide. ‘Blue Whale’ is a controversial Internet game in which a series of tasks are given to players for a period of 50 days by the administrators with a final challenge requiring them to commit suicide. The player is asked to share photos after finishing the different levels of the game. The game is spread via links on social media platforms. In the 17-point advisory, the HCPC has suggested deploying digital surveillance system in schools, installation of filters, firewalls, monitoring software mechanism, effective use of internet, among others as preventive measure. The initiative was taken following the directives of the National Children Protection Commission (NCPC), said Ramesh Yadav, a member of the HCPC. Yadav told PTI, “We have directed all Haryana government and public schools managements to spread awareness among all students and at Gururgram schools. The schools have also been asked to closely watch and conduct proper counselling in case abnormal behaviour is seen in any student.” He added, “We have directed schools to send a copy of advisory to parents with similar guidelines and instructions to keep a tab on the activities of students at home.” The district education officers have been directed to carry out surprise inspection in schools on a day-to-day basis to get feedback and maintain records if the HCPC guidelines were being followed, Yadav said.

New method to track HIV infection developed,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a new way to track HIV infection that can identify how individual particles infect each cell, and lead to novel therapies for prevention and treatment of the disease.

It has become routine to visualise the movement and progression of individual virions - individual infectious particles - in cells, but the relevance of these observations was previously unclear, as many virions are defective or do not progress to make further copies of themselves.

“This approach - and the ability to say ‘that virion infected that cell’ - will help bring clarity to the field,” said Thomas Hope, professor at Northwestern University in the US.

“It allows us to understand what the virus really needs to do to infect a cell. It gives us new details, like where in the cell it happens and the timing of specific events. The more we know about the virus, the better our chances are to stop it,” said Hope.

During the course of infection, HIV fuses onto a target immune cell and delivers its capsid - a cone that holds the genetic material of the virus - into the cell’s cytoplasm.

From there, the capsid disassembles through a process called “uncoating,” which is crucial to the synthesis of viral DNA from its RNA genome and the hijacking of the cell’s functions.

However, the specific details of uncoating have been controversial, with two groups of thought. One believed that uncoating takes place late at pores, allowing factors to enter the nucleus.

A second camp showed data suggesting that uncoating takes place early and in the cytoplasm.

In part, the uncertainty persisted because previous methods in HIV research have been unable to distinguish between viral particles that actually lead to infection of the cell, and those that are irrelevant.

In the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists used a novel live- cell fluorescent imaging system that allowed them for the first time to identify individual particles associated with infection.

In this case, they utilised the approach to monitor how the HIV capsid uncoats in the cell at the individual particle level. They demonstrated that uncoating leading to infection occurs early in the cytoplasm, around 30 minutes after cell fusion.

The finding is just one example of novel discoveries about HIV that might now be possible with the imaging system.

“Being able to connect infectivity of individual particles and how they behave in the cell to infection - which is what we really care about - is going to have a big impact on the field,” Hope said.

“The system can now be used to resolve other controversies in HIV biology and to determine which potential targets for drug development are most relevant,” he said. PTI"

Court to announce sentence in 1993 blasts case on September 7,"Mumbai, August 10

The special TADA court here would announce the quantum of sentence of five convicts, including extradited gangster Abu Salem, in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case on September 7.

Judge GA Sanap had on June 16 convicted Salem, Mustafa Dossa, Karimullah Khan, Firoz Abdul Rashid Khan, Riyaz Siddiqui and Tahir Merchant for their role in hatching the conspiracy for the blasts.

Another accused, Abdul Kayuum, was acquitted.

The court had concluded hearing on the quantum of punishment on August 10. Judge Sanap today said he would pronounce the sentence on September 7.

The prosecution had demanded death for Dossa, Karimullah Khan, Firoz Khan and Tahir Merchant, and life sentence for Siddiqui.

However, Dossa, one of the masterminds of the conspiracy (apart from absconding accused Dawood Ibrahim, Tiger Memon and others) died of cardiac arrest on June 28.

The prosecution had said that Salem too deserved death, but it cannot demand the maximum penalty for him because of the Indian Extradition Act.

Under section 34 (c) of the Act, if the country from where an accused has been extradited does not have a law that provides for capital punishment, he or she cannot be sentenced to death. Such a convict, however, can be awarded life term in jail.

In the first set of trial in the case which concluded in 2007, the court had convicted 100 accused, including Yakub Memon (who got death penalty) and actor Sanjay Dutt.

The trial of Salem and others was separated as they were arrested later.

The serial blasts in the country’s financial capital on March 12, 1993, left 257 people dead, 713 seriously injured, and destroyed property worth Rs 27 crore.

In the present trial, except for Riyaz Siddiqui, the court convicted other five of criminal conspiracy and murder under the IPC and provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act.

Siddiqui was convicted only under the TADA for helping Salem and others in transporting arms and ammunition.

All of them were absolved of the charge of ‘waging war against the nation’ under Section 121 of IPC.

While Dossa arranged for landing of explosives, including RDX in India, and sent some youths to Pakistan for arms training, Salem transported arms and ammunition from Gujarat coast to Mumbai.

He also handed over AK-56 rifles, 250 rounds of ammunition, and some hand grenades to Dutt. He was accused of later collecting two rifles and some ammunition back from the actor’s residence.

The court had dropped certain charges against Salem in 2013 after the investigating agency, CBI, said those were in violation of the extradition treaty between India and Portugal from where Salem was deported in 2005. — PTI"

Global roots of India’s freedom struggle,"Priya Satia

The Ghadar movement cultivated strong ties of solidarity with Egyptian, Irish, and other anti-colonial movements. Competing visions of the future world order coexisted with common dissatisfaction with the contemporary world order. Ghadar linked militant diaspora intellectuals with activists in the subcontinent.

Priya Satia

INDIA’S Independence changed the world. But it was also shaped by the world; Indian nationalism was a global product. Most of the iconic leaders of the nationalist movement—Gandhi, Nehru, and others — were formed by experiences abroad. More importantly, the movement by the Congress that they led made Independence its objective under the influence of radical influences from beyond the subcontinent. British suppression of the First War of Independence of 1857 led to the scattering of Indian rebels around the world. Many Punjabis wound up in California, where I write this article. The Delhi-born Lala Har Dayal met this community when his global wanderings took him to San Francisco. Around 1913, he led the foundation of the Ghadar Party here; the name ""Ghadar"" was an homage to the mutineers of 1857. The party's newspaper distributed revolutionary poetry and news from around the world — from Ireland, Russia, India, and elsewhere. Under British pressure, the American immigration authorities drove Har Dayal to flee to Geneva where he worked with anti-colonial exiles from Egypt. The Ghadar movement cultivated strong ties of solidarity with Egyptian, Irish, and other anti-colonial movements. These international networks of anti-colonialism were politically heterodox-a mix of nationalists, communists, anarchists, regionalists, those invested in ""pan"" movements (for example, Pan-Arabism, Pan-Asianism, Pan-Islam). Competing visions of the future world order coexisted with common dissatisfaction with the contemporary world order. Ghadar linked militant diaspora intellectuals with activists in the subcontinent. As China underwent a revolution in 1911, Indian communities along the Pacific rim helped the Ghadar movement acquire money and arms for an insurrection at home. Indians in India were also engaged in anti-colonial activities, inspired by a mix of local and global ideas. There was the ""gentlemanly terrorism"" of Bengal, influenced by the ideas of European revolutionaries from Mazzini to Marx. Banned literature came into Punjab from around the world, along with news of Indian resistance to racist policies in South Africa and Vancouver. Figures like Lala Lajpat Rai who travelled to California in 1907 and 1916 also strengthened intellectual and political ties between the Punjabi diaspora and Punjab. In 1914 as hundreds of Punjabis trying to enter Canada were turned back in the infamous ""Komagata Maru"" incident, World War I began. In Constantinople, Har Dayal and other Indians continued to work with Egyptians. Meanwhile, hundreds of Ghadar Party members prepared to return to India to free their homeland by raiding arsenals and organising mutinies. With American cooperation, British Intelligence caught wind of their plans. Many were executed; others were imprisoned on the Andaman Islands where they wrote love poetry for the motherland. On the hanging of his comrade Pandit Sohan Lal Pathak in 1916, Amar Singh wrote: Chardhaa Mansur phansi par, pukarta ishq baazon ko, Yeh berda hai tabaahi ka utthaaye jis ka ji chaahe Kartar Singh Sarabha, executed in 1915 at the age of 19, wrote: Jo koi pooche ke kaun ho tum To keh do baaghi hai naam apna

Zulm mitaana humaara pesha

Ghadar ka karna hai kaam apna

Namaaz-sandhya yahi humaari

Paath pooja bhi sach yahi hai Dharam karam sach yahi hai yaaro Vahi Khuda bhi o Ram apna Ghadar publicity inspired Punjabi Muslim soldiers in the Fifth Madras Light Infantry in Singapore to mutiny in 1915. Thirty-six mutineers were executed before a crowd of 15,000. In the United Provinces, the revolutionary passion of the young poet Ram Prasad Bismil (who authored ""Mera Rang de Basanti Chola"") was awakened as he read in a newspaper of the death sentence pronounced on a Ghadar leader. With their global networks, Indian radicals remained determined despite suppression. With German and Ottoman support, Har Dayal, Raja Mahendra Pratap and other rebels set up a provisional Government of India in Afghanistan to coordinate an uprising in the subcontinent. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 fortified the resolve of such rebels. Ghadar's aim was total Independenc e, unlike the Congress movement at this time. After the war, the Muslim League and the Congress cooperated in the Khilafat movement to pressure the British to preserve the defeated Ottoman Caliphate. The fiercely anti-colonial journalist and poet Hasrat Mohani (who gave us ""Chupke chupke raat din"") was the presiding chair of the League at a joint meeting in Ahmedabad in 1921. There, he and Bismil urged passing of a Purna Swaraj proposal, but Gandhi opposed it, favoring dominion status within the empire as a goal. Mohani was jailed for two years for his radical speeches. In jail, he wrote devotional ghazals to pirs as wells as to Lord Krishna. Here is one: Manmohan Shyam se nainan lag Nis-din sulag rahi tan aag Birah ki rain nipat andhiyaari

Rovat-dhovat katat jaag-jaag

Prem ka rog lagaike Hasrat

Rag-rang sab diin tyaag

The poet Mohamed Ali Jauhar presided over Congress in 1923. He shared his dream of a subcontinent that went beyond nationalism: ""a federation, grander, nobler and infinitely more spiritual than the United States of America,…(a) dream of 'United Faiths of India'."" As such radicals became disillusioned with Gandhi's aims and tactics, Har Dayal encouraged Bismil and Mohani to found the Hindustan Republican Association, which aimed to create a federated republic of the United States of India through organised armed revolution. Mohani also helped found the Indian Communist Party. Bismil was hanged in 1927. In 1928, the Simon Commission arrived to study constitutional reform. In Lahore, nationalist groups protesting the Commission's all-White composition were lathi-charged, and Lajpat Rai died of his wounds. Partly to avenge his death, Hindustan Republican Association members Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, and Rajguru assassinated the assistant superintendent of police JP Saunders. The struggle Singh and his companions launched in prison for the rights of political prisoners became intensely popular. When they went on hunger strike in 1929, thousands gathered in Amritsar to recite poems comparing their love of country to the qissas of Heer-Ranjha and Sohni-Mahiwal. Bhagat Singh was hanged in 1931. The radicals had had their effect. In 1930, Congress finally agreed to demand Purna Swaraj. Many radicals remained unsatisfied, dreaming of freedom not only from the British but from the parochial forms of nationalism and violent capitalism whose dangers the world war had so clearly exposed. They continued to pursue other forms of organisation — workers' and peasants' movements, the Communist Party, the Progressive Writers' Movement, and so on. Radical ideas of subcontinental federation did not prevail; instead, ideas of separation carried the day, as the Congress Party and Muslim League continued to cultivate parochial forms of nationalism. The individuals mentioned in this article were Muslims, atheists, Buddhists, Arya Samajis, Sikhs, but their anti-colonial passions transcended such distinctions, as did their shared poetic sensibility, which was integral to their radicalism. Poetry infuses politics with the imaginative power required for practical politics —the space of continuing aspiration and longing for a better future. The Ghadar memorial in San Francisco is currently under reconstruction. As inequality and insecurity continue to stalk India on its 70th year of Independence, reconstruction of the Ghadar legacy is urgent there too."
"RBI ex-dy governor dubs farm loan as bubble, slams govt for setting targets","Mumbai, August 22

Amid reverses faced by banks on farm loans, RBI’s former deputy governor HR Khan has come out strongly against the practice of agri credit targets set by the government every year for lenders and termed them as a “perpetual bubble”. “The banking system has just been reactive to the targets given by government, he said, speaking at an industry awards event organised by consultancy D&B here on Monday night. Noting that every year the government keeps on setting new credit disbursal target in the trillions in budget, and the banks exceed it, Khan said most of these are short-term crop loans. The need is to support long-term needs of the farm sector through capital investments, he said, adding that the proportion of capital investments in total farm credit had fallen to 20 per cent from 35 per cent level five years ago. He said that in the last 10 years, while credit to the farm sector had grown at 18 per cent, the production rose only 12 per cent and farmer incomes continued to be depressed due to a variety of reasons, including lower prices for their produce rise in wages and input costs. Investments need to be done in aspects like warehouses, supply chains and other infrastructure-related aspects, he said. Khan, who retired from the RBI last year, termed agriculture loans as a “perpetual bubble” which the public policy has not been able to solve. Many a time, the short-term farm loans are taken for consumption purposes and claimed that a fourth of the money raised through it goes for buying gold, he said. The former carrier central banker, however, did not make any mention to the rash of farm loan waivers which has affected credit behaviour and increased NPAs for the banks as farmers stop servicing their loans once such announcements are made. He said these are challenging times for the banking sector because of the twin problem of NPAs and pressure on capital levels. On the insolvency and bankruptcy code, Khan said, “We should be realistic and cautiously optimistic as our experience says that no system has been really effective.” PTI"

Drive smart with Telematics,"Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation. n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health. n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details. n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone. n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you. n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc. You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it. n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour. n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour. n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills. Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

Muslim men can no longer pronounce instant triple talaq as the Supreme Court on Tuesday declared the age-old controversial practice unconstitutional, terming it arbitrary and violative of right to equality of Muslim women.

A five-judge Constitution bench set aside the age-old practice by a majority of 3:2, holding it was unworthy of protection. Interestingly, all five judges on the bench belonged to five different faiths -- Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism.

The ruling came on petitions filed by some Muslim women challenging the practice of triple talaq on the ground that it violated their right to equality, right to non-discrimination and right to live with human dignity.

It’s is likely to have a bearing on petitions against the practice of polygamy and nikah-halala which are already pending before the top court.

Judgment of the Hon'ble SC on Triple Talaq is historic. It grants equality to Muslim women and is a powerful measure for women empowerment. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) August 22, 2017

Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed the verdict, terming it ""historic"", for it gave equality to Muslim women. He said the judgment will serve as a powerful measure for women empowerment.Within hours of the judgment, the Centre prepared an advisory to be sent to all states asking them to ensure compliance of the Supreme Court verdict declaring triple talaq illegal. A Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson said, “An advisory asking the states to keep close watch on the situation and also ensure compliance of the court order will be issued soon.”There were three verdicts -- one each pronounced by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar, Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice Rohinton F Nariman.

The majority verdicts were pronounced by Justice Nariman and Justice Joseph. Justice Lalit agreed with Justice Nariman's findings on the contentious issue.

“…It is clear that this form of Talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it. This form of Talaq must, therefore, be held to be violative of the fundamental right contained under Article 14 of the Constitution of India,” said Justice Nariman and Justice Lalit.

Justice Nariman's verdict held that The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, was a 'law' within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution and, hence, it can't violate fundamental rights of Muslim women.

Accordingly, Justice Nariman and Justice Lalit declared Section 2 of the Act unconstitutional in so far as it sought to enforce triple talaq.

The CJI was in minority with Justice S Abdul Nazeer agreeing with him. They held triple talaq to be a part of Muslim Personal Law practice for 1,400 years.

“Religion is a matter of faith, and not of logic. It is not open to a court to accept an egalitarian approach, over a practice which constitutes an integral part of religion,” the CJI noted in his verdict.

“It is not difficult to comprehend, what kind of challenges would be raised by rationalists, assailing practices of different faiths on diverse grounds, based on all kinds of enlightened sensibilities. We have to be guarded, lest we find our conscience traversing into every nook and corner of religious practices, and ‘personal law’.

“Can a court, based on a righteous endeavour, declare that a matter of faith, be replaced – or be completely done away with,” asked the CJI.

However, noting that there was gender bias in the Muslim law and the fact that Muslim personal law has been reformed the world over, including Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, the CJI and Justice Nazeer exercised their powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to restrain Muslim husbands from pronouncing triple talaq.

Pointing out that personal laws of other communities in India have been reformed by the legislature, the CJI and Justice Nazeer asked the government to come up with a law on the issue within six months.

Justice Joseph – who heavily relied on The Quran and other Islamic scriptures -- said was sinful in religion can't be lawful under personal law. “What is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well,” Justice Joseph said.

The CJI, Justice Nazeer and Justice Joseph talked about the responsibility of Parliament to take initiative to reform personal laws. Justice Khehar also referred to Article 44 of the Constitution, which talks about the state's responsibility to enact a Uniform Civil Code for all citizens."
Audit finds irregularities in fund usage,"Dehradun, August 21

Financial irregularities have emerged in the audit regarding construction of small canals, cement roads, water tanks, roads, etc at the gram panchayat, block samiti and zila parishad levels in Tehri, Chamoli, Haridwar and Nainital districts. It was found that the instead of providing basic infrastructure, the grants were either not spent or were siphoned off. Grants worth Rs 4.50 crore released by the Centre for construction of basic amenities in villages were either parked in banks or utilised for purposes leading to wasteful expenditure . Of the Rs 1194.39 lakh released for Tehri district in 2011-12 and 2013-14, Rs 99.92 lakh remained unutilized. In Haldwani development block, of the Rs 252.94 lakh released Rs 99.92 lakh were not spent. The money released for the gram panchayats is transferred to the joint bank accounts opened in the name of gram pradhan and two panchayat officers. During this period, the panchayats received money under the 13th Finance Commission, MPLAD Fund, among others. — TNS"
Contact sports may alter brains of athletes,"Toronto

People who play contact sports such as football and hockey — that have higher risk of body collisions — are more likely show changes in their brain structure and function, a study has found.

Researchers at St Michael's Hospital in Canada performed preseason brain scans of 65 varsity athletes — 23 from collision sports (with routine, purposeful body-to-body contact), 22 from contact sports (where contact is allowed, but is not an integral part of the game) and 20 from non-contact sports.

They found that the athletes in collision and contact sports had differences in brain structure, function and chemical markers typically associated with brain injury, compared to athletes in non-contact sports.

There is a growing concern about how participation in contact sports may affect the brain, said lead author Nathan Churchill, a post-doctoral fellow in St Michael's Neuroscience Research Programme.

Most of the research in this area has focused on the long-term effects for athletes in collision sports, such as football and ice hockey, where players may be exposed to hundreds of impacts in a single season.

Less is known about the consequences of participating in contact sports where body-to-body contact is permitted, but is not purposeful, such as football, basketball and field hockey.

This study looked at both men and women from a variety of sports, and found progressive differences between the brains of athletes in non-contact, contact and collision sports.

This included differences in the structure of the brain's white matter — the fibre tracts that connect different parts of the brain and allow them to communicate with one another.

Athletes in sports with higher levels of contact also showed signs of reduced communication between brain areas and decreased activity, particularly within areas involved in vision and motor function, compared to those in non-contact sports, such as volleyball.

However, these differences do not reflect significantly impaired day-to-day functioning, said Tom Schweizer, head of the Neuroscience Research Programme.

The study fills an important gap in understanding how contact affects healthy brains, as a step toward better understanding why a small number of athletes in contact sports show negative long-term health consequences.

The findings were published in the journal Frontiers of Neurology. PTI"

Secure garden,"GROUND REALTY

Jagvir Goyal

A spurt in cancer cases in North India and awareness about the ill effects of excessive use of pesticides has made people look for organic food or make effort to grow their own vegetables. While a company has launched vegetable and fruit purifier which has not been much successful, trend of growing own vegetables is fast catching up in urban areas. ‘Plant to Plate’ is becoming a tagline for the urban elite. As a result everyone wants to have his own kitchen garden, grow vegetables and enjoy healthy and pesticide-free food. As far as one is living on the ground floor, there is no problem in developing a kitchen garden. One can always find a corner or some space in the front or back courtyard to develop the kitchen garden. And there are no structural issues involved. The challenge lies in developing a kitchen garden while living on the first floor or higher elevations, in flats or apartments. Here, the front or back balconies are considered to be most suitable locations for developing kitchen garden because plenty of sunlight and air are available. What is more important to watch are the structural features of the kitchen garden. Let’s have a look at the related engineering aspects of this new trend:

Structural features

Developing a kitchen garden in a balcony or on the terrace means deposition of extra earth load over the balcony or terrace slab. This extra load on the slab causes stresses in it and at the slab supports. Application of water to the plants may cause retention of water on the balcony or terrace leading to dampness in the area. Then establishment of proper drainage system has also to be taken care of. Thus, there are three major structural features: Structural design, water proofing and drainage arrangements. design: The design of the floor slab over which a kitchen garden is to be developed, needs to be rechecked by taking into account the extra load of earth and other items that shall be rested over the slab. Often the weight of earth is counted but the weight of extra pots that are laid there is ignored. Weight of pots is significant and needs to be considered as ‘pointed load’. It is better to use stands for the pots instead of placing them directly on the slab to disperse their load over a wider area.To cause lesser load on the slab, wooden, plastic, aluminium or fibre pots should be selected. The weight of soil should be considered as saturated slab so that weight of water also gets counted. Normally, the thickness of soil mixed with manure layer thickness is 8 inch to 10 inch. By rechecking the design, it should be ensured that the slab and its supports can wear the extra load being put on it without causing any cracks in them. Cantilevers: If a kitchen garden is being developed in a balcony, be extra cautious. Most of the balconies are designed as cantilevers and cantilevers are infamous for their failure in the history of civil engineering. A cantilever is simply projecting from a wall without any other support below it. If the cantilever slab is found to be unsafe for extra load being caused on it, supports below it should be provided before developing kitchen garden in the balcony. It should also be seen that making all this arrangement of extra supports below the cantilever slab is not uneconomical. Waterproofing: Needless to say that waterproofing of kitchen garden slab is as important as its structural design. To provide waterproofing, proper treatment should be given to the slab before laying the garden. The slab surface should be cleaned well with wire brushes and then treated well by applying polymer-based flexible water proofing layers on it. While doing this, if any cracks are noted in the slab, these should be treated well by converting them into small V-shaped crevices and then filling them with a polymer modified mortar. For waterproofing, it is better to lay a layer of 6mm thick 1 : 3 cement sand mortar over the slab after adding waterproofing compound to the mortar. Over the mortar layer, a layer of tiles can be laid in slope as per drainage plan. Drainage arrangement: In case of balconies and terraces, it is common practice to provide proper slope to the slab area during their construction, for drainage of rain water through rain water pipes. A concrete ‘gola’ at the junction of the slab and parapets is also provided in normal practice as these junctions are the vulnerable leakage points. While developing a kitchen garden in balcony or on terrace, a 2 inch thick layer of water-borne aggregate or shingle or pebbles should also be laid over the tiles in the same slope by maintaining the two-inch thickness uniformly so that the slope of tiles is acquired by the stone layer also. This whole system shall provide effective drainage arrangement. All these loads should be considered while rechecking the structural design of the slab. Geo-membrane provision: For creating best kitchen garden arrangement, it is better to lay a thick layer of geo membrane on the tiles before covering them with the pebbles or stones. However, this is optional as the geo-membrane layer will causeadditional cost. Otherwise, a HDPE net layer can be laid over the stones. This geo membrane or HDPE net layer will prove helpful in holding back the soil while excess rain water in balcony gets drained off to the rain water pipes. Next, the soil layer can be laid as the base for it is now ready to receive the soil. The water connection: Provision of a water connection in the balcony or terrace is essential for a productive kitchen garden growing vegetables. Generally, we keep a tap on the terrace or balcony to draw water. Same tap can be used for watering the vegetable plants in kitchen garden. Outsourcing the job: As growing on vegetables is becoming a craze among people, many companies who undertake development of kitchen garden now exist in every city. An online search will tell you about their existence. And howsoever small space be available with you, they would develop your kitchen garden in it. Even a 4 x 4 feet space is converted by them. Contact them and assign them the job. However, just ensure that all structural aspects are taken care of and joy of having a kitchen garden is not marred by structural cracks or dampness or leakage or failure of balconies. — The writer is former HoD and engineer-in-chief, civil engineering department in

Gorakhpur infants' death: Probe panel submits report,"The high-power committee probing the Gorakhpur hospital tragedy on Tuesday submitted its report to the Uttar Pradesh government.

The committtee headed by chief secretary Rajive Kumar submitted the report to the government this evening, an official spokesperson said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, who formed the committee on August 12 to probe the incident — a day after deaths of scores of children in the state-run BRD Medical College was reported — has now ordered FIRs against former priciapl of Baba Raghav Das Medical College Dr Rajeev Mishra and six others.

UP Medical Education minister Ashutosh Tandon had promised action against those found guilty in the probe.

As its first action, the state government had suspended the college principal Dr Rajiv Mishra, who subsequently put in his papers accepting moral responsibility for the tragedy.

A three-member team of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has charged the administration with negligence, saying no alert was issued regarding shortage of oxygen.

Doctors should have been alerted seven days in advance that oxygen supply was not being received, the IMA had said on August 18.

A total of 60 infants admitted to the government-run facility had died in a span of 48 hours, allegedly because of the disruption in oxygen supply due to pending payments to the supplier, a charge stoutly refuted by the state government.

The government has maintained that the children died due to different illnesses, including Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and there was no shortage of oxygen. PT/ TNS"

Hyundai brings in all new Verna; seeks to regain market share,"New Delhi, August 22

South Korean automaker Hyundai on Tuesday launched all-new version of Verna in India with introductory price starting at Rs 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) as it seeks to regain lost market share in mid-sized sedan segment.

The fifth generation Verna will compete with the likes of Honda City and Maruti Suzuki Ciaz.

The petrol variants of the Verna are priced between Rs 7.99-12.23 lakh, while the diesel trims are tagged between Rs 9.19-12.61 lakh.

Honda City petrol on the other hand is priced between Rs 8.46 lakh and Rs 13.37 lakh, while its diesel variants are priced between Rs 10.68 lakh and Rs 13.43 lakh.

Maruti Ciaz petrol is priced between Rs 7.65 lakh and Rs 10.41 lakh, while diesel variants are tagged between Rs 9.42 lakh and Rs 11.55 lakh (all prices ex-showroom).

""We are aiming for the leadership position in the segment. With the kind of features the new Verna has, we are confident of achieving it,"" Hyundai Motor India MD & CEO YK Koo told reporters here.

The company has set a target of selling 4,000 to 5,000 units a month for the model, he added.

""In the last 17 days, we have received 45,000 enquiries and we expect at least a conversion of 20 per cent of these into actual sales,"" Koo said.

As competition brought in full model changes of their models like City, sales of Verna had dropped to around 700 units a month from a peak of around 49,000 a year in period between 2011 and 2013, he added.

Hyundai said the introductory prices will be applicable for first 20,000 customers only.

""We will take a price increase after 20,000 units,"" HMIL Director Sales & Marketing Rakesh Srivastava said.

The latest Verna comes with 1.6 litre petrol and diesel engines mated with both manual and automatic transmissions.

The model is based on a newly developed K2 platform and has been developed with an investment of Rs 1,040 crore.

Overall, Hyundai has sold 3.17 lakh units Verna in India since the introduction of the model in 2006. Globally, around 88 lakh units of the sedan have been sold.

The new Verna comes with various features like sunroof, rear curtain, standard dual airbags and ABS, eco coating for AC vents and rear parking sensors.

When asked about increasing the production capacity, Koo said with flexibility in manufacturing the company would be able to pull on till around 2020.

""So there is no plan for a new factory right now. After 2020 we will look into it,"" he added. — PTI"

Punjab colts shine on England tour,"Gaurav kanthwal

chandigarh, august 21

Punjab cricketers Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma have come out with flying colours in their first overseas test in the India Under-19 team’s tour of England. The team won its first four-day game against England U-19 by 334 runs and registered a 97-run win in the second game. In the 50-over series, the Indian colts whitewashed England 5-0. Gill emerged the Man of the Series with 278 runs in four matches and chipped in with three wickets with his off-spin. Gill’s first overseas experience turned out to be fruitful as the right-hander scored one century in the four-day series, and followed it up with a century and another half-century in the limited-overs series. He was the highest run-scorer for the Indian team on the tour. “It got more comfortable as the tour progressed. I got a century (102) in the second innings of the second ‘Test’. It boosted my confidence and I was able to score 147 and 66 in the last two 50-over matches,” Gill said. The No. 3 batsman also took three wickets in the last two matches of the tour. He was also declared the Man of the Match in the third One-dayer. “I had been bowling in the nets for quite some time and I had a fair idea of what to do,” the 17-year-old added. Even before his first tour — which the teenager had described as a “great learning opportunity” — had begun, Gill had been confident of doing well overseas. “The coaches in PCA had prepared me well for every difficulty that I would face in English conditions,” he said of his preparations before the tour. The two-time winner of BCCI’s best U-16 cricketer of the year award (2014 and 2015) said that besides this being his first overseas tour, it was significant in the sense that it gave him first-time experience to play ‘Test’ cricket in different conditions. “It was a new experience to play in the longer format of the game abroad. The weather conditions changed suddenly and you had to adapt. As a batsman, I also got to know about the preparations to be made before a four-day game. Coaches WV Raman and Abhay Sharma guided us very well during the tour and discussed our strengths and weaknesses with us,” he said. Raman was impressed with Gill’s ability to pack a punch in his strokes.

Abhishek’s all-round show

Amritsar lad Abhishek Sharma scored 98 runs in four innings and bagged seven wickets. The all-rounder was the third highest wicket-taker — behind Anukul Sudhakar Roy (10 wickets) and Rahul Chahar (10) — with an economy rate of 4.17 in the series. “I would rate my performance as decent. I am not satisfied with my batting performance and would have liked to score more runs, but I could not do so,” said the No. 5 batsman. Sharma said that trying too hard affected his batting. “Then Raman sir advised me not to try too hard and trust my stroke-making ability. The advice made things easier for me,” he said. The duo’s next international assignment is the Under-19 Asia Cup in Malaysia in November this year."

Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar’s latest film Shubh Mangal Saavdhan touches a taboo subject (sexual disorder), something that both these actors have done before — Ayushmann with Vicky Donor and Bhumi with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. The talented stars talk about the movie and more.

What made you say yes to Shubh Mangal Saavdhan?

Ayushmann: It’s a love story about Mudit Sharma and Sugandha, and touches a taboo subject; reading the script I jumped up to play this urban guy.

Bhumi: I have an affinity for different kind of films. And, it has been by far the funniest script I have come across; I was down on the floor rolling in laughter listening to this one.

It hardly seems like a subject for a family movie, were you apprehensive?

Ayushmann: It is important to know who is backing the film. With Anand L Rai backing the film, one would know that it’s not going overboard selling the edginess of the subject.

BHuMI: It’s a family entertainer that at no point makes fun of the protagonist’s problem; it finds a solution.

Before signing the film, did you take your family into consideration?

Ayushmann: My wife reads all my scripts anyway. She read this one too and liked the way it touched a subject people tend to brush under the carpet. We both are artistes, so it was good.

Bhumi: After me, my mother is the first one to read the scripts. She found the story entertaining and educative, and gave a happy go-ahead.

It’s your second film together. Given the theme, was there any awkwardness?

Ayushmann: Bhumi is a dear friend and we talk about anything under the sun. And working with a progressive friend and a dedicated actor, this was no issue.

Bhumi: I am very good friends with Ayushmann, so we share a certain comfort level. He is such an inspiring actor and working with him is always a delight.

Censor Board till very recently had a conservative approach towards issues, were you anxious about your film hitting trouble?

Ayushmann: No. We were sure of our content. With Prasoon Ji and Vidya Ji, it was not any trouble at all.

Bhumi: No. Ours is a funny romcom that you can see with a 10-year-old!

You think Indian audiences, fed on the dose of commercial cinema, is ready for such subjects as yet?

Ayushmann: Definitely. My first was lapped up by the audience despite it touching another taboo subject. People are up for different content, which is huge victory for all of us.

Bhumi: I am 100 per cent sure. There have been enough of commercial plots; audiences enjoy different and meaningful cinema today, and I feel fortunate to be part of it.

What next for you?

Ayushmann: First, I am hoping that Shubh Mangal Saavdhan gets the same love as I have been getting for Bareilly Ki Barfi, and Bhumi has also been enjoying with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. Next, I am shooting a thriller with Sriram Raghavan, which is tentatively called Shoot the Piano Player.

Bhumi: There have been some very interesting line-ups, but ethically I would like the senior actors to speak up about them before I do.

Bathinda, August 21

As the Bathinda-Barnala four-lane project nears completion, the traffic problem is increasing rather than getting sorted for the public.

Apart from being used for parking vehicles, the service lanes on both sides of the widened roads are now witnessing heavy rush of traffic, half of which moves in the wrong direction.

Commuters, aiming to save time and a little effort, prefer driving on the wrong side rather than taking the right direction.

Lack of action against offenders has added to the problem.

“Vehicles, especially two-wheelers don’t care about traffic regulations and drive on the wrong side, endangering motorists coming from the other side. We have often seen vehicles almost colliding due to this,” said Rajesh Bansal, a resident of Prajapat Colony.

“There is absolutely no monitoring by the traffic police to check offenders,” Bansal added.

The service lanes are also being used as parking lots by people visiting hotels and retail outlets located on the either side of the road.

Ever since the road widening project was undertaken by the state government, crossing the Bathinda-Barnala stretch has turned into a Herculean task for the commuters.

The service lanes where Best Western Stella, Hotel Sapphire, Reliance Mart and Azad Nagar are situated are blocked by haphazard parking of vehicles throughout the day.

Although the service lanes are wide enough to let two vehicles pass at the same time, a car barely manages to make its way these days.

Ashok Sharma, a resident of Hazura Kapura Colony, said, “Since construction is going on at Rose Garden Chowk, a large number of vehicles going towards Barnala from the city have started making their way through these colonies and take the service lane. Automobile repair shops along the service lanes have taken the liberty to park the repaired or broken down vehicles near the shops, thereby creating bottlenecks for traffic.”

“Instead of parking their vehicles in the parking lots of the hotels and shopping complexes, visitors prefer to use the service lane to make it a bit convenient for them. This adds to traffic chaos. Vehicles coming from the wrong side add to the woes and are a cause of accidents,” said Subhash Kumar, a resident of Guru Gobind Singh Nagar.

On condition of anonymity, sources in the traffic police said although there was a provision to issue challans to wrongly parked vehicles and also to those driving on the wrong side but the police were lenient as the project is under way."
Water enters houses in Panchkula,"Panchkula, August 21

The morning downpour threw life out of gear in Panchkula. Almost all sectors, particularly roundabouts, were flooded. Water entered houses and damaged furniture in Sectors 8, 16 and 19. Residents of Sector 19 were the worst hit once again. They were forced to come out after water entered their houses. Vehicles broke down due to the flood-like situation in the sector and nearby areas. In Sector 16 too, water entered houses. Residents came out of their homes and were busy in clearing road gullies. Even senior citizens were seen clearing road gullies to drain out the water. Two-wheelers could be seen wading through knee-deep water in Sector 16, the HUDA roundabout in Sector 6 and Sector 19. Parking lots in market areas were also waterlogged. The flood-like situation has exposed the claims of the Panchkula MC regarding preparations to deal with waterlogging problems. The seasonal nullah passing through Swastik Vihar and Sector 7, Panchkula, was overflowing.As the heavy rain started around 8 am, office-goers faced a tough time driving through the choked rotaries and traffic light points in Panchkula. Not even a single traffic light point was functional and the presence of traffic cops was thin.

Vehicles break down

Vehicles broke down due to waterlogging in Sectors 16 and 19, and the Industrial Area. Sandeep Singh, a mechanic in the Industrial Area, said on a normal day, he used to repair around five cars, but today he had already attended to more than 10 customers in the morning. Some of the cars will take time for repairs as the water entered these, he said. — TNS"

Governor Anil Baijal on Monday directed Delhi Jal Board Chief Executive Officer Keshav Chandra to finalise a plan within 15 days for migration to 100 per cent mechanisation for cleaning of sewer/drains in coordination with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).

Baijal ordered the Standard Operating Procedure for cases requiring emergency manual intervention as per law to be laid down within seven days and all such SOPs will be applicable to all, including private contractors, group housing society and malls, etc.

The directions came after Baijal called a high level meeting, attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Public Works Department Minister Satyendar Jain, Water Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam along with senior officers of Delhi Government, NDMC and the three municipal corporations, Member (Delhi Jal Board), CEO (Delhi Cantonment Board) and Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order, South).

Noting that these deaths are a grim portrayal of the unsafe working conditions of people engaged to keep sewer lines and tanks clean, often with their bare hands, the Lt. Governor termed the present situation as “unacceptable”.

Before the meeting, Gautam posted a series of tweets on the matter saying a case under 304 IPC will be registered against the contractors as well as the government officials responsible for the same. “Shocked and painful to see the 4 incidents of death during sewage cleaning. Contractors have no fear of law,” the minister tweeted.

The Secretary (SC/ST) was directed to upload all the notifications clarifying the legal position on the website so that it can be in public domain for the benefit of the contractors as well as the users.

The Lt. Governor also directed the CEO (DJB) and other departments, including the municipal bodies, to undertake extensive information, education and communication (IEC) campaign for widespread publicity of the harmful impact on the health of such workers as well as the illegality committed by the contractors/user agencies.

He stressed that the liability of the principal employer does not get diluted and asked the government agencies to strictly abide by the law.

“The employers must provide gas masks, safety harness belts, helmets and mechanised equipment, etc as legally mandated for the hazardous work of cleaning of clogged underground sewers and must ensure strict compliance of the relevant guidelines and proper arrangements of the safety and security of the workers,” said an official.

The Lt. Governor also directed the Delhi Police to take stringent action against those contractors who violate the law. He was informed that the police have already booked the contractor for culpable homicide in yesterday’s tragic incident. The review of the implementation of the directives would be made again after two weeks, added the official."
"BJP will expose ‘failures’ of Cong govt, says Dhumal","Our Correspondent

Hamirpur, August 21

PK Dhumal, Leader of Opposition and former Chief Minister, said that the Congress-led government in the state had failed on all fronts and the BJP would expose its failures and other issues in the last Vidhan Sabha session starting tomorrow. He was talking to press here today before leaving for Shimla to attend the session here today. Dhumal said that it was shameful that minor girls were raped and killed and police could not book the culprits. He said that forest mafia was so powerful that it felled hundreds of precious trees from the hill at Tara Devi. Felling of over 1,400 trees in the area of the forest minister could not have been possible without having shelter enjoyed by culprits from the leaders in the ruling party. He said that the lives of those employees who tried to protect forest from the forest mafia were at high risk. Forest guard Hoshiar Singh, who was the sole bread winner for the family, was killed by the forest goons. He alleged that government tried to hush up the case by terming it a suicide. Dhumal said that the rape and murder of minor girl in Halaila forest in Kotkhai area was highly condemnable and had created panic among women throughout the state. He said with the killing of one accused in the police custody integrity and the trust on the police had also vanished. Earlier Dhumal addressed the meeting of BJP Vision Document Committee (VDC). The meeting was also addressed by Randheer Sharma MLA Naina Devi and Khushi Ram Balnahta, member of the committee. Other present included district BJP president Anil Thakur, Zila Parishad chairman Rakesh Thakur, BJP state secretary Kamlesh Kumari and Vijaypal Soharu."
Now an artificial heart made of spider silk,"London

Researchers have developed cardiac muscle tissue made of spider silk, to investigate whether artificial silk protein could be suitable for engineering cardiac tissue.

Ischaemic diseases such as cardiac infarction leads to irreversible loss of cardiac muscle cells, which is the main cause of reduced cardiac functionality that affects the working of the heart.

According to the researchers at Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (FAU) in Germany, silk could be the key to artificial cardiac tissue. Or, the protein that gives the silk its structure and mechanical stability called as fibroin.

For the study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the team investigated the suitability of the silk protein eADF4(?16) produced in the laboratory for the production of cardiac tissue.

The research involved applying a thin layer of the silk protein to a glass slide. The technique is based on the fact that cells with a negatively charged surface adhere to films made of the eADF4(?16) silk protein due to its positive charge.

The study focussed, in particular, on cardiac cell functionality. The researchers compared these cells to cells that they had applied to a film of fibronectin, which is similar to the natural environment of cardiac cells.

No functional differences between the two were observed.

The researchers were able to demonstrate, for instance, that factors responsible for hypertrophy -- enlargement of cardiac cells for instance in athletes and pregnant women -- also led to a growth in volume in the cardiac cells that had been cultured on a film of eADF4(?16).

The possibilities of printing artificial silk proteins using 3D printing technology therefore represent the first steps towards future methods for engineering functional cardiac tissue, the researchers noted.

Judges from 5 different religions divided on triple talaq verdict,"Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 22

A Bench of five judges from different religious communities, including Sikh, Christian, Parsi, Hindu and Muslim, which pronounced the historic judgement on the controversial issue of the practice of 'triple talaq' among Muslims were not unanimous in the verdict.

The apex court by 3:2 verdict held that the triple talaq is against the basic tenets of Quran.

Three of the five judges hearing a case questioning the legality of ""triple talaq"" ruled it as ""unconstitutional"".

""The government should find a way to frame new laws,"" the three judges said in their ruling, which overruled the other two judges.

While Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer were in favour of putting on hold for six months the practice of triple talaq, asking the government to come out with a law in this regard, Justices Kurian Joseph, R F Nariman and U U Lalit held it as violative of the Constitution. The court's verdict was marred by confusion initially, with the senior judge, the chief justice of India, announcing that his opinion was to suspend the practice and ask the government to come up with a new law within six months.

He was overruled by the three judges who said it was unconstitutional.

""Finally I feel free today. I have the order that will liberate many Muslim women,"" said Shayara Bano, one of the women who brought the case, after the ruling.

Besides CJI Khehar, the Bench also included Justices Kurian Joseph, R F Nariman, U U Lalit and S Abdul Nazeer.

The laws allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word ""talaq"" three times. Muslim women say they have been left destitute by husbands divorcing them through ""triple talaq"", including by Skype and WhatsApp. Triple talaq is banned in several Muslim countries, including in neighbouring Pakistan and conservative Saudi Arabia. —Agencies"

Life insurance: Key to protection and legacy,"Sujoy Manna

India as a country is extremely emotional and family oriented. Our predecessors used to always save up and postpone their wishes so they could plan well for their loved ones' future. Life insurance also has a lot of sentimental value because it is an effort by the life assured to ensure that his loved ones don't have to suffer after his demise. The financial benefit is reaped only by the family. However, due to definite coverage term of term plans in India, there still remains a risk of the benefits not being transferred to the family in case the life assured outlives the policy term. In such a case, their wish to pass on the planned amount i.e sum assured to the loved ones remains unfulfilled. This gap can be filled by products that offer life-long protection. Such a feature would ensure that the family benefits from the deceased's financial planning after he is not around. Moreover, there would be no term of protection. Even if a person dies at an age of 100, the family would receive this sum, hence making it a part of the legacy left behind. Such a product would be apt for people who not only want to compensate for their income after they're gone but also want to leave a lump sum as a legacy for the comfortable living of the beneficiaries.

Legacy protection

Wealth preservation has gained precedence over asset management in recent times, especially taking into account the economic volatility that is prevalent currently in the global market. This creates a greater emphasis on legacy planning in order to transfer wealth to the next generation. This is what most financial advisers don't tell you when they talk about life insurance - legacy planning. It is a financial tool we ideally don't associate with wealth transference, since most of the time it is only viewed as a tool to secure funds for financial obligations or to replace the family's income. But, inherently, life insurance is a legacy. You leave behind wealth for the generations to come, so that they are financially secure. And you can do all of this without compromising your current lifestyle. In a way, we can call it 'legacy protection'.

Conclusion

Finally, as we mentioned earlier, life insurance gives you 'legacy protection'. In many ways, it protects the legacy that you wish to leave for your loved ones, while at the same time makes sure you don't compromise on your present. It not only protects their financial future, but also makes sure they have enough to leave a legacy of their own. The writer is Vice President -Products, HDFC Life.

Bathinda, August 21

As the Bathinda-Barnala four-lane project nears completion, the traffic problem is increasing rather than getting sorted for the public.

Apart from being used for parking vehicles, the service lanes on both sides of the widened roads are now witnessing heavy rush of traffic, half of which moves in the wrong direction.

Commuters, aiming to save time and a little effort, prefer driving on the wrong side rather than taking the right direction.

Lack of action against offenders has added to the problem.

“Vehicles, especially two-wheelers don’t care about traffic regulations and drive on the wrong side, endangering motorists coming from the other side. We have often seen vehicles almost colliding due to this,” said Rajesh Bansal, a resident of Prajapat Colony.

“There is absolutely no monitoring by the traffic police to check offenders,” Bansal added.

The service lanes are also being used as parking lots by people visiting hotels and retail outlets located on the either side of the road.

Ever since the road widening project was undertaken by the state government, crossing the Bathinda-Barnala stretch has turned into a Herculean task for the commuters.

The service lanes where Best Western Stella, Hotel Sapphire, Reliance Mart and Azad Nagar are situated are blocked by haphazard parking of vehicles throughout the day.

Although the service lanes are wide enough to let two vehicles pass at the same time, a car barely manages to make its way these days.

Ashok Sharma, a resident of Hazura Kapura Colony, said, “Since construction is going on at Rose Garden Chowk, a large number of vehicles going towards Barnala from the city have started making their way through these colonies and take the service lane. Automobile repair shops along the service lanes have taken the liberty to park the repaired or broken down vehicles near the shops, thereby creating bottlenecks for traffic.”

“Instead of parking their vehicles in the parking lots of the hotels and shopping complexes, visitors prefer to use the service lane to make it a bit convenient for them. This adds to traffic chaos. Vehicles coming from the wrong side add to the woes and are a cause of accidents,” said Subhash Kumar, a resident of Guru Gobind Singh Nagar.

On condition of anonymity, sources in the traffic police said although there was a provision to issue challans to wrongly parked vehicles and also to those driving on the wrong side but the police were lenient as the project is under way."
A travel back in time,"Shailesh BR’s most recent work, Tarka, looks like an interpretation of childhood memories

Monica Arora

Shailesh BR’s work is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected that you may have seen amongst contemporary artists in the recent times, and that is what makes it all the more engaging and awe inspiring. He draws inspiration from several concepts in Sanskrit, a language he studied and mastered for some 14 years during his early childhood. His creations reflect the rural upbringing and simplicity of life as in his village, where even an electric bulb was regarded as a huge miracle. In an interview during a Khoj workshop in 2015, Shailesh had articulated, “I do not know how to work, but I sure can create for my own and from my own.”A post-graduate from Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU, Baroda, the artist uses the ordinariness of mundane objects to turn their notion or existence around. He recently put up his first solo show at the Vadhera Art Gallery in New Delhi as part of Foundation for Contemporary Indian Art (FICA)’s Emerging Artist Award Programme. This show was known as Tarka, being derived from Tarka Shastra or the art of debating, enquiring and logical reasoning as prescribed in ancient Sanskrit philosophy. Through his myriad creations, he has questioned the origin, life journey and end of several objects and that is what draws onlookers to this unique body of work. Occupying centre piece at the exhibition was the Kshir Dhara, a series of sculptures that explore repeated actions whilst performing religious ceremonies such as the grinding of chandan on a slab or application of tilak on the forehead. These are used as metaphors in sculptures made from material such as wax, motor, sandalwood, honey, motor, water, milk, copper. Created from rubber, motor, iron was The Tongue, a set of kinetic sculptures that represents the various sensory functions and organs of the body that pertain to sensations of touch, taste, smell, sight and so on. Similarly, the Hot Tongue, comprising of plaster, coil and iron mesh, seems to be a satirical statement on the art of glib talking and nonsensical jargon, which is innately ingrained in the political and bureaucratic machinery. The most evocative of all creations was the Philosophy Machine. Essentially a wooden rotating disc fitted with lamps arranged in a circle, it has a gas flame pipe to light the lamps at one end and a blower pipe to extinguish them. This remarkable creation is a representation of the circle of life and is a stunning commentary on the fact that death is inevitable. Philosphy Machine Drawings was a series of 48 drawings. These inhabit little corners at the gallery and are mostly arranged as asymmetrical drawings on vintage, sepia-tinted and yellowing paper that appear as blueprints or pages from a novella or a personal diary or an old school examination. In most, there is no attention paid to any spelling or grammatical errors and reflect a childlike innocence with several drafts, cuts, scratches and random musings. Also, the 46 tongue drawings are an extension of the sculpture and endeavour to decode the tongue as an organ of taste, articulation and hence, as an allegory for human emotions, sensory as well as of the mind faculties. It’s almost as if he had taken tiny bits of childhood memorabilia and when he saw similar objects during adulthood, he re-interpreted those in a completely different manner and re-arranged the conventionality and typicality associated with them."
"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","WASHINGTON:Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims.

Washington, August 22

Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims.

Scientists from Duke University in the US have discovered that a gene variant which affects cholesterol levels could increase the risk of contracting typhoid fever.

They also showed that a common cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) could protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the nasty infection.

The findings, which appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease.

They also point to possible avenues to protect those who are most vulnerable to pathogens - like the Salmonella bacteria - that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells.

""We need to try this approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before we can consider taking this into the clinic,"" said Dennis C Ko, assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine.

""What is so exciting is that our study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,"" Ko said.

Ko and his team used hundreds of cell lines from healthy human volunteers and exposed them to the exact dose of Salmonella Typhi, which had been tagged with a green fluorescent marker.

They then looked for genetic differences that distinguished cells that had higher rates of bacterial invasion from those that did not.

The researchers found that a single nucleotide of DNA in a gene called VAC14 was associated with the level of bacterial invasion in cells.

When they knocked out the gene, the cells were invaded more readily and more of the cells glowed brightly with green bacteria.

They also unexpectedly found that those more susceptible cells had higher levels of cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes that Salmonella binds to invade host cells.

Researchers tested DNA from subjects in a group of 1,000 Vietnamese people, half of whom had typhoid fever and half did not.

They found that the VAC14 gene variant was associated with a moderately elevated risk of typhoid fever.

""Discovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins for high cholesterol,"" said Ko.

""We wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,"" he said.

Monica Alvarez, a graduate student in Ko's lab and lead author on the study, added a cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) to their water and then injected the fish with Salmonella Typhi.

She found that the treated animals were more likely to clear the bacteria out of their system and survive. — PTI"
Indian-American ousted as top editor and publisher of Los Angeles Times,"New York, August 22

Davan Maharaj, who was the highest-ranking Indian American newspaper journalist, has been removed as the top editor and publisher of ‘The Los Angeles Times’ in a shakeup of the publication’s leadership. The newspaper reported on Monday that Tronc, the parent company of the LA Times, had also removed three other high-level editors in what it described as a “dramatic shake-up” at the fifth largest newspaper in the US with a circulation of about 500,000. Ross Levinsohn was named to succeed Maharaj as the publisher and Jim Kirk as the editor. Levinsohn is a former executive of Fox Interactive Media, owned Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, and interim CEO of Yahoo. Kirk was the editor and publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times. Maharaj, who began his editorial career at the Trinidad Express in his native Caribbean country, worked his way up the LA Times from an intern to the top spot. Along the way he was a foreign correspondent in Africa, assistant foreign editor, business editor and managing editor. He became editor in 2011 and added the title of publisher last year. He also oversaw six local newspapers, two Spanish language newspapers and several websites. Last year, another Indian American at the LA Times, S Mitra Kalita, who was the Managing Editor for Digital Strategy, left the newspaper to become the vice president for programming at CNN Digital. The LA Times was purchased in 2000 by the Tribune Co, which was renamed Tronc. The parent company has been in a state of turmoil, weathering a bankruptcy, change in ownership and the split of the newspaper and television properties. The LA Times has undergone several rounds of layoffs. New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet had been fired by the LA Times corporate management in 2006 when he was the editor there refusing to carry out layoffs. While announcing the changes Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn said the company would invest more in the LA Times and would like it to reach Asia and South America, the LA Times reported. IANS"

Afghan envoy hails Trump for breaking silence on Pak’s support to terror,"Washington, August 22

Afghanistan on Tuesday lauded President Donald Trump for breaking America’s “silence” on Pakistan providing sanctuaries to terrorists and embracing a strategy that gives the war-torn country what it needs. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America’s longest war. He also warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Reacting to Trump’s address, Afghanistan’s Ambassador to the US Hamdullah Mohib thanked President Trump for breaking America’s silence on Pakistan, which has been harbouring terrorists for attacks against its neighbours. “We welcome this decision, which is the result of intense deliberations and takes into account both our countries’ needs and considerations. This is the first time a focus has been put on what Afghanistan must have to succeed, and we are grateful for this outcome,” Mohib said after Trump concluded his speech on Afghanistan and South Asia. Mohib said Trump had embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. He also lauded the decision to integrate America’s military, economic and political power to achieve shared goals. The strategy also expands “authority to move swiftly against terrorist activities and criminal networks in place of micromanagement from Washington” and “a breaking of the silence over Pakistan’s shelters and sanctuaries for terrorists”, the Afghan Ambassador said. “Like America, Afghanistan also wants an honourable and enduring outcome” to this fight, for all the Afghan, US, and NATO soldiers who had served and sacrificed to advance the cause of peace, Mohib said. In his address, Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continued to do so. PTI"

Eighteen cases involving alleged land deals of about 1,400 bigha near Mahajan Ganj Firing range by various persons and companies, including Robert Vadra, registered in four FIRs during 2010-12 have been recommended to the CBI, Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters at Secretariat.

All cases were lodged in Kolayat police stations. Some accused were already arrested and since the cases were of complicated nature and involved many government employees too, it was decided by the state government to put the files before CBI, Kataria said.

In lieu of land acquired for Mahajan Firing Range, there was about 1,400 bigha of land which was allegedly traded not once but three-four times by locals and private companies, he said.

The names of exact buyers and sellers and their whereabouts were still not clear, Kataria said, adding the allotment existed in revenue records by various names.

About 275 bigha of land was bought and sold by one or more companies linked with Vadra, and four FIRs were lodged by the Kolayat police station, he claimed.

Kataria added that, “Vadra's companies have allegedly sold the land three times.”

Alleging vendetta, Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot said, “Three functionaries of the BJP were arrested in the said land scam. What happened to them? The state government has set up a CM sub-committee to probe the said case when it came to power in 2013, but the committee report has not been prepared. Who is responsible for it?”

As the 2018 assembly polls are approaching, the Raje government is politicising the matter and misusing the investigating agency (CBI) for its own benefits and to get political mileage, Pilot alleged while talking to mediapersons.

“Has the BJP ably probed the Lalit Modi case and alleged corruption charges against Raje? There is Vyapam case in MP besides many scams in the BJP-ruled states. Have they recommended probe by CBI or other agency into these,” Pilot asked.

“The BJP is resorting to politics of vendetta by targeting Opposition leaders, whether it is Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal or anyone else,” he said.

In recent years, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had provisionally attached movable and immovable assets worth Rs 1.18 crore under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, in connection with a land scam in Kolayat and Gajner towns of Bikaner district.

The ED action involved a private person and the government officials. ED had also issued notice to Vadra-linked firms, including Skylight Hospitality, according to sources."

Finnish court places main stabbing suspect in custody,"Helsinki, August 22

A Finnish district court on Tuesday placed in custody the main suspect in last week's stabbing spree that left two dead, which is being investigated as the country's first terror attack.

""The offender in Turku incident is suspected on probable cause of murders and attempted murders with terrorist intent and placed in detention,"" the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said in a Twitter post.

The suspect has been identified as 18-year-old Moroccan citizen Abderrahman Mechkah, an asylum seeker who arrived in Finland in early 2016.

Police have said he targeted women in the Friday afternoon attack at a market square in the southwestern port city of Turku. Two women were killed and six women and two men were injured.

Mechkah, who was shot in the thigh by police minutes after the attack, appeared before the Turku court on Tuesday via video link from hospital.

Most of the hearing was held behind closed doors, but press photos taken at the beginning showed the suspect lying in his hospital bed, his head propped up on a pillow and his face shielded by a white sheet.

The motive for the attack is unclear, but the country's intelligence agency SUPO said yesterday that he might have been radicalised. — AFP"
"The Tribune, India news","NEW DELHI: A Bench of five judges from different religious communities, including Sikh, Christian, Parsi, Hindu and Muslim, which pronounced the historic judgement on the controversial issue of the practice of 'triple talaq' among Muslims were not unanimous in the verdict.

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 22

A Bench of five judges from different religious communities, including Sikh, Christian, Parsi, Hindu and Muslim, which pronounced the historic judgement on the controversial issue of the practice of 'triple talaq' among Muslims were not unanimous in the verdict.

The apex court by 3:2 verdict held that the triple talaq is against the basic tenets of Quran.

Three of the five judges hearing a case questioning the legality of ""triple talaq"" ruled it as ""unconstitutional"".

""The government should find a way to frame new laws,"" the three judges said in their ruling, which overruled the other two judges.

While Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer were in favour of putting on hold for six months the practice of triple talaq, asking the government to come out with a law in this regard, Justices Kurian Joseph, R F Nariman and U U Lalit held it as violative of the Constitution.

The court's verdict was marred by confusion initially, with the senior judge, the chief justice of India, announcing that his opinion was to suspend the practice and ask the government to come up with a new law within six months.

He was overruled by the three judges who said it was unconstitutional.

""Finally I feel free today. I have the order that will liberate many Muslim women,"" said Shayara Bano, one of the women who brought the case, after the ruling.

Besides CJI Khehar, the Bench also included Justices Kurian Joseph, R F Nariman, U U Lalit and S Abdul Nazeer.

The laws allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word ""talaq"" three times. Muslim women say they have been left destitute by husbands divorcing them through ""triple talaq"", including by Skype and WhatsApp.

Triple talaq is banned in several Muslim countries, including in neighbouring Pakistan and conservative Saudi Arabia. —Agencies"
ODF Rudraprayag village lacks toilets,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 21

An inspection has revealed that only 29 toilets were built out of the sanctioned 79 in Donda village (Jakholi block) of Rudrapryag district, which was declared open defecation free (ODF) in June. Uttarakhand became the fourth state in the country to be declared ODF after all the 13 districts, including Rudraprayag became free of open defecation in June. Now, the inspection has raised doubts on the state’s claims. Mangesh Ghildiyal, District Magistrate, Rudraprayag, said, “Of the 79 toilets sanctioned for the village only 29 have been built and around 50 are yet to be built.” The gram panchayat was given Rs 4.47 lakh in grant to build toilets. While 19 families got the facility, 31 others are left out. “Each family (beneficiary) was to receive Rs 12,000 under the Swajal Scheme for constructing toilets. But, most of them complained that the pradhan released Rs 6,000 only as part of the first instalment,” said Ghildiyal. It also came to light that no survey was conducted in the village by the officials, who relied on the pradhan for information on number of beneficiaries. The village pradhan has been asked to release the remaining amount."

Mohali, August 21

AAP for Vigilance probe

A downpour for around four hours not only left most of the town virtually submerged under nearly 4 ft of water but also exposed the hollowness of the local administration’s claims regarding their monsoon preparedness. Even as hapless residents saw rainwater entering hundreds of houses across the town, the “clueless” authorities, including MC officials, administrative officers, fire brigade personnel and PCR staff, were missing from the scene. “Nobody except the media is picking our phone calls. We don’t know whom to call up at this time of distress,” said panic-stricken residents while making distress calls to Chandigarh Tribune this morning. Rainwater, up to the level of around 4 ft, was seen flowing in certain parts of Phase 3B2, 3B1, Phase V, Phase IV, Sectors 70 and 71 and the Airport Road area, turning roads into virtual rivers. What to talk of two-wheelers and small cars, even SUVs were seen floating in the “road rivers” with drivers losing control over their vehicles. In Phase 3B2, cars and two-wheelers parked on streets were almost submerged in rainwater. Knee-deep rainwater entered hundreds of houses across the town and damaged household goods, including furniture, refrigerators, invertors and other such items worth several lakhs of rupees here. The other worst-hit areas included Phases 1, 2, 3A, 3B1, 4, 5, 7, 9, Sector 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 and 71 and some parts of the Industrial Area. More than 1,000 vehicles broke down on roads around the town. The water pushed several vehicles on to the road divides and pavements. “I saw several four-wheelers virtually floating on roads. This is the first time I saw so much water in the town,” said 20-year-old Karan, who was out with his friends to help the stranded people.Panic-stricken residents claimed they made hundreds of calls to the MC authorities, the fire brigade and the Police Control Room for help, but to no avail. “Nobody was there to listen to us,”they said. A local resident, Manjit Singh, said initially no official was picking up the phone. “And after some time when someone did, he asked us to call up another official. The game of passing the buck was on. When we called up the PCR after water entered our houses, the policeman told us to make a call to the fire brigade office. When we rang them (fire brigade) up, they said they would come only after the rain stopped. We helplessly saw the rainwater damaging our household items,” said Jasbir Singh Bir, a resident of Phase 3B1, who claimed that he suffered a loss of nearly Rs 4 lakh as several electronic items and newly bought furniture got damaged.Ashish Gupta, AS Bajwa, advocate Pawan Sharma and other residents of Phase 2 claimed that they suffered losses of several lakhs as the rainwater damaged furniture and household goods. Later, the fire brigade authorities pressed three fire enignes into service to help people in Phases 1, 3B2, and 5.On the failure of the authorities in tackling the rain aftermath despite spending crores of rupees on various projects in this regard, leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party and local MC councillor Kuljit Bedi demanded a Vigilance inquiry. “The authorities have spent crores of rupees on laying a new drainage at Phase 5 and construction of reservoirs equipped with pumps to deal with the water accumulation problem”, said councillor Kuljit Singh Bedi."
The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Beep, beep, cut, cut… as long as the lord of controversies Pahlaj Nihalani remained at the helm of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he and the films he censured/censored made headlines.

Nihalani's exit and lyricist poet and ad guru Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the new CBFC chairperson is indeed not just a routine change of guard. There is much to read here, may be a lot to cheer, if Nihalani’s words “god bless those who are celebrating my departure” are to be taken seriously for once. If there was little doubt about Nihalani’s absurd ways of working, there can be no questions about Joshi’s finesse as a poet and sensitivity as a writer. But can one man’s elevation and another’s sacking be the answer to all issues that ail filmmakers?

Director Hansal Mehta, whose film Aligarh ran into trouble with the CBFC, doesn’t think it’s fair to put the blame of all that’s wrong with the outdated cinematograph Act on just one person. Certainly tempers ran high when Mehta’s Aligarh, a film on homosexuality, was given an adult certificate, stalling possibilities of the film’s promotion. Time and again producers or directors found themselves at the receiving end. The list of movies that had to bear the brunt of CBFC, running in hyperactive mode under Nihalani, is endless: Udta Punjab, Spectre, Lipstick Under My Burkha, Babumoshai Bandookbaz…. Rare was a film that did not have a run in with the man obsessed with sanskar, Indian ethos and values. Lip locks, abuses, use of words like intercourse… anything and everything even a reference to a city or state could raise his hackles.

But with Nihalani out of sight, Mehta can perhaps rationalise that may be Nihalani was just implementing rules, or following the information and broadcasting ministry orders. If the latter is true, uneasy lies the time ahead. Ashoke Pandit, former member of CBFC (during Nihalani’s tenure) however, is more scathing in his assessment. He believes, “Rules were merely a fig leaf with which Nihalani tried to cover his misdeeds. Which rules say there had to be a banned list of cuss words? Or that words like Kanpur and Kishore Kumar can't be referred to. Nihalani wanted directors to make films as per his individual sense and sensibility. Which filmmaker would agree to that?” Besides, he reminds that the same films he censored were ultimately either cleared by FCAT or the courts.

Pandit believes Joshi is the right man for the job. “In sync with today's times, Joshi understands the world cinema and has worked with the very best makers in the country.” Mehta, however, feels that the CBFC should not be personality driven, instead be guided by crystal clear guidelines. That’s precisely why he would not jump the gun and hail the newly constituted CBFC as the panacea.

Actor Aahana Kumra stands pleased and fearless like the bold character she played in Lipstick Under My Burkha, the film that was even denied certification and is rumoured to be the real trigger for Nihalani's ouster. She says, “I am hopeful that with Joshi as the chairperson and actors like Vidya Balan on the board, path-breaking films, especially women centric subjects, will be viewed favourably.” Producer director Prakash Jha who has been at loggerheads with the CBFC has only one word answer — no censorship.

Is absence of censorship a guarantee of good cinema? May be not… after all there is censorship in Iran and the country's makers have been producing world-class cinema. In a democracy that India is, artists feel strongly against censorship which they insist connotes backwardness, just as George Bernard Shaw would say, “The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.”

Whether Joshi can ensure that scissors are laid to rest remains to be seen. Right now Joshi, too, doesn't have the answers, only claims to have the right intent. And that's what really matters feels Pandit. “If Nihalani had the inclination to change, instead of bothering about nitty-gritties, he would have worked towards implementing Benegal committee recommendations which have been around for a year now.” Mehta is not sure whether the Benegal committee guidelines are a fit-all solution or that there can be a please-all policy. But Pandit reasons, “If implemented, Benegal guidelines would be a good start for sure.” Propelled by Joshi’s vision who clearly doesn’t endorse micromanagement, he foresees happy times for the Indian cinema. Round one of sniping and snipping may have lasted too long but for now votaries of cinema seem to heave a sigh of relief and reassurance."

New Delhi, August 21

Taking cognisance of recent sewer deaths, Lt. Governor Anil Baijal on Monday directed Delhi Jal Board Chief Executive Officer Keshav Chandra to finalise a plan within 15 days for migration to 100 per cent mechanisation for cleaning of sewer/drains in coordination with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).

Baijal ordered the Standard Operating Procedure for cases requiring emergency manual intervention as per law to be laid down within seven days and all such SOPs will be applicable to all, including private contractors, group housing society and malls, etc.

The directions came after Baijal called a high level meeting, attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Public Works Department Minister Satyendar Jain, Water Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam along with senior officers of Delhi Government, NDMC and the three municipal corporations, Member (Delhi Jal Board), CEO (Delhi Cantonment Board) and Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order, South).

Noting that these deaths are a grim portrayal of the unsafe working conditions of people engaged to keep sewer lines and tanks clean, often with their bare hands, the Lt. Governor termed the present situation as “unacceptable”.

Before the meeting, Gautam posted a series of tweets on the matter saying a case under 304 IPC will be registered against the contractors as well as the government officials responsible for the same. “Shocked and painful to see the 4 incidents of death during sewage cleaning. Contractors have no fear of law,” the minister tweeted.

The Secretary (SC/ST) was directed to upload all the notifications clarifying the legal position on the website so that it can be in public domain for the benefit of the contractors as well as the users.

The Lt. Governor also directed the CEO (DJB) and other departments, including the municipal bodies, to undertake extensive information, education and communication (IEC) campaign for widespread publicity of the harmful impact on the health of such workers as well as the illegality committed by the contractors/user agencies.

He stressed that the liability of the principal employer does not get diluted and asked the government agencies to strictly abide by the law.

“The employers must provide gas masks, safety harness belts, helmets and mechanised equipment, etc as legally mandated for the hazardous work of cleaning of clogged underground sewers and must ensure strict compliance of the relevant guidelines and proper arrangements of the safety and security of the workers,” said an official.

The Lt. Governor also directed the Delhi Police to take stringent action against those contractors who violate the law. He was informed that the police have already booked the contractor for culpable homicide in yesterday’s tragic incident. The review of the implementation of the directives would be made again after two weeks, added the official."
Dawood on UK asset freeze list with 3 Pak addresses; 21 aliases,"London, August 22

India’s most wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim remains the only “Indian national” on an updated list of financial sanctions released by the UK which also listed 21 aliases for the underworld don.

The mafia boss appears on the UK Treasury Department’s ‘Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK’ updated yesterday, with three recorded addresses in Pakistan, where he is reportedly based.

“Kaskar Dawood Ibrahim” is recorded to have lived at: House No 37, 30th Street — Defence Housing Authority, Karachi, Pakistan; Noorabad, Karachi, Pakistan (Palatial bungalow in the hilly area); and White House, near Saudi Mosque, Clifton, Karachi, Pakistan.

A fourth address on record until last year – House no.29, Margalla Road, F 6/2 Street no.22, Karachi, Pakistan – is no longer part of the records.

Ibrahim is the main accused in the 1993 serial bomb blasts case in Mumbai in which around 260 people were killed, and more than 700 suffered injuries. He fled the country post the bombings and is understood to be hiding in Pakistan.

Pakistan has repeatedly denied his presence in the country.

His place of birth is recorded as Kher, Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, and his nationality is listed as “Indian” with a recorded Indian passport which was subsequently revoked by the government of India and then goes on to list a string of Indian and Pakistani passports acquired by him and misused.

“Father’s name is Sheikh Ibrahim Ali Kaskar, mother’s name is Amina Bi, and wife’s name is Mehjabeen Shaikh. Also referred to as Hizrat and Mucchad,” the listing on Ibrahim, first made on November 7, 2003, notes.

The listing also records 21 aliases used by Ibrahim: Abdul, Shaikh, Ismail; Abdul Aziz, Abdul Hamid; Abdul Rehman, Shaikh, Mohd, Ismail; Anis, Ibrahim, Shaikh, Mohd; Bhai, Bada; Bhai, Dawood; Bhai, Iqbal; Dilip, Aziz; Ebrahim, Dawood; Farooqi, Sheikh; Hasan, Kaskar, Dawood; Hassan, Dawood; Ibrahim, Anis; Ibrahim, Dowood, Hassan, Shaikh; Kaskar, Daud, Hasan, Shaikh, Ibrahim; Kaskar, Daud, Ibrahim, Memon; Kaskar, Dawood, Hasan, Ibrahim; Memon, Dawood, Ibrahim; Sabri, Dawood; Sahab, Haji; and Seth, Bada.

The financial sanctions list also included organisations such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Khalistan Zindabad Force and Hizbul Mujahideen.

A series of affiliates of ‘Al-Qaeda’ and the ‘Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’ are also recorded on the list.

Financial sanctions in force could apply to individuals, entities and governments who may be resident in the UK or abroad.

The measures include prohibiting the transfer of funds to a sanctioned country and freezing the assets of a government, the corporate entities and residents of the target country to targeted asset freezes on individuals/entities.

Certain financial sanctions may also prohibit providing or performing other financial services, such as insurance, to designated individuals or governments.

It is a criminal offence to breach a financial sanction, without an appropriate licence or authorisation from the UK Treasury. — PTI"

He also presented Colours to all five Ladakh Scouts battalions and the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre. The President said, “In capacity as the Supreme Commander of the armed forces, I dedicate the visit to the armed forces of the country.”He said it had been 54 years since the Ladakh Scouts became part of the Army. “This period has been replete with tales of heroism, honour and glory. The genesis of the regiment was in the invasion by Pakistani raiders in 1947-48 and the resolve with which Ladakhis defended their motherland. This continues to remain a matter of pride for the entire country,” he said. The President said in little over half a century, the regiment has earned 605 honours and awards for conspicuous gallantry and distinguished service. “This speaks for the exceptional valour and spirit of the regiment personnel and is a model for all soldiers and officers of the armed forces,” he added. He said at the colour-presentation ceremony that he would like to pay homage to the martyrs of the Ladakh Scouts Regiment. “Their blood and sacrifice has secured our sovereignty, brought glory to our nation and protected our people from harm,” he said.

Srikanth, Sameer have an easy outing; mixed-doubles pair also makes second round

Glasgow, August 21

India made a promising start at the World Badminton Championships with Kidambi Srikanth and Sameer Verma advancing to the second round here today. Eighth seed Srikanth, who won the Indonesia Super Series and Australian Super Series this year, defeated Russia’s Sergey Sirant 21-13 21-12 in less than half-an-hour, setting up a second-round clash with France’s Lucas Corvee for Tuesday. Verma, who won the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold in January, reached the second round after his opponent, Spain’s Pablo Abian, retired midway with the score reading 21-8 17-4 in favour of the Indian. He will meet either England’s Rajiv Ouseph or Czech Republic's Adam Mendrek in the next round. The mixed-doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Maneesha K defeated Hong Kong’s Tam Chun Hei and Ng Tsz Yau 24-22 21-17 to start their campaign on a positive note. In the men’s singles, it was a nervy start for Srikanth as he missed a few points initially but his smart play at the net and some precise smashes saw him open up an 11-6 lead at the break. After the interval, the Indian tightened his grip on the contest and eventually sealed the opening game with ease. In the second game, Srikanth zoomed ahead to 11-5. The duo engaged in some exciting rallies but the Indian always had his nose ahead of his competitor. Srikanth had a cushion of eight points when a return from his rival found the net, giving the Indian an easy passage to second round. “I had a decent break after the Indonesian Open and I worked hard before coming here. First rounds can always be tough in a big championship like this, I am happy I came through. It is a confidence booster,” said Srikanth. “I have not set any targets as such, I just want to play and I want to go match by match.

Singapore, August 22

One of Singapore’s oldest Hindu temples is under investigation over suspected criminal offences, a media report said on Tuesday.

Commercial Affairs Department is conducting the probe into Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, but it is “inappropriate” to comment further on the investigation, police said.

The Commissioner of Charities (COC) also said in a statement that it had been notified of the investigation and had also launched its own inquiry into the temple.

“The review identified certain areas of concern with regard to governance and administration, which warrant conducting an inquiry,” Channel News Asia reported citing the statement.

The COC added that it would decide on the next course of action after the inquiry.

In the meantime, religious activities would not be affected and the temple could continue with its operations and daily services, the COC said, adding that measures would be put in place to ensure the temple is properly managed.

The temple at Serangoon Road is a well-known landmark in the Little India area, with about 5,000 devotees on Sundays and is popular among tourists.

The temple was set up as a trust and obtained charity status in 1988.

The temple, founded by Tamil pioneers in 1835, underwent a two-year-long SGD7-million makeover which was completed in 2014.

It is one of 15 places of worship that have been listed for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. PTI"

A tad too sweet,"MOVIE REVIEW: BAREILLY KI BARFI

Nonika Singh

Ever since Anand L Rai invented patakha Tanu, which fit Kangana Ranaut like a glove, there has been a deluge of perky small-town female characters. So, Bitty (Kriti Sanon) of Bareilly Ki Barfi comes as no surprise. This daughter of a sweet shop owner is bold and vivacious, can break into a jig (break dance to be precise) at the slightest turn of music, smokes and drinks and has the courage to tell her suitors that she is no virgin. No wonder she can't find a suitable groom. After all girls like her, few and far between, are a ‘disaster.’

But before she decides to call it quits and run away from home, she stumbles upon a book Bareilly Ki Barfi that best describes a girl just like her with no value judgements attached to her behaviour which others, including her mother, call misdemeanors.

Thus begins her search for the author and director takes us on to the love path where identities are muddled and soon love has three facets, not just the visible Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti. If Kriti is just right for the exuberant Bitty and Khurrana is endearing and exasperating in turns as his character demands, Rajkummar Rao as the third angle and the underdog is brilliant. He gets even better when he transforms into the snazzy confident, almost brash guy. Only if he had some more screen time as well as something more (spoiler alert).

Nevertheless, for a considerable part the director keeps you invested in the story told simply as well as has you nibbling over the key question---who will get the girl? Fleetingly, the film reminds you of those delectable super fresh romances such as Sai Paranjpye’s Katha. But if those films skillfully and subtly delved into complexities and many shades of human nature, here the director decides to play super safe and love story ends the way you so hope and wish it won’t. The conflict resolution is a downer.

Thus Bareilly Ki Barfi, despite the surface gloss of rebellion, turns too sweet. If you like your love stories more sugar than spice be Bareilly’s guest. We would have preferred a sharper climax, the sparkle of which can otherwise be seen interspersed in-between and not just in Javed Akhtar’s witty voice-over that takes you enroute Bareilly ki galiyan, especially the Misra household that is peopled with few but animated characters and competent actors (Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi as parents). Dialogues such as Agar ladkiyan shakal dekhti to desh ke aadhe se zyaada ladke kunwaare hote have a zing. Indeed, Bareilly… has many delightful one-liners and amusing moments but the overall impact is not tantalizing enough to make it a wholesome fare one must bite into.

Colours of healing,"Art helps make sense of suffering. This therapy is coming to the rescue of children undergoing behavioural issues

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
Punjabi poet Surjit Patar appointed Punjab Arts Council chairman,"Tribune News Service

Ludhiana, August 22

Celebrated Punjabi poet Surjit Patar was on Tuesday appointed as Chairman of Punjab Arts Council in place of television anchor Satinder Satti. Tourism and Culture Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu presented the nomination letter from Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh at Patar’s residence here. Speaking on the occasion, Sidhu said it is a matter of pride for this government that Patar had agreed to this role. “There cannot be a more able man to head this chair. He is not only an icon but a genius,” he said.

Patar is the lighthouse and role model to give direction to the youth and the government is going to facilitate him into this role, he added. “We are going to inculcate a sense of pride in our culture. We have to go and fight this war in the minds of the people and it cannot be fought by just making a policy. And to fight this war, there is no bigger warrior than Surjit Patar,” he said. “We are going to create a movement and would involve everyone associated with and passionate for Punjabi culture,” he said. He said Satinder Satti had worked a lot and she would also be involved. At least 50,000 people would be involved in this movement, he added. Patar, meanwhile, said he was humbled with this “love and honour”. “I have a firm belief that we would be able to take art, music and culture through the Arts council to village level. Punjab is not just a mere geographical entity, but it is a song, love, feeling and a philosophy,” he added. “We plan to create a cultural centre comprising a library, a place for staging plays at village level. We would collaborate with the education department so that cultural icons can interact with children at school level,” he added."

Shimla, August 21

The flak drawn by the state government over inept handling of the sensational rape and murder of the 16-year-old Kotkhai girl is likely to cast its shadow on the four-day monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha, the last in this term of the Virbhadra Government.

The session commencing tomorrow is likely to witness heated debates and frayed tempers over the deteriorating law and order situation. Opposition BJP is preparing to make the deteriorating law and order situation in the state the main issue for discussion and will demand a debate on it.

Both the Congress as well as the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) will be holding their meetings tonight to chalk out their strategy. Some Bills, including the Medical Sciences University Bill, is also likely to be tabled and passed by the house.

Having faced criticism on the manner in which the rape and murder of the Class X school girl was ‘mishandled’, the government will have a lot to answer. However, with the high court monitoring the investigations being undertaken by the CBI, the state government could take the plea that since the matter is sub judice it cannot be taken up for any discussion or debate.

However, the BJP seems to have made up its mind on taking on the government on the Kotkhai case and its various aspects. The custodial death of one of the rape and murder accused Suraj has put the police department in the dock and the BJP will seek detailed report on this too, said Opposition legislators.

Satpal Singh Satti, state BJP president, said there had been a surge in crime which had shaken the faith of the people in the ability of this government to check such disturbing incidents.

The government, on the other hand, will try to turn the tables on the government over the discriminatory approach of the Modi regime in making budgetary allocation to Himachal in various schemes. The delay in laying the foundation stone of the AIIMS by Union Health Ministry is another issue on which the ruling party will try to embarrass the BJP. The state Health Minister has been maintaining that the tasks such as identifying the land and completing the formalities like seeking forest clearance have been undertaken."

Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday met Union Minister for Food and Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan and urged him to review the Rs 31,000 crore food procurement debt of the state. Paswan acceded to the request and the matter would be taken up with the Finance Ministry. Paswan has also accepted Singh’s request to allow higher user charges in lieu of deprecation of once-used gunny bags for the forthcoming kharif season. Singh urged disbursement to the state for the loss incurred by it in making procurements of grains for the Central pool.

He said the state wanted to be fully geared for the coming kharif season, which is expected to witness a produce of 18.2 million tonnes of rice. Later, responding to a specific question, Singh said the state police had been directed to take all measures for the upkeep of law and order in the context of the impending court verdict in the Dera Sacha Sauda chief case. He said the Centre had provided the state 75 companies of paramilitary forces."
City comes to a standstill,"Chandigarh, August 21

The city came to a virtual standstill due to waterlogging that led to massive traffic jams across the city. Thousands of commuters, especially office-goers, ended up getting stuck in jams for over an hour. Traffic was thrown out of gear on stretches across the city, including Madhya Marg, Dakshin Marg and roads leading to Mohali. While the waterlogged roads led to traffic jams, vehicles that broke down in the middle of the road added to the chaos. Motorists abandoning their vehicles and wading through knee-deep water was a common sight across the city. The thin presence of traffic cops on intersections left commuters at the receiving end. The daily 20-minute drive from Zirakpur to Chandigarh stretched to over an hour. Commuters moving from one part of the city to another landed up in traffic snarls. Efforts to take alternative routes did not help much. Major traffic snarls were witnessed at the old Airport light point, the Hallo Majra light point, Tribune Chowk, the Sector 32/33/20/30 chowk, the Sector 34/33/20/21 chowk, the Housing Board light point, the Kalagram light point, the Transport light point, the Sector 26/27/7/19 roundabout, the Press light point, Sector 17, Matka Chowk and the Sector 22 Aroma light point. Manjeet Singh, a city resident, said it took him almost two hours to reach Sector 34 from Sector 15. Minor accidents were also reported on all major roads. Accidents were reported from Dakshin Marg, Madhya Marg and various southern sectors. “Many two-wheeler riders also fell on the road after losing balance,” said a cop. — TNS"

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"

During the 30-minute meeting here, the Governor apprised Singh of the prevailing situation in the Kashmir Valley and steps taken for restoring normalcy. They also discussed, among other issues, the ceasefire violations from across the border, increasing infiltration attempts and the incidence of terrorism in the Valley. A 40-year-old woman was killed in firing by the Pakistani Army on border villages in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district on August 12. Pakistan violated the ceasefire four times on August 13 by firing at and shelling Krishnagati, Nowshera and Mankote, resulting in injuries to three jawans. On August 8, Pakistani troops fired at and shelled the Krishnagati sector of Poonch district, killing one soldier. Till August 1 this year, there have been 285 instances of ceasefire violations by the Pakistani forces. In 2016, the number was significantly less at 228. PTI"
116 PoK residents stranded in Jammu sent back via Uri,"Samaan Lateef

Srinagar, August 21

116 residents of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir were stranded in Jammu for the past over a month after the Poonch-Rawalkote bus service was suspended

The bus service was stopped due to heavy shelling from Pakistani troops along the LoC

Officials said three residents of this side who were stranded in PoK have also returned home

The J&K Government sent 116 stranded residents of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) back home as the cross-Line of Control (LoC) bus service operating between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad resumed today. The LoC bus service also known as Karvan-e-Aman (peace bus) resumed after remaining suspended since August 14. As per the schedule, the weekly bus left Srinagar today for the Kaman post, the last Indian military post on this side of the LoC in the border town of Uri in Baramulla district. The bus carried 50 passengers, including 42 PoK residents and eight residents of Kashmir, who crossed the Kaman post, Uri Sub-District Magistrate Sagar Doifode told The Tribune. Doifode said the 116 residents of PoK, who were stranded in Jammu for the past over a month after the Poonch-Rawalkote bus service was suspended due to heavy shelling from Pakistani troops along the LoC, were also sent back to their home through Uri. He said the PoK residents in Poonch left for the Kaman post early in morning through historic Mughal Road, connecting Shopian with Rajouri and Poonch in the Jammu region. Officials said three residents of this side who were stranded in PoK have also returned home. The Karvan-e-Aman, which was started on April 7, 2005, runs on a weekly basis but due to the tension on the LoC, the number of people travelling in it has come down in the last one year. The bus service helped thousands of families of J&K, divided by Partition, to meet each. Both LoC trade and bus service are considered as the important confidence-building measures between two warring nuclear-armed neighbors — India and Pakistan. However, the cross-LoC trade has come under the radar of the NIA, which is probing terror funding in Kashmir, and as per reports may recommend closure of trade along these routes."
Feel victorious and protected by SC verdict: Muslim women,"New Delhi, August 22

Muslim women, who had knocked the doors of the Supreme Court opposing triple talaq, on Tuesday rejoiced at the historic judgment striking down the practice, saying they have emerged “victorious” and now feel protected.

However, some women petitioners opined that the victory in its true sense would be achieved once a law comes into force, making the practice punishable.

Farah Faiz, Zakia Suman, Noorjehan Niaz and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIMWPLB) either described the verdict as a “moment of big victory,” “big relief” or as “half the battle won.”

“The court has given a direction to the government to frame a law. We have won half the battle. We will be victorious in the true sense only once the law is framed so as to make this practice punishable. There is no remedy for women against the practice till a law is framed,” Faiz, also the president of Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh, said.

Advocate Chandra Rajan, who represented the AIMWPLB, said “It is a monumental, landmark verdict and the Supreme Court could not give more to the Muslim women. The court has protected every Muslim woman. After six months, a law will be in place and we are very happy about it.”

Niaz of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) expressed relief over the legal backing that the verdict has brought for the Muslim women.

“Now, Muslim women will be able to enjoy their fundamental rights and have a codified law that will guarantee them their fundamental rights. Just like the Hindu personal law which has legal backing, the law for Muslims should have the same,” she said.

Co-founder of BMMA Zakia Suman also welcomed the verdict but said the battle for women’s rights will still go on.

“We welcome the historic judgment on triple talaq, but the battle for women’s rights will still go on. Our fundamental rights have been upheld by the SC order. This kind of a divorce exists because of patriarchal tyranny and we have been suffering this for the past 70 years,” Suman said.

Bangladeshi author Tasneema Nasreen also reacted to the verdict in a tweet posted by her, saying, “Quran2:229 says about #TripleTalaq. Quran4:34 says about beating wife. Abolish 1400 yrs old Quranic laws. Need modern laws based on equality.

Abolishing #TripleTalaq may be a slap to Muslim Law Board but it is definitely not women’s freedom. Women need to be educated and independent.”

Triple talaq, or verbal divorce, is practiced by some in the Muslim community to instantly divorce their wives by saying talaq three times. — PTI"

Dehradun, August 21

The possibility of Uttar Pradesh government handing over the Hotel Alaknanda located in Haridwar to Uttarakhand seems bleak.

Meenakshi Sundaram, Secretary, Department of Tourism, said, “The meeting with the Uttar Pradesh officials on Thursday did not yield any result in our favour. They have conveyed to us their inability to hand over the property. Now, we will have to seek legal remedy as the case is already pending in the Supreme Court.”

Savin Bansal, Additional Secretary, Tourism, had gone to Lucknow to attend the meeting on the asset transfer between Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where he was conveyed the UP government’s decision.

Hopes of final settlement to the 16-year long dispute on asset transfer had gained ground after Adityanath Yogi, who hails from Uttarakhand, was elected Chief Minister of UP.

Chief Minister TS Rawat had visited the Chief Minister in Lucknow where the discussions were held. After the meeting, CM Rawat had conveyed that the discussions were fruitful and it was decided that the issue of transfer of properties between the two states would be resolved amicably.

However, a discordant note was set, when a minister in the Yogi Cabinet claimed that Uttar Pradesh will not part with the properties under its control. The transfer of properties between the two states is pending since the creation of the state in 2000.

Significantly, the prime property in Haridwar is a good source of income for Uttar Pradesh and so far all the governments have resisted its transfer."

Ludhiana, August 21

The first of its kind skyscraper residential complex, Atal Apartments, conceived by the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) to be constructed on 8.80 acre in Shaheed Karnail Singh Nagar on Pakhowal Road here is all set to be dropped. The Trust has adopted a resolution in this regard which has been sent to the state government for approval.

The scheme launched with much fanfare in September last year had a chequered track record as it took almost 17 years for the multi-storey housing complex to reach the execution stage from the drawing board.

The project envisaged construction of 242 HIG and 220 MIG flats in multi-storey towers for which applications were invited from intending buyers during Sept-October 2016. As per the government policy, 50 per cent of the total flats were to be allotted on a reserve price while the rest were to be auctioned at a later stage. In all, the LIT had received 224 applications for (121) HIG flats and another 75 for (110) MIG flats till the closure of the scheme.

According to LIT officials, 34 applicants had opted to withdraw and their earnest money was refunded as per rules of the allotment mentioned in the brochure for the residential scheme. Finally, there were only 80 buyers left for a total of 231 flats in both categories (HIG and MIG).

In the resolution (No. 431) adopted by the Trust meeting, it has been stated that against payment of earnest money and instalments by 80 applicants, construction of 462 multi-storey flats is not viable. It has also been mentioned in the resolution that as many as 26 cases have been filed by successful allottees in the Punjab and Haryana High Court and the Consumers Disputes Redressal Forum for the delay in construction of the flats. Not only this, a few allottees have lodged complaints with the Vigilance Department as well.

“In view of the above stated facts,” says the resolution, “it will be prudent to drop the project and refund earnest money deposited by the applicants for HIG and MIG flats.” It has been further suggested that the technical/engineering wing be asked to prepare an alternative residential/commercial project for this site.

It was officially stated that the successful allottees of HIG and MIG flats in the proposed residential scheme had been given a pro forma to give their consent for refund of earnest money along with interest on savings bank rate since the project was practically deemed to have been dropped."

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour.

[ + read story ]

Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation.

n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health.

n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details.

n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone.

n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you.

n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc.

You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it.

n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour.

n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour.

n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills.

Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
SSP leads from the front,"Chandigarh, August 21

Not worrying about getting drenched in rain, UT SSP (Traffic) Shashank Anand hit the road to regulate traffic and take stock of the situation at various intersections. The SSP spent almost four hours on city roads to ensure minimum inconvenience to commuters. Around 8.30 am, the UT SSP (Traffic) was about to leave for office when he got information about the downpour leading to traffic jams around the city. The SSP then decided to go out on the roads to gauge the situation. The SSP was seen regulating the traffic at Gurdwara Chowk on Dakshin Marg for over 20 minutes after which he went to Tribune Chowk. The SSP also went to other places, including Madhya Marg. Drenched up to the knees, the SSP kept on shuttling from one intersection to another after getting information about traffic snarls. He spent around four hours on the waterlogged roads, regulating traffic. — TNS"
Rocky rocks!,"MOVIE REVIEW - ROCKY MENTAL

Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill. Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment. The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill. Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise. Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man. Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed. The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots. Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

"The Tribune, Business news","NEW DELHI:Profitability of India Inc has been hit by uncertainties due to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the destocking of goods that followed which is also expected to slow down the GDP growth for the first quarter of financial year 2018.

GDP growth also likely to slow down in first quarter, say experts

New Delhi, August 22

Profitability of India Inc has been hit by uncertainties due to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the destocking of goods that followed which is also expected to slow down the GDP growth for the first quarter of financial year 2018.

Ratings agency, ICRA said today that GVA growth will slow down to 6.3% in Q1 FY2018 from 7.6% in Q1 FY2017 due to transitional challenges posed by GST, rupee appreciation and sector-specific issues. ICRA expects GDP to rise by 6.1% in year-on-year terms.

CARE Ratings said in a report that the performance of a sample of 2,108 companies over the last quarter (April-June) 2017 period reveals a negative picture, with net sales showing slower growth and net profits growth showing deterioration.

The agency said this slowdown in industry performance can be attributed to the uncertainties revolving around the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1, 2017. It said most companies were destocking goods before July 1 and operations were impacted quite markedly.

A recovery in corporate earnings has become elusive with another weak quarter of India Inc results. Corporate results which are seen as an indicator of economic activity were expected to improve but the GST impact has led to a strong recovery in the economy post demonetisation getting pushed further into the fiscal year.

Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note that earnings recovery remains elusive as the Q1FY18 earnings season marked another quarter of weak performance and a subdued start to FY18.

It said the performance was also hit by GST-related de-stocking in several consumer-oriented sectors — auto, FMCG, healthcare and consumer durables. Destocking-driven volume and top-line miss exacerbated the impact at operating profit levels."
US teen pleads guilty to internet villain-inspired attack,"Chicago, August 22

One of two girls accused with stabbing a friend inspired by a fictitious internet character pleaded guilty to a reduced attempted homicide charge in a Wisconsin court.

Anissa Weier, who is now 15 but was 12 years old at the time of the 2014 crime, agreed to plea to a lesser charge of second-degree homicide as party to a crime yesterday, with use of a deadly weapon.

She originally faced first-degree intentional homicide.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

She will stand trial next month to determine if she is legally responsible considering her mental health condition.

She told the court she participated in the attack, because she feared the internet character Slender Man -- a villain featured on a horror website -- would otherwise hurt her and her family, according to US media.

Both she and her alleged accomplice Morgan Geyser are accused of stabbing their friend Payton Leutner 19 times at a park. A bicyclist found Leutner and helped her get to a hospital.

After the attack, the suspect teens told police they were headed to see Slender Man at a national forest hundreds of miles away, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Both defendants have entered an insanity plea.

Should the jury reject the insanity defense for Weier, prosecutors would recommend up to 10 years in prison, according to the paper.

If she is found not guilty due to mental issues, she has agreed not to seek conditional release until July 2020 from a state mental hospital.

Geyser's attorney told reporters at the courthouse that a plea deal in her case is also possible.

""I really don't think there's a whole lot we're fighting over in this case,"" the Journal Sentinel reported Anthony Cotton as saying. —AFP"
Triple talaq case: Chronology of events,"New Delhi, August 22

Delhi court denies bail to Kashmiri separatist leader,"New Delhi, August 22

A Delhi court on Tuesday denied bail to Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah, who was arrested in a decade-old money laundering case for alleged terror financing.

Additional Sessions Judge Sidharth Sharma denied the relief to Shah, who is currently in judicial custody, after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said that he was not needed for further custodial interrogation.

On August 3, the court had allowed the ED custody of Shah after the agency alleged that he was ""ruining"" the country by using money to fund terror.

Shah was arrested by the ED a day after several Hurriyat leaders were taken into custody of the National Investigating Agency (NIA) in a case of alleged terror funding in the Valley to fuel unrest.

He was arrested in connection with the August 2005 case in which the Special Cell of Delhi Police had arrested Mohammed Aslam Wani (35), an alleged hawala dealer who is currently in ED custody, claiming that Rs 63 lakh was recovered from Wani out of which Rs 52 lakh was allegedly to be delivered to Shah.

The agency had earlier issued summonses to Shah in the case, the prosecution had said, adding that Wani had claimed that he had given Rs 2.25 crore to Shah.

Investigating agencies like the NIA have cracked down on Hurriyat leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani's son-in-law — Altaf Ahmed Shah, also known as Altaf Fantoosh — and six other Kashmiri separatists. PTI"

The talented stars talk about the movie and more.Ayushmann: It’s a love story about Mudit Sharma and Sugandha, and touches a taboo subject; reading the script I jumped up to play this urban guy. Bhumi: I have an affinity for different kind of films. And, it has been by far the funniest script I have come across; I was down on the floor rolling in laughter listening to this one.Ayushmann: It is important to know who is backing the film. With Anand L Rai backing the film, one would know that it’s not going overboard selling the edginess of the subject. BHuMI: It’s a family entertainer that at no point makes fun of the protagonist’s problem; it finds a solution.Ayushmann: My wife reads all my scripts anyway. She read this one too and liked the way it touched a subject people tend to brush under the carpet. We both are artistes, so it was good. Bhumi: After me, my mother is the first one to read the scripts. She found the story entertaining and educative, and gave a happy go-ahead.Ayushmann: Bhumi is a dear friend and we talk about anything under the sun. And working with a progressive friend and a dedicated actor, this was no issue. Bhumi: I am very good friends with Ayushmann, so we share a certain comfort level. He is such an inspiring actor and working with him is always a delight.Ayushmann: No. We were sure of our content. With Prasoon Ji and Vidya Ji, it was not any trouble at all. Bhumi: No. Ours is a funny romcom that you can see with a 10-year-old! You think Indian audiences, fed on the dose of commercial cinema, is ready for such subjects as yet? Ayushmann: Definitely. My first was lapped up by the audience despite it touching another taboo subject. People are up for different content, which is huge victory for all of us. Bhumi: I am 100 per cent sure. There have been enough of commercial plots; audiences enjoy different and meaningful cinema today, and I feel fortunate to be part of it.

What next for you?

Ayushmann: First, I am hoping that Shubh Mangal Saavdhan gets the same love as I have been getting for Bareilly Ki Barfi, and Bhumi has also been enjoying with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. Next, I am shooting a thriller with Sriram Raghavan, which is tentatively called Shoot the Piano Player. Bhumi: There have been some very interesting line-ups, but ethically I would like the senior actors to speak up about them before I do. (Shubh Mangal Saavdhan hits the screens on September 1)

"Statins may help fight typhoid, malaria","Washington, August 22

Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims. Scientists from Duke University in the US have discovered that a gene variant which affects cholesterol levels could increase the risk of contracting typhoid fever. They also showed that a common cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) could protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the nasty infection. The findings, which appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease. They also point to possible avenues to protect those who are most vulnerable to pathogens - like the Salmonella bacteria - that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells. ""We need to try this approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before we can consider taking this into the clinic,"" said Dennis C Ko, assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine. ""What is so exciting is that our study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,"" Ko said. Ko and his team used hundreds of cell lines from healthy human volunteers and exposed them to the exact dose of Salmonella Typhi, which had been tagged with a green fluorescent marker. They then looked for genetic differences that distinguished cells that had higher rates of bacterial invasion from those that did not. The researchers found that a single nucleotide of DNA in a gene called VAC14 was associated with the level of bacterial invasion in cells. When they knocked out the gene, the cells were invaded more readily and more of the cells glowed brightly with green bacteria. They also unexpectedly found that those more susceptible cells had higher levels of cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes that Salmonella binds to invade host cells. Researchers tested DNA from subjects in a group of 1,000 Vietnamese people, half of whom had typhoid fever and half did not. They found that the VAC14 gene variant was associated with a moderately elevated risk of typhoid fever. ""Discovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins for high cholesterol,"" said Ko. ""We wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,"" he said. Monica Alvarez, a graduate student in Ko's lab and lead author on the study, added a cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) to their water and then injected the fish with Salmonella Typhi. She found that the treated animals were more likely to clear the bacteria out of their system and survive. — PTI"
Centre should discuss triple talaq in Parliament: Muslim League,"Thiruvananthapuram, August 22

The Indian Union Muslim League in Kerala on Tuesday demanded that the central government should not show any undue haste in coming out with an ordinance on triple talaq, after the Supreme Court struck it down as ""unconstitutional"" and ""not part of Islam"".

Speaking to the media, senior IUML leader and Malappuram Lok Sabha member P.K. Kunhalikutty said with the apex court giving six months time, the Centre should debate the issue well and not show any undue haste in coming out with an ordinance.

""The Parliament should debate and discuss this issue... there is time of six months,"" said Kunhalikutty.

The IUML, the second largest ally of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, has two Lok Sabha members and a member in the upper house.

A five judge constitutional bench by a 3:2 majority judgement said there is no constitutional protection for triple talaq.

Justices Kurien Joseph, Rohinton Fali Nariman and Udey Umesh Lalit held that triple talaq is not integral to Islam, is banned in law and lacks approval of the Shariat.

However, Chief Justice J.S. Khehar and Justice S. Abdul Nazir, in a minority judgment, said triple talaq is integral to Islamic practices and enjoys constitutional protection.

Khehar in his judgement urged Parliament to pass a law to deal with the issue.

He, however, injuncted Muslim men from pronouncing instant triple talaq for next six months within which he implored the political parties to shed their difference and enact a law.

Kunhalikutty's colleague in the Lok Sabha, E.T. Mohammed Basheer said that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board will discuss this issue.

Vijender predicts more than 1 medal at World Championships,"Eight years ago, he scripted history by opening the country’s account in amateur boxing’s marquee event and Vijender Singh feels India might just go one better on that during the 19th World Championship, starting August 25 in Hamburg.

The 31-year-old had fetched a bronze medal at the 15th World Championship in Milan, just over a year after becoming India’s first Olympic medallist in boxing—a bronze-winner at the 2008 Beijing Games.

The nation has a bronze each to show for in the 2009, 2011 and 2015 World Championships—the other two bronze-medallists, apart from Vijender, being Vikas Krishan (2011) and Shiva Thapa (2015).

“It is a mature bunch of boxers. I have been in teams that had Shiva (Thapa), Vikas (Krishan) and Manoj (Kumar). So, I know some of them well. They have the ability to ensure that India ends up with more than one medal. If they compete to their full potential, I think there is a real chance of more than one medal,” Vijender told PTI in an interview.

“They have competed at the highest level in the past and know what they should do. I cannot give any suggestions to them but I can just say, they need to be very focussed,” he added.

Both Vikas (75kg) and Shiva (60kg) are part of the eight-member team, which has already reached Hamburg after qualifying for the event through the Asian Championships earlier this year.

The others in the team are Amit Phangal (49kg), Kavinder Bisht (52kg), Gaurav Bidhuri (56kg), Manoj Kumar (69kg), Sumit Sangwan (91kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg).

A fair share of amateur history to his credit, Vijender turned professional in 2015 and has two titles to flaunt in an unbeaten run so far.

“That bronze medal I won in Milan was part of a beautiful phase in my career because it managed to silence some harsh critics, who felt that my medal in Beijing was a fluke. There were people who said that I was not training enough, within months of my medal in Beijing,” Vijender said.

Vijender recalled how he sought solitude during both the Olympics and the World Championship.

“To me, focus has always meant shutting myself off before heading to a big tournament. I would just insulate myself from anything and everything that was going on outside the little space, which I would create for myself,” he explained.

“There will always be expectations and I am sure the guys who are competing this time, are well aware of that. But to me, the key lies in not allowing that to play on the mind. There has to be a single-minded focus on the ring, forget everything else, that’s what I do,” he said.

A former world No.1 in middleweight amateur rankings, Vijender refused to pick favourites but did single out Thapa for praise.

“He has progressed tremendously and seems to be a very sorted boxer. I have been impressed by his growth,” said the Haryana star about the 24-year-old, who is the first Indian to claim three back-to-back Asian Championship medals. — PTI"

Two jobs for martyr’s family

A scaled-down version of the much-hyped Guardians of Governance (GoG) scheme will be launched across 4,000 villages of Punjab from next month. The scheme is coming up for approval before the Council of Ministers in the cabinet meeting, scheduled for Thursday. With ex-servicemen being appointed as the Guardians of Governance (GoG), they will be initially keeping track of 18 welfare schemes, including atta dal, disbursement of social security pensions, any overcharging by cooperatives in fertiliser sale services provided in the hospitals/community health centres and veterinary hospitals. The guardians, to be appointed by a screening committee of ex-servicemen, will be armed with an app on their mobile handsets. They will be physically inspecting the progress of each scheme, which will be ranked and uploaded on the app linked to the IWDMS operating system at the government headquarters here. The ranking, high or low, will be simultaneously visible to the SDM, DC and the administrative secretary of the department that runs the scheme, and the Secretary, Defence Services Welfare, who will be the overall in charge of the GoG scheme. Based on the ranking given by the guardian, the scheme can be rectified. The app allows for the scheme to be examined at the sub-divisional level, district level and at the state level. The Congress government has decided to appoint 1,000 guardians, with each guardian looking after four villages. Originally, the scheme was meant to be rolled out with a budget of Rs 180 crore. “We found that ex-servicemen are residing in only 3,000 villages. We thus reworked the scheme and scaled it down to employing guardians in these 3,000 villages. Thus, the total provisioning required for the scheme will be Rs 45 crore. To begin with, we are running the scheme on a pilot basis this year, and a budget of Rs 12 crore is required for it. Next year, the scheme will be scaled up,” said Gurkirat Kirpal, Secretary, Defence Services Welfare.As against the norm of giving one compensatory job to next of kin of a martyr, the Punjab Cabinet is likely to give two jobs to the family of Naib Subedar Paramjit Singh of Vein Poin village in Tarn Taran, who attained martyrdom earlier this year."

Kotkhai rape to cast shadow on Assembly session,"Session begins today; set to witness heated exchanges over law & order

Shimla, August 21

The flak drawn by the state government over inept handling of the sensational rape and murder of the 16-year-old Kotkhai girl is likely to cast its shadow on the four-day monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha, the last in this term of the Virbhadra Government. The session commencing tomorrow is likely to witness heated debates and frayed tempers over the deteriorating law and order situation. Opposition BJP is preparing to make the deteriorating law and order situation in the state the main issue for discussion and will demand a debate on it. Both the Congress as well as the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) will be holding their meetings tonight to chalk out their strategy. Some Bills, including the Medical Sciences University Bill, is also likely to be tabled and passed by the house. Having faced criticism on the manner in which the rape and murder of the Class X school girl was ‘mishandled’, the government will have a lot to answer. However, with the high court monitoring the investigations being undertaken by the CBI, the state government could take the plea that since the matter is sub judice it cannot be taken up for any discussion or debate. However, the BJP seems to have made up its mind on taking on the government on the Kotkhai case and its various aspects. The custodial death of one of the rape and murder accused Suraj has put the police department in the dock and the BJP will seek detailed report on this too, said Opposition legislators. Satpal Singh Satti, state BJP president, said there had been a surge in crime which had shaken the faith of the people in the ability of this government to check such disturbing incidents. The government, on the other hand, will try to turn the tables on the government over the discriminatory approach of the Modi regime in making budgetary allocation to Himachal in various schemes. The delay in laying the foundation stone of the AIIMS by Union Health Ministry is another issue on which the ruling party will try to embarrass the BJP. The state Health Minister has been maintaining that the tasks such as identifying the land and completing the formalities like seeking forest clearance have been undertaken."
Patiala techie made cooker bombs for revenge,"Spurned by girl, wanted to kill her family members, says police challan

More than two months after the probe into the death of young techie Rajatvir Singh Sodhi, who is believed to have shot himself, the Patiala police are ready with a challan to be submitted in a local court any time. No terror angle, the police claim members of family of a girl who had spurned his love were the “intended targets”. No link with any terror organisation, yet Rajatvir was an “expert in bomb-making”, says the police report. “Rajatvir wanted to eliminate the family of his one-sided love interest and was experimenting with bombs so he could blow the girl’s house in Sangrur district,” it claims. The girl was a student at Rayat and Bahra College, which was Rajatvir’s college too.Quoting Sadar SHO Jaswinder Singh Tiwana, the challan says: “Three months before his death, he (Rajatvir) trespassed into the girl’s house, but was caught and thrashed by her parents and then let off. He again tried to trespass, was caught, given a sound beating and handed over to the local police. A compromise was reached.” Thereafter, Rajatvir started visiting websites of separatist organisations for information on making bombs, the challan claims. It says the investigating team had found 10 live bombs, wires, pressure cookers, a dozen knives, 16 mobiles, as many pen drives and a few bombs fitted in pipes and cookers at his house. Rajatvir’s social media accounts showed he had watched two videos with “jihadist” content on May 3, it claims. “There is no terror angle. The boy was an introvert and wanted revenge,” said S Bhupathi, Patiala SSP. On June 1, the police were informed of a father-son duo frequenting a vacant plot and experimenting with explosives at a village near Punjabi University. Rajatvir’s father Harpreet Singh was arrested and a crude bomb and a weapon were found in his car. On reaching the accused’s house in Darshan Nagar, the police were told by Harpreet’s wife that their son was in a house nearby. The police rushed there only to find Rajatvir’s body lying on the floor with a gunshot wound. Two days later, Rajatvir’s mother Kiranjot Kaur’s body was found hanging from a ceiling fan. Harpreet Singh, who retired as secretary of one of the market committees, reportedly told the police that his son was in depression ever since his marriage proposal was turned down by a girl. He is still in jail. The police will file a challan against him under Sections 25/54/59 of the Arms Act and Sections 3/4 of the Explosives Act."
UK scientists create world's smallest surgical robot,"London

British scientists have developed the world’s smallest surgical robot that could transform daily operations for tens of thousands of patients, the media reported on Sunday.

From a converted pig shed in the Cambridgeshire countryside, a team of 100 scientists and engineers have used low-cost technology originally developed for mobile phones and space industry to create the first robotic arm specifically designed to carry out keyhole surgery, reports the Guardian.

The robot, called Versius, mimics the human arm and can be used to carry out a wide range of laparoscopic procedures including hernia repairs, colorectal operations, and prostate and ear, nose and throat surgery, in which a series of small incisions are made to circumvent the need for traditional open surgery.

The robot is controlled by a surgeon at a console guided by a 3D screen in the operating theatre, according to its maker Cambridge Medical Robotics.

""Having robots in the operating theatre is not a new idea,"" said the company's chief executive, Martin Frost.

""But the problem at the moment is that they are phenomenally expensive, not only do they cost $2.5 million each to buy but every procedure costs an extra $3,800 using the robot... and they are very large."" The Cambridge Medical Robotics said it was already working with a number of National Health Services-owned and private hospitals to introduce the robots.

Residents wake up to season’s heaviest & highest-ever rainfall in 17 years; houses turn pools; traffic hit

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 21

The tricity region comprising Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula woke up to the season’s heaviest and highest-ever rainfall recorded in the past at least 17 years. It threw normal life out of gear and poured lots of pain and misery on residents. Since it was morning time, school and office-goers were the worst-hit and a majority of them could not reach their destinations; resultantly a thin presence was witnessed at educational institutions and workplaces. The downpour started around 7 am and within an hour, the tricity was almost deluged. Mohali was the worst hit as it virtually floated. The 200-foot-wide road leading to the international airport turned into a full-fledged river with gushing waters taking a toll on the moving vehicular traffic. With the Airport road, which was constructed two years ago at a whopping Rs 170 crore (land cost excluded), disappearing under up to 4-foot-deep rainwater, vehicles started floating like unmanned boats in the heavy current of water. Such was the situation that the occupants of vehicles afloat could not even come out of their vehicles, which went totally out of their control and led to accidents.





Hundreds of vehicles got stuck on the 4-km stretch of the Airport road-turned-water body close to Radha Soami Satsang Bhawan and it was only after two boundary walls of the bhavan were razed and its gates opened that the gushing water level started coming down. However, it was only after several hours of ordeal that the situation started limping back to normal. Till 3 pm, the road was still under knee-deep water. Elsewhere in the tricity, rainwater entering houses, shops, godowns and even government offices remained the order of the day. This resulted in heavy loss of property. However, no loss of life was reported from any part of the tricity till reports last came in.In Chandigarh, the situation was a bit better than Mohali but almost all roads and roundabouts had turned into water bodies. The 134-mm rainfall (Mohali excluded and the Met Department, in the absence of any observatory, estimating it to have crossed even the 200-mm mark), which the weatherman recorded from 7 am to 1 pm in Chandigarh once again proved beyond doubt that there was a total collapse of the drainage system, which turned out to be almost non-existent.Even as new UT SSP (Traffic) Shashank Anand led from the front and himself manned the badly blocked vehicular traffic on city roads, all major junctions – Tribune Chowk, Labour Chowk, the ISBT, Sector 17, JW Marriott, Press Chowk, Transport Chowk, Madhya Marg and southern pockets of the city -- witnessed heavy traffic jams with traffic signals conking out and traffic policemen seldom seen to clear the logjam. At several places, trees and poles (both electricity and telephone) got uprooted and damaged vehicles. This also snapped the power and water supply, besides telephone services, in several parts of the tricity. Several roads developed big cracks while some caved in various parts. As far as Panchkula was concerned, it also witnessed a flood-like situation. Ajoy Kumar, whose Mercedes Benz E-Class remained afloat for a couple of hours on the Airport road, said, “It was a second life for me.” “We learn that crores of rupees are spent every year on maintaining the drainage system in the tricity, but today’s situation made it evident that all such expenditure went down the drain,” said Nandini Seth, who, along with her 10-year-old daughter, remained stuck on city roads for three hours. Officials termed it an “unexpected and unavoidable” situation, which was handled “timely”."
Warehousing on growth track,"REAL TALK - ANSHUL SINGHAL, CEO, EMBASSY INDUSTRIAL PARKS

In India, there are three to four classes of real estate — residential, commercial, hospitality and retail — which are the main focus areas of private developers. Globally, there is another class called industrial real estate. In fact, in Europe, US, Japan and China, industrial real estate is one of the largest classes of real estate. In India, it is still at a nascent stage. However, people have realised that with the implementation of GST, Make in India and policy-level changes in government, industrial real estate is now opening up to be a profitable sector and a lot of foreign investment is coming in. Tracking the growth opportunities that have emerged post the imlementation of GST The India Warehousing Show was organised recently. This year, Embassy Industrial Parks was associated as the Official VIP Partner of the show. Anshul Singhal, CEO, Embassy Industrial Parks, who was the keynote speaker at the Warehousing Leadership Summit talks about how the industrial segment is going to be the next big thing in Indian realty. Excerpts from an interaction: What are the growth prospects for the warehousing segment in India? India’s logistics and warehousing sector is poised for accelerated growth, led by GDP revival, ramp up in transport infrastructure, e-commerce penetration, the GST implementation, besides several other initiatives like ‘Make in India.’ Indian 3PL market is expected to grow with CAGR of 6 per cent over the next five years. The biggest indicator of its future is that the government of India plans to build multi-modal logistic parks across the country with an investment of Rs 33,000 crore in a bid to bring down costs incurred on logistics, it will also lay low the overall freight cost, reduce vehicular pollution and congestion, and will enable reduction of warehousing costs of the country. How is GST going to benefit this vertical? With the implementation of GST, domestic warehousing industry will see consolidation. Facilities will relocate to consumer-driven and transportation network areas from the current tax-friendly locations. We even expect sectors like e commerce, automotives, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals; FMCG will own/lease larger warehouses at prime locations like Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Already the warehousing activity along the western corridor has moved towards a more systematic mode of operation leading to an inflow of more institutional funding and formal sources of capital. A recent survey about leading warehousing occupiers in the country revealed that consolidation and expansion will be the key theme driving warehousing demand in the region. This will result in increased demand for larger and better quality warehouses leading to the emergence of new warehousing hubs as well as expansion of the existing hubs. The survey also revealed that 30 per cent of respondents said that they will further expand their footprint in the warehousing market of Delhi-NCR alone in the post GST scenario. GST will ensure that India for the first time will be exposed to consolidated large space central warehousing parks instead of the current scattered poor quality stand alone spaces. Which are the key pockets of growth according to you? Modern warehousing facilities that allow for consolidation of distribution hubs will be a vital component in the growth story. Key markets obviously will be close to cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune — that are a mix of consumption centres and have active industrial presence. What are the major challenges that this segment is facing at the moment? Land acquisition is a major challenge for any real estate player. When we are looking at buying 50 acres to 200 acres of land and develop it, we hope for some reforms that make this process for industrial and warehousing purposes a lot easier. Second challenge is approvals. What we have today has definitely improved from what it was five years back and it has become friendlier in the Modi government but I think we have scope for improvement there. The policies can become more user friendly. The important thing to understand here is that the more time approvals take, the more the capital sits idle as we cannot start construction and generate revenues onto the land. What are your group’s expansion plans in this segment? Embassy Industrial Parks aims to build 20 million sq ft of industrial and warehousing space over the next five years across India at a total investment of about $1 billion. Being a forerunner in this sector, Embassy Industrial Park is also one of the few companies contributing to success of Make in India initiative and has signed three MoUs with the State governments. We have already signed lands which are at various stages of acquisition in Chennai, Delhi, Pune, Mumbai & NCR and we are actively working to acquire lands in Gujarat and Kolkata. We have a JV with Warburg Pincus with Warburg is investing Rs 1,000 crore of equity out of the total Rs 1,600 crore of equity investment. Which means we can raise another approximately Rs 4,000 crore as debt, our investment alone will be Rs 6,600 crore in this sector. This totals to $1 billion.

Nawaz Sharif's wife Kulsoom suffering from throat cancer: Aide,"Lahore, August 22

Kulsoom Nawaz, wife of Pakistan's ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has been diagnosed with throat cancer, a close aide of former premier said on Tuesday.

""Begum Kulsoom has been diagnosed with throat cancer in London. Doctors have said that her cancer is curable,"" Sharif's political secretary Senator Dr Asif Karmani told PTI.

Kulsoom had filed nomination papers for NA-120 in Lahore after the seat fell vacant following Sharif's disqualification to hold any office by the Supreme Court on July 28 in the Panama Papers case.

“Doctors will start her treatment in coming days in London,” Dr Karmani added.

Kulsoom, in her mid-60s, had suddenly left for London last week on the day when her nomination papers were to be filed in the Election Commission of Pakistan.

Dr Karmani said Kulsoom would not be able to participate in election campaign for some days.

He further said that Kulsoom's absence federal commerce minister Pervaiz Malik will supervise her election campaign.

According to a PML-N leader, Kulsoom had not been well for quite some time but Sharif preferred to pitch her on his constituency making her a possible candidate for the prime minister slot.

Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court Appellate Tribunal yesterday rejected all appeals filed against the nomination papers of PML-N candidate Kulsoom for the NA-120 by-poll.

Petitioners had argued that Kulsoom Nawaz also holds a work permit of UAE like that of her husband on which he was disqualified.

Sharif won the seat by a substantial margin in the 2013 general elections, defeating Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf's Yasmin Rashid, who is again contesting for the seat this time around. — PTI"
"Indian-origin former CEO charged with fraud, ordered to pay $294,000","New York, August 22

An Indian-origin former CEO of a penny stock company, charged with making false claims in press releases and engaging in manipulative trading, has been ordered to pay a hefty fine of USD 294,000. Adesh Kumar Tyagi was the former CEO, sole director, and majority shareholder of Systems America, subsequently renamed Cloudeeva. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) obtained a final judgment against Tyagi who had been charged with making false claims in press releases and engaging in manipulative trading in company stock. The final judgment, entered by consent on August 17 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, permanently enjoins Tyagi from violating federal securities regulations and imposes a conduct-based injunction. In addition, the final judgment orders Tyagi to pay approximately USD 294,000 in disgorgement and interest. The court’s entry of judgment against Tyagi resolves this litigation in its entirety. The SEC’s complaint had alleged that Tyagi falsely claimed in press releases he issued between July 2010 and September 2011 that the company had hundreds of customers and supported customer operations in nearly 20 countries when, in fact, the company had only two main clients in 2010 and did not support operations in any foreign countries in 2010 and 2011. Tyagi also allegedly falsely claimed in an initial disclosure he published on behalf of Systems American in 2010 that he was not a party to any material litigation. He claimed that no officer or director of the company had been named as a defendant in a criminal proceeding, when he had been named as a defendant in two pending criminal proceedings. Tyagi had pleaded guilty in November last year to certain aspects of the misconduct at issue in the SEC’s complaint. PTI"

Smartphone separation anxiety becoming widespread,"Los Angeles

Smartphone addiction, and anxiety caused by being separated from the devices, is getting worse as people are increasingly seeing their devices as an extension of themselves, a study has warned. Smartphones have become an integral part of living, penetrating deep into everyday life as ""an irresistible intruder in time or place"" and enabling ""the extension of ear and voice"" for interacting with the world, researchers said. ""Nomophobia"" or smartphone separation anxiety is the feelings of discomfort or anxiety caused by the unavailability of a mobile device that allows virtual communication. Previous studies have found that separation from smartphones causes increases in heart rate, anxiety, blood pressure, and unpleasant feelings. Researchers, including those from University of Hong Kong found that when users perceive smartphones as their extended selves, they are more likely to get attached to the devices, which, in turn, leads to nomophobia by heightening the phone proximity-seeking tendency. ""As smartphones evoke more personal memories, users extend more of their identity onto their smartphones,"" researchers said. ""When users perceive smartphones as their extended selves, they are more likely to become attached to the devices, which, in turn, leads to nomophobia by heightening the phone proximity-seeking tendency,"" they added. Dependency on smartphones is likely to continue to increase, as the advancement of technology continues to make smartphones increasingly appealing and indispensable by adding various convenient and powerful features that facilitate ubiquitous communication, researchers said. Nomophobia, therefore, is also likely to become more rampant, synchronously with the increase in time spent using smartphones. Researchers developed a model that identified a link between factors such as personal memories and user's greater attachment to their smartphones, leading to nomophobia and a tendency to phone proximity-seeking behaviour. An online survey was developed to assess the levels of smartphone users' positive memories, self-extension, attachment, phone proximity-seeking behavior, and nomophobia. ""Nomophobia, fear of missing out (FoMo), and fear of being offline (FoBo) — all anxieties born of our new high-tech lifestyles — may be treated similarly to other more traditional phobias,"" said Brenda K Wiederhold from Interactive Media Institute in the US. ""Exposure therapy, in this case turning off technology periodically, can teach individuals to reduce anxiety and become comfortable with periods of disconnectedness,"" Wiederhold added. The study was published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking."

The Guru of light,"The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn this work

Kuldip Singh Dhir

Birth of Guru Nanak marks an enlightening era in the darkest period of medieval India. Nugatory rituals, superstitions, dogmas, fatalistic outlook, caste divisions, gender discrimination and diffidence to stand up against injustice, oppression or tyranny had rendered people hapless invertebrates. He took upon himself the task of redemption from all this as an assignment from the heavens. The motive force for this lifelong mission was his intimate communion with the Ultimate which forms the leitmotif of this biography. This mystic connection becomes apparent for the first time when Nanak disappeared at the Bien river to reappear after three days.

His message was of oneness of the transcendent. He argued politely but compellingly against futile customs and orthodoxy, liberating people from senseless beliefs, hatred, malice, cowardice, immorality, and delusions which had created a plethora of problems. Profoundness of his simple and persuasive teachings had an immediate impact. Extra-ordinary story of the Guru has been told time and again, but it does not take long to appreciate that this narrative is privileged to stand apart. It relates to the reader as much through the emotive word as through scintillating brush-strokes. Its storyline leans on factual details available in the Sikh scripture Vars of Bhai Gurdas, Janamsakhi traditions, Mahima Parkash and Twarikh Guru Khalsa. Sumeet has vetted these with the help of Bhai Vir Singh, Macauliffe, Dr Ganda Singh, Prof Harbans Singh, Dr Gopal Singh, Prof GS Talib, Dr JS Garewal and McLeod.

The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn the leaves of this work. These are based on author’s own paintings and those of renowned artist Devender Singh, who happens to be his father.

These visuals speak in terms of multilayered creativity and boundless imagination, transcending determinate Cartesian barriers of everyday language. Flesh-and-blood characters, hermeneutical implications, mystical aura and creativity coalesce in this text. Abstract depiction of birth of the Guru, his refusal to wear the sacred thread, the Bien episode, discussion with Pir Dastgir and Sidhas, description of the Divine court (Sodar), the celestial song (arti), moods evoked by various Ragas / months of the year, and socio-cultural reality portrayed in the hymns are a testimony to it.

Starting with the birth of the Guru, Sumeet ends the introductory chapter with Nanak preparing for his missionary journeys after the Bein episode. We have a glimpse of his birth place Nankana Sahib, the birth of the extraordinary child, his family, and his father’s efforts to mould Nanak in the social, religious, cultural and educational framework of his times failing badly. The child prodigy astonishes everybody with rational thinking impeachable knowledge and precocious queries. The four chapters that follow present Nanak disseminating his message of oneness of God, dignity of labour, universal love, peaceful coexistence and socially responsible life, couching it in hymns of postmodernist plural tone.

Nanak acknowledges that his message was derived from a divine vision saying: “As the word comes, so do I describe it.” The people and places, customs and beliefs, habits and habitats, flora and fauna, natural environs and landscape, mountains, rivers and desolate lands, ascetic’s yogis and preachers of diverse faiths all come alive as if with a magical touch. He sang the divine praises all along. He often directed his Muslim companion Mardana to play on his rabab as he vividly sang the bani or Divine Word descending upon him from the skies.

Guru’s settled life in Kartarpur, his handing over his mission to Bhai Lehna, anointing him as Guru Angad and an insightful summary of Nanak’s teachings have been taken up next. The last three chapters give us a peep into the mind and message of the Guru by taking up three of his masterpieces, Japji, Asa di Var and Bara-mah. This unique biography combines skillfully narrative with the descriptive, real with the imaginary, and word with the brush-strokes to capture the persona of Guru Nanak."
Dhawan credits failure for his success,"Dambulla, August 21

Shikhar Dhawan may have hit a purple patch but the opener has not forgotten the slump which had forced him out of the team. Dhawan was dropped after the New Zealand series last year and made a comeback for the Champions Trophy this year. Ever since, he has done exceedingly well and hopes to continue in the same vein for as long as possible. “I would like to keep performing because if I don’t, there are many batsmen in our side who can take my place,” Dhawan said after helping India to a thumping nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka on Sunday. “Failure teaches you a lot, and I am lucky I have learnt so much out of it.” Talking about the slump in form that saw him dropped, Dhawan, who hit a fluent unbeaten 132 on Sunday, said, “When I was not doing well, I was just focussing on my processes. And when I am doing well, I am still focussing on my processes. So those things don’t bother me that much,” said Dhawan. “I have already had a slump, so I don’t think about it. When it has to come, it will come. I will embrace that too.”

Focus on fitness

The left-hander said he needed to keep his fitness level high to be at par with “the young boys” in the team. “I like to keep myself fit. Apart from that, I don’t really set goals like I’ve to score these many runs. I just focus on my fitness, skills and fielding,” he said.

Lanka not bad team

After being ruthless with the willow, he chose to be far more sympathetic with his words. “This is a young Sri Lankan side, they are going through a transition and will mature. The young boys are good, they will get better with time,” he said. Asked if the Lankan attack, led by the ageing Lasith Malinga, was the poorest he has faced, the opener refused to belittle the Lankan attack. “Malinga has been a legend for Sri Lankan cricket and he has done great in international cricket. He is a bit old now and with time his pace has gone down a bit. But this is natural because he has played so much cricket, it’s just a cycle, a life cycle,” said the left-handed opener. “I don’t use those harsh words. I won’t say they are the worst bowling attack I have ever faced. The left-arm bowler (Vishwa Fernando) bowls a decent pace. They have a good pace attack,” he added. — PTIAverage at which Dhawan has scored his 757 runs from 10 matches against Sri Lanka.

Dhumal accuses HP govt of 'suppressing facts' in rape and murder case of schoolgirl,"Shimla, August 22

Leader of Opposition in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly Prem Kumar Dhumal on Tuesday accused the state government of ""suppressing the facts"" in the gangrape and murder case of a schoolgirl and alleged that it was ""running away"" from a discussion as it was on a ""weak turf"".

Talking to reporters here, he claimed that there were many loopholes in the investigation carried out by the state police into the case and added that going by the sequence of events, it appeared that the evidence in the case had been tinkered with.

""The government is in the dock and it has a lot to explain. But, it is running away from the discussions, which is giving rise to more suspicion about its role and that of the police,"" the former chief minister said.

Referring to reports of CBI raids at the houses of four people — photos of which were uploaded on the Facebook page of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh — Dhumal said the subsequent deletion of the photographs from the social media raised several questions on the police investigation.

He also claimed that the state government's request to the high court for a CBI probe into the ghastly crime, stating that the situation was going out of its hands, spoke volumes about ""its own failures"".

Dhumal said it was ""intriguing"" that the police suddenly arrested some persons in the case after a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed and claimed that the credibility of the men in uniform was at stake and that is why the government was forced to refer the case to the CBI to ""save its own skin"".

The BJP leader alleged that the mysterious death of forest guard Hoshiar Singh in the Karsog area of Mandi district was linked to the forest mafia, adding that the culprits were being shielded by the government.

He said the police version that the forest guard had committed suicide was ""not convincing"".

Pointing out that the police recently placed some persons under arrest after going through the call details of Singh's mobile phone, Dhumal wondered why did it take them such a long time to do so.

He also alleged that the cases of illegal felling of trees at Bharmour and Taradevi were being hushed up.

""Regarding Taradevi, the government said no tree was felled there but bushes were cleared, in spite of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) slapping a fine of Rs 1.16 crore on it,"" Dhumal said.

The leader of opposition also claimed that the controversy surrounding the arrest of a Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) official with 'chitta' (crude heroin), too had taken a ""twist"" as the drug was later dubbed as 'limestone'. PTI"

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour.

[ + read story ]

Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation.

n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health.

n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details.

n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone.

n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you.

n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc.

You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it.

n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour.

n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour.

n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills.

Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

Failed mechanics,"MOVIE REVIEW: ANNABELLE: CREATION

Set in the 1940’s, “Annabelle: Creation” the prequel to “Annabelle,” which was in turn a spinoff of “The Conjuring,” is the third cinematic outing for the demon-host, a wooden doll made by the doll-maker Sam Mullins( Anthony La Paglia), who lost his daughter in an accident(the only strikingly shocking scene in the entire movie).

His wife Esther (Miranda Otto) has already become a victim of the demonic doll and is now living a secluded mysterious life within the confines of her own bedroom.

The Doll has been cloistered within a closet papered with Bible readings, in their sprawling California farm house for a few years now. And into this set-up they introduce a bunch of six orphans - Prepubescent Polio-stricken and wearing a leg-brace, young Janice (Talitha Bateman), her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), a motley group of pre-teens and their caretaker Nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman).

Could be they thought that inviting strictly catholic folk would absolve them of their descent into evil? But what about the young ones who have basically been set-up for scare-happy voyeuristic entertainment? That the religious Church going Mullins’ put young helpless children in harm’s way is a little hard to stomach.

Returning ‘Annabelle’ screenwriter Gary Dauberman contrives to have Janice curious enough to overcome her fears and investigate the mysteries of the old house, thus laying out the plot points that would eventually lead to her victimisation. Linda is also drawn in while the Nun and her other four wards have their own scary encounters to deal with. And there’s really nothing new to keep you absorbed here.

No doubt Sandberg’s narration follows the genre ritual of terrorising its female characters, but this time they are a little too young to be validated by such impunity!"

Taliban warns Afghanistan will become ‘graveyard’ for US,"Kabul, August 22

The Taliban warned that Afghanistan would become “a graveyard” for the United States on Tuesday after President Donald Trump cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country. “If America doesn’t withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, soon Afghanistan will become another graveyard for this superpower in the 21st century,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, said in a statement. He said America should think of an exit strategy “instead of continuing the war”. “As long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,” Mujahid said. Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America’s longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief on Monday, though he did not offer specifics. He said he had concluded “the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable”, leaving a vacuum that terrorists “would instantly fill”. While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan. Earlier Mujahid had dismissed the strategy as vague and “nothing new”. “For now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,” he told AFP. A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the “arrogant behavior” of previous presidents such as George W Bush. “He is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. “For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,” he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government “is a US puppet”. The insurgents signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack on Monday. The rocket landed in a field in the city’s diplomatic quarters, with no casualties reported. Trump also lambasted US ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to “agents of chaos”. A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan’s shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump “has proved it’s a crusade”. “His statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),” he said. Prior to Trump’s announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. AFP"
Unavailability of land hits Kangra projects hard,"Lalit Mohan

Dharamsala, August 21

Non-availability of land and forest clearances continue to be bottlenecks in the completion of various development projects in Kangra district. Central University Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) and Dharamsala-McLeodganj and Himani-Chamunda ropeways are the three major projects in Kangra district that have failed to see the light of the day. Besides, the efforts of the HIMUDA to bring up housing projects and a proposed IT park have also remained on paper. The CUHP is a project that involves an investment of about Rs 500 crore. It was sanctioned and started in Kangra district in the year 2010. Seven years have gone by since the project was started but till date even the land for it has not been finalised. The Dharamsala-McLoedganj ropeway is an important project that can help de-congest traffic to the most popular tourist destination of the district. The project was allocated to M/S TRIL, Urban Transport Private Ltd Company. However, the Ministry for Environment and Forest had put on condition on use of forest land for the project. It had asked the government to provide 2.5 hectare land that can be diverted to the Forest Department before the land earmarked could be diverted to the ropeway project. The government officials were busy finding 2.5 hectare land which could be diverted to the Forest Department for forestry purpose. The construction of the project is yet to take off. The Himani-Chamunda ropeway project was allocated to Usha Brackel Company in the year 2016. However, sources here said that the project was still struck due to lack of environmental clearances. The project is intended at developing Himani Chamunda temple located at a height of 12,000 feet from the sea level at par with the Vashino Devl temple shrine in Jammu and Kashmir. The sources here said that the project is as good as abandoned as even the case for its environment clearance has not processed. The only project that was completed this year in Kangra district was the Rajiv Gandhi Government Engineering College that was inaugurated by Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi. The project has been brought at a cost of about Rs 50 crores. Much talked of Smart City project for Dharamsala is yet to take off. The Smart City Private Ltd. Company formed to execute the project got about 200 crores this year for developmental projects in Dharamsala city. This included Rs 183 crores given by the Union government, while the rest was given by the state government. However, the Smart City project is being delayed due to inadequate staff and non-appointment of project consultants who are to execute it. The present government had also announced and started seven new degree colleges in Kangra district in the last two year. However, the colleges are being run in two to three rooms taken from local primary schools."
Indians celebrate I-Day at grand parade in New York,"New York, August 21

Thousands of people from the Indian diaspora converged in the heart of New York in their traditional finery to celebrate India’s 71st Independence Day at one of the largest parades outside India attended by ‘Baahubali’ actors Rana Daggubati and Tamannaah Bhatia.

The 37th India Day Parade organised by the Federation of Indian Associations — New York, New Jersey, Connecticut — ran through several streets in Madison Avenue in Manhattan on Sunday and featured tableaux by several Indian-American organisations, marching bands, police contingents and cultural performances by young Indian-American children.

Greeting the crowd, New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio said the Independence Day parade celebrates the “extraordinary contributions” of the Indian-American community to the city.

“This is a day we appreciate what people do for the city regardless of what they look like, regardless of what language they speak, regardless of where they were born. Everyone here contributes to making New York City better and making America stronger. That is what we are celebrating today,” de Blasio said.

The mayor, holding the Indian tricolour, waved to the thousands of people gathered along the parade route.

Daggubati, the Grand Marshal for the parade, said it was a matter of great pride for him to celebrate the Independence Day with a large population of Indian-Americans.

“It gives me a huge sense of pride to be here. The people here are the ambassadors of our country making us proud outside of India,” he said.

Bhatia said, “It is amazing to see Indians celebrating” the country’s culture and heritage.

“India has given me lot of freedom to express myself. It is very humbling to represent India at the parade,” she said.

Padama Shri awardee Sudhir Parikh, a medical doctor and long-time leader of the Indian-American community, said over the years the parade has been a bridge between India and the second and third generation Indian-Americans.

A float by the Indian Consulate in the city focused the rich cultural heritage of India’s northeast states.

Thousands of people from the New York tri-state area came for the day-long celebration, which included special food stalls, cultural extravaganza and about 25 floats by various Indian organisations based in the US such as Air India.

People, including young children and seniors, raised patriotic slogans like ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’, ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Jai Hind’ and carried banners, placards and Indian and American flags as they witnessed the floats and celebrities from the barricaded pavements along the parade route. Indian music and popular Bollywood songs reverberated through the air as people celebrated with a fervour of patriotism.

Several Americans and people belonging to different communities also stopped to watch the parade and enjoy the festivities. Families had travelled from nearby states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts to witness the parade, an annual fixture in the city’s calendar since 1981.

On India’s Independence Day on August 15, the iconic Empire State Building was lit up in the Indian try-colour.

Commemorating the Day, India’s Consul-General here Ambassador Sandeep Chakravorty had rung the opening bell at the NASDAQ stock market in Times Square. Flag-hoisting ceremonies and commemorative events were held at the Indian Consulate as well as at India’s Permanent Mission to the UN.

Singer Kailash Kher had attended the flag hoisting ceremony at the permanent mission. Later speaking to PTI, Kher applauded the significant contributions of Indian Americans to the social and economic fabric of the US.

He called on Indians settled in America to join hands and continue to make contributions that take India to the next level of growth and development, particularly through support of flagship Indian programmes such as ‘Swachch Bharat’, ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ and ‘Digital India’. PTI"

Get the maximum out of your diet,"WELLNESS

Mridula Wattas

Our body needs vitamins to function efficiently. They play important roles in metabolism, immunity and digestion. The vitamins, our bodies need, can be broken down into two groups: fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K rely on fats to be digested. A lack of healthy fats in the diet can lead to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins. But if taken in excess these can be harmful to the body as these cannot be excreted easily. Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin B complex and the vitamin C. Excess intake is excreted in the urine. Because our bodies can’t store these vitamins, we need to take them regularly. The important minerals required by our body during different stages of life are calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium. A healthy balanced diet normally provides all these minerals in sufficient amount. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of various vitamins and minerals are far more than the actual requirements of our body. Because while calculating the RDAs, it is assumed that only a small percentage is actually absorbed from the food we eat. So we should make sure that our vitamin and mineral needs are met by making conditions favourable for maximum absorption of these vitamins and minerals by our digestive system. This way we can meet our daily needs by having lesser amount of these nutrients. The absorption can be maximised in the following way

Deworming

Parasitic infestations in the gastro-intestinal tract hinders the absorption of these nutrients. Even adults can have these infestations if they tend to eat out a lot because the food handlers or cooks could be the carriers. Hence, regular deworming is the must

Avoid wrong food combinations

Avoid eating palak and paneer together as the oxalate from palak combines with the calcium from paneer inhibiting calcium absorption from the gut. Do not drink tea or coffee with meals as the tannins present in both the tea and the coffee inhibit the absorption of iron from the food. Do not eat fruits along with the meals. The best time to eat fruits is on an empty stomach in morning, or as a snack between breakfast and lunch. This will ensure that all vitamins and minerals present in the food are fully absorbed. Do not drink water with meals as it dilutes the enzymes in the mouth and digestive tracks leading to in incomplete digestion and absorption of food.

Eating the right combinations

Lemon juice is a good source of vitamin C and should be taken with iron-rich foods such as spinach, quinoa, chia seeds, lentils, oatmeal and soybeans. Sulphur-rich foods like garlic and onion should always be added while cooking mutton, chicken because sulphur helps in the absorption of zinc and iron present in these foods.

Soaking and sprouting

Soaking and sprouting of cereals and pulses increases their vitamin C and B complex content and bioavailability. Eat probiotic and prebiotic foods To keep your gut healthy you need to maintain a healthy micro flora in your gut. Add the following foods in your diet which help to increase the healthy bacteria in your gut. These are prebiotic foods like banana, pineapple, garlic, onion, cucumber and flax seed. Probiotic foods like curd and yoghurt should also be added. Health and wellness is something which we all desire. Most people look for an easy way to attain it. The internet is flooded with information regarding the extra-ordinary role of some vitamins and minerals in achieving health and wellness. While the information may be true but it may not cater to individual needs. Since vitamins and mineral supplements are available over the counter and are considered relatively harmless without any side effects, more and more people fall prey to self medication with these supplements. However, these should always be taken under medical guidance and according to the specific needs of a particular person. The bottom line is that these supplements may be good for you but they do not substitute a balanced diet. Never start any such supplementation without consulting your doctor and in any case eating a healthy balanced diet is of utmost important.

"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","WASHINGTON:Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims.

Washington, August 22

Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims.

Scientists from Duke University in the US have discovered that a gene variant which affects cholesterol levels could increase the risk of contracting typhoid fever.

They also showed that a common cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) could protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the nasty infection.

The findings, which appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease.

They also point to possible avenues to protect those who are most vulnerable to pathogens - like the Salmonella bacteria - that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells.

""We need to try this approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before we can consider taking this into the clinic,"" said Dennis C Ko, assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine.

""What is so exciting is that our study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,"" Ko said.

Ko and his team used hundreds of cell lines from healthy human volunteers and exposed them to the exact dose of Salmonella Typhi, which had been tagged with a green fluorescent marker.

They then looked for genetic differences that distinguished cells that had higher rates of bacterial invasion from those that did not.

The researchers found that a single nucleotide of DNA in a gene called VAC14 was associated with the level of bacterial invasion in cells.

When they knocked out the gene, the cells were invaded more readily and more of the cells glowed brightly with green bacteria.

They also unexpectedly found that those more susceptible cells had higher levels of cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes that Salmonella binds to invade host cells.

Researchers tested DNA from subjects in a group of 1,000 Vietnamese people, half of whom had typhoid fever and half did not.

They found that the VAC14 gene variant was associated with a moderately elevated risk of typhoid fever.

""Discovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins for high cholesterol,"" said Ko.

""We wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,"" he said.

Monica Alvarez, a graduate student in Ko's lab and lead author on the study, added a cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) to their water and then injected the fish with Salmonella Typhi.

She found that the treated animals were more likely to clear the bacteria out of their system and survive. — PTI"

Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar have always been up for different cinema. With their upcoming movie Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, they go a notch higher in terms of creative freedom

Mona

Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar’s latest film Shubh Mangal Saavdhan touches a taboo subject (sexual disorder), something that both these actors have done before — Ayushmann with Vicky Donor and Bhumi with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. The talented stars talk about the movie and more.

What made you say yes to Shubh Mangal Saavdhan?

Ayushmann: It’s a love story about Mudit Sharma and Sugandha, and touches a taboo subject; reading the script I jumped up to play this urban guy.

Bhumi: I have an affinity for different kind of films. And, it has been by far the funniest script I have come across; I was down on the floor rolling in laughter listening to this one.

It hardly seems like a subject for a family movie, were you apprehensive?

Ayushmann: It is important to know who is backing the film. With Anand L Rai backing the film, one would know that it’s not going overboard selling the edginess of the subject.

BHuMI: It’s a family entertainer that at no point makes fun of the protagonist’s problem; it finds a solution.

Before signing the film, did you take your family into consideration?

Ayushmann: My wife reads all my scripts anyway. She read this one too and liked the way it touched a subject people tend to brush under the carpet. We both are artistes, so it was good.

Bhumi: After me, my mother is the first one to read the scripts. She found the story entertaining and educative, and gave a happy go-ahead.

It’s your second film together. Given the theme, was there any awkwardness?

Ayushmann: Bhumi is a dear friend and we talk about anything under the sun. And working with a progressive friend and a dedicated actor, this was no issue.

Bhumi: I am very good friends with Ayushmann, so we share a certain comfort level. He is such an inspiring actor and working with him is always a delight.

Censor Board till very recently had a conservative approach towards issues, were you anxious about your film hitting trouble?

Ayushmann: No. We were sure of our content. With Prasoon Ji and Vidya Ji, it was not any trouble at all.

Bhumi: No. Ours is a funny romcom that you can see with a 10-year-old!

You think Indian audiences, fed on the dose of commercial cinema, is ready for such subjects as yet?

Ayushmann: Definitely. My first was lapped up by the audience despite it touching another taboo subject. People are up for different content, which is huge victory for all of us.

Bhumi: I am 100 per cent sure. There have been enough of commercial plots; audiences enjoy different and meaningful cinema today, and I feel fortunate to be part of it.

What next for you?

Ayushmann: First, I am hoping that Shubh Mangal Saavdhan gets the same love as I have been getting for Bareilly Ki Barfi, and Bhumi has also been enjoying with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. Next, I am shooting a thriller with Sriram Raghavan, which is tentatively called Shoot the Piano Player.

Bhumi: There have been some very interesting line-ups, but ethically I would like the senior actors to speak up about them before I do.

Breast milk may fight bacterial infections in babies,"NEW YORK: Breast milk has protective sugars that could provide a one-two punch against deadly bacterial infections in babies, according to a study which may lead to new antimicrobial drugs.

Researchers at Vanderbuilt University in the US found that some of the carbohydrates in human milk not only possess antibacterial properties of their own but also enhance the effectiveness of the antibacterial proteins also present.

“This is the first example of generalised, antimicrobial activity on the part of the carbohydrates in human milk,” said Steven Townsend, assistant professor at the Vanderbilt University in the US.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.

“In most women, the group B strep that is present will not cause illness. But for newborn babies, a GBS infection often leads to sepsis or pneumonia, and in severe cases death, because they do not have fully developed defence mechanisms,” Townsend said.

Researchers, instead of searching for proteins in human milk with antimicrobial properties, looked at the sugars. They collected human milk carbohydrates, also called oligosaccharides, from a number of different donor samples and profiled them.

The team then added the compounds to strep cultures and observed the result under the microscope.

This showed that not only do some of these oligosaccharides kill the bacteria directly but some also physically break down the biofilms that the bacteria form to protect themselves.

Researchers found that the sugars from one sample nearly killed an entire strep colony. In another sample, the sugars were moderately effective while the remaining three samples exhibited a lower level of activity.

In a follow-up study, they are testing more than two dozen additional samples.

So far, two broke down the bacterial biofilms and killed the bacteria, four broke down the biofilms but did not kill the bacteria and two killed the bacteria without breaking down the biofilms, researchers said.

“Our results show that these sugars have a one-two punch.

""First, they sensitise the target bacteria and then they kill them. Biologist sometimes calls this ‘synthetic lethality’ and there is a major push to develop new antimicrobial drugs with this capability,” said Townsend.

The study was published in the journal ACS Infectious Diseases. PTI"
Iceland in a nutshell,"The landscapes, seascapes, lava fields, glacier and hiking trails of Snaefellsnes Peninsula make it worth exploring

Kanika Kalia

There is no doubt that Iceland is one of the most beautiful and traveller-friendly destinations in the world. Its dynamic landscape, mystery of geysers, legends of Vikings and beauty of northern lights has captivated travellers for years now. While most people visiting Iceland straightway shoot to the Golden Circle and south Iceland, the Snaefellsnes peninsula in west Iceland is truly a hidden gem just waiting to be explored. Why Snæfellsnes? Well for starters, it is a true testament to Iceland’s dynamic nature. It has almost everything that Iceland has to offer: breathtaking landscapes, alluring seascapes, lava fields, glacier, abandoned farms, and great hiking trails. No surprise that it’s often called ‘Iceland in a nutshell’. It makes for a great destination for a day trip (and even multiple if you have time). This is a much-less visited corner of Iceland compared to the typical touristy areas of the South Coast, and that being said, you will have some areas exclusive to yourself. Now, of course, in winters trying to explore this whole area in a day is literally like racing against the time. But if you have made up your mind and set off for a day of exploring, these tips will help you in planning.

Rent a car at the airport in Keflavík. This is the most convenient way of exploring the area. Though there are some tour companies that offer day trips to Snaefellsnes Peninsula , it will be best to drive it by yourself and do it at your own pace.

Depending on the number of days you intend to spend, base yourself out of Reykjavik.

According to google maps, the entire loop starting and ending at Reykjavik is almost about 500 km and takes six hours if you drive non-stop. But since there are so many scenic viewpoints and you are bound to make frequent stops, it will easily take 10-12 hours to explore the peninsular region.

For all you winter explorers, start your day early so that you may cover maximum in daylight.

There are not many restaurants in this area, so do not forget to pack lunch.

Fill your gas tank as and when you see a gas station. In winters, not all gas stations are open and you may not find one for hours.

Make sure you keep an eye on the weather and road conditions.

If you take the route via Hvalfjordur bay, you will have to pay the toll 100ISK. You can pay by card or in cash.

Things to see:

You can drive through Snaefellsnes Peninsula starting from Reykjavik in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, provided you reach the Kirkjufell mountain before sunset to enjoy a gem of the view. For this sole reason, it is recommended to drive anti-clockwise in winters. But Kirkjufell is not the only thing to see in this area. Here is list of stoppages you can make in your journey.

Mt. Helgafell: An easy 15-20 minute hike up Mt. Helgafell will reward you with a beautiful view. Legend says if you hike up Mt Helgafell keeping mum and not looking back, your three wishes come true. Definitely worth a try.

Eldborg volcanic caldera: A dirt road from the highway will take you to the closest parking spot near the crater. From there, it is about 15 to 20 minutes hike up.

Gerðuberg Basalt Columns: The beautiful hill gives an illusion of being on the sets of Game of Thrones. These basalt columns are nature’s masterpiece and give an illusion of castle’s fortification.

Bjarnarhöfn Shark Museum: This museum is not like any ordinary museum at all. What makes it unique? Well coupled with randomness and shabby appearance, this place will tell you about an intriguing Icelandic snack, fermented shark, called hákarl. Of course, you can’t leave the place without trying this peculiar delicacy.

Berserkjahraun (Lava field): While driving on Route 54, you will see lava field on both sides of the road. The landscape is breathtaking. To enjoy the beauty of these lava fields, you have two options. You can park your car somewhere near Berserkjahraunvegur road and go for a long walk. Or you can take a dirt road and explore it by car. If you do it by car, make sure your car has good tyres.

Vatnshellir: The 8000-year-old volcanic cave is bound to leave you speechless. There is only one way to explore this cave, and that is taking a group tour. In winters, this place often gets closed.

Kolgrafarfjördur Fjord: This fjord is known for the maximum concentration of marine life. In year 2003-4, there had been an incident of mass death of marine life in this fjord because of lack of oxygen and since then, it has been a popular stop for visitors. The area is beautiful and definitely worth spending some time and taking beautiful pictures.

Kirkujafell Mountain: The Kirkujafell Mountain is the climax of journey of Snaefellsnes Peninsula. It is the most photographed mountain of Iceland. When you reach this spot, you will understand God’s perfect set up: waterfall, mountain, sea — all in one sight. And if you are lucky, you will also find Icelandic horses running in the barn. Keep in mind that parking lot is small at this spot, so it does take some amount of waiting as this place remains crowded. For photographers, you will have to be in line to get the chance to photograph the mountain from the perfect angle."
Soldiering on to Everest,"BOOK REVIEW: NORTON OF EVEREST: THE BIOGRAPHY OF E.F. NORTON, SOLDIER AND MOUNTAINEER

Lt-Gen Baljit Singh (retd)

“They were men, the likes of which we will never know again...... collect butterflies in the dawn, paint watercolours in late morning, discuss Keats and Shelley over lunch and still be prepared to assault the flanks of Everest or indeed the German frontlines, by dusk”. — Dave Wade in the Foreword. The biographer observes that “it was a statistical miracle” for Edward Felix Norton (EFN) to have survived World War I. But even EFN’s climb to the highest on Everest in 1922, even higher in 1924 and his advice to Col John Hunt that culminated in summiting the Everest, an year before his demise, was equally miraculous. EFN’s military career began after graduating from the Military Academy, Woolwich, and posting to the R Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) at Meerut, in 1902. For most part of the next 10 years, he would professionally profit immensely from the Indian Army’s frequent skirmishes with the North West Frontier tribes along the restive Durand Line. A year later, Major Norton would graduate from the Staff College, Camberley , and proceed to France to lead his R Battery, RHA, from the very first battle at Aisne in 1914 on to Marne, Ypres, Loos, Cambrai, Somme, Arras and onward to the last German spring offensive of 1918. His unflagging performance found recognition through conferment of the DSO, an MC and Mentioned in Dispatches for gallantry, thrice. After World War I ended, it was a natural choice to post EFN to the Staff College, as an instructor till 1921. Sometime in February-March 1922, EFN set sail for India once again, but this time as a climbing member of the First British Everest Expedition. On May 19, 1922, George Mallory, Howard Sommervell and EFN reached 26,985 feet height when bad weather forced a retreat. The British returned to the Everest in 1924 and EFN would assume leadership from the ailing Brigadier Bruce. The second attempt by this expedition was launched by EFN and Sommervell on June 4, 1924. Unfortunately, Sommervell’s choking cough so incapacitated him that placing him under the shelter of a rock-spur, EFN proceeded on an incredible solo climb of Everest. EFN’s record of getting to 28,126 ft, without the use of oxygen, wouldn’t be bettered till 1978. But even in Everest fall-out, there was a personal gain for was EFN — his marriage with Joyce, daughter of William Pasteur, a well-known physician throughout Europe and a house-hold name among Alpine climbers. Outside his family, there was not a word about EFN as a talented painter. The world learnt from Joyce during the Alpine Club dinner only in 1991 that EFN had carried a small sketch book on each Everest expedition and executed a few hundred, on-the-spot paintings. Shortly prior to Pearl Harbour, EFN was appointed Lieut Governor and C-in-C, Hongkong, where he earned fresh laurels but had an accidental, near fatal fall which necessitated his evacuation to India. He recouped sufficiently but retired on health grounds in 1942, with the acting rank of a Lieut Gen. Back in England, he would now gracefully oversee the affairs of his beloved R H A, as their Colonel Commandant from 1947 to 1951. The life story of this impressive and intriguing man, Norton of Everest, makes for an engrossing read."

""We are going to initiate efforts to bring in a new Chief Minister with the help of our supporting MLAs,"" Dhinakaran supporter and Andipatti MLA Thanga Tamil Selvan told reporters following a meeting with Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, a day after the patch-up between the camps led by Palaniswami and rebel leader Panneerselvam.

The Dhinakaran camp had on Tuesday claimed the support of 25 AIADMK MLAs.

Raj Bhavan sources confirmed that the meeting took place this morning, but did not divulge details, including the number of members in the delegation and the nature of their interaction with Rao.

""We have informed the Governor that we don't have confidence in the Chief Minister,"" Selvan said after the MLAs owing allegiance to Dhinakaran, nephew of jailed AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, met Rao.

Of the 234-member Assembly, the AIADMK has 134 MLAs, excluding the Speaker. Late chief minister Jayalalithaa's RK Nagar constituency is still vacant.

The DMK has 89 seats followed by its allies Congress eight and IUML one seat.

Seeking to capitalise on the developments, principal opposition DMK shot off a letter to the Governor asking him to convene the assembly and direct Palaniswami to prove his majority in the House.

Asked about the possibility of the Palaniswami government facing a trust vote, Selvan said that was ""our intention"".

""Our intention is that there should be a trust vote. So after that a new Chief Minister will be in place,"" he claimed.

MLAs supporting Dhinakaran have been on a warpath against Palaniswami, questioning the merger of the Amma faction-led by him and Panneerselvam's Puratchi Thalaivi Amma faction on Tuesday.

Selvan criticised Palaniswami for aligning with Panneerselvam, who had been critical of the government till very recently.

""The 122 (AIADMK) MLAs had made Palaniswami Chief Minister because Chinnamma (Sasikala) asked us to do so. Panneerselvam had voted against the government (in the February 18 trust vote).”

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""He (Panneerselvam) wanted to split the party and topple the government. Yet you (Palaniswami) gave the Deputy Chief Minister's post to him. What is the need for that now?"" Selvan asked.

He also expressed anguish over efforts to remove Sasikala from the party, saying it was she who ensured the continuation of the AIADMK government following Panneerselvam's revolt in February last.

Meanwhile, Palaniswami went into a huddle with his Deputy O Panneerselvam and some senior ministers following the development.

Further, reports also claimed MLAs supporting Dhinakaran were being taken to an undisclosed location.

In a related development, Dhinakaran announced the removal of senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP R Vaithilingam from the primary membership of the party.

The move came a day after Vaithilingam, a loyalist of Palaniswami, said steps would be taken for the removal of Sasikala from the AIADMK.

Earlier, in his reaction to the merger, Dhinakaran dubbed it as a ""betrayal"" of party general secretary Sasikala.

In a series of tweets last night, he also questioned the durability of the arrangement.

""It is not a merger. It is a commercial agreement reached for self-interest and hunger for positions and to protect posts,"" Dhinakaran charged.

He also claimed that not only the AIADMK cadres, but even the public would not forgive ""those who betrayed the general secretary who made Pannerselvam and Palaniswami the chief ministers after the death of Jayalalithaa"".

His tweets came hours after the factions merged and Panneerselvam, who had challenged Sasikala's leadership, was appointed the deputy chief minister and his close aide K Pandiarajan a minister.

Responding to Dhinakaran's loyalist MLAs meeting the Governor, opposition parties including DMK, said Palaniswami should now prove his majority.

DMK Working President and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly M K Stalin in a letter to Rao claimed: ""Consequent upon identical letters given by 22 MLAs to the Governor expressing lack of confidence on the chief minister, an unprecedented constitutional crisis has erupted"".

The DMK leader said, as a result of the letters given by MLAs, the incumbent government led by Palaniswami has ""lost"" its majority.

He said in a similar previous occasion in Karnataka, the Governor of that state had directed then Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa to prove his majority in the House.

Any inordinate delay in asking the chief minister to prove majority would pave the way for continuance of an ""unconstitutional"" government, he said in the letter, a copy of which was circulated to the media here.

""As the leader of Opposition, I, therefore, request the Governor to direct Palaniswami to prove his majority in the House immediately,"" Stalin said.

The DMK will take a ""good decision"" on the trust vote at an appropriate time, he later told reporters.

PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss also said that following the revolt of MLAs the Palaniswami government should prove its majority. PTI"
"For ‘ghar ghar naukri’, govt banking on private sector","Launches job fests across state, targets 50,000 placements

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 21

Banking on private universities and colleges in the state, the Congress government today declared to fulfil its poll promise of “ghar ghar naukari” by kickstarting an 11-day statewide mega job fair, beginning today from the campus of Chandigarh University at Gharuan near here. Coming to the rescue to the fund-starved government, the educational institutions, which otherwise annually organise job fest for their students as part of their academic exercise, are now providing their infrastructure and resources to the government to implement its flagship employment campaign. The Capt Amarinder Singh government has announced to handover appointment letters to 50,000 youths selected at the job fairs in the first phase. However, nearly 4 lakh jobseekers have already registered on the government portal of “ghar ghar naukari”. Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who today inaugurated the first in the series of statewide job fairs at Chandigarh University, defended the government move saying the job fairs by private institutions were not up the mark and there was generally lack of confidence among the students. But now the government in a first-of-its-kind initiative is actively engaged as a facilitator between the private companies, educational institutions and students in organising the mega job fairs. “Never have 832 companies, 21 venues and 50,000 students were brought on one platform,” said the minister. He said the government was setting up a research centre for upgrading syllabus of technical education and industrial training. Experts from the field of industry and technical education would be part of the panel to make syllabus of the ITIs and technical education as per the present and future needs of the industry. Every three years, the syllabus would be reviewed and upgraded in consultation with experts. Satnam Singh Sandhu, Chancellor, Chandigarh University, said the job fest would go a long way in building confidence among all stakeholders.

Focus on soft skills

The government is reportedly contemplating to invest in soft skill development of unemployed youths, instead of paying Rs2,500 per month as allowance for a period of up to 36 months under the “ghar ghar naukari” campaign. As per official estimates there are over 20 lakh youths and a huge amount was required for unemployment allowance. By spending on soft skill training courses, the youths could be gainfully employed. An announcement in this regard is expected soon."

Blue plaque for first black actor,"Shakespearean theatre manager Ira Aldridge was honoured 150 years after his death

Chantal Da Silva

Britain’s first black Shakespearean actor has been honoured with the unveiling of a blue plaque in Coventry. Ira Aldridge became manager of the Coventry Theatre in 1828, after impressing the city’s residents with his acting talent on a tour. The actor, who died 150 years ago, put on performances that are believed to have inspired the people of Coventry to petition Parliament to abolish slavery. Aldridge was honoured by the city of Coventry, with the Lord Mayor Tony Skipper unveiling a blue plaque celebrating his legacy as the UK’s first black theatre manager. “It’s very important,” Professor Tony Howard, who leads Warwick University’s Multicultural Shakespeare project. “He’s been admired and respected for a long time as the first black Shakespearean actor, but many people are less aware of the fact that he had also been the first black theatre manager.” The ceremony marked the 150th anniversary of his death and was attended by actor Earl Cameron, who is widely celebrated as one of the first black actors to break the “colour bar” in the UK. Cameron was also trained by Aldridge’s daughter Amanda and was invited as a guest of honour at the plaque unveiling. Aldridge was born in New York in 1807 and worked as an actor in the US until the 1920s when he migrated to England after being brutally beaten in racist attacks. He rose to fame in the UK, managing to break down racial barriers, playing principal roles, including Romeo, Hamlet, Othello and later on, King Lear. The actual theatre that Aldridge managed was demolished long ago, but the permanent memorial will mark the site where it would have stood. “It’s a reminder of the fact that cities come and cities go; they go through periods of strength and depression. That’s why we have to honour those moments, when people do the unexpected,” Professor Howard said. “I think the city is very proud and very happy,” he added. Aldridge has already been honoured with a blue plaque in the London borough of Bromley at a home where he once lived as part of the English Heritage scheme. The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare’s globe will also be honouring the actor with an event called “Against Prejudice: A celebration of Ira Aldridge” on September 19.— The Independent"
Amendments to deal with today’s ills,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

Is it true that the Reserve Bank of India has amended the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to expand its jurisdiction? If so, can you please give some details?

Yes, the 2017 amendment to the Banking Ombudsman scheme has widened the scope of the scheme and brought under the ambit of the Ombudsman, a number of hitherto excluded issues pertaining to the banking operations.

To be more specific, the amendments finally provide for redress of a large number of highly vexatious problems faced by bank customers in recent years such as fraudulent withdrawal of money through electronic banking as well as stolen and cloned debit and credit cards, besides mis-selling of insurance, mutual funds and other investment products. Similarly, the amendments have also brought under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman issues such as erroneous reporting of credit information to the Credit Information Bureau and the failure to rectify such factual inaccuracies. These are all issues on account of which consumers have for long suffered not just financial loss but also harassment and mental anguish. And in the absence of any redress at the ombudsman level, they have had to fight long battles before the consumer court. Finally, consumers can seek resolution of their disputes in these matters through the Ombudsman.

The revised ombudsman scheme, which came into effect from July 1 this year, includes in the list of ‘Grounds for complaint’, non-adherence to the instructions of the Reserve Bank vis-à-vis mobile banking/electronic banking services in respect of delay or failure to effect online payment or fund transfer and unauthorised electronic payment/fund transfer . Similarly, one can complain against banks for sale of unsuitable, improper financial products such as insurance and mutual funds, besides lack of transparency in such sale and delay in facilitating after sales service.

Another positive change brought about in the Ombudsman Scheme is the provision to award compensation for harassment and mental anguish, besides loss of the complainant’s time and other expenses, up to a limit of Rs 1 lakh. Despite the low limit, I really welcome this because earlier the Scheme provided for such compensation only in cases of credit card operations. So, extending this to all complaints is really good. Second, the compensation awarded for any loss suffered as a direct consequence of the bank’s omission or commission (or the pecuniary jurisdiction to pass an award) has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to 20 lakh.

Are there any pre-conditions that one must remember while filing a complaint before the Ombudsman?

One of the most important conditions is the requirement of the complainant going to the Ombudsman only after exhausting the complaint redress system available with the bank. The Scheme requires the complainant to first write to the bank (preferably the nodal officer) and approach the ombudsman only if there is no response within a month or if the response is not satisfactory. Consumers must remember this because a number of cases before the Ombudsmen are rejected for this reason.

Otherwise, filing a complaint before the Ombudsman is easy — you can even send it electronically. You do not need any lawyer and the process of resolution of the complaint is very simple. First and foremost, the Ombudsman will try to promote a settlement through conciliation or mediation between the parties and if it is agreeable to the complainant, will pass an order. If not, the Ombudsman will pass an award after giving both the parties an opportunity to present their case. One can also file an appeal against the order of the Ombudsman before the Appellate Authority.

The complaint has to be filed before the Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the bank branch concerned is situated. However, in case of credit card and other types of services with centralised operations, a complaint can be filed before the Ombudsman under whose territorial jurisdiction the billing address of the complainant is located. You can get the details of the scheme as well as the addresses of the 20 Ombudsmen in the country from the website of the Reserve Bank of India."
“A play has repeat value if the subject is relevant”,"If you have been wondering who goes to theatre in the age of digital entertainment, there are plays that have been running for decades now

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

At a time when cinema has a turnover of millions, television shows have been running for years, actors and producers are raking in the moolah, including new entrants on social media, yet in all this theatre, the world’s first form of entertainment, has been chugging along. It neither has the money, the visibility nor the fame. But actors of every genre swear by it.

“That is because there is an audience which realises the thrill of live theatre. Any live event becomes more humane due to the ‘human error factor’ and that adds to the thrill,” declares Nitish Bhardwaj, once again performing the role of Lord Krishna in the currently running play Chakravyuha, which has completed more than 65 shows. His first role as Lord Krishna in B. R. Chopra-produced TV serial Mahabharata (1988) immortalised him.

“There is human touch and a live audience! Even the long-running plays have something new happening in every show. This is what keeps the adrenalin pumping”, says Jayati Bhatia, who has acted in television series like Sasural Simar Ka, Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki, Jassi Jaise Koi Nahin and theatre shows like Vagina Monologues, Blame it on Yashraj, Mahatma Vs Gandhi for more than two decades now.

A well-written and well-directed play often gets a full house and has a tremendous repeat value. The longest-running play in the world, Mousetrap, is written by English crime novelist and playwriter Dame Agatha Christie. It opened in London’s West End in 1952 and has completed 26,703 shows at its last count!

In India, too, several plays in many regional languages, have completed more than 2,000 to 3,000 shows. Many have been staged for decades with a change of actors and directors. To name a few: in Marathi, we have Ghasiram Kotwal, written by Vijay Tendulkar and directed by Dr Jabbar Patel (1973), Nat Samrat written by V. V. Shirwadkar and acted brilliantly by Dr Shriram Lagoo (1970), Katyar Kaljat Ghusali made famous by the singing and acting of Vasantrao Deshpande (1967). In Kannada, we have Hayavadana by Girish Karnad (1971), Jokumar Swamy (1972) directed by B.V.Karanth, Mukhya Mantri (play adapted by Ranjit Kapoor from a 1976 novel by Panchari Sen, translated by TS Lohitshwah (1978). In English, we have Dance Like A Man directed by Lillete Dubey (more than 550 shows), Hamlet the Crown Prince directed by Rajat Kapoor (more than 200 shows in Mumbai alone), Love Letters was adapted in India (1993) from Pulitzer prize-winning American play by A. R. Gurney. The latest sensation is English play Vagina Monologues, which was first performed in 2003, and even after more than 1000 shows, it runs to a packed house.

“A play has repeat value if the subject is forever relevant”, observes Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal, the woman behind Indian adaption of the iconic Vagina Monolgues (1996) play by Eve Ensler. The popularity of the play and a demand for it to be staged in places where English isn’t the spoken or common language, made them translate it into Hindi as Kissa Yoni Ka.

There are many Hindi plays, especially from IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association) like Bakri (directed by M. S. Sathyu), Ek Mamuli Aadmi (directed by Raman Kumar), Ek Aur Dronacharya (S. Dangyach), Sir Sir Sarla, Ek Kadam Aage (Makarand Deshpande), which have been staged to full house.

Actor Om Katare, founder of the Yatri Theatre group (1979) which has staged more than 5,500 shows of his plays, says, “No one can touch the charm of theatre. If only there were more theatre spaces, our plays could have easily given tough competition to other entertainment bodies.”

Veteran theatre, TV and film actor Aanjjan Srivastav says, lack of space and media coverage is the bane of theatre. “If we get more media coverage, popularity of theatre will increase. It will bring in sponsors, moolah and attract more talent”, he adds."
Landslide blocks Manali road,"Our Correspondent

The Kiratpur-Manali road was blocked this morning due to landslide at Chamukha village near Sundernagar. About four months back, the 8-km stretch of fourlaned road between Pungh to Bhawana was opened to traffic but at many places, the protection walls, raised along the four-lane, had been damaged which had exposed the poor quality of engineering. The traffic has been diverted and the police have been deputed so that least inconvenience was caused to the public. It was further stated that that this patch would not be cleared for a few days as disturbing the spot may result ino more slips in the area. The district administration has given instructions to the National Highways Authority of India to inspect the site to avoid any further damage in the area."
When stalking goes beserk,"GOOD MOTORING

Several things can go wrong on the road. You must know how to counter these

H. Kishie Singh

There was a very unpleasant ‘happening’ in Chandigarh recently: the Varnika episode. However, there are some important lessons to be learnt. The one thing that stands out is that Varnika Kundu is a very brave girl. But what saved the day was the girl’s presence of mind. That is the first lesson. Had Varnika panicked for one moment, the outcome would have been very different. According to media reports, the situation was extreme: two drunken goondas out for fun. Even under such a life threatening situation, Varnika followed a set procedure. The goondas allegedly followed her car and then drove alongside. Frightened and alone, she made all the right moves. She zig-zagged through the sectors — this is called evasive action. She was trying to get on to Madhya Marg when the goondas blocked her way. She reversed and zoomed off. They followed her. When she got to the next traffic light, a goonda got out again, banged on her window and tried to open the door! The police were waiting at the red light and nabbed the man in action. While being chased, she had the presence of mind to call the police. Another lesson learnt. Keep your phone handy, within easy reach. Make sure the last call was to the police before you start driving so you don’t waste time in scrolling. Do this before you start driving. Make sure your seat belt is on. Even if the goonda does manage to open the door and tries to drag you out, the seat belt will defeat his nepharious designs. Here is another very effective safety device. An after sales fitment is a remote open-lock switch. When the car reaches 20 kmph, all four doors lock automatically. Also, worth taking up is the fact that women have a habit of leaving their bags on the seat, where it is easily visible. Better keep it on the floor boards, out of sight. If in full view, the street urchins will not hesitate to open the door at a red light, grab the bag and disappear! A pepper spray is another effective deterrent. It should be instantly available at hand. Speed of action is your weapon. Even if the goonda opens the door or shatters the glass, welcome him with a blast of pepper spray. Blinded and in pain, he will stagger away. This is all the time you need skedaddle. Another deterrent you need is a whistle, easily bought at a children’s store. A shrill blast, continuous or spasmodic, establishes authority. It also alerts people of the danger and draws attention. If you are driving late at night, put it around your neck. Even if you are separated from your cell phone and pepper spray, this will be in easy reach and ready to use. A shrill, ear-splitting shriek from the whistle will stop the goonda in his tracks. The cell phone and pepper spray should be in a secure place. All cars have cubby holes for easy storage. Don’t put them on the passenger seat next to you. Should you have to slam on the brakes, these items will go flying onto the floor boards. If you have to fumble, the goonda will have the upper hand. There are so many things that can go wrong. Think about them and how to counter them. Goondas are bullies. The minute they face resistance, they crumble. Learn from Varnika, girls, and feel proud. Chandigarh has given you a braveheart!

Happy Motoring!"
The Tribune: Science,"TORONTO: People who play contact sports such as football and hockey — that have higher risk of body collisions — are more likely show changes in their brain structure and function, a study has found.

Toronto

People who play contact sports such as football and hockey — that have higher risk of body collisions — are more likely show changes in their brain structure and function, a study has found.

Researchers at St Michael's Hospital in Canada performed preseason brain scans of 65 varsity athletes — 23 from collision sports (with routine, purposeful body-to-body contact), 22 from contact sports (where contact is allowed, but is not an integral part of the game) and 20 from non-contact sports.

They found that the athletes in collision and contact sports had differences in brain structure, function and chemical markers typically associated with brain injury, compared to athletes in non-contact sports.

There is a growing concern about how participation in contact sports may affect the brain, said lead author Nathan Churchill, a post-doctoral fellow in St Michael's Neuroscience Research Programme.

Most of the research in this area has focused on the long-term effects for athletes in collision sports, such as football and ice hockey, where players may be exposed to hundreds of impacts in a single season.

Less is known about the consequences of participating in contact sports where body-to-body contact is permitted, but is not purposeful, such as football, basketball and field hockey.

This study looked at both men and women from a variety of sports, and found progressive differences between the brains of athletes in non-contact, contact and collision sports.

This included differences in the structure of the brain's white matter — the fibre tracts that connect different parts of the brain and allow them to communicate with one another.

Athletes in sports with higher levels of contact also showed signs of reduced communication between brain areas and decreased activity, particularly within areas involved in vision and motor function, compared to those in non-contact sports, such as volleyball.

However, these differences do not reflect significantly impaired day-to-day functioning, said Tom Schweizer, head of the Neuroscience Research Programme.

The study fills an important gap in understanding how contact affects healthy brains, as a step toward better understanding why a small number of athletes in contact sports show negative long-term health consequences.

The findings were published in the journal Frontiers of Neurology. PTI"

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."

Triple Talaq: BJP calls it victory for Muslim women,"Vibha Sharma

Top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and BJP chief Amit Shah, on Tuesday hailed as “historic” the triple talaq verdict, and termed it a victory for Muslim women.

“Today is the beginning of a new era of dignity and equality for Muslim women. The BJP sees it as way forward towards a determined ‘New India’,” Shah said.

“The verdict is not a question of a win or a loss for anyone. It is a victory of the right to equality and basic constitutional rights of Muslim women,” he said, lauding the prime minister and the BJP government for putting before the apex court BJP’s stance, prudently and judiciously.The next step is now expected to be a legislation to give “a concrete definition and form to the Supreme Court verdict”, say party leaders.

Till then the apex court verdict should be considered the law and BJP leaders should “exercise restraint and “not allow it to become a religious or us-versus-them issue,” is the directive from the top leadership.

It wants “dignity and constitutional rights of Muslim women” to remain central to the theme but without the religious undertones.

The BJP is expected to showcase the verdict as a vindication of its stance against a practice that violates the basic principles of gender justice and equality—an add-on to the existing poll plank of development, good governance and “Hindutva”.

However, even as the BJP’s stance is being linked to its attempts to impact 50 per cent of the Muslim community, saffron leaders do not foresee “any magical changes in the saffron party’s existing fortunes” in the community.

“The verdict gives us a moral high ground but to think that it has helped us make immediate inroads in the Muslim community is wrong,” they said on the impact of the triple talaq issue.

“The PM has also supported the issue on multiple occasions. However, it would take another 10 years for a change in attitude of the community. But it will certainly help increase the participation of minorities in the government policies,” say the BJP leaders, who also denied that the triple talaq verdict was a precursor for Uniform Civil Code.

”The triple talaq issue is distinct from the UCC,” they said on the long standing poll plank of the saffron party.

“Judgment of the Hon’ble SC on Triple Talaq is historic. It grants equality to Muslim women and is a powerful measure for women empowerment.”

“The judgment marks the beginning of a new era of pride and equality for Muslim women. The BJP welcomes and respects the expansion of Muslim women’s rights and sees today’s court order as a step towards a determined ‘New India’. It is a historic judgement, and not a question of victory or defeat. It’s an assertion of equal rights for Muslim women and the prevalence of their basic rights under the Constitution.”“The Supreme Court judgment in the triple talaq case undoes the injustice to Muslim women who were victims of a unilateral termination of a matrimonial relationship.The majority view of the Supreme Court is absolutely clear that this instant pronouncement is not fundamental to the religion itself. It is not even an essential aspect of the religion, and therefore it is discriminatory. It compromises the dignity of the women.”"
Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple under investigation: report,"Singapore, August 22

One of Singapore’s oldest Hindu temples is under investigation over suspected criminal offences, a media report said on Tuesday. Commercial Affairs Department is conducting the probe into Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, but it is “inappropriate” to comment further on the investigation, police said. The Commissioner of Charities (COC) also said in a statement that it had been notified of the investigation and had also launched its own inquiry into the temple. “The review identified certain areas of concern with regard to governance and administration, which warrant conducting an inquiry,” Channel News Asia reported citing the statement. The COC added that it would decide on the next course of action after the inquiry. In the meantime, religious activities would not be affected and the temple could continue with its operations and daily services, the COC said, adding that measures would be put in place to ensure the temple is properly managed. The temple at Serangoon Road is a well-known landmark in the Little India area, with about 5,000 devotees on Sundays and is popular among tourists. The temple was set up as a trust and obtained charity status in 1988. The temple, founded by Tamil pioneers in 1835, underwent a two-year-long SGD7-million makeover which was completed in 2014. It is one of 15 places of worship that have been listed for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. PTI"
The Tribune: Movie Reviews,"Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill.

Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment.

The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill.

Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise.

Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man.

Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed.

The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots.

Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

"In old shawl, scent of mother","Sumitra Dabas

Sumitra Dabas

IT was 1990. My husband was posted at Jadan Wali Gali in Jammu and Kashmir, not far from the LoC. It was a non-family Army station. I along with my two school-going children stayed at Jammu in a rented accommodation. Militancy by then had engulfed the entire Valley and Jammu, otherwise a peaceful town, too was badly affected. Despite heavy policing and sizeable presence of the military in and around the city, militants struck at will. Even school buses were being targeted. Every day I anxiously awaited the safe return of my children from school. Fed up with the state of affairs and concerned about their safety, we decided to send our children to a boarding school. There was another reason behind this decision. I was only a matriculate from a Hindi-medium school in my village and wanted my children to study in a good English-medium school. After a long search, we selected Army Public School (APS) at Dagshai in the Shivaliks, which admitted students from Class V onwards. My daughter was in Class VII when she joined the school. Next year, our son was to follow suit, but the 10-year-old was too much of a mumma’s boy and would not agree to stay away from me. With great effort, I convinced him, giving heavy doses of attractions like the school was located in a hill station, number of extra-curricular activities in the school including horse-riding, the thrill of living together with friends, and above all, staying close to his sister. Soon the day arrived when we were to escort him to Dagshai. I packed his belongings. While I was closing his suitcase, he brought an old brown shawl belonging to me and said he wanted to carry it along. I told him that the shawl was wornout, assuring him that “do mahine baad main tumse milne aoungi, tab apne bete ke liye nayi aur khoob achhi shawl laoungi” (when I visit you in two months, I will get you a new shawl). But he was adamant and insisted that he would carry only that shawl. I politely asked him why that particular shawl. His innocent reply truly elevated me to the seventh heaven. “Mumma, is shawl ko aap hamesha odhte ho. Is shawl mein aapki khushboo hai, aapki scent hai. Shaam ko jab mujhe aapki yaad ayegi, tab main ise odh loonga, mujhe lagega ki aap mere paas ho” (the shawl has your smell, whenever I miss you, I will wrap it around me. I will feel you are near me). Tears in my eyes, I hugged him tightly and almost thought of not sending him away. However, I had to suppress my emotions for his good and I did just that. My darling Munna rightfully had his way and carried his priceless treasure along with him. That 10-year-old lad is now a married man and proud father of a baby girl. He is a good father and a loving husband. He is no longer a Mumma’s boy, but certainly is a doting son."
The Java connect,"Pulsating with performances, art and life, the city of Yogyakarta in Indonesia gives you the feel of being in a different era

Akash Mehrotra

An ancient city and the last remaining Sultanate of Indonesia, Yogyakarta has been a cradle of art and culture and for long nurtured the Javanese connection with the outer world. Old ways of life exist side by side with bustling modernity here and the city decorates itself with the symbols of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. From shadow puppetry, the age old extraordinary Buddhist temple of Borobodur and the equally impressive Hindu ones of Prambanan, socially aware graffiti on the wall to the beautifully styled Batik designs; Yogyakarta, Indonesia’s second most visited spot, is a cultural palette on display.

The city comes as a huge relief from the urbane madness of Jakarta; narrow roads lined with trees, old buildings wearing a colonial touch, shops styled as pagodas, alleys lined with themed restaurants, art cafes often buzzing with some performances, random music bands performing on streets, endless boards advertising batik designing lessons, and strangers wearing a gracious smile; Yogyakarta gives you a feeling of being in a different era.

The city is always throbbing with performances, mostly unannounced. An art gallery will host a performer or a dance troupe visiting the city performing an ancient myth, puppetry shows in some random corner around the Sultan’s palace, rappers set up on a plaza, some impromptu performance in some coffee shop or even private homes inviting strangers for a local gamelan performance; festivals can pop up in any corner.

And as you remain on the lookout for the art scenes, don’t miss to do what all travel blogs tell you. Yogyakarta is a Unesco heritage site for its old temples and its age-old puppetry tradition. Put these in your ‘must-do’ list and then proceed. Start off your day with the Krotan Palace, snaking your way through the alleys of the old town, an area owned by the Sultan. The palace stands like a happy collision between the conformist and the iconoclastic. Perhaps, the most captivating, the Gamelan music, an ensemble of bronze percussion instruments, including gongs, xylophones and drums, often combined with string and wind instruments as well as vocals, can be experienced regularly throughout the week.

At a stone’s throw is the water castle. At a walkable distance from there, through the narrow alleys, housing some painters, designers and artists is the underground masque.

Cut to evening and brace yourself for some more artesia. In the north of the airport stands another emblem of Yogyakarta cultural heritage — the Prambanan temple. The towering temples with spires and spectacularly sculpted walls are a treat to watch. The temple also serves a backdrop of the Ramayana ballet, a spectacular staging of the South Asian Hindu epic, in a dance drama form, with firelights, extravagant costumes, gamelan orchestra, grandeur and an adroit mastery in story-telling. The town seems to have grown up with the Ramayana tales, no wonder many kids (including Muslim kids) have been named after characters of The Ramayana.

The Borobodur Temple

Ditch that urge to lie in late and take an hour-long drive past the enchanting countryside to the Borobodur temple, the largest Buddhist temple excavated in the early 19th century by the then British king of Indonesia, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Sitting atop a hill, surrounded by volcanoes, Borobodur haunts with its striking architectural beauty. A colossal 30 metre-high step pyramid, housing some 500 Buddha sculptures perched around and lower terraces built as balustrades with countless sculptures from Buddha’s life and teachings, the temple is a sight to behold.

In the early 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of the site and ordered its excavation. Even though one can find enough cues of this decay in the temple, Borobodur stands as a defining architectural piece and attracts hundreds of travellers and art lovers from across the world, for academic revelations and picture perfect moments.

Both Prambanan and Borobodur, give a peep into how elegantly Yogyakarta embraced and nurtured different cultures and religious ideals, which still live in the daily rituals of the common folk in the form of rituals, myths, stories passed on from one generation to other, puppetry shows, music, dance forms or just as symbols hung on doorsteps."
Cong welcomes ban on instant talaq but says no for law,"Aditi TandonTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 22The Congress on Tuesday welcomed the Supreme Court majority order setting aside instant triple talaq but said there's no cause for legal intervention in the matter once the court has spoken its mind. ""The court has today set aside and quashed the practice of instant triple talaq, which was by itself an aberration and adulteration thereby recognising pristine form of religious practice in Islam. We welcome the court order and everyone should respect it"", Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said today.The Congress, however, distanced itself from the court's suggestion to bring a law to ban instant triple talaq saying there's no cause for bringing a law once the court has ruled the practice un-Islamic.""The suggestion of a law is anyway part of the minority judgment led by Chief Justice of India JS Kehar who held instant triple talaq valid and left it to the Parliament to ban it. You can analyse the judgment and will find that the court by majority has banned talaq-e-biddat, which is not sanctioned by either the Quran or the Hadees, which are the sources of Islamic jurisprudence,"" Surjewala argued.Congress sought to differentiate its stand on the matter with that of the BJP saying the BJP was for ban on triple talaq itself while the Congress had always argued against instant form of triple talaq which has no validity in the Qoran, as upheld by the majority SC order today.Politically the Congress refused to see the court order today as a loss of perception to the BJP and said two former ministers in the Congress government argued in the court against instant triple talaq.

Salman Khurshid and Kapil Sibal, both our former ministers, opposed instant triple talaq in the Apex Court during the hearing. ""Our leaders opposed instant triple talaq and that's what the court endorsed,"" Surjewala said.From Shah Bano case to today the Congress appears to have shifted its stand though the party leaders did not admit this."
Green is their kind,"As the pitfalls of global warming and jungles of concrete swarm our planet, some unknown, unsung heroes are quietly working to make our environment and world a little better

Eesha Duggal

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
The Tribune: Jammu & Kashmir news,"JAMMU: Angry over bring forced to follow a dress code, hundreds of students of the Government Women’s College here on Tuesday boycotted their classes and staged protests against the management's ""unnecessary diktats"".

Jammu, August 22

Angry over bring forced to follow a dress code, hundreds of students of the Government Women’s College here on Tuesday boycotted their classes and staged protests against the management's ""unnecessary diktats"".

Shouting slogans and demanding immediate removal of the college principal, they also blocked the main road for nearly an hour soon after the institution opened at 9 am, the police said.

The blockade was removed after district and police officials rushed to the college at Parade, in the heart of the city, and pacified the protesters assuring them of appropriate action within 24 hours if their allegations were found true.

The protest, however, continued through the day despite assurances as the agitators accused the principal and teachers of harassing them on one pretext or the other.

""We are made to sit outside the class as punishment for not following a dress code, like not wearing a proper uniform and making two plaits. The students are deliberately failed in the class tests and even lewd remarks and abusive words are used against them,"" alleged the agitating students.

Additional District Development Commissioner Arum Manhas said the issues of removal of a peon at the main gate of the college and passing of lewd remarks came up during the discussion between the protesting students, the college management and district administration and police official.

""It was decided that the peon who is deployed at the main gate would be immediately removed. As far as the second allegations of passing of lewd remarks, there was no credible evidence, and the students were asked to lodge a written complaint with Sub-divisional Police Officer (North) Varun Jandiyal who was asked to probe the allegations and submit report within 24 hours,"" he said.

Meanwhile, on the allegations of harassment and high-handedness by the college management, Principal Anita Sudan said she had taken several decisions on the recommendations of the parents to ensure discipline in the institute.

""Four of our college girls had gone missing in the recent times and one of them was later recovered from Allahabad.

Parents of the girls regularly visit me and complain that they drop their wards outside the institute in the morning but they do not attend the college.

""I had asked the girls to come in proper uniform and called for strict enforcement of college timing. The students are levelling wild allegations,"" Sudan said.

She said no student had lodged any complaint about misbehaviour or passing of lewd remarks by anyone with her till date.

""When I came today and saw the students protesting, I called them to my chamber and asked them the reason. Some girls claimed that the guard at the main gate allegedly misbehaved with one of the girls but when I called him, they could not identify him,"" she claimed. — PTI"
AAP to hold dharna outside Harsimrat Badal's Delhi residence,"Chandigarh, August 22

Punjab's main opposition party, the AAP, today threatened to stage a dharna outside Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal's residence in Delhi on August 24 to protest against the Centre's decision of extending ""industrial incentives"" to the hill states.

Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly Sukhpal Khaira alleged that ""discriminatory"" concessions to the neighbouring hill states have wrecked havoc upon the industry of Punjab by denying it a level playing field.

Harsimrat Kaur Badal is the Union food processing minister and the wife of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal.

Earlier this month, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that industries in the northeastern and Himalayan states will continue to get tax exemption till March 2027, albeit as refund, under the current GST regime which was rolled out on July 1.

""The Vajpayee government had announced major tax concessions to the hill states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand and others. The said policy of tax holiday to these states, was carried forward by the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government for 10 more years.

""Now the Modi government has decided to extend for another 10 years the tax benefits available to these hill states,"" said Khaira in statement.

The ""anti-industry"" decision of successive central governments has left a devastating effect on small and medium scale industries in Punjab.

""It became very difficult for the manufacturers of the state to compete with their counterparts in these hill states, who are enjoying tax benefits,"" he said.

Opposing the Centre's decision to extend special incentives to the hill states, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had on August 18 said he would pursue Punjab's demand for extending similar incentives to the border areas and 'Kandi' (sub mountainous) belt.

Urging Singh to take a ""bold stand"" on this issue, Khaira said the steel rolling mills and induction furnaces of Mandi Gobindgarh, hosiery industry of Ludhiana, sports and leather industry of Jalandhar and others have been severely affected by the ""erroneous"" policies of the Central governments.

""The agrarian economy of Punjab has already collapsed due to colossal debt burden of over Rs one lakh crore, forcing farmers to commit suicides in large number.

""Instead of bailing out the farmers of the state by giving a package, the Centre has further added a body blow to Punjab by extending tax benefits to hill states for 10 more year,"" he said.

Khaira said AAP MLAs from Punjab, led by him, will hold the dharna outside the official residence of Harsimrat Badal who is a ""signatory to the anti-Punjab decision of the Union Cabinet"". — PTI"

Punjab-cadre IPS officer Jagdale Nilambari Vijay today took over as the first woman Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Union Territory of Chandigarh.

Soon after taking over the charge, the 2008-batch officer said that maintenance of law and order in the city and safety of vulnerable sections, including women, would be her main priority.

Ahead of the verdict in a case involving Dera Sacha Sauda chief, she said elaborate security arrangements were being made to maintain law and order (in the wake of verdict in the case).

The special CBI court in Panchkula will pronounce the judgment in sexual exploitation case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief on August 25.

The Sirsa-headquartered sect head has also been asked to appear in person before the court on the same day.

To a query on crime against women, she said special efforts would be made to ensure safety of vulnerable sections including women.

Chandigarh remained in the news this month in the wake of woman stalking incident.

She also appealed to city residents to cooperate with the police for better police services.

Vijay was earlier presently posted as the commandant- cum-deputy director (indoor) at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Police Academy, Phillaur.

She had served in various districts including Ludhiana, Ropar and Pathankot.

Avoidable negligence,"Avoidable negligence

Railways slipping up on the basics

A casual surfer on the net would not be able to recognise the Indian Railways under Suresh Prabhu: a separate railway budget is history, soon private companies will run slick express trains, line surveys for fast trains are on in every part of India, a gourmet platter is a click away and many stations will take on a glitzy avatar under private ownership. This vision clashes with the ground reality revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India: surveys are not leading to anywhere; there is excreta in food; railway beddings are storehouses of infections; and, as Junaid Khan’s lynching and the Rs 10 lakh theft in Rajdhani Express showed, even a valid traveller feels his safety is compromised. As Prabhu strives to paint the railways in the vivid colours of the free market, the basics are being neglected. The Railway Minister has done well by sending three of the top brass on leave, besides suspending several officers down the line. The audio clip and the tools found at the accident site have made it clear that non-communication between two railway departments allowed an express train barrel over an under-repair track at over 100 kmph with predictable consequences. However, the first reflex action of trying to brush the real cause under the carpet was not encouraging. Before an audio clip emerged to nail the negligence of the staff, the conversation on social media was being pushed into the direction of a sabotage theory, as has been the case with recent accidents. Amidst all the talk of turning around the railways, the angry wall writing in the marshalling yards reflects a workforce in a state of mental agitation. The government has claimed a quantum leap in rail sector infrastructure over the past three years. Its surveys speak of a satisfaction spike in railway services. Mr Prabhu is entitled to get captivated by his drum beat. But for the ordinary person, train travel is still an ordeal, slowly getting expensive, and unsafe in the bargain. The staff and the common travelling public need equal attention along with the overseas purveyors of fancy train sets."
England legend Boycott apologises for ‘unacceptable’ remark,"London, August 22

Controversial England batting legend Geoff Boycott made a grovelling apology on Tuesday for remarking he needed to “black up his face” to get a knighthood at an event last week.

The 76-year-old astonished his audience with his comment during a question and answer session in one of the intervals at last week’s first Test with the West Indies.

Boycott, who played a pivotal role in organising the 1982 England rebel tour of South Africa when sporting links had been cut with the rest of the world because of the apartheid regime, said knighthoods had been bestowed on West Indian cricketers like “confetti”.

“Mine’s been turned down twice. I’d better black me face,” Boycott is reported to have said according to a guest at the event cited by The Daily Mirror.

The guest at the event—which cost £300 ($385, 327 euros) to attend—said the remark though intended as a joke was “crass” and went down like a “lead balloon”.

However, Boycott—who has overcome throat cancer in 2002 to become a popular and outspoken pundit on BBC Radio’s globally renowned Test Match Special—took to Twitter on Tuesday to unreservedly apologise.

“Speaking at an informal gathering I was asked a question and I realise my answer was unacceptable,” he tweeted.

“I meant no offence but what I said was clearly wrong and I apologise unreservedly.

“I have loved West Indian cricket my whole life and have the utmost respect for its players.” West Indies greats like Viv Richards, Garfield Sobers and Curtly Ambrose have been knighted whilst the last England cricketer to be knighted was Ian Botham—no stranger to controversy himself—in 2007.

Boycott has always contended the reason he has not been knighted is because of his conviction in France—firstly in 1996 and confirmed on appeal in 1998 -- for assaulting former girlfriend Margaret Moore.

A durable but unspectacular opening batsman, Boycott played 108 Tests, scoring 8114 runs with 22 centuries at an average of 47.72. — AFP"

The recent heavy rains in Jalandhar and surrounding areas have increased the problems of commuters as huge potholes, along with piles of garbage, have appeared on various roads of the city. These potholes and damaged roads have been posing a big threat of accidents to people.

The road from Namdev Chowk to BMC Chowk in the city, which witnesses heavy traffic everyday, lies in a dilapidated condition. Roads have been damaged at various places like the bus-stand road, Police Lines Road, Pathankot Bypass Road and Railway Station road which need to be repaired urgently.

The sludge on roads is also resulting in the skidding of two-wheelers in various areas, including the Maqsudan flyover.

Praveen Kumar, a commuter, said, “Tall claims of the development by the Congress government have fallen flat with just three rains in the season, as roads have been damaged and potholes appearing at various places. Officials of the MC have become a mute spectator in the matter.”

Residents said the potholes should have been filled by officials concerned immediately after the rain. But as usual, this time also we find ourselves at the receiving end despite paying taxes to the government.”

Another commuter Vishesh Gupta said, “I was travelling through the BMC Chowk with my friend and passing near MBD Mall when our motorcycle lost its balance due to a pothole. We fell on the road and sustained injuries on a hand and knee. The MC officials should take strict action in this regard and fill these potholes immediately as thousands of commuters daily use the road.”

Rajnish Dogra, Municipal Corporation Engineer (B&R), said, “The cost to improve such roads which are in a dilapidated state has been estimated. As the estimated budget has not been passed, the work cannot be done. We will make sure the condition of the roads get improved soon.”

A canvas for fashion,"Installations and scenography are the new buzzwords at fashion shows across the country

Swati Rai

if 29 Rooms, the installation at last year’s New York Fashion Week in Bushwick, is anything to go by, it can safely be presumed that art in high fashion is a globally rising trend. Designed to inspire creativity and, of course, Instagram posts, the 80,000 square foot warehouse saw installations by artists as well as fashion designers, amongst them the likes of Michael Kors. Kors’ concept titled The Sidewalk is Your Runway, had people posing with his famed bags and posting the captures on social media. Fashion and its interpretation have changed over the years. This change reflects itself not just in the colour and texture, but also in the way fashion is presented to people today. Artistic installations and scenography for a fashionably ambient presentation are an off shoot of that. Bold designing steps see couturiers seeking artistic outlet to jazz up the ramp and, in turn, create an immersive experience for the onlooker. While we have had the trend impressing the fashion scene abroad, it is catching up in India too, be it at the last two India Couture Weeks or Lakme Fashion Week. Designers have been successful in creating scenes and vignettes both on and off the ramps. Recently, seven fashion icons — Sabyasachi Mukherji, JJ Valaya, Tarun Tahiliani, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Shantanu & Nikhil, Abraham & Thakore and Narendra Kumar Ahmed — were invited by Godrej India Culture Lab to reflect on the Partition of India through their designs. These were presented in a fashion-meets-art installation at the Lakme Fashion Week and would be permanently housed at The Partition Museum in Amritsar. At the recent ICW, designer Anamika Khanna, in her show entitled Happily Ever After, chose to have a multi-dimensional mannequin theme reflecting various stages in a marital journey — from betrothal to the nuptials. Wide-eyed stationary models brought alive the theme with scenes created to match the outfit and the occasion. An installation is also about a designer’s mind. Also at ICW, Gaurav Gupta brought to the ramp a bit of the fantasy world he inhabits. An esoteric world found itself taking shape and offering the audience a quick mood elevation. The ramp became a barren yet rich moonscape with huge glass blowouts radiating in a purple haze as the show opened. It felt as if one was suspended in the bubble for a moment. In his own words: “I added a new dimension to a mythological forest by creating a floating space in between. It sort of mirrored the fantasy space in my head, which I inhabit most of the time. There was foliage in glass on the 10 installations, measuring between 7 and 10 feet, which we created.” A more traditional take was Manav Gangwani’s latest couture collection, India@70. It showcased the god and goddesses of India and meenakari on Patolas and Paithani to reflect different cultural imprints of the country. Big and bold Kathakali masks worn by models accentuated the show. A model perched on the grand staircase of a hotel foyer reflected the Prime Minister’s Make in India campaign, showcasing an intricately designed silhouette of a lion. Sharing his design landscape, Gangwani says, “The fashion industry has evolved over the past few years. We now have so much inspiration around us in India. Monumental structures, cultural diversity and geographical differences have helped me curate this collection… I have taken inspiration from every region of India to create this collection and to give the audience this experience.” FDCI president Sunil Sethi isn’t surprised by the increasing room for art in fashion. “Deep down, all designers think of themselves as artists and this creative force comes out in their collections — be it in the set design or as an installation fashion show.” Still, he feels art is just an embellishment for a fashion show. Designs have to be the real powerhouse. “I feel that the philosophy or the thought process of a designer will remain hidden if the clothes in his/her collection fail to do so. It’s the clothes and not the art work that is important.” While crediting digital technology and advanced projection techniques for the innovation on ramp, he hints at the limited scope of the trend too. “Such scenography has more scope and visibility in couture and not so much in pret,” Sethi says."
