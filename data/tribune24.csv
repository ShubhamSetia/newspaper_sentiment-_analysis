Police must act impartially, independently

Fundamentally right

The deteriorating socio-political environment necessitates reiteration of obvious truths. A criminal is what a criminal does, no matter what his political affiliation. What the Congress asserted earlier, the Shiromani Akali Dal is crying about now — political workers being harassed by the police at the behest of the government of the day. The Congress government set up the Mehtab Singh Gill Commission to examine allegations by Congress supporters of false cases registered against them during the tenure of the SAD-led government. It has found that the allegations were correct in 130 cases out of the 178 it has examined so far. The commission has also recommended compensation for the victims and punishment to erring police officials. Rampant misuse of the police is suggested in 4,200 complaints received by the panel. Gangsterism raised its ugly head in the state during that time, and it is still a challenge. SAD allegations about the mistreatment of their workers, and some politically charged incidents of murder, all are visible reminders that little has changed on the ground... the “good” criminals of yesteryear became “bad” criminals of today and vice versa. Propriety, fairness, and impartiality were given a short shrift in the interest of political expediency. Even as the Chief Minister pursues the findings of the commission to the logical end, he must dwell on the need to change the culture of policing that allowed his party men to be harassed. The saying, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” has a particular importance in a scenario where governance is determined by the natural ebb and flow of political fortunes. The commission’s findings must have a resonance beyond documenting the past and providing relief to victims. They highlight the propensity of the police to use extra-legal means to deliver results that please political masters. A professional force would not act in this manner. The right manner of honouring the findings of Justice Mehtab Singh Gill would be to restore professionalism to the police and insulate the force from political operatives."
When Justice DY Chandrachud overruled his father’s Emergency era verdict,"Satya Prakash

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 24

The Supreme Court’s nine-judge Constitution Bench verdict declaring right to privacy a fundamental right under the Constitution was historic for a unique reason as Justice DY Chandrachud overruled a verdict authored by his father YV Chandrachud in the infamous ADM Jabalpur case during Emergency.

Justice YV Chandrachud, who was part of a five-judge Constitution Bench, had ruled by 4:1 majority on April 28, 1976, that all fundamental rights get suspended during Emergency and individuals did not have a right to approach constitutional courts for protection.

Forty one years on, his son Justice DY Chandrachud overruled the verdict, saying, “The judgments rendered by all the four judges constituting the majority in ADM Jabalpur are seriously flawed.”

Justice Chandrachud was supported by two other judges — Justice RF Nariman and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul — who also overruled ADM Jabalpur verdict.

Much of the problems created by the ADM Jabalpur verdict were corrected by the 44th Constitutional Amendment but the formal overruling can be seen as an attempt by the judiciary to counter criticism for its failure to protect citizens’ fundamental rights during the Emergency.

Justice DY Chandrachud went on to justify the minority verdict delivered by Justice Khanna in the case, saying, “The view taken by Justice Khanna must be accepted, and accepted in reverence for the strength of its thoughts and the courage of its convictions.”

Justice Chandrachud said: “Justice Khanna was clearly right in holding that the recognition of the right to life and personal liberty under the Constitution does not denude the existence of that right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous assumption that in adopting the Constitution the people of India surrendered the most precious aspect of the human persona, namely, life, liberty and freedom to the state on whose mercy these rights would depend.

“Such a construct is contrary to the basic foundation of the rule of law which imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the modern state when it deals with the liberties of the individual. The power of the court to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus is a precious and undeniable feature of the rule of law,” said Justice DY Chandrachud.

He said: “No civilized state can contemplate an encroachment upon life and personal liberty without the authority of law. Neither life nor liberty is bounty conferred by the state nor does the Constitution create these rights. The right to life has existed even before the advent of the Constitution. ""In recognising the right, the Constitution does not become the sole repository of the right. It would be preposterous to suggest that a democratic Constitution without a Bill of Rights would leave individuals governed by the state without either the existence of the right to live or the means of enforcement of the right. The right to life being inalienable to each individual, it existed prior to the Constitution and continued in force under Article 372 of the Constitution.”"
Colours of healing,"Art helps make sense of suffering. This therapy is coming to the rescue of children undergoing behavioural issues

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."

"The Tribune: Delhi, NCR news","NEW DELHI:The enthusiasm among the residents of Bawana Assembly constituency appears to have received a beating if the voters’ turnout for the seat—which saw a decline from 2015 Delhi Assembly elections’ 61.83 per cent to 45 per cent—is anything to go by. The voting began at 8 am and progressed at a slow pace in the first few hours and rose to 24.39 per cent even after five hours of voting at 1 am, said officials.

New Delhi, August 23

The enthusiasm among the residents of Bawana Assembly constituency appears to have received a beating if the voters’ turnout for the seat—which saw a decline from 2015 Delhi Assembly elections’ 61.83 per cent to 45 per cent—is anything to go by.

The voting began at 8 am and progressed at a slow pace in the first few hours and rose to 24.39 per cent even after five hours of voting at 1 am, said officials.

Over 2.94 lakh electors were eligible to exercise their franchise in the bypoll carried out through 379 polling stations where EVMs equipped with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) were used.

Glitches were seen in the machines, with polling body confirming the same. As per officials, five ballot units (BU) and control units (CU) each while 34 VVPAT devices were replaced during mock poll while one BU and CU each and 17 VVPATs had to be changed due to error report while polling was under way.

Besides, no untoward incident was reported from the area during the day, said polling officials.

The north-west Delhi seat was expected to have a three-cornered contest between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress even as eight candidates are in the fray in the election.

All three major political parties are eyeing a victory in the bypoll seeing it as an indicator of their political influence. The AAP enjoying an overwhelming majority in the Assembly wants to win the by-election to boost its confidence, especially after successive setbacks in the civic polls, the Rajouri Garden Assembly polls and the Punjab and Goa elections. The AAP has fielded Ram Chander from the constituency

On its side, the saffron party having just four members in the 70-member House hopes to continue its winning streak in the national Capital while the third major contender of the Congress is keen to open its account after being relegated to zero seat in the Assembly.

It has fielded its former three-time MLA from Bawana, Surender Kumar who is contesting against AAP’s Ram Chandra and the BJP’s nominee Ved Prakash, whose resignation as an MLA from Bawana actually led to the bypoll.

Prakash had contested the 2015 Assembly elections on an AAP ticket and left the AAP to join the BJP in March this year. The counting will take place on August 28.

FIR against Hussain

Minister Imran Hussain has been booked for allegedly “issuing” pamphlets seeking votes in the name of religion for the Aam Aadmi Party in the Bawana Assembly bypoll, said a senior police official.

The complaint was filed by the returning officer of the Bawana bypoll. An FIR was registered in connection with the matter yesterday at the Bawana Police Station, said the official.

Therefore, a case has been registered under the relevant sections of the Representation of the People Act and the Indian Penal Code, the police said.

The complainant alleged that ""the pamphlet prima facie makes an appeal to the Muslim residents of Bawana to vote for ‘quom’ (community). In addition to this other objectionable and communal appeal has been made (sic)"".

A BJP delegation, led by its president Manoj Tiwari, today raised the issue with the Chief Election Commissioner, a spokesperson for the party said.

""The delegation demanded action against Hussain for seeking votes in the name of religion,"" said Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta."
Blue plaque for first black actor,"Shakespearean theatre manager Ira Aldridge was honoured 150 years after his death

Chantal Da Silva

Britain’s first black Shakespearean actor has been honoured with the unveiling of a blue plaque in Coventry. Ira Aldridge became manager of the Coventry Theatre in 1828, after impressing the city’s residents with his acting talent on a tour. The actor, who died 150 years ago, put on performances that are believed to have inspired the people of Coventry to petition Parliament to abolish slavery. Aldridge was honoured by the city of Coventry, with the Lord Mayor Tony Skipper unveiling a blue plaque celebrating his legacy as the UK’s first black theatre manager. “It’s very important,” Professor Tony Howard, who leads Warwick University’s Multicultural Shakespeare project. “He’s been admired and respected for a long time as the first black Shakespearean actor, but many people are less aware of the fact that he had also been the first black theatre manager.” The ceremony marked the 150th anniversary of his death and was attended by actor Earl Cameron, who is widely celebrated as one of the first black actors to break the “colour bar” in the UK. Cameron was also trained by Aldridge’s daughter Amanda and was invited as a guest of honour at the plaque unveiling. Aldridge was born in New York in 1807 and worked as an actor in the US until the 1920s when he migrated to England after being brutally beaten in racist attacks. He rose to fame in the UK, managing to break down racial barriers, playing principal roles, including Romeo, Hamlet, Othello and later on, King Lear. The actual theatre that Aldridge managed was demolished long ago, but the permanent memorial will mark the site where it would have stood. “It’s a reminder of the fact that cities come and cities go; they go through periods of strength and depression. That’s why we have to honour those moments, when people do the unexpected,” Professor Howard said. “I think the city is very proud and very happy,” he added. Aldridge has already been honoured with a blue plaque in the London borough of Bromley at a home where he once lived as part of the English Heritage scheme. The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare’s globe will also be honouring the actor with an event called “Against Prejudice: A celebration of Ira Aldridge” on September 19.— The Independent"

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."

Mridula Wattas

Our body needs vitamins to function efficiently. They play important roles in metabolism, immunity and digestion. The vitamins, our bodies need, can be broken down into two groups: fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K rely on fats to be digested. A lack of healthy fats in the diet can lead to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins. But if taken in excess these can be harmful to the body as these cannot be excreted easily. Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin B complex and the vitamin C. Excess intake is excreted in the urine. Because our bodies can’t store these vitamins, we need to take them regularly. The important minerals required by our body during different stages of life are calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium. A healthy balanced diet normally provides all these minerals in sufficient amount. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of various vitamins and minerals are far more than the actual requirements of our body. Because while calculating the RDAs, it is assumed that only a small percentage is actually absorbed from the food we eat. So we should make sure that our vitamin and mineral needs are met by making conditions favourable for maximum absorption of these vitamins and minerals by our digestive system. This way we can meet our daily needs by having lesser amount of these nutrients. The absorption can be maximised in the following way

Deworming

Parasitic infestations in the gastro-intestinal tract hinders the absorption of these nutrients. Even adults can have these infestations if they tend to eat out a lot because the food handlers or cooks could be the carriers. Hence, regular deworming is the must

Avoid wrong food combinations

Avoid eating palak and paneer together as the oxalate from palak combines with the calcium from paneer inhibiting calcium absorption from the gut. Do not drink tea or coffee with meals as the tannins present in both the tea and the coffee inhibit the absorption of iron from the food. Do not eat fruits along with the meals. The best time to eat fruits is on an empty stomach in morning, or as a snack between breakfast and lunch. This will ensure that all vitamins and minerals present in the food are fully absorbed. Do not drink water with meals as it dilutes the enzymes in the mouth and digestive tracks leading to in incomplete digestion and absorption of food.

Eating the right combinations

Lemon juice is a good source of vitamin C and should be taken with iron-rich foods such as spinach, quinoa, chia seeds, lentils, oatmeal and soybeans. Sulphur-rich foods like garlic and onion should always be added while cooking mutton, chicken because sulphur helps in the absorption of zinc and iron present in these foods.

Soaking and sprouting

Soaking and sprouting of cereals and pulses increases their vitamin C and B complex content and bioavailability. Eat probiotic and prebiotic foods To keep your gut healthy you need to maintain a healthy micro flora in your gut. Add the following foods in your diet which help to increase the healthy bacteria in your gut. These are prebiotic foods like banana, pineapple, garlic, onion, cucumber and flax seed. Probiotic foods like curd and yoghurt should also be added. Health and wellness is something which we all desire. Most people look for an easy way to attain it. The internet is flooded with information regarding the extra-ordinary role of some vitamins and minerals in achieving health and wellness. While the information may be true but it may not cater to individual needs. Since vitamins and mineral supplements are available over the counter and are considered relatively harmless without any side effects, more and more people fall prey to self medication with these supplements. However, these should always be taken under medical guidance and according to the specific needs of a particular person. The bottom line is that these supplements may be good for you but they do not substitute a balanced diet. Never start any such supplementation without consulting your doctor and in any case eating a healthy balanced diet is of utmost important.

"Dera verdict tomorrow, full alert in state","Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 23

Ahead of the CBI Special Court’s verdict in a case against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief, Punjab has deployed about 25,000 personnel from the paramilitary forces and the state police. The border with Haryana has been sealed, while the Army has been told to remain prepared to be called at a short notice. Senior Range-level officers of the police held a meeting with Army officers in Bathinda, while Muktsar Deputy Commissioner Sumeet Jarangal sought Army deployment in Gidderbaha, one of the sensitive areas. DGP Suresh Arora, who toured various parts of the state today with DGP (Law and Order) HS Dhillon and DGP (Intelligence) Dinkar Gupta, said the police were on maximum alert. “We have adequate personnel. All wings of the government are working in tandem and the situation is under control.” The police top brass said this was the biggest deployment of security forces in the state in the past decade or so. So far, 85 companies of paramilitary forces out of the 250 requisitioned by the state government have reached Punjab. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 police personnel from VVIP security for posting on field duty to strengthen the security blanket, an official spokesperson said after a meeting attended by Arora, Gupta, Dhillon and others. All schools and colleges in the state would remain closed on August 25. State transport buses will not ply to Haryana that day. Section 144 of the CrPC, banning the assembly of more than four persons in an area, has been imposed across the state. The jail department has segregated inmates who are dera supporters from other prisoners so as to avoid clashes, even as a government spokesperson said the police had seized five walkie-talkies from suspected dera followers. Harcharan Singh, a member of the dera’s state committee, said in Malout: “If the decision comes in our favour, we will celebrate it. But if the court gives an adverse verdict, we have asked the followers to maintain peace as well as law and order. We are holding naam charcha (congregation) here every morning,” he added. Meanwhile, the police and paramilitary forces carried out a flag march in Bathinda today. Bathinda and Mansa districts, which have a sizeable number of dera followers, share their border with Sirsa, the sect headquarters. Forty-two companies of paramilitary forces have been deployed in the seven districts of the Bathinda Zone. IG MS Chhina said all vehicles entering Punjab were being checked. In Mansa, cops carried out a mob-control drill. The 2007 clashes between Sikhs and dera followers had started from this district. In Muktsar, DGP Suresh Arora held a meeting with the civil administration and police officers of Muktsar and Fazilka districts today to review the security arrangements. The respective district administrations have banned the sale of bottled petrol, diesel, acid and other inflammable material. Many fuel station owners have decided to stop the sale of petrol and diesel for the next few days. Arms dealers have been told to suspend operations till further orders.

Illegal mining goes on unchecked,"Officials cite lack of infrastructure, manpower for being unable to prevent it

Arteev Sharma

Tribune News Service

Jammu, August 24

Illegal excavation near major rivers continues unimpeded in Jammu and Kashmir with the mining mafia, having full backing of government officials, finding new ways and means to mine sand, gravel and boulders from riverbeds and river banks in broad daylight. This is happening because the state government could not complete the auction for grant of mining lease or quarry licences last year. Thereafter, it granted a “breathing period” to ensure availability of sand and gravel for construction so that the people do not face any inconvenience. The unabated mining has not only been causing huge loss to the state exchequer but also damaged strategic bridges, caused soil erosion and impacted the course of rivers across the state. “It’s a free-for-all in the Kishenpur area. Hundreds of trucks, tractors and mules strip the riverbeds of mineral wealth daily from the unauctioned sites on the Tawi near Kishenpur. Miners use trucks and tractor-trailers to transport sand and gravel without any fear. We are allowed to transport sand and gravel without issuing mandatory royalty payment receipts,” Deepak Kumar, a tractor owner, said. He added, “In return, we pay officials their share. In this way, officials generate a handsome daily income illegally while the state’s coffers remain empty.” An official of the Geology and Mining Department said, “The mining sector has always been controlled by a powerful and influential lobby. Whenever the department made attempts to keep a check on their activity, the lobby scuttled the move by using political clout.” The official said the illegal and uncontrolled extraction of minerals from the Tawi, Ravi and other rivulets had also been causing damage to basements and superstructures of important bridges. Farooq Ahmad Khan, Director, Geology and Mining Department, admitted that the pilferage and leakage in the existing system while citing lack of infrastructure and manpower as the main reasons for it. “The department had notified new rules in 2016 following the Supreme Court guidelines. We started the auction process but it was stayed by the court. Finally, we have got a green signal from the court for the auction and the process has been initiated. We will be going for the auction at the district-level under the supervision of Deputy Commissioners,” Khan said. “The lack of infrastructure and manpower are the reasons for the leakage in the system. The revenue generated for the government could be in the range of 50 to 60 per cent while there was a possibility of 40 per cent leakage,” he said. The Director said the department provided a “breathing period” to the people after the stay on the auction process to ensure that the people did not face any difficulty. “Till July this year, we generated Rs 20 crore as royalty against the expected annual revenue of Rs 60 crore,” he said. Khan said it was not possible to have a round-the-clock supervision. “The odd-hour movement of trucks and tractor-trailers is another problem for us. We are going for the auction of royalty and the process will be completed by September 30 to ensure a foolproof system,” he added."

Chandigarh, August 24

Coming down heavily on the Haryana government for its apparent inability to maintain law and order in the state ahead of the Dera verdict, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday asked the Centre to forthwith provide forces, including paramilitary force. Asserting that it could initiate action against the Director General of Police in case of the state’s failure to ensure security, the Division Bench of Acting Chief Justice Surinder Singh Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan said it did not want a situation similar to the Jat reservation stir.

The Bench said it also expected “full cooperation” from the Dera. Taking into consideration the sensitivity of the situation, the Bench posted the matter for post-lunch session.

In its detailed order, the Bench directed the Centre through the Home Secretary to provide forces “keeping in view the gravity of the situation”. The Bench asked the Centre to make its own assessment in the matter, while asking Haryana to afford its own estimation and requirement as might be necessary from time to time. Taking a note of CBI standing counsel Sumeet Goel’s submission that its investigating officer, witnesses in the case, and public prosecutor in trial and the High Court were facing threats, the Bench directed Advocate General BR Mahajan to make arrangements to provide protection to them. The Bench also asked Dera counsel SK Garg Narwana and Virat Amarnath to submit in the post-lunch session the steps being taken to defuse the situation. The Bench made the Centre through Home Secretary, the CBI and the Dera parties to a PIL in the matter before calling to the Court Additional Solicitor General Satya Pal Jain. The Bench asked Haryana Additional Advocate General Pawan Girdhar, Satya Pal Jain and advocate Dheeraj Jain to intervene in the matter. Punjab Additional Advocate General PPS Thethi was also requested to assist the court. “The Centre will provide adequate security and force to the state government for maintaining peace and law and order in Panchkula and its surrounding areas forthwith,” the Bench added. A lawyer on Wednesday had moved the High Court for directions to Haryana and its officials to make adequate security arrangements, especially in Panchkula district and surrounding areas, for the expected pronouncement of verdict in the criminal trial against Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh on August 25. Petitioner-advocate Ravinder Singh Dhull had also prayed that the security arrangements might be monitored by the High Court. He claimed that more than 1.5 lakh people had already entered Panchkula district despite prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC."

A tad too sweet,"MOVIE REVIEW: BAREILLY KI BARFI

Nonika Singh

Ever since Anand L Rai invented patakha Tanu, which fit Kangana Ranaut like a glove, there has been a deluge of perky small-town female characters. So, Bitty (Kriti Sanon) of Bareilly Ki Barfi comes as no surprise. This daughter of a sweet shop owner is bold and vivacious, can break into a jig (break dance to be precise) at the slightest turn of music, smokes and drinks and has the courage to tell her suitors that she is no virgin. No wonder she can't find a suitable groom. After all girls like her, few and far between, are a ‘disaster.’

But before she decides to call it quits and run away from home, she stumbles upon a book Bareilly Ki Barfi that best describes a girl just like her with no value judgements attached to her behaviour which others, including her mother, call misdemeanors.

Thus begins her search for the author and director takes us on to the love path where identities are muddled and soon love has three facets, not just the visible Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti. If Kriti is just right for the exuberant Bitty and Khurrana is endearing and exasperating in turns as his character demands, Rajkummar Rao as the third angle and the underdog is brilliant. He gets even better when he transforms into the snazzy confident, almost brash guy. Only if he had some more screen time as well as something more (spoiler alert).

Nevertheless, for a considerable part the director keeps you invested in the story told simply as well as has you nibbling over the key question---who will get the girl? Fleetingly, the film reminds you of those delectable super fresh romances such as Sai Paranjpye’s Katha. But if those films skillfully and subtly delved into complexities and many shades of human nature, here the director decides to play super safe and love story ends the way you so hope and wish it won’t. The conflict resolution is a downer.

Thus Bareilly Ki Barfi, despite the surface gloss of rebellion, turns too sweet. If you like your love stories more sugar than spice be Bareilly’s guest. We would have preferred a sharper climax, the sparkle of which can otherwise be seen interspersed in-between and not just in Javed Akhtar’s witty voice-over that takes you enroute Bareilly ki galiyan, especially the Misra household that is peopled with few but animated characters and competent actors (Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi as parents). Dialogues such as Agar ladkiyan shakal dekhti to desh ke aadhe se zyaada ladke kunwaare hote have a zing. Indeed, Bareilly… has many delightful one-liners and amusing moments but the overall impact is not tantalizing enough to make it a wholesome fare one must bite into. Unless you have a sweet tooth…the saccharine-high barfi will leave you craving for more."

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"

Panchkula, August 24

Convinced that they have an infallible god in Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, his followers, having laid siege to the city and occupying open spaces in swarms for the last three days, are all set for the CBI verdict in the rape case against the dera head.

“We will dance right back to where we came from because truth will prevail and ‘Pitaji’ will be acquitted. If the verdict does not uphold the truth of his innocence, we should not be blamed for how the situation will pan out. The verdict will decide our next step,” says a charged Kamlesh from Mandhar village in Punjab’s Malout.

Women far outnumber men among the followers who have “captured” the shade of every tree in sight and every inch of pavement and open space around the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Sector 3. Lying stretched out on plastic sheets covered with bedsheets, using their bags as pillows, the dera followers are all over the place and the three days of sleeping in the open spaces or pavements has not fatigued them a wee bit

“We have locked our houses, left our young children behind and have come for ‘Pitaji’s’ darshan. We will not tolerate an adverse order of the CBI court. These breaths we take are his alone and we will willingly give these up for him. He can do no wrong. If they want to take him, it will have to be over our bodies,” say Sushma and Kiran Bala of Yamunanagar who reached the city two days back.

As other women nod in unison, a saner group among them says that “Pitaji” has not taught them to respond to injustice with violence. “We don’t even want to hear that the judgment can be adverse. ‘Pitaji’ will be absolved in the case and the lies will be exposed. If the unexpected happens, we will quietly go back,” maintains Rekha from Indrapuri in Ghaziabad, adding that there is no iota of truth in information of followers reaching the city armed with sticks and swords and stones.

As she and her group of women open their bags to show they are carrying only two sets of clothes and some snacks since langar is served, a group of women from Noida, camping under the shade of a tree for the last three days, chip in to express their devotion.

“Guruji does not preach violence. This entire police bandobast is meaningless. We mean no harm to anybody. If our worst fears come true, we will immolate ourselves to free ourselves from the suffering of seeing our god suffer. We have not come here with the intention of creating a ruckus,” says Meera who is indebted to the dera chief for curing her husband and giving him a new life.

Accompanied by her 15-year-old daughter, Simlesh, also from Noida, says her drunkard husband recovered after she started going to the dera in Sirsa. “This is our chance to show our gratitude and we will do so by being his armour,” she emphasises.

Kamlesh Insaan from Ghaziabad, associated with the dera for 20 years, sums up the sentiment among the followers when she says that the judgment will be favourable because when god wills, all winds bring rain. Each follower staunchly believes that his faith will create a verdict of his asking when it is announced tomorrow. Till then, they will wait patiently. Tomorrow is a new day holding untold secrets, she says.

After Rampal, advocate Narwana now bats for Ram Rahim

Chandigarh: When advocate SK Garg Narwana shifted to the Punjab and Haryana High Court more than two decades ago after 12 years of practice in Narwana and Jind, there was no way anyone could tell that high profile controversial cases would soon land up on his desk. A 1982 law graduate from Kurukshetra University, Narwana hit the limelight as he held the brief for Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, former Punjab and Haryana High Court judge Justice Nirmal Yadav, and also for self-styled godman Rampal. He also represented Haryana’s independent MLAs before the Speaker in the anti-defection matter. Narwana also made a name for himself for contesting election petitions. He was appointed Haryana Additional Advocate-General in 2005 and senior standing counsel for the income tax department the next year. He was designated senior advocate in 2012.—TNS

CBI counsel not new to controversial cases

Chandigarh: Harinder Pal Singh Verma (50), CBI counsel in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, is not handling a controversial case for the first time. In past, he had appeared for the CBI in cases like Jaswant Singh Khalra murder in Patiala court, Haryana’s Sarita rape case in Panchkula court etc. Verma, who was appointed a CBI counsel in 2001, did law from Lucknow University in 1991. He says the CBI has submitted all legal evidence available with it against the Dera head in the Special CBI Court in Panchkula.—TNS"

'Finisher' Dhoni shows his composure in Indian win,"Pallekele, August 24

Mahendra Singh Dhoni's oodles of experience in pressure situations came in handy as he successfully anchored a tricky chase, guiding India to a three-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in the second ODI, here today. The former skipper scored a patient unbeaten 45 off 68 balls but more importantly mentored Bhuvneshwar Kumar (53 not out) as they added 100 runs for the eighth wicket to reach the revised victory target of 231 in 44.2 overs under Duckworth- Lewis method. India now take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. This was after unheralded mystery spinner Akila Dananjaya (6/48 in 9 overs) infused life into a series, which has been panned by all and sundry for the lopsided contests starting with the Test matches. India were reduced to 131 for 7 when Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar joined forces. Tbe pitch which looked easy for batting 15 minutes prior to their union, was looking venomous after the Indian batting line-up for the first time in the past one month were asked a few testing questions. Dhoni, whose finishing skills have been put to test in recent times showed that experience worth its weight in gold as he tapped around for singles and doubles. The target being a modest one and the run-rate being under check also helped his cause as his innings only had one boundary. The former skipper soaked in the pressure initially as Bhuvneshwar played a lot of dot balls. However once the partnership crossed 40, the UP criketer showed that he is more than a capable batsmen. Dananjaya was hit for two boundaries in the 40th over by Bhuvneshwar when the match decisively swung in India's favour. It ended in an anti-climax when the winning runs came through a wide delivery. But the match will also be remembered for a 15-minute mayhem that had left the much-vaunted Indian batting in complete tatters. Chasing a revised victory target post rain interruption, India were cruising along with Rohit Sharma (54 off 45 balls) in sublime touch. Alongside man of the moment, Shikhar Dhawan (49 off 50 balls). The duo put on 109 runs for the opening stand before Dananjaya bowled a flipper which saw found Rohit missing a sweep shot. He was adjudged leg-before and the review was wasted. Within four runs, left-arm spinner Milinda Siriwardana got rid of Dhawan to have India 113 for 2. However the drama unfolded in the 18th over when Indian batsmen were simply unable to read Dananjaya's googly. Kedar Jadhav (1) didn't show any footwork as the wrong 'un rifled into middle and leg stump. Within a couple of deliveries, skipper Virat Kohli (4) was deceived by flight as he yorked himself to a googly. KL Rahul's indecisive footwork saw India slump to 119 for 5 by the time the over ended. In his very next over Dananjaya completed his maiden five-for when Hardik Pandya (0) jumped down the track to get stumped. Axar Patel became Dananjaya's sixth victim but got a debatable leg-before decision before Bhuvneshwar joined forces with Dhoni as India were looking down the barrel at 131 for 7. Exactly 100 runs were needed and the duo were up for the task. Earlier, Indian bowlers once again put up an impressive performance to restrict Sri Lanka to 236 for 8. Indian team would rather be disappointed as they had Lanka on the mat at 121 for 5 before a 91-run stand between Milinda Siriwardana (58) and experienced Chamara Kapugedera (40) enabled the home team reach a semblance of respectability. This was after Virat Kohli won his fifth consecutive toss on this tour and opted to field. Put into bat, Niroshan Dickwella (31) and Danushka Gunathilaka (19) made a quick start to their innings. India handed the new ball to Bhuvneshwar Kumar (0-53) and Jasprit Bumrah (4/43). The two openers showed aggressive intent. Bumrah was taken for a few runs in his initial spell as Dickwella hit two sixes off him. Lanka's 50-mark came up in the 9th over but Bumrah had got his revenge when he had Dickwella caught at short midwicket in the 8th over. Kusal Mendis (19) then joined Gunathilaka and put on 29 runs for the 2nd wicket before the latter was stumped off Yuzvendra Chahal (2-43) in the 15th over. It was Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 99th stumping in ODI cricket, equalling Kumar Sangakkara's record albeit in fewer games. Skipper Upul Tharanga (9) then edged a simple outswinger from Hardik Pandya (1-24) to slip in the 16th over. Then Mendis was out leg before sweeping off Chahal in the 24th over as Lanka were reduced to 99/4. It seemed a familiar script as Angelo Mathews (20) too followed back to the dressing room, out LBW to Axar Patel (1- 30) in the 29th over. But Siriwardana and Kapugedara pulled their team out of the hole with a resolute partnership. The duo played within themselves and didn't seem to be in any hurry to score runs, even as they didn't let the scoring rate dip too far. They were helped in that Pandya had to go off in the 28th over as he seemed to have strained his left calf. The all-rounder came back on the field twice, but finally hobbled off in the latter stages of the innings. Kedar Jadhav (0-32) completed his quota of overs. PTI"

With the date of judgment just two days away, about 1.5 lakh Dera Sacha Sauda followers have reached Panchkula. The followers spilled from the Naam Charcha Ghar in Sector 23 into the entire city. They have been sitting in parks, on road dividers, roadsides and along the National Highway-73. On Tuesday night, the followers slept on the road separating Sectors 3 and 21 outside Tau Devi Lal Stadium. In the morning, the passage was blocked. They had to be moved to an open site in the afternoon in Sector 3 between Holiday Inn and the golf course to clear the passage. All roads leading to the Sector 1-based District Courts complex have been sealed. Barbed wires and barricades have been put up at Majri Chowk, the Suraj theatre at old Panchkula and Bella Vista Chowk. Barbed wires of 3 to 3.5 ft have been put up. Commuters coming from Barwala and Raipur Rani were left harassed as they could not enter Panchkula via Majri Chowk. The entry through the Housing Board light point has been squeezed as due to barricades vehicles could enter or leave only in a queue. The entry to Chandigarh near the Vigilance police station in Sector 17 has also been closed. Cops were seen mounted on horses in Sector 2 today. Advocates at the District Courts suspended work for three days, beginning today. “The decision has been taken to avoid harassment to advocates. On the day of the verdict, the entry of advocates would be from the Suraj theatre side,” said Abhishek Rana, a lawyer. Deputy Commissioner Gauri Prashar Joshi had already announced the closure of all government and private educational institutions for three days — August 23 to August 25. She appealed to people and the dera followers to maintain peace in view of the August 25 order. “We have formed a peace committee and have been interacting with dera followers for the past two days,” she said. Regarding rumours of closure of petrol pumps and business establishments, she clarified that as of now only educational institutions had been closed for three days. “We can’t comment on how he will reach here,” she said when asked whether the dera chief was reaching by a helicopter. Commissioner of Police, Panchkula, AS Chawla said, “Panchkula has been allotted 25 paramilitary companies, all of which will reach by tomorrow. Besides, 2000 cops have also been deployed.” The police tested drone cameras, which will be deployed on August 25.The Chandigarh Administration has announced that all educational institutions — schools and colleges -- in Chandigarh (government, private, aided, unaided and technical) will remain closed on August 24 and 25. The decision has been taken in view of the verdict to be pronounced by the CBI court in Panchkula in a case registered against Dera Sacha Suada chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.The Haryana Government on Wednesday notified that there would be a gazetted holiday in government offices, boards/coporations and banks situated in Sectors 2, 4, 5 and 6 in Panchkula district on August 24 and 25. Special powers under the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881, in view of the law and order situation in Panchkula have been invoked.Government schools in Mohali will remain open on Thursday and closed on August 25, the day the CBI court will pronounce its verdict in the rape case against dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Mohali Deputy Commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra said: “Fuel station owners have been told not to sell petrol/diesel in bottles. Section 144 has been imposed in the area.” Sapra said: “Residents need not panic. All arrangements have been made. We are keeping an eye on all activities and making rounds of the town. As many as 30 Duty Magistrates have been deputed in the district and the number will be increased, if need be.” Sandeep Hans, Additional Chief Administrator, GMADA, has been made the overall in-charge of the Dera Bassi sub-division, while Mohali ADCs Sanjiv Garg and Charandev Singh Mann are looking after Mohali and Kharar.Kirron Kher, Member of Parliament, has advised residents of the city to be extra cautious during the next two days in view of the verdict to be pronounced in the case against the dera chief. She said while the Administration has announced holidays in all educational institutions of Chandigarh on August 24 and 25, residents should avoid going out of their houses for the next two days if it is not necessary. She appealed to the people to maintain peace at all cost."

The Supreme Court has made the right to privacy a fundamental right. So, will it work in letter and spirit? Well-known faces from the region share their take

Jasmine Singh

The Oxford dictionary defines privacy as a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people,; now, the word finds an approval from the Supreme Court, which, in a verdict on Thursday, passed the ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right.

Chief Justice JS Khehar said the ‘right to privacy’ is intrinsic to the ‘right to life’ and is hence a part of Article 21, Part 3, of the Constitution of India. The verdict, though slightly ambiguous in nature, has got thumbs-up from the film fraternity, politicians and from the general public. In a country like ours, where the next-door- aunty keeps a tab on your coming and going out timings, where paparazzi chase celebrities to death, where one can draw hints about your private life from the social media...declaring ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right is a praiseworthy step. What needs to be seen now is how it safeguards privacy!

Private life

“Privacy is part of our liberty, part of freedom, which must be respected; it helps people make better decisions and safeguard our family,” shares filmmaker Amit Prasher, who reminds us of the one-line answer that actors and actresses have in response to whom are they dating or if they were seen with someone – ‘It’s my personal life’. “No one has any right to question them or print their personal pictures on social networking sites,” he adds.

Amit has raised a valid concern but with celebrities willing to share their personal pictures on social networking sites, it is all a bit chaotic. “Celebrities want to share their pictures all the time and then they want to guard their privacy fiercely,” says Mandy M, singer-actor. Mandy is also of the opinion that the verdict might curtail the loose talk that people do about celebrities on social media; morphing pictures, writing about their personal choices.

Right choice

One of the key conclusions of the judgement is that privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacy, the sanctity of family life, marriage, home, procreation and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes right to be left alone. Dhananjay Mangalmukhi, first transgender student at Panjab University, draws our attention to this point. “It is my business what I do in my bedroom; whom I stay with, what I wear, is my right. Tomorrow, they can even install cameras in washrooms, which will be total violation of privacy.”

Vivek Trivedi, Chandigarh-based social worker, however, has his concerns. “We already have six fundamental rights that are violated on a daily basis. Right to privacy will only hold some value if there is a law backing it, which will allow prosecution, otherwise this will be another fundamental right with exceptions.”

Great verdict

""I am truly overwhelmed by the Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy and the parts of the judgement which specifically mention that sexual orientation should be a guaranteed right under the Constitution. This is a big day for the LGBTQ community in India, who have been fighting for their rights for over two decades. This verdict vindicates our appeal for equal rights as citizens of India. I feel truly happy and free.""

"Special Af Pak Representative to work under South, Central Asia Bureau","Washington, August 24

The once high-profile Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan will now work under the South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department, the Trump Administration has said.

Established under the previous Obama Administration, the once high-profile office of Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan previously reported to the Secretary of States, but now has been brought under the umbrella of the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia.

The office, which had a separate set of staff, has now been merged with the South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department.

However, the office of SRAP has not been abolished and there soon would a Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

“So SCA won’t give birth to an entirely new office that will duplicate its activities. There may be someone who is brought in to be a new special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan who would just be an extra body to help with some of the issues that we’re now facing. Obviously, it’s a big job,” State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters yesterday.

The SRAP Office has now been merged with SCA, Nauert said, adding that the staff and their work remains the same.

“We still have the same number of people. In fact, I was sitting with our team earlier today and I sat with them yesterday as well. So all that work is now still being done just by one department under SCA, South Central Asia,” she said. PTI"
The talaq verdict fallout,"STATECRAFT

Judicial wisdom, political mischief

Harish Khare

A socially useful litigation, insisted upon by those intrepid women of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, has produced a Supreme Court ruling, invalidating the practice of instant triple talaq. Lest it be suggested that the court had adjusted itself to the political expediencies of the day, we were curiously but repeatedly told that the judgment was delivered by a Bench that represented five different religious faiths. That was somehow meant to reassure us all. Still, that did not prevent the assorted politicians, from the Prime Minister downward, from overloading the verdict with their political calculations. Some wise and clever RSS functionary was even reported to have pronounced the death of “old secularism.” Consequently, we are forced to examine the political context of this consequential judgment. It needs to be noted that the talaq ruling has come soon after we recently courted an elaborate controversy over the Hamid Ansari proposition that the minorities in India had been given reason to feel insecure. Authoritative and angry voices were raised: how dare anyone bring up this disagreeable subject of the minorities' welfare and insecurity? The rebuff was laced with a be-grateful-for-what-you-are-allowed-to-have smugness. Legal scholars will keep chewing on the jurisprudential nuances of three sets of opinion, the larger question that needs to concern us is: how will the triple talaq ruling add to — or subtract from — the minorities’ sense of insecurity? True, the honourable judges were not addressing themselves to the minorities' (in)security but there can be no doubt that this ruling will have complications and consequences in the larger political landscape. To begin with, there may be cases of stray Muslim men being criminalised for being in violation of the Supreme Court. The very lumpen elements who had inflicted violence in the name of cow protection would feel emboldened to rework their gruesome energy. The use of violence and aggression against the minorities can now be explained away as sanctioned by the highest court. Some voices are already asserting that the ruling is the beginning of the end of what they see as the jumped-up insolence of the Muslims. Others are insisting that the politics of “appeasement” that began with the Shah Bano case three decades ago stands rolled back. This assertion of “appeasement” has been central to the ideological concoction served up by the Hindutva forces; it was meant to denigrate the non-BJP forces and to create certain visceral resentment, inducing a grievance that the majority remains at a clear disadvantage “in our own land”. So, unsurprisingly, the talaq judgment is deemed to be a political statement. It needs to be noted that the Supreme Court ruling is a very limited intervention in the Muslim “religion” — limited only to a very obnoxious practice; the practice was held unacceptable by the court because it is in violation of the Islamic laws. In any case, progressive, liberal and sensitive voices within the Muslim community have consistently voiced themselves against the obnoxiousness of this practice of instant triple talaq. So, why this dismay or jubilation? Arguably, the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion does not constitute a blanket protection; nor are the minorities entitled to feel totally beyond the reach of the court’s jurisdiction. Religious practices and customs can be challenged; and, in each case a determination is to be made by the court whether a practice is essential to the religion. In this limited context, the Muslim community need not allow itself to feel particularly cornered. Yet it is easier said than done. Because, on the other hand, there is a sense of satisfaction, even triumphalism, that the Muslims can no longer claim to be beyond the interventionist reach of the State; just as the majority has been repeatedly subjected to —remember the Hindu Marriage Act, the sati, dowry, etc. — the progressive gaze of the law, now the same light of reasoned enlightenment would be focused on the minorities. The hardcore constituency can permit itself a smirk that the Muslims have lost an ill-deserved immunity. A beachhead has been established. Indeed, the Hindutva forces have not lost any time in asserting that the triple talaq ruling is only the beginning; and that its old demand for a uniform civil code remains unabandoned. That demand itself is part of an unfinished agenda on what terms of co-existence are to be offered to the Muslims/minorities in India — parity, equality, or subordination. That will be the stuff of politics in the months and years to come. Make no mistake about it. Given the BJP’s current political ascendency, the minorities may well be within reason to feel that the ruling party is out to question every single assurance or commitment, even overturn constitutional guarantees. Indeed, the orthodox leadership of the Muslim community may feel besieged but it would be a pity if the maulanas were to spurn the opportunity to raise their game. Perhaps the most beneficial side-effect of the triple talaq ruling is that the Supreme Court has reclaimed its status and aura as the principal and only institutional interpreter of the constitutional rights and wrongs. The privacy case verdict on Thursday should be seen as a natural follow-up of the triple talaq verdict. A robust judiciary is central to the restoration of liberal sanity to our polity. Those who swear by progressive and liberal values and profess a commitment to secularism and pluralism have an obligation, post-Talaq ruling, to devise new political tactics. It needs to be recognised that the old-fashioned identity politics is becoming increasingly counter productive. If the orthodox Muslim leadership were to insist on wallowing in its entrenched ill-liberalism of the status quo, it will only enhance the potency of ill-liberalism of the right wing. It is no rocket science that the BJP’s politics is predicated on creating hostility among groups and suspicion in society at large. Secular political parties and leaders have to give the Muslim community the confidence to grow out of the maulanas’ sway. The apex court has anchored its verdict on universal moral values; and, the same values can be invoked to insist a fair deal for the minorities in a fair constitutional order, creating “a good society”. Before he went rogue in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson had defined “a good society” as one in which all citizens and groups “expect justice for themselves and are willing to grant it to others”. Liberal, democratic and secular voices need to seize the talaq judgment to insist on a renewal of the constitutional core guarantees."

Sri Lanka launches inquiry into recent defeats,"Colombo, August 24

Sri Lanka is launching an investigation into the woeful state of cricket on the island, the sports minister said on Thursday, amid a string of humiliating losses and calls for an administrative overhaul.

Dayasiri Jayasekera said he was inviting former administrators, players, sports experts and journalists to brainstorm ideas about how to revive the game, beloved in Sri Lanka.

“I am hoping to get all these experts at a single forum and thrash out issues,” Jayasekera told AFP.

“There is no point in blaming administrators or the players without an in-depth study. The idea is not to apportion blame, but address the deficiencies and rally behind the national team.”

He has rejected a suggested clear-out of the cricket board, an idea pushed aggressively by former World Cup winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga following this month’s 3-0 Test whitewash against India on home soil.

That compounded the misery for the national side after they suffered a humiliating ODI home series defeat against bottom-ranked Zimbabwe and bowed out early from the Champions Trophy in England.

“I don’t want to interfere in the administration,” Jayasekera said. “That might lead to isolation by the ICC (International Cricket Council).”

For years Sri Lanka’s cricket was governed by state- appointed boards, before a switch in 2016 to democratically- elected office bearers.

Ranatunga, who wanted a key role in the administration, was defeated at those elections.

The ICC had briefly suspended Sri Lanka’s voting rights before the 2016 reforms.

Jayasekera said player fitness was also an issue that contributed to Sri Lanka’s poor showing of late. The sports minister had already caused a stir by labelling the squad too fat and unfit to field five-day matches.

It is hoped the proposed forum, which has asked interested parties to submit written submissions about how to improve the game, will be held within a fortnight. — AFP"

Besides, buses of the Haryana Roadways coming to Chandigarh and Panchkula have already been stopped for two days. He said, according to earlier orders, Section 144 had been imposed in all districts and carrying of any kind of weapon had been prohibited. Dera followers were being relocated from sensitive areas. Besides additional police force, 18 companies of paramilitary forces would also be available by the evening. “Ten senior IPS officers have been deployed and two Additional Director General of Police-level officers have been tasked with ensuring peace and help maintain law and order in the state. Besides, 10 Duty Magistrates have been posted to various locations. The civil and police authorities are taking action on the basis of intelligence inputs,” he said."
"Nepali woman attacked in New York, thrown on metro rail track","New York, August 24

A Nepali-origin woman was attacked at a local underground metro station and thrown on to the rail track, but was saved when two people pulled her to safety before a train came along, according to media reports.

Why Dera Sacha Sauda attracts such huge following,"Jupinderjit Singh

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 24

Besides spirituality, there seems many other things that attract people in droves to become followers of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda. The controversial Dera is in limelight these days with Dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh facing the verdict in a rape case against him. Lakhs of followers have made a beeline to Panchkula where the Special CBI court will deliver the verdict on Friday afternoon. Thousands others are gathering in the worship centres called ‘Naam Charcha Ghars’ in Haryana and Punjab praying that the verdict goes in the dera head’s favour.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Why do so many people throng the Dera and follow the sect head who has repeatedly courted controversy besides acting in films. He is probably the only sect head in the country to have acted in films.

Caste equality

Caste equality at the dera is one such reason. “We experience peace in the spiritual environs at the Sirsa Dera and at various Naam Charcha Ghars in our town. Besides, the Dera life provides an equal status to all castes,” says Prem Insaan, a resident of a colony near Bathinda Railway Station. He says there is so much discrimination in society on the basis of caste. “Different communities and castes have their own temples and gurdwaras in Punjab and Haryana, but at our Dera all are equal. We all have one surname—Insaan—which means human. The Dera advocates humanity. We may be Hindu, Sikh or anything else, but we have failed to end caste divisions in society. At the Dera, these divisions get erased,” Prem adds.

Humble management ranking

For some, the humble ranking of the Dera management is also an attraction. Sukhvir Insaan, a Dalit from Mansa, says the Dera management has devised nomenclature like Insaan to advocate not just equality but also humility. “The management divides the state into zones which are further divided into units. Each unit is headed by a man who is given the title Bhangi Dass. The word Bhangi is used for low-caste people. But when the unit head is called this, it lends it respect. That is why so many low-caste people are Dera followers.”Subsidised food and free medicine is another huge attraction. “The Dera headquarters in Sirsa and the district units provide subsidised ration to its members. This is a boon for the poor. Unlike government schemes, like free ration for BPL families, which are often delayed or marred by corruption, the supply of subsidised ration at the Dera is smooth and equal for all,” says Bathinda-based follower Swarn Insaan. Dera followers have a high concentration in the belt comprising Sangrur, Barnala, Mansa, Bathinda, Fazilka, Faridkot and Ferozepur districts. Most of these districts are close to Sirsa in Haryana and are thus influenced by the Dera. The region is plagued by cancer and knee problems owing to the bad quality of water. The dera offers free treatment to such patients. “They have a system of providing free treatment. A Bhangi Dass collects slips from the followers in his area about the disease they are suffering from. He coordinates with the Dera headquarters and takes appointment. The free treatment, along with the spiritual environs of the Dera, acts as a great pull for poor patients or even those from middle-class families,” says a Bhangi Dass from Sangrur."

"One Bill passed, 3 tabled amid pandemonium","Tribune News Service

Shimla, August 24

Notwithstanding the stalemate in the Vidhan Sabha, the government today passed the Himachal Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 and tabled three Bills in the Assembly within a span of five minutes amidst complete pandemonium and sloganeering by the protesting BJP legislators. With tomorrow being the last day of the four-day monsoon session of the Assembly, the government seemed to be in a haste to introduce the Bills and get them passed as this will be the last session of this Vidhan Sabha. Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh tabled the Himachal Pradesh Hindu Public Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the House as nothing could be heard in the din. Similarly, Industry Minister Mukesh Agnihotri tabled the Himachal Pradesh Single Window Investment Proposals and Facilitation Bill, 2017 and Excise and Taxation Minister Prakash Chaudhary tabled the Himachal Pradesh Excise (Amendment) Bill 2017. At one stage there was even confusion as to whether the Bills had just been introduced or passed by the House. The Ministers and the Speaker completed the formalities with regard to introduction of the Bill in the din as nothing could be heard as BJP members created ruckus. The Bills are likely to be passed tomorrow without being taken up for discussion as the BJP is unlikely to join proceedings in protest against denying a debate on law and order under Rule 67."
Premis from Kangra head for Panchkula,"Tribune News Service

Dharamsala, August 24

Workers and managers (Premis) of the Baba Ram Rahim Singh Dera at Chachian in Kangra district are off to Panchkula where their guru is scheduled to appear in court in a rape case tomorrow. A visit to the dera in Kangra district revealed that all workers and managers had left and the premises wore a deserted look. Enquiries from the people residing in adjoining areas revealed that the workers and managers had left for Panchkula. There are a lot of followers of Baba Ram Rahim in Kangra district also. A large number of them attend his “satsang” when he comes to the dera here occasionally. However, despite the large number of followers, there is peace in Kangra in contrast to the situation in Punjab and Haryana where the security forces are on high alert. The dera in Chachian in Kangra district is spread over 175 kanals amid tea gardens and snow-covered hills in its background. It has allegedly remained in controversies over illegal land dealings. In 2007, District Magistrate Bharat Khera had declared the property as benami under Section 118 of the HP Transfer of Land (Regulation) Act, 1968. Later in April 2010, this decision was upheld by the Revenue Court of Divisional Commissioner, Kangra. The case is still pending in the higher Revenue Court. CP Verma, District Commissioner, said the advisories had been issued to keep a check in the area about the gathering and other suspicious activities. “We are vigilant on this issue,” he said. Intelligence agencies are giving routine inputs to the police headquarters of the district. Superintendent of Police Ramesh Chajta said no intelligence inputs had come regarding the gatherings. “We are competent enough to take action and are getting intelligence inputs also. No such gathering is there at the centre,” he said. Ram Rahim was fond of Kangra and had shot some of his movies in the area around this centre and at Dharamsala. He used to come to this centre often. In October 2016 during his visit to this place, Ram Rahim had also addressed a press conference over the release of his movie ‘Messenger of god’. This year in June, a mass gathering was organised by the “Baba” at police ground of the town.

High alert in Baddi

The Baddi police were in a state of high alert and vehicles leaving and entering this industrial hub are being checked. Since the area shares a border with Haryana the police was in a state of high preparedness. Baddi SP Rahul Nath said being a border area, additional force had been stationed here as a precautionary measure. Since HRTC buses would move on the Baddi-Nalagarh and Baddi-Siswan route, special emphasis was being laid on managing the traffic influx which the area would face. In a bid to avoid any untoward incident, the Nalagarh Truck Operators Union on Thursday suspended the movement of trucks to other states. — TNS"

"Nadda to lay stone of PGI satellite centre, says Satti","Rs 320-crore hospital to be set up in Una will have 300 beds

Our Correspondent

Una, August 24

State BJP president Satpal Singh Satti today said Union Health Minister JP Nadda would lay the foundation stone of satellite centre to be set up by PGI, Chandigarh, in Una. The project was recently announced by the Union Health Minister. Speaking to mediapersons here Satti said the first installment for the project had already been issued to the PGI authorities. The estimated Rs 320-crore hospital will have 300 beds and will be constructed on 25 acres in Malahat village near Una. He also said that a 100-bed Mother and Child Health Center would be built at a cost Rs 20 crores at Una with Central assistance, adding first installment of Rs 4 crore for the project had been sent to the state government by the Union Health Ministry. Satti said the state government should lend logistic support to the Central projects. The district hospital at Una faced shortage of medical staff despite being one of the busiest hospitals in the state. He claimed only 16 doctors were deputed at the hospital against the sanctioned strength of 26. He said apart from shortage of paramedical staff, inadequate infrastructure added to the problems. Satti said the Union Health Ministry had issued directions to sanction funds for setting up a trauma centre and haemo-dialysis centre at the district hospital. He also said that party leaders should refrain from seeking credit for development works. The comment comes after MP Anurag Thakur’s reportedly claimed credit for getting the requisite sanctions to set up AIIMS at Bilaspur, while stating that the Union Health Minister JP Nadda made no contribution towards the project. Satti also stated that he had raised the issue with the MP, who said his views were misquoted in the media."
Kohli to aid troubled Lanka?,"On eve of 2nd ODI, Kohli says he'll help Lanka deal with transition, but only after series

Pallekele, August 23

Sri Lankan cricket seems to be in strife. The team was whitewashed by India in the Test series. It then suffered a nine-wicket defeat in the first ODI. The fans were angered, and they delayed the departure of the Sri Lankan team bus after the loss, booing the players. The Lankan management might turn to, of all people, Virat Kohli to seek his advice. What are the chances that Kohli will give advice to Sri Lanka on how to manage their “transitional” difficulties? Very likely, it seems. Kohli said that he’s willing to discuss Sri Lanka’s issues with their management, but only after the end of the limited-overs series. Today, on the eve of the second ODI, Kohli was asked if the Sri Lankans have had any discussions with him about handling the difficulties of transition — both in terms of leadership and changes in personnel. The question came after Sri Lanka’s coach Nic Pothas had commented that the Sri Lankans would interact with the Indian team management to discuss this. “We haven’t had any discussions yet. Those things may happen after the competitive zone is over and we are done with the series,” Kohli said. “I think that will happen after September 6 if it has to happen from their end.” “Look, it is difficult for any team going through transition,” Kohli added, and provided some insight about what the Indian team did after some top players retired: “One thing that we decided to do as a team was take more responsibility and ownership of what we do on the field when playing for the country. We just needed to change our mindset.” “It didn’t matter if we were playing against a side that has played 60 Tests each — if we are mentally more prepared than them, then we are in a better position to win. So we decided to put our heads in that zone where experience didn’t matter much for us,” he added. “It was the fight and competitiveness we were willing to show and the desire to fight for longer periods that helped us get through that phase quicker than what others might have faced.”

Burning effigies? No!

Kohli is a very passionate player, as is often seen on the field. Would he have been a very passionate fan as well, if he hadn’t been playing the game? Would he have been burning effigies of the Indian players if the team failed? “If I am, as a fan, watching a game and I see a team not being able to do well, I would feel compassion. I would not burn effigies or smash faces, put on mannequins and what not,” he said. “I would show compassion because you can understand at a human level that everyone’s trying hard out there and no one wants to go out there to lose or fail.”

Pulling people down

“I’m not someone who will sit here after not performing and request the fans to be patient with us or (tell them) ‘please don’t react in a bad way’,” the captain said. “That’s a very personal choice.” “I think people find the ease and convenience, and the pleasure in pulling other people down which I personally don’t believe in,” Kohli went on. “I’m sure it’s tough for the players to see such things. But you can’t really control what’s happening from another person, you can only control what you can do on the park and the mindset that you can be in.”

Dhoni’s form

Fear of failure hurting the Sri Lankan team, says Jayawardene

Kohli also spoke about Mahendra Singh Dhoni, his predecessor as captain of both Test and ODI teams. Kohli said a number of limited-overs matches in the next three months would give Dhoni momentum and consistency. “This coming season gives us an opportunity to define roles for players and give them time to execute it so that for the World Cup, we know exactly what one player needs to do in certain situations,” Kohli said. “And it helps someone like MS because he doesn’t play Test cricket anymore. This long streak of matches will help him be in touch with the international games, find some momentum and stick to it.” — AgenciesFormer Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene feels the fear of failure is impeding the growth of the Sri Lankan team. Sri Lanka’s heavy loss to India in the three-match Test series came after the island nation lost the five-match ODI series against minnows Zimbabwe 2-3. “I feel the team’s confidence is low. The fear of failure has come out. They don’t look confident, they don’t look hungry enough in the middle. They need to address that and find solutions very quickly,” said Jayawardene. Talking about the whitewash against India, Jayawardene said the team failed in all departments. “I am sure the guys would be very disappointed with their performance in the Test series. It was a great challenge for them to test themselves against the No. 1 team,” said Jayawardene. “They didn’t handle certain situations well. First innings batting, too, let them down even when there were no demons in the wicket. They also never looked like getting 20 wickets.”

‘Virat a proactive captain’

Jayawardene, however, was all praise for India captain Virat Kohli, who guided his team to an eighth consecutive Test series win. “Look, he is a proactive captain. He is very aggressive. He has a brilliant record, though most of the games were played in India, you still have to win matches. He has led the team from the front, so the rest of the boys are following on and off the field,” he said. “The test for them now will be playing away from home. They have created a good nucleus of players who are taking responsibility. There is good competition for batting and bowling positions.” — PTI"

"After HC rap, police to evict dera followers from Panchkula","Army help sought; mobile internet suspended in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh for 3 days

New Delhi/Chandigarh, August 24

After being reprimanded by the Punjab and Haryana High Court over apparent inability in maintaining law and order ahead of the dera verdict, the Haryana police on Thursday evening said an operation will be launched to evict dera premis from Panchkula.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

“The dera followers have been asked to leave the city. This has been conveyed to the lawyer and an operation will be launched to send them away,” Haryana DGP BS Sandhu told mediapersons.

More than 15,000 paramilitary personnel have been deployed in Punjab and Haryana ahead of Friday's dera verdict by a Panchkula court, a Union Home Ministry official said earlier.

Sandhu said the Haryana government had asked for 20 columns of the army. ""The Deputy Commissioner has sent a letter for the same and the army columns will be provided as per availability shortly,"" he stated, adding that the situation was under control.

Around 150 companies of paramilitary forces had been deployed in the two states to assist the police forces in maintaining law and order. One paramilitary company comprises over 100 personnel.

The case against dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was registered in 2002 on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court after anonymous letters were circulated about the alleged sexual exploitation of two women followers by the dera head.

Meanwhile, mobile Internet and data services across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh will be suspended for 72 hours from Thursday.

The Haryana government has suspended mobile internet services, including 2G, 3G, 4G, CDMA and GPRS, SMS and dongle services, except voice calls, for 72 hours in an attempt to check misinformation and the incessant flow of dera followers.

Panchkula's Sector 1, which houses the CBI special court where the verdict is to be delivered by judge Jagdeep Singh at 2.30 pm, has been fortified with a four-tier security.

All liquor vends in Panchkula will remain closed from today till August 26.

Punjab and Haryana police forces were on a high alert to deal with any law-and-order situation, an official said, referring to the court verdict.

Earlier in the day, the Centre assured all possible help to the two state governments to deal with any situation as a large number of followers of the Dera have started arriving in Panchkula, Chandigarh and nearby areas, another official privy to the development, said.

""We are in constant touch with the governments of Punjab and Haryana. We have given them adequate forces,"" the official, who did not want to be identified, said.

He said flag marches had been carried out by security forces in Panchkula, Sirsa, Hisar and some other places while several hospitals were also put on alert.

The police forces are keeping a close watch on social media, particularly WhatsApp groups, Facebook and Twitter, and have asked people not to spread rumours, the official said.

The special court in Panchkula is scheduled to deliver the verdict on Friday.

HC annuls nominated councillors’ voting right,"Chandigarh, August 23

The Punjab and Haryana High Court today allowed a petition claiming that the voting right to nominated councillors in the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh would result in suppressing the will of the electorate. With this, the voting right of nominated councillors stands annulled. The Bench of Acting Chief Justice Surinder Singh Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan passed the order on the petition, filed in public interest by councillor Satinder Singh through counsel Baltej Singh Sidhu. He had referred to Section 4(3) (ii) of the Municipal Corporation Act before asserting that the nominated members were to be nominated by the government. “Nominated members are not elected members. They have not taken the mandate of the electorate. To give the right to vote in the meeting of the Municipal Corporation amounts to suppressing the will of the electorate,” Sidhu had argued. He had added that the right to exercise the vote by the nominated members tilted the balance against the wishes of the electorate. It was not only undemocratic, but prone to misuse also “because it cannot be expected from a nominated person to go against the will of his nominator”. Sidhu said the issue before the court was regarding the nominated members’ right to vote in the Municipal Corporation meetings. Section 4 (3) (ii) of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, as extended to Chandigarh, gave the voting right to nine members to be nominated by the government. On the other hand, Article 243 R of the Constitution did not give the voting right to the nominated members. As such, the provisions were ultra vires and unconstitutional. Referring further to the provisions of the Constitution, the law laid down by the Supreme Court and the High Court (supra), Sidhu said: “It was abundantly clear that there was no intention of the Constitution by way of the 74th Amendment to give the right to vote to the nominated members”. The petitioner, being an elected member of the Municipal Corporation, studied the law and brought it to the notice of the respondents and asked them to remove the anomaly. The petitioner also received a response from the Prime Minister’s Office. He was told that his representation had been sent to the quarters concerned for appropriate action. “Erroneously, it was sent to the Government of Punjab, he said. The petitioner added that the substantial question of law involved in the present writ petition was whether the provisions of Section 4 (3) (ii) of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, giving the voting right to the nominated members was ultra vires and contrary to the provisions of Article 243 R of the Constitution. — TNS"

ED acted impartially: Commission

The Justice Mehtab Singh Gill Commission, set up for looking into false cases registered during the past decade of the SAD-BJP government, has recommended compensation in more than 70 per cent of cases examined so far. The panel has also recommended recovery of relief amount from erring Investigating Officers. The dismissal of a Deputy Superintendent of Police and prosecution of complainants under Section 182 of the IPC in cases of false implication, too, has been suggested. The section deals with furnishing of false information with an intent to cause a public servant to use lawful power to injure another person.In its first interim report submitted to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today, the panel recommended compensation in 130 cases out of 178 examined so far. The panel, set up in April soon after the Congress government came to power, has received 4,200 complaints. In cases where the accused were given a clean chit by the police, the commission has decided to go with the cops. Prosecution under Section 182 and compensation for the accused has essentially been ordered in cases culminating in acquittal by courts. “The logic behind launching prosecution is not only to discourage false complaints, but also to prevent police from misusing powers for pecuniary gains,” Justice Gill (retired) asserted. “If the complainant is honest, there is little scope for the police to be dishonest.” The Justice Gill panel recommended the dismissal of DSP Gurmeet Singh after a court recorded in its verdict that the accused was implicated in a false case registered at his behest at the Khanna Sadar police station. “So far, the panel has reviewed cases in which the police probe revealed innocence, the challan has not been filed or the proceedings have terminated in orders of acquittal,” Justice Gill said. “We have not gone into pending cases.” Capt Amarinder has directed the Home and Judicial Departments to examine and implement the recommendations of the commission in a time-bound manner. The commission has been asked to monitor the implementation with the help of the Secretary (Home) and Director (Prosecution). For follow-up action at the district level, the Home Department may appoint District Magistrates and District Attorneys as nodal officers, the CM ordered. The nodal officers would report the follow-up action through the Commission.In 79 cases, the Justice Mehtab Singh Gill Commission found that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) “correctly” and “impartially” concluded the cases to be false. In another 19 cases, the commission recommended cancellation of FIRs or withdrawal of cases. The Home and Judicial Departments have been asked to request courts to cancel FIRs in a legal and proper manner."

Shimla, August 24

The traffic movement, including public transport from Himachal to Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, today came to a standstill after the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) stopped all 200 buses to the states following a high alert sounded in Punjab and Haryana in view of the massive gathering of Dera Sacha Sauda followers taking shelter on the highways near Panchkula in support of their head Ram Rahim, who faces a CBI court verdict in a rape case tomorrow. It has spelt doom for the tourism industry and its aftershocks will impact the business for the week. The tourist towns of Shimla, Manali, Dalhousie and other places wore a near-deserted look as the tourist traffic had come to a standstill since yesterday, said hoteliers. “To avoid any inconvenience to passengers and damage to the buses, we have stopped all 200 buses plying from Shimla, Manali, Dharamsala and other places to Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi today till Friday evening,” said Transport Minister GS Bali here. Bali told The Tribune that he would review the situation tomorrow. “If the situation eases out, then we will run the buses on the routes, otherwise the buses will not ply until things become normal. We will lose Rs 1 crore per day,” he added. In Shimla, the room occupancy in hotels had dipped to 20 per cent as the tourists had cancelled their plans to visit Himachal, said Harnam Kukreja, president of the Shimla Hoteliers and Restaurant Owners Association. The Kullu-Manali tourist circuit has been reeling under the lean tourist season and the dera episode has worsened the situation. “The tourist towns of Manali and Kullu wore a deserted look. The hotels and guest houses are vacant while the room occupancy has gone between 5 per cent and 10 per cent,” said Gajender Thakur, president of the Manali Hoteliers’ Association. He said the tourist inflow had decreased drastically since mid-August soon after the Kotrupi landslide blocked the Pathankot-Mandi highway and the rockslide near Hanogi temple blocked the Chandigarh-Manali highway,” Thakur said."
Grant against working capital is taxable,"Grant against working capital is taxable

Q.I had set up a unit in rural area and received a subsidy of Rs 5 lakh under Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme. The details of the subsidy are as under: 1. 35% (Rs 140,000) against building investment of Rs 4 lakh 2. 35% (Rs 4.2 lakh) against machinery investment of Rs 12 lakh 3. 35% (Rs 2.80 lakh) against working capital of Rs 8 lakh What should be the treatment of subsidy in the books of accounts? Please refer to Sec 2(24) xviii also. — Narinderjit Singh A. The subsidy would be covered within the term 'Government Grants' defined by Paragraph 3.1 of Accounting Standard (AS) 12 which deals with Accounting for Government Grants. Paragraph 8 of the said Standard deals with the issue of Grants received for specific fixed assets. Paragraphs 8.1 to 8.5 prescribe two methods for dealing with such Grants. One of the methods prescribed is to deduct such Grants from the gross value of the assets concerned in arriving at its book value. The second method which has been prescribed is to treat such Grants as deferred income and recognise the same in the profit and loss account on a systematic and rationale basis over the useful life of the asset. Such allocation of income is usually made over the periods in proportion to the charge of depreciation on related asset. The amount of Grant which is received for working capital can be classified as compensation for expenses incurred in the accounting period and can therefore be recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss account for the period in which it becomes receivable. I may add that for income-tax purposes, the treatment will have to be in accordance with the Income Computation and Disclosure Standard VII dealing with Government Grants. According to the said Standard, the Government Grants relating to depreciable fixed assets shall be deducted from the actual cost of the asset concerned or from the written down value of the block of assets to which asset concerned or assets belonged to. The Grants against working capital will be treated as income of the period for which it is receivable. Section 2(24) (xviii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (The Act) would not apply to the above case as the subsidy against building and machinery will be deducted from the cost of the related assets and therefore, would be excluded as per the provisions of Explanation 10 to Sub-section (1) of Section 43 of the Act. Further, the subsidy has not been given for the purposes of corpus to the institutions specified in the said clause and therefore the above section is not applicable to the grants received in respect of fixed assets. The amount of grant received against working capital should be taxable under Section 28(iv) of the Act. Q. My father bought an agricultural land in 1980 which has come within municipal limit now. He sold his land in March 2017 and bought NHAI bonds too. But still he is left with some money and wants to do some business (not interested in buying agricultural land) and spend some money on home as well as on his two two children.

(b) Can he gift some money (in case yes, up to what amount) to his unmarried daughter or her wife or his son (me)? (c) Can he also sell some of his ancestral land and what will be the base year for that land? —amar teja A. a) The agricultural land having been sold in March 2017, your father has an option to adopt fair market value as on 1.4.81. The amendment with regard to change in base year is applicable for assessment year 2018-19 which would cover the period from April 2017 to March 2018 and onwards. b) Your father can gift any amount to his children. There is no taxability with regard to the amount so gifted either in the hands of a donor or in the hands of a donee. However, any gift to his wife would not involve any tax, but any income earned on such gifted amount would be clubbed with the income of your father. c) In case your father sells his ancestral land after March 2017, the applicable date for adoption of fair market value would be 1.4.2001. Q.Our father was allotted a house (91-E, Hussainpura (West), Gali No.2, Amritsar) in lieu of the property left in Pakistan, after migration. He died on 28.07.1979. We are two brothers, a widow of the third brother and four sisters. But none of us has sales deed exhibiting the occupant of this house. However, the following documents give support to our contention of our late father being the owner of the house under discussion: 1. Death certificate of our father (27.8.1979) 2. Property tax of the house showing occupant being my father. 3. Antkal certificate of neighbour in House No. 91-F showing location of our House No. 91-E/13 in the East. 4. Electricity bill payment depicting the name of my deceased father. 5. A letter obtained under RTI from the Public Information Officer-cum- Deputy Director Land Record, Punjab, Jalandhar, pressing the inability of the office to trace the sales deed of the house. These documents are with me and a photocopy can be sent, if advised. — Dr inder Mohan Talwar A. I have gone through the contents of your query. You have stated that your father was allotted a house in lieu of the property he left in Pakistan. It seems this is a case of allotment of an evacuee property which had been left behind by the persons who migrated from Pakistan. The allotment having been made by the Government of India, there should be an allotment letter prescribing the details on the basis of which your father was allotted the property at Amritsar. In case you do not have the original letter, a copy thereof should be obtained from the department concerned. There may not be any sale/ conveyance deed in such cases."

Minister skips Cabinet meeting,"Dehradun, August 24

Uttarakhand Forest and Ayush Minister Harak Singh Rawat brought to fore the disquiet prevailing in the TS Rawat Cabinet by abstaining from the Cabinet meeting yesterday. Instead, Harak Singh Rawat visited Kotdwar, his Assembly segment. On being contacted, Harak Singh Rawat said he wanted to be with the people of his constituency. “Flash floods took place here and my people need me,” he clarified. He joined the BJP in 2016 and was included in the Cabinet after the Assembly polls. Sources said he said he was disenchanted over not being able to get a free hand in the government. Once a powerful minister in the previous Congress government, Rawat was hoping for a similar treatment in the BJP, but it has not happened. “He has failed to get a free hand in the transfers of IFS officers or the appointment of Ayush doctors,” quipped, a senior BJP leader. The friction between him and Satpal Maharaj became visible after a heated argument during a Cabinet meeting. He said there were no doctors in hospital but he was unable to do anything about it. — TNS"
Bad loans at 9.6% not acceptable: RBI Guv,"Calls for recapitalisation of banks

Mumbai, August 19

Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel on Saturday called for recapitalisation of state-run banks to help them resolve the NPAs issue in a time-bond manner as bad loans at 9.6 per cent of the system is not acceptable.

“Gross NPA ratio of the banking system at 9.6 per cent and stressed advances ratio at 12 per cent as of March 2017 on the back of persistently high ratio in the past few years, is indeed a matter of concern,” Patel told a gathering of bankers and industrialists in the presence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here.

Admitting that the balance sheet of most state-run banks are not healthy enough to take large haircuts, which is a corollary of any bad loan resolution, he called for their recapitalisation.

“NPA resolution would necessitate a higher re- capitalisation of these banks,” he said, adding “Government and the RBI are in dialogue to prepare a set of measures to enable state-run banks to shore up the requisite capital in a time bound manner.”

Regulatory or rather the economic challenge in dealing with the NPA issue gets accentuated when seen against the capital position of some of the banks, particularly public sector banks, he told an insolvency summit, hosted by industry lobby CII and chaired Jaitley.

The RBI chief said as much as 86.5 per cent of GNPAs are accounted by large borrowers.

“Swift time bound resolution or liquidation of stressed assets will be critical for delogging the balance sheet and for efficient reallocation of bank capital,” Patel said.

The government and the RBI are working together to comprehensively address the issue through a multi-pronged approach, he added.

Stating that the success and credibility of all the NPA resolution efforts will be critically contingent on the strength of public sector banks’ balance sheets to absorb the costs, he said any resolution will involve deep haircuts.

“It is clear that state-run banks will need to take haircuts on current exposures under any resolution plan agreed within or outside the IBC. Higher provisioning requirements on this counts as well as other factors will affect the capital position of several banks,” he said.

The measures could include a combination of capital raising from the market, dilution of government holding, additional capital infusion by the government, merger based on strategic decision and sale of non-core assets.

The RBI chief also blamed lenders for the mess, saying their poor credit appraisal systems have led to the pile of bad loans, which tops over Rs 9 trillion now. PTI"
The Railway Strike and its Lessons,"LAHORE, SATURDAY, AUGUST 25, 1917

THE Bombay railway strike, which has just ended, has its lessons which administrators and economists should note. Though the strike has ended, the problem underlying it has not yet been solved. Until this is done, there is no guarantee that the trouble will not recur. The very fact that large body of 15,000 work people stood out for nearly four weeks, resisting the efforts of conciliators, shows they must have had some real grievances. The men asked for increased pay and other concessions, not out of greed, but on account of an admitted rise in the cost of living. The proper way of solving the problem is to find out the actual minimum expenditure that a working man has to incur and to see that he is given the wages to maintain himself decently. But so far as we are aware, this was not done."

Warehousing on growth track,"REAL TALK - ANSHUL SINGHAL, CEO, EMBASSY INDUSTRIAL PARKS

In India, there are three to four classes of real estate — residential, commercial, hospitality and retail — which are the main focus areas of private developers. Globally, there is another class called industrial real estate. In fact, in Europe, US, Japan and China, industrial real estate is one of the largest classes of real estate. In India, it is still at a nascent stage. However, people have realised that with the implementation of GST, Make in India and policy-level changes in government, industrial real estate is now opening up to be a profitable sector and a lot of foreign investment is coming in. Tracking the growth opportunities that have emerged post the imlementation of GST The India Warehousing Show was organised recently. This year, Embassy Industrial Parks was associated as the Official VIP Partner of the show. Anshul Singhal, CEO, Embassy Industrial Parks, who was the keynote speaker at the Warehousing Leadership Summit talks about how the industrial segment is going to be the next big thing in Indian realty. Excerpts from an interaction: What are the growth prospects for the warehousing segment in India? India’s logistics and warehousing sector is poised for accelerated growth, led by GDP revival, ramp up in transport infrastructure, e-commerce penetration, the GST implementation, besides several other initiatives like ‘Make in India.’ Indian 3PL market is expected to grow with CAGR of 6 per cent over the next five years. The biggest indicator of its future is that the government of India plans to build multi-modal logistic parks across the country with an investment of Rs 33,000 crore in a bid to bring down costs incurred on logistics, it will also lay low the overall freight cost, reduce vehicular pollution and congestion, and will enable reduction of warehousing costs of the country. How is GST going to benefit this vertical? With the implementation of GST, domestic warehousing industry will see consolidation. Facilities will relocate to consumer-driven and transportation network areas from the current tax-friendly locations. We even expect sectors like e commerce, automotives, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals; FMCG will own/lease larger warehouses at prime locations like Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Already the warehousing activity along the western corridor has moved towards a more systematic mode of operation leading to an inflow of more institutional funding and formal sources of capital. A recent survey about leading warehousing occupiers in the country revealed that consolidation and expansion will be the key theme driving warehousing demand in the region. This will result in increased demand for larger and better quality warehouses leading to the emergence of new warehousing hubs as well as expansion of the existing hubs. The survey also revealed that 30 per cent of respondents said that they will further expand their footprint in the warehousing market of Delhi-NCR alone in the post GST scenario. GST will ensure that India for the first time will be exposed to consolidated large space central warehousing parks instead of the current scattered poor quality stand alone spaces. Which are the key pockets of growth according to you? Modern warehousing facilities that allow for consolidation of distribution hubs will be a vital component in the growth story. Key markets obviously will be close to cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune — that are a mix of consumption centres and have active industrial presence. What are the major challenges that this segment is facing at the moment? Land acquisition is a major challenge for any real estate player. When we are looking at buying 50 acres to 200 acres of land and develop it, we hope for some reforms that make this process for industrial and warehousing purposes a lot easier. Second challenge is approvals. What we have today has definitely improved from what it was five years back and it has become friendlier in the Modi government but I think we have scope for improvement there. The policies can become more user friendly. The important thing to understand here is that the more time approvals take, the more the capital sits idle as we cannot start construction and generate revenues onto the land. What are your group’s expansion plans in this segment? Embassy Industrial Parks aims to build 20 million sq ft of industrial and warehousing space over the next five years across India at a total investment of about $1 billion. Being a forerunner in this sector, Embassy Industrial Park is also one of the few companies contributing to success of Make in India initiative and has signed three MoUs with the State governments. We have already signed lands which are at various stages of acquisition in Chennai, Delhi, Pune, Mumbai & NCR and we are actively working to acquire lands in Gujarat and Kolkata. We have a JV with Warburg Pincus with Warburg is investing Rs 1,000 crore of equity out of the total Rs 1,600 crore of equity investment. Which means we can raise another approximately Rs 4,000 crore as debt, our investment alone will be Rs 6,600 crore in this sector. This totals to $1 billion.

AI system to help detect skin cancer in early stages,"Toronto

Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

The system, built by researchers at University of Waterloo in Canada, analyses images of skin lesions and provides doctors with data on telltale biomarkers of melanoma, which is deadly if detected late, but highly treatable if caught early.

It deciphers levels of biomarker substances in lesions, adding consistent, quantitative information to assessments currently based on appearance alone, researchers said.

In particular, changes in the concentration and distribution of eumelanin, a chemical that gives skin its colour, and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, are strong indicators of melanoma, they said.

The artificial intelligence (AI) system — trained using tens of thousands of skin images and their corresponding eumelanin and hemoglobin levels — could initially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, a significant health-care cost, researchers said.

It gives doctors objective information on lesion characteristics to help them rule out melanoma before taking more invasive action.

""This could be a very powerful tool for skin cancer clinical decision support. The more interpretable information there is, the better the decisions are,"" said Alexander Wong, a professor of systems design engineering at Waterloo.

""There can be a huge lag time before doctors even figure out what is going on with the patient. Our goal is to shorten that process"" Wong added. PTI"
Govt favoured pvt distillery: Cong,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 24

Leader of the Opposition in state Assembly Indira Hridayesh today accused the state government of putting a blanket ban on recruitments and favouring a private distillery over the government cooperative for manufacturing liquor. Addressing a press conference, Indira Hridayesh said, “Far from fulfilling the electoral promises, the BJP government upon being elected in Uttarakhand has put a blanket ban on recruitments. The government should offer an explanation to the people.” She accused the government of pursuing a revenue-driven excise policy without exercising caution or restraint. She alleged that the state government in order to earn more revenue had stopped manufacturing Gulab, a country liquor brand, at the cooperative distillery to favour a private distillery owner at Bajpur. “The Gulab brand, with light content, has been shut in favour of a stronger brand, Dabang, manufactured by a private company. The locals are getting addicted to it,” she rued. She accused the state government of delaying the CBI probe in the NH-74 land scam. “The Central government is not keen on the probe. It is protecting the NHAI officials at the behest of the Centre,” alleged Hridayesh."
Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple under investigation: report,"Singapore, August 22

One of Singapore’s oldest Hindu temples is under investigation over suspected criminal offences, a media report said on Tuesday. Commercial Affairs Department is conducting the probe into Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, but it is “inappropriate” to comment further on the investigation, police said. The Commissioner of Charities (COC) also said in a statement that it had been notified of the investigation and had also launched its own inquiry into the temple. “The review identified certain areas of concern with regard to governance and administration, which warrant conducting an inquiry,” Channel News Asia reported citing the statement. The COC added that it would decide on the next course of action after the inquiry. In the meantime, religious activities would not be affected and the temple could continue with its operations and daily services, the COC said, adding that measures would be put in place to ensure the temple is properly managed. The temple at Serangoon Road is a well-known landmark in the Little India area, with about 5,000 devotees on Sundays and is popular among tourists. The temple was set up as a trust and obtained charity status in 1988. The temple, founded by Tamil pioneers in 1835, underwent a two-year-long SGD7-million makeover which was completed in 2014. It is one of 15 places of worship that have been listed for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. PTI"
A canvas for fashion,"Installations and scenography are the new buzzwords at fashion shows across the country

Swati Rai

if 29 Rooms, the installation at last year’s New York Fashion Week in Bushwick, is anything to go by, it can safely be presumed that art in high fashion is a globally rising trend. Designed to inspire creativity and, of course, Instagram posts, the 80,000 square foot warehouse saw installations by artists as well as fashion designers, amongst them the likes of Michael Kors. Kors’ concept titled The Sidewalk is Your Runway, had people posing with his famed bags and posting the captures on social media. Fashion and its interpretation have changed over the years. This change reflects itself not just in the colour and texture, but also in the way fashion is presented to people today. Artistic installations and scenography for a fashionably ambient presentation are an off shoot of that. Bold designing steps see couturiers seeking artistic outlet to jazz up the ramp and, in turn, create an immersive experience for the onlooker. While we have had the trend impressing the fashion scene abroad, it is catching up in India too, be it at the last two India Couture Weeks or Lakme Fashion Week. Designers have been successful in creating scenes and vignettes both on and off the ramps. Recently, seven fashion icons — Sabyasachi Mukherji, JJ Valaya, Tarun Tahiliani, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Shantanu & Nikhil, Abraham & Thakore and Narendra Kumar Ahmed — were invited by Godrej India Culture Lab to reflect on the Partition of India through their designs. These were presented in a fashion-meets-art installation at the Lakme Fashion Week and would be permanently housed at The Partition Museum in Amritsar. At the recent ICW, designer Anamika Khanna, in her show entitled Happily Ever After, chose to have a multi-dimensional mannequin theme reflecting various stages in a marital journey — from betrothal to the nuptials. Wide-eyed stationary models brought alive the theme with scenes created to match the outfit and the occasion. An installation is also about a designer’s mind. Also at ICW, Gaurav Gupta brought to the ramp a bit of the fantasy world he inhabits. An esoteric world found itself taking shape and offering the audience a quick mood elevation. The ramp became a barren yet rich moonscape with huge glass blowouts radiating in a purple haze as the show opened. It felt as if one was suspended in the bubble for a moment. In his own words: “I added a new dimension to a mythological forest by creating a floating space in between. It sort of mirrored the fantasy space in my head, which I inhabit most of the time. There was foliage in glass on the 10 installations, measuring between 7 and 10 feet, which we created.” A more traditional take was Manav Gangwani’s latest couture collection, India@70. It showcased the god and goddesses of India and meenakari on Patolas and Paithani to reflect different cultural imprints of the country. Big and bold Kathakali masks worn by models accentuated the show. A model perched on the grand staircase of a hotel foyer reflected the Prime Minister’s Make in India campaign, showcasing an intricately designed silhouette of a lion. Sharing his design landscape, Gangwani says, “The fashion industry has evolved over the past few years. We now have so much inspiration around us in India. Monumental structures, cultural diversity and geographical differences have helped me curate this collection… I have taken inspiration from every region of India to create this collection and to give the audience this experience.” FDCI president Sunil Sethi isn’t surprised by the increasing room for art in fashion. “Deep down, all designers think of themselves as artists and this creative force comes out in their collections — be it in the set design or as an installation fashion show.” Still, he feels art is just an embellishment for a fashion show. Designs have to be the real powerhouse. “I feel that the philosophy or the thought process of a designer will remain hidden if the clothes in his/her collection fail to do so. It’s the clothes and not the art work that is important.” While crediting digital technology and advanced projection techniques for the innovation on ramp, he hints at the limited scope of the trend too. “Such scenography has more scope and visibility in couture and not so much in pret,” Sethi says."
BSP not to participate in Lalu’s anti-BJP rally: Mayawati,"Lucknow, August 24

BSP president Mayawati on Thursday said though her party is a votary of unity among secular parties, it will not take part in RJD president Lalu Prasad’s Patna rally against BJP on Sunday.

“BSP has clearly told the RJD that it will share the dais with any regional or national party only when it is decided beforehand on how many seats will go to which party in the secular alliance... Before finalising any secular programme the policy and principle of seat sharing should be decided (first) as the life of an alliance is dependent on it and all should get respectable number of seats,"" she told newspersons here.

The RJD chief is criss-crossing Bihar to mobilise people for the August 27 rally, which he has claimed would be a major occasion to bring together the secular forces on one platform against the BJP ahead of the 2019 polls.

Lalu is attempting a major show of strength after he was ousted from the Bihar government with the JD-U moving out of the grand alliance and joining back the NDA fold and the government with the BJP.

""If the issue of seat sharing is decided beforehand, it will save the mutual distrust at the last minute as also the trust of the people will be kept intact...then it will not be difficult to defeat the BJP,"" she said.

The BSP president said that her party has always supported unity among secular parties and has also taken steps against ""the BJP and company and RSS and their communal and casteist mentality"".

“As far as the issue of taking part in the Patna rally is concerned, BSP's concern is that there should be no distrust among the people and there is no tiff between the secular parties on the issue of seat sharing even if this rally turns out to be a success...there are cases of back stabbing in the past and it must be ensure that eventually the BJP does not gain from it,"" she said.

“BSP is not against the joint struggle or alliance between secular parties but all this need to be carried out with good intentions and full honesty...the experience of last Assembly election in Bihar proved how some parties had parted ways at the last time over seat sharing,"" she said.

The former chief minister said that BSP never compromises on self respect, and enters into an understanding only when it feels that it is getting respectable number of seats.

""Presently BJP and company is in government in the state and at the Centre and will use all tactics to defame secular opposition parties or weaken them also by misusing government machinery...the EC is also wary of their anti-democratic stance to win elections,"" Mayawati said.

Under such circumstances, she said, opposition parties need to chalk out concrete strategy to defeat BJP so that the confidence of the people can be won over again and for this seat adjustment is the most important thing failing which alliances are disintegrated at election time.

""...this also breaks peoples trust and give a wrong message to people and only result in BJP making electoral gains,"" she said.

Keeping these facts in mind, BSP is very alert and think seriously and many times on the issue of sharing dais with any secular party as a result of which there will not be any participation of BSP in the Patna rally, she said.

She said BSP also welcomes the Supreme Court decision on right to privacy as a fundamental right. The historic verdict will strengthen democracy and the Constitution.

At the same time the SC decision is also a warning for the Modi government to use its mandate for people welfare and not force things on people by acting in an autocratic manner, she added. — PTI"

New York, August 23

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump's Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

. @RavinGandhi1 I am told on a daily basis to go back to India. Like you, I was born here and proud of my roots. Thanks for speaking out. — Ameya Pawar (@Ameya_Pawar_IL) August 22, 2017

""I recently told the New York Times I was 'rooting' for certain aspects of Trump's economic agenda,"" Gandhi wrote in the op-ed.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""After Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don't look like him.""

Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters. Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should ""get your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.""

The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take ""that other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,"" referring to the US envoy to the UN. ""She's (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don't tell us that you gave him a chance. We don't give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We're going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,"" the woman said. In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should ""go clean up your own (expletive) country, it's a filthy mess.""

Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said. ""It was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,"" he said. ""I wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.""

""Even though my race is a complete non-issue in my day- to-day life, the sad reality is there's a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,"" he said in the report.

""I wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there's this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected."" Gandhi added that the fact that Trump ""equated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up"" as he called Trump's moral leadership on the issue ""reprehensible.""

He said while his sharing a ""bigoted"" voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so. ""My heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let's be honest — I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I'm suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don't have resources really are suffering.""

""I know I'm on the right side of history here,"" he said. ""That's how I sleep at night."" —PTI"
"The Tribune, India news","NEW DELHI: BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday appointed eight top-ranking ministers looking after more than 15 key departments in the Narendra Modi government as in-charge of three states —Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka, due for elections this year and early next year.

Vibha Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 24

BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday appointed eight top-ranking ministers looking after more than 15 key departments in the Narendra Modi government as in-charge of three states —Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka, due for elections this year and early next year.

While senior leader and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who has also held the responsibility in the past, has been given the charge of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah’s home state Gujarat, HRD Minister Prakash Javedakar and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot will take care of the BJP’s fortunes in Congress-ruled Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, respectively.

Notably, in Gujarat Jaitley will be assisted by an array of senior central ministers. They include Narendra Singh Tomar, Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh and PP Choudhary.

While the move is indicative of the importance Gujarat holds for BJP, the fact that in addition to the PM and Shah (who will obviously be actively campaigning in their state) five top ministers have been positioned to oversee Gujarat polls perhaps also shows that “all may not be well” for the saffron party in the state.

Even as the BJP juggernaut rolls on with Shah in the driving seat, events in Karnataka and Gujarat show the party may not be as comfortable position as he would like it to be.

For example Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s win in the Rajya Sabha polls, despite the best efforts by Shah, proved what appears on the surface could be different from the realities on the ground.

Besides, ever since Modi moved to the Centre, Gujarat has been a hot spot of major anti-BJP agitations, including the Patidar protests led by Hardik Patel and the Dalit revolt after the Una flogging episode.

In Gujarat, the BJP is not just facing an anti-incumbency of 17 years but also a built-up over Prime Minister’s economic moves like demonetisation and switchover to the GST.

As far as Karnataka is concerned, where Union minister Piyush Goyal will assist Javadekar in building the BJP campaign in the Congress-ruled state, the grand old party appears to be on a roll after the launch of ‘Indira Canteen’ — a new programme of the Siddaramaiah government to provide food at subsidised rates.

In Himachal Pradesh, a relatively smaller state which appears to be “quite under control”, Gehlot will be relying upon State leaders for help, say BJP leaders.

Seven key states — Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh (November-December), Meghalaya (February) Karnataka (April-May next year), Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan (September-October 2018) — will go to polls before the 2019 General Elections."
Failed mechanics,"MOVIE REVIEW: ANNABELLE: CREATION

Set in the 1940’s, “Annabelle: Creation” the prequel to “Annabelle,” which was in turn a spinoff of “The Conjuring,” is the third cinematic outing for the demon-host, a wooden doll made by the doll-maker Sam Mullins( Anthony La Paglia), who lost his daughter in an accident(the only strikingly shocking scene in the entire movie).

His wife Esther (Miranda Otto) has already become a victim of the demonic doll and is now living a secluded mysterious life within the confines of her own bedroom.

The Doll has been cloistered within a closet papered with Bible readings, in their sprawling California farm house for a few years now. And into this set-up they introduce a bunch of six orphans - Prepubescent Polio-stricken and wearing a leg-brace, young Janice (Talitha Bateman), her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), a motley group of pre-teens and their caretaker Nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman).

Could be they thought that inviting strictly catholic folk would absolve them of their descent into evil? But what about the young ones who have basically been set-up for scare-happy voyeuristic entertainment? That the religious Church going Mullins’ put young helpless children in harm’s way is a little hard to stomach.

Returning ‘Annabelle’ screenwriter Gary Dauberman contrives to have Janice curious enough to overcome her fears and investigate the mysteries of the old house, thus laying out the plot points that would eventually lead to her victimisation. Linda is also drawn in while the Nun and her other four wards have their own scary encounters to deal with. And there’s really nothing new to keep you absorbed here.

The fright tactics employed here are not effective enough even though they have old school generic effects written all over them. No doubt Sandberg’s narration follows the genre ritual of terrorising its female characters, but this time they are a little too young to be validated by such impunity!"

“The two sides also discussed global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual concern. The conversation is a continuation of our US-China strategic bilateral dialogue,” she said. PTI"
“A play has repeat value if the subject is relevant”,"If you have been wondering who goes to theatre in the age of digital entertainment, there are plays that have been running for decades now

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

At a time when cinema has a turnover of millions, television shows have been running for years, actors and producers are raking in the moolah, including new entrants on social media, yet in all this theatre, the world’s first form of entertainment, has been chugging along. It neither has the money, the visibility nor the fame. But actors of every genre swear by it.

“That is because there is an audience which realises the thrill of live theatre. Any live event becomes more humane due to the ‘human error factor’ and that adds to the thrill,” declares Nitish Bhardwaj, once again performing the role of Lord Krishna in the currently running play Chakravyuha, which has completed more than 65 shows. His first role as Lord Krishna in B. R. Chopra-produced TV serial Mahabharata (1988) immortalised him.

“There is human touch and a live audience! Even the long-running plays have something new happening in every show. This is what keeps the adrenalin pumping”, says Jayati Bhatia, who has acted in television series like Sasural Simar Ka, Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki, Jassi Jaise Koi Nahin and theatre shows like Vagina Monologues, Blame it on Yashraj, Mahatma Vs Gandhi for more than two decades now.

A well-written and well-directed play often gets a full house and has a tremendous repeat value. The longest-running play in the world, Mousetrap, is written by English crime novelist and playwriter Dame Agatha Christie. It opened in London’s West End in 1952 and has completed 26,703 shows at its last count!

In India, too, several plays in many regional languages, have completed more than 2,000 to 3,000 shows. Many have been staged for decades with a change of actors and directors. To name a few: in Marathi, we have Ghasiram Kotwal, written by Vijay Tendulkar and directed by Dr Jabbar Patel (1973), Nat Samrat written by V. V. Shirwadkar and acted brilliantly by Dr Shriram Lagoo (1970), Katyar Kaljat Ghusali made famous by the singing and acting of Vasantrao Deshpande (1967). In Kannada, we have Hayavadana by Girish Karnad (1971), Jokumar Swamy (1972) directed by B.V.Karanth, Mukhya Mantri (play adapted by Ranjit Kapoor from a 1976 novel by Panchari Sen, translated by TS Lohitshwah (1978). In English, we have Dance Like A Man directed by Lillete Dubey (more than 550 shows), Hamlet the Crown Prince directed by Rajat Kapoor (more than 200 shows in Mumbai alone), Love Letters was adapted in India (1993) from Pulitzer prize-winning American play by A. R. Gurney. The latest sensation is English play Vagina Monologues, which was first performed in 2003, and even after more than 1000 shows, it runs to a packed house.

“A play has repeat value if the subject is forever relevant”, observes Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal, the woman behind Indian adaption of the iconic Vagina Monolgues (1996) play by Eve Ensler. The popularity of the play and a demand for it to be staged in places where English isn’t the spoken or common language, made them translate it into Hindi as Kissa Yoni Ka.

There are many Hindi plays, especially from IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association) like Bakri (directed by M. S. Sathyu), Ek Mamuli Aadmi (directed by Raman Kumar), Ek Aur Dronacharya (S. Dangyach), Sir Sir Sarla, Ek Kadam Aage (Makarand Deshpande), which have been staged to full house.

Actor Om Katare, founder of the Yatri Theatre group (1979) which has staged more than 5,500 shows of his plays, says, “No one can touch the charm of theatre. If only there were more theatre spaces, our plays could have easily given tough competition to other entertainment bodies.”

Veteran theatre, TV and film actor Aanjjan Srivastav says, lack of space and media coverage is the bane of theatre. “If we get more media coverage, popularity of theatre will increase. It will bring in sponsors, moolah and attract more talent”, he adds."

City on high alert after suspicious movement,"Army, police carry out searches in Miran Sahib area; security strengthened in Udhampur too

Amir Karim Tantray & Deepankar Gupta

Tribune Reporters

Jammu/Udhampur, August 24

High alert was sounded in Jammu and Udhampur districts on Wednesday night following two reports of suspicious movement in the Miran Sahib area on the outskirts of Jammu city and possibility of infiltration on the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri and Poonch districts. The police, Army and the administration were on their toes throughout the night. As a result, some schools in Jammu and Udhampur remained closed today. The police in Jammu said searches were conducted during the night in the Miran Sahib area by the Army and the police following reports of suspicious movement. “Nothing was found during the searches after which the operation was called off. After information of suspicious movement, high alert was sounded but it was called off this morning,” said Sunil Gupta, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Jammu. A resident of Satwari in Jammu said the Army choppers were making rounds during the night and it did not sound normal. “A few shopkeepers outside the Satwari cantonment were on Wednesday evening asked to close their shops early,” the resident said. A red alert was also sounded in Udhampur town by the Northern Command and the police last night, leading to closure of all Army schools and Kendriya Vidyalayas today. Air Force Station, Jammu, school was also closed early, creating panic among parents. All vital installations, including the Udhampur railway station, Vaishno Devi and Chenani-Nashri tunnel, were put on high alert and security was beefed up. Strict vigil was being kept on the highway and other locations in the district. “High alert was sounded for security installations at all places in the Jammu zone as a precautionary measure,” said Rayees Ahmed Bhat, SSP, Udhampur. “(The people are asked to) remain alert and cautious and inform the police in case of any suspicious movement. There is no need to panic. Rumours of terrorists being sighted in Udhampur are baseless and there is no need to pay any attention,” Bhat said. Sources in the Army confirmed that a red alert was sounded in the area. “We were told by the higher authorities to sound a red alert. Beyond that we have no information,” said a source. Another source in the Army said that after the red alert, movement of Army vehicles was restricted and schools were closed as a precautionary measure."
Cabinet’s in-principle nod to merger of PSU banks,"Alternative mechanism to be set up for their consolidation

Sanjeev Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 23

Kicking off a major consolidation among 20 public sector banks, the Union Cabinet today gave an in-principle approval for an alternative mechanism to oversee amalgamations with a view to creating fewer and stronger entities which do not require as much government funds for recapitalisation. The alternative mechanism would be a committee of ministers that will be set up to consider proposals which come from the boards of the banks. One of the stated objectives of the consolidation exercise is to create banks that have the capacity to raise resources without depending unduly on the state exchequer, which is likely to free up government resources. While the caveat is that the proposal must start from the boards of banks, it is evident that the government being the majority shareholder in all the public sector banks would have a say in the matter. It is learnt that the process has been in the works for some time and some banks have already held discussions. While a major consolidation in the PSU banking space has been advocated by the government functionaries on several occasions, it is the first time that the Union Cabinet has put its seal. PSU bank stocks went up in trade after the announcement helping the market to close up by 276 points. Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Allahabad Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of India recorded moderate to sizeable gains. An official statement said in 1991, it was suggested that India should have fewer but stronger public sector banks. However, it was only in May 2016 that effective action to consolidate public sector banks began by announcing amalgamation of six banks into State Bank of India. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the decision regarding creating strong and competitive banks would be solely based on commercial considerations. Jaitley said the consolidation would add commercial strength to the banks, prevent multiplicity of resources and improve the ability of the banks to absorb shocks. He said the experience of consolidation has been positive. The proposals received from banks for in-principle approval to formulate schemes of amalgamation will be placed before the Alternative Mechanism. There are now 20 public sector banks other than SBI. The government said the banking scenario has changed since 1970 when banks were nationalised, with an increased banking presence from private sector banks, non-banking financial companies, regional rural banks, payment banks and small finance banks. “The decision is expected to facilitate the creation of strong and competitive banks in public sector space to meet the credit needs of a growing economy, absorb shocks and have the capacity to raise resources without depending unduly on the state exchequer”, the government said."

New Delhi, August 24

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia today proposed constitution of a tourism advisory board that could suggest innovative ideas to develop the national Capital into a tourist hub in the country.

Sisodia, who also holds the tourism portfolio, pitched for creation of tourism circuits such as golf, political and social circuits to increase the stay period of tourists visiting the city. He was speaking during an event “Destination Delhi: Socio Economic Perspective on Heritage, Art, Culture and Tourism” organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry here,

The Deputy Chief Minister said the political heritage of Delhi such as the President House, the Parliament, the Delhi Secretariat and a host of such sites of historical significance, including state-owned education institutions, hotels, could also be showcased to the tourists.

The government is going to set up such a board which could contribute towards thinking of ways to tap tourism potential in the city, Sisodia said while elaborating a team that may comprise tourism experts, professionals, representatives of industry, media and market associations who can suggest innovative ideas on ways to promote tourism in the national Capital.

Noting that the aspects such as the government schools, mohalla clinics and night shelters developed by the government could interest visitors, Sisodia said roping in Delhiites will be of great help in the entire exercise and even suggested special packages for the locals.

In his address, High Commissioner of Brunei, Dato Paduka Haji Sidek Ali praised the tourism potential of India in general and that of Delhi in particular. He felt that with more beautification drive, the capital city of New Delhi could be transformed from tourism perspective with multi-pronged strategies.

PHD Chamber president Gopal Jiwarajka also emphasised the need for promotion of Delhi given its potential which is partly harnessed and needs to be much more utilised with creative and innovative strategies."

"Unlike Valley, region silently awaits SC verdict on Art 35A","Amit Khajuria

Tribune News Service

Jammu, August 24

Even as separatists as well as mainstream parties of the Kashmir valley have announced ‘mass movement’ to safeguard Article 35A at any cost, Jammu is silently waiting for the apex court’s verdict on this provision of the Constitution. A Delhi-based NGO along with some individuals have challenged the constitutional validity of this Article in the Supreme Court. Although a majority of the population in Jammu is against what they called ‘discriminatory’ Article, people in the region prefer remaining calm to repose their faith in the court. Locals are confident that this Article will not stand a chance during the legal scrutiny. Article 35A, which imposes some restrictions on the people from other parts of the country as well as wards of the daughters of the state who married a non-state subject to have ownership rights on property in the state — has become a hot topic of debate in the country and particularly in the state. The Kashmir valley and Jammu region once again are at loggerheads over the debate on Article 35A as the Valley is in its support while Jammu finds it to be a violation of the fundamental rights. “Yes, Jammu is silent over Article 35A because we have full faith in the country’s legal system and when some issue is in the Supreme Court then there is no need to come on to roads in support of it or in opposition,” said Subash Khajuria, a retired government employee. “Jammu has always been against Article 370 and the main reason behind it is that our daughters who get married outside the state cannot claim the property rights for their wards in J&K while if our sons get married outside the state, their wives as well as children get all rights in the state,” he added. Meanwhile, as the constitutional validity of Article 35A has been challenged in the Supreme Court, different political parties have come up with different views, which suit their political aspirations. Jammu parties are in favour of the debate under the court of law, however, the Kashmiri leadership has flared up the issue in the Valley by attaching religion with it. “It is a debatable issue under the court of law, but not a religious issue. Kashmiri leaders are misguiding people for their political benefits. The issue is in the Supreme Court, so let the court decide after hearing both the sides,” said Pankaj Saroch, an IT engineer. “I personally feel that if Article 35A gets abolished, it will be a boon for the state industry. Moreover, it will end discrimination being faced by the women of the state,” he argued"

"Toll in Bihar floods touches 379, situation in UP grim","New Delhi, August 24

Bihar and Uttar Pradesh continued to reel under floods, which have left a trail of death and destruction in the two states, where 21 more people lost their lives on Thursday and over two crore people are still affected.

The toll in Bihar floods, which have affected 1.61 crore people in 19 districts, mounted to 379 with 12 more deaths while in eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh nine more people died.

In West Bengal’s northern districts, the flood situation has improved, but in Assam, as many as 606 villages were inundated and 4.5 lakh people still affected by deluge across nine districts where the death toll has climbed to 156.

As the water was receding at some places in Bihar and many people have returned to their homes, the number of relief camps dropped to 624 in which 1.56 lakh people were staying, a state disaster management department official said.

Araria district accounted for 80 deaths, followed by Sitamarhi (43), West Champaran (36), Katihar (35), Madhubani (25), Kisanganj (24), Darbhanga (22), Madhepura (21), East Champaran and Gopalganj (19 each), Supual (16), Purnea (9), Khagaria, Saran and Muzaffarpur (7 each), Sheohar and Saharsa (4 each) and Samastipur district (1).

A total of 3.44 lakh people were being served meals in 1,565 community kitchens which are operational in marooned areas of Bihar, the official said.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar visited the flood-hit areas of East Champaran district and inspected community kitchens in Sugauli, Motihari and Sugaon in the district, an official statement said.

The state weather office has forecast generally cloudy sky with a few spells of rains or thundershowers at some places in the state tomorrow.

Meanwhile, the toll in Uttar Pradesh floods rose to 91 with reports of nine more deaths as the situation remained grim with 24 lakh people affected by the deluge in the state’s eastern districts.

Nearly 57,000 people have taken shelter in relief camps in flood-affected districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh where there was no let up in the situation as waters of rivers emanating from Nepal caused havoc in vast swathes of human habitation, an official said citing a flood report compiled till yesterday.

“The death toll in the floods has reached 91 in the state, where 3,067 villages in 25 districts are inundated, affecting a population of over 24 lakh,” it said.

Twenty-eight companies of the NDRF, 32 companies of the PAC along with two choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and several columns of Army personnel were working in flood-hit districts in the state.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Faizabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Basti and Gorakhpur districts in the state and distributed relief material to flood-hit people.

In Assam, the third wave of devastating flood has so far claimed the lives of 72 people across the state.

According to a Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) report, one person died in Dhubri district in a flood related incident.

It said 4.31 lakh people are affected at present in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Barpeta, Chirang, South Salmara, Goalpara, Morigaon, Nagaon and Golaghat districts.

Authorities are running 128 relief camps and distribution centres in six districts.

Currently, the Brahmaputra river is flowing above the danger mark at Dhubri town, while its tributary, the Dhansiri, at Numaligarh in Golaghat is flowing above the red mark.

However, the situation in parts of the six flood-hit northern districts of West Bengal has improved as the water was receding though several areas in Malda district remained inundated, an official said.

The flood in north Bengal has claimed the lives of at least 90 people while nearly 59 lakh have been affected in the six districts, the official of the state disaster management department said.

Of the 90 dead, 77 drowned, seven died in snake bites, five in wall collapses and one due to electrocution, he said.

According to a disaster management department report, the toll in Uttar Dinajpur district was 36, Dakshin Dinajpur 21, Coochbehar 18, Alipurduar 8 and Jalpaiguri 7, a no deaths due to the deluge in Malda district.

After touring Dakshin Dinajpur, Uttar Dinajpur and Malda districts on Monday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said 152 people have died and 1.5 crore people affected in the 11 districts of the state which were affected by floods.

Over six lakh hectares of crop fields in the six north Bengal districts have been affected and 1,89,161 houses were fully damaged, the state disaster management department official said. — PTI"

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
Faith or duty? Tough call for Premi cops,"Jupinderjit Singh

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 23

It’s a double whammy for a number of Punjab cops who are followers of Dera Sacha Sauda and are on duty to maintain law and order in the wake of tension over a CBI court verdict on August 25 into a rape case against the dera head. Many of these cops have chosen to work instead of going on a leave. “There are a number of policemen who are dera premis. We don’t have a list of such followers, but we all know our colleagues. They are on duty as they are committed to the uniform,” said a senior police officer. The officer, based in Malwa region that has the highest concentration of dera premis, said so far no policeman who was a dera follower had sought leave or exemption from duty. “It is a tough choice. But a cop cannot be emotional. We are on duty and ready to wield stick and fire bullets, if necessary for our commitment to maintain peace,” said a policeman whose family is following the dera for several years. Another follower said he knew that if he chose to take leave on such occasions, he would have to leave the police job. Some senior officers take the presence of dera followers in the police ranks as a boon for effective policing in such sensitive situations. “It is a fact that some of them are proving helpful on containing situation as they act as a bridge between dera followers and the police. They help in negotiations and nip rumours in the bud through their information network,” said a senior police officer."

Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation.

n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health.

n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details.

n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone.

n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you.

n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc.

You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it.

n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour.

n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour.

n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills.

Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

Life insurance: Key to protection and legacy,"Sujoy Manna

India as a country is extremely emotional and family oriented. Our predecessors used to always save up and postpone their wishes so they could plan well for their loved ones' future. Life insurance also has a lot of sentimental value because it is an effort by the life assured to ensure that his loved ones don't have to suffer after his demise. The financial benefit is reaped only by the family. However, due to definite coverage term of term plans in India, there still remains a risk of the benefits not being transferred to the family in case the life assured outlives the policy term. In such a case, their wish to pass on the planned amount i.e sum assured to the loved ones remains unfulfilled. This gap can be filled by products that offer life-long protection. Such a feature would ensure that the family benefits from the deceased's financial planning after he is not around. Moreover, there would be no term of protection. Even if a person dies at an age of 100, the family would receive this sum, hence making it a part of the legacy left behind. Such a product would be apt for people who not only want to compensate for their income after they're gone but also want to leave a lump sum as a legacy for the comfortable living of the beneficiaries.

Legacy protection

Wealth preservation has gained precedence over asset management in recent times, especially taking into account the economic volatility that is prevalent currently in the global market. This creates a greater emphasis on legacy planning in order to transfer wealth to the next generation. This is what most financial advisers don't tell you when they talk about life insurance - legacy planning. It is a financial tool we ideally don't associate with wealth transference, since most of the time it is only viewed as a tool to secure funds for financial obligations or to replace the family's income. But, inherently, life insurance is a legacy. You leave behind wealth for the generations to come, so that they are financially secure. And you can do all of this without compromising your current lifestyle. In a way, we can call it 'legacy protection'.

Conclusion

Finally, as we mentioned earlier, life insurance gives you 'legacy protection'. In many ways, it protects the legacy that you wish to leave for your loved ones, while at the same time makes sure you don't compromise on your present. It not only protects their financial future, but also makes sure they have enough to leave a legacy of their own. The writer is Vice President -Products, HDFC Life.

"Meet Lulu Hashimoto, the living doll","Lulu’s ability to blur the line between reality and fiction has mesmerised fans on social media

Lulu — a full-body doll suit consisting of a wig, a mask and stockings patterned with doll-like joints — was born from one woman’s desire to become cute. “I have always really liked dolls and for me, the epitome of cuteness is dolls,” said the 23-year-old fashion designer Hitomi Komaki, who created Lulu. Dressing up as a mascot, called “kigurumi” in Japanese, is a popular art form in Japan. Komaki has taken it to a new level by creating a body suit that looks like a doll and lets you move like a human. “Many people call my project a fetish, but for me it’s not a fetish but fashion,” she said. “It’s like wearing nice clothes or putting on false eyelashes to become cuter.” There is only one Lulu body suit, Komaki said, but dancers, designers and models are among those who have worn the costume. “The identity of exactly who is inside is secret,” she added.

Turning heads

The stockings worn by Lulu were created by fellow fashion designer Koh Ueno, who airbrushes doll-like joints onto the material. “I want to see women wear these stockings and transform,” said 29-year-old Ueno. “I want them to experience the extraordinary - to become otherworldly, artificial, or like a doll,” he added. While popular among fans of Japanese subculture, Lulu is now turning heads at the annual Miss iD beauty pageant where she is among the 134 semi-finalists chosen from as many as 4,000 entrants. The pageant, which includes “non-human” characters generated by artificial intelligence and three-dimensional computer graphics for the first time, will announce a winner in November. Lulu’s ability to blur the line between reality and fiction has mesmerised fans on social media, where the Lulu Twitter and Instagram accounts have drawn tens of thousands of followers. “I find it miraculous that dolls and humans - two things that exist in different planes - are standing in the same space,” said Erika Kato, 24, who met Lulu for the first time at a recent fan event.

Contact sports may alter brains of athletes,"Toronto

People who play contact sports such as football and hockey — that have higher risk of body collisions — are more likely show changes in their brain structure and function, a study has found.

Researchers at St Michael's Hospital in Canada performed preseason brain scans of 65 varsity athletes — 23 from collision sports (with routine, purposeful body-to-body contact), 22 from contact sports (where contact is allowed, but is not an integral part of the game) and 20 from non-contact sports.

They found that the athletes in collision and contact sports had differences in brain structure, function and chemical markers typically associated with brain injury, compared to athletes in non-contact sports.

There is a growing concern about how participation in contact sports may affect the brain, said lead author Nathan Churchill, a post-doctoral fellow in St Michael's Neuroscience Research Programme.

Most of the research in this area has focused on the long-term effects for athletes in collision sports, such as football and ice hockey, where players may be exposed to hundreds of impacts in a single season.

Less is known about the consequences of participating in contact sports where body-to-body contact is permitted, but is not purposeful, such as football, basketball and field hockey.

This study looked at both men and women from a variety of sports, and found progressive differences between the brains of athletes in non-contact, contact and collision sports.

This included differences in the structure of the brain's white matter — the fibre tracts that connect different parts of the brain and allow them to communicate with one another.

Athletes in sports with higher levels of contact also showed signs of reduced communication between brain areas and decreased activity, particularly within areas involved in vision and motor function, compared to those in non-contact sports, such as volleyball.

However, these differences do not reflect significantly impaired day-to-day functioning, said Tom Schweizer, head of the Neuroscience Research Programme.

The study fills an important gap in understanding how contact affects healthy brains, as a step toward better understanding why a small number of athletes in contact sports show negative long-term health consequences.

The findings were published in the journal Frontiers of Neurology. PTI"

In more trouble for security agencies, lakhs of followers of Dera Sacha Sauda have closed their shops and other business establishments across the state and along with their families, have started moving towards Dera headquarters Sirsa and Panchkula to express solidarity with Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

Sources among Dera followers said that after a discussion, all followers who run various businesses and shops across the state, have closed their establishments and have converged in their respective Nam Charcha Ghars from where they are moving towards Sirsa and Panchkula in small groups.

Premis, as Dera followers are known, from Samana, Patiala and Nabha also shut their shops and left for Panchkula. They say they will camp for the night on the streets and wait for the court verdict tomorrow. Hundreds of them, including women, have left for Panchkula.

“No one asked us to close our shops, but we have decided on our own. I, along with my family, am going to Panchkula to attend the court hearing on Friday,” said Ravinder, a local Dera follower who runs a shop in the main market.

Followers have booked local vehicles. All devotees wear special lockets of the Dera and they have hidden them under their vests.

“All Dera followers have closed their shops and other business establishments on their own without any direction from the Dera. All are moving towards the Sirsa Dera and Panchkula. They have great respect for the court, but they want to express solidarity with the Dera head during the court hearing,” said Harinder Insan Mangwal, a member of 45-member Punjab state executive committee of the Dera."
"Sindhu, Srikanth enter World Championship quarters","Glasgow, August 24

Olympic silver medallist PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth stood just one step away from grabbing a medal each at the World Badminton Championship after entering the quarterfinals of the singles events here on Thursday.

Sindhu, who twice won a bronze medal at the 2013 and 2014 editions, survived a scare against Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi before prevailing 19-21 23-21 21-17 in a thrilling women’s singles match that lasted an hour and 27 minutes.

Not just repairing smiles,"ORTHODONTIST

Tanvir Singh

Dentistry is the branch of medicine that is involved in the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions of the mouth and related structures and tissues, particularly in the jaw and facial area. To meet the ever increasing demands of the dental problems dentistry now possesses seven speciality branches amongst them one is orthodontics. Orthodontics deals with the correction of malocclusion and also provides the preventive treatment that can decrease the need of orthodontic treatment. People requiring orthodontic treatment have malocclusion. The malocclusion can be defined as an occlusion in which there is a malrelationship between the arches in any of the planes or in which there are anomalies in tooth position beyond the normal limits. The malocclusion effects oral health, increases prevalence of dental caries and can cause temporoman dibular joint disorders. Good dental appearance makes people confident and people presumed that it is a step towards success. Because of this fact, demand of orthodontic treatment is increasing.

Role and responsibilities

Modern orthodontic practices have grown largely over the past 20 years reducing the procedures of tooth extractions,, For orthodontic practitioners and following and updating themselves with the latest technology can help you deliver an enhanced level of treatment and amazing results. There are no substitutes for the skilled, experienced, and well-trained orthodontic practitioner. The improvements in tools and techniques enable orthodontists to achieve great results with far less discomfort and in a much shorter treatment time than was ever before possible. Ortho treatment needs to consider not only the severity of malocclusion traits, but also age group and dentition period of the children to be treated . This way, treatment initiated early on during the late mixed dentition or at the beginning of the permanent dentition can avoid further damage to the latter.

Assimilating change

The most important changes in the orthodontic industry is self ligating wires that affect tooth movement. Unlike traditional ligating systems, new passive self-ligating brackets use a slide mechanism that opens to allow the provider to place the wire inside and then close it, creating a slot where the wire is free to glide inside. This approach not only reduces friction and pressure, but also results in more effective forces that make treatment more comfortable for the patient. Inspite of the growing needs of orthodontic treatment required number of skilled orthodontists who are able to practice modern orthodontics are very few. Field of orthodontists is a fast growing branch incorporating modern techniques to decrease the discomfort and at the same time provide best results in less time which helps people to achieve the best smile that one can have. — The writer is a practicing Orthodontist"
Indian-origin fund manager’s insider trading conviction upheld,"New York, August 24

An Indian-origin portfolio manager, who is serving a nine-year jail term for his role in the most lucrative insider trading scheme in the US, has lost his bid to overturn his conviction after an appeals court ruled that there was “overwhelming” evidence against him.

Mathew Martoma, 43, was convicted in 2014 for his role as the “central figure” in the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever charged involving $275 million in illegal profits.

Martoma, who had changed his name from Ajai Mathew Thomas, had served as a portfolio manager of CR Intrinsic Investors, a division of hedge fund behemoth SAC Capital, led by billionaire Steven Cohen.

Martoma had been charged with collecting confidential information about a high-profile Alzheimer’s drug trial from two doctors and making profits and avoiding losses of 275 million dollars for SAC Capital.

In appealing against the conviction, Martoma argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction but a three-judge bench at the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision yesterday that the “government presented overwhelming evidence that at least one tipper received a financial benefit from providing confidential information to Martoma.”

Former US Attorney Preet Bharara had led the government’s case against Martoma and his successor at the Southern District of New York Acting US Attorney Joon Kim welcomed the Second Circuit’s affirmation of the conviction.

“We are gratified by the Second Circuit’s affirmation of Mathew Martoma’s conviction. The strength of our securities markets rests on their integrity and fairness.” “And the successful prosecution of those who cheat by trading on illegally obtained inside information, as Martoma did to the tune of over USD 275 million, is critical to maintaining that integrity and fairness in our markets,” Kim said in a statement.

SAC had pleaded guilty to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle the criminal and civil charges against it. It changed its name to Point72 Asset Management and now only manages the personal wealth of its founder Cohen, who has not been criminally charged.

It was alleged that Martoma’s entire success across his four years at SAC Capital was based on illegal insider trading.

Days after beginning his employment at SAC Capital, Martoma began searching for doctors who would be willing to provide him access to confidential information about an Alzheimer’s disease drug trial conducted by Elan Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Corporation.

Prosecutors had alleged that Martoma exploited his personal and financial relations with doctor Sidney Gilman who chaired the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) for the trial.

Martoma obtained inside information about the drug trial that Gilman learned at the SMC meetings and through other communications with drug companies Elan and Wyeth. The judges said in the ruling Gilman, over the course of approximately 18 months and 43 paid consultation sessions for which he billed $1,000 an hour, regularly and intentionally provided Martoma with confidential information from the bapineuzumab clinical trial.

Q. I am in BBA second year at present. I am very keen to pursue a PG degree in International Relations (MA in International Relations). Is it necessary to have subjects like history and political science in graduation to get admission in the MA course in IR? Should I switch to bachelor's in these subjects or in mass communication to be eligible for the master's course or continue with BBA? I am ready to lose one year of my BBA degree for this purpose. Which are the top colleges /universities for Masters degree in International Relations in India and what will be the job prospects for me post this degree?— priyanka khanna A.International Relations is a field of study that combines political science with the intricacies of globalisation, terrorism, ecological sustainability and global finance. Which means that besides political history your programme in IR will be a dynamic mix of political history, economics, foreign policy, anthropology and sociology with a major focus on nations, states and governments. Although International Relations forms part of the Master’s in Political Science programmes offered at a large number of universities, a relatively fewer number of universities offer a specific Master’s in IR: Selection to most of the reputed university departments is done on the basis of an entrance test. As long as you can tackle that, you should be fine. If you’re already in the second year, there’s no need to drop a year. Just get hold of the previous year’s papers and start reading up on the subject. As for career prospects, many top foreign correspondents and political journalists, diplomats, teachers, area study experts, researchers and analysts in MNCs hold a degree in this subject. And as the world becomes smaller and more interconnected place, the field of IR has increased in scope and gained greater significance. As a consequence, those aspiring to work in the areas of Peace & Conflict Resolution, Area Studies, International Justice, International Economic Development, Humanitarian Relief, Human Rights Advocacy, Political and Economic Risk Analysis would also find it useful.

Leave me alone,"The Supreme Court has made the right to privacy a fundamental right. So, will it work in letter and spirit? Well-known faces from the region share their take

Jasmine Singh

The Oxford dictionary defines privacy as a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people,; now, the word finds an approval from the Supreme Court, which, in a verdict on Thursday, passed the ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right. Chief Justice JS Khehar said the ‘right to privacy’ is intrinsic to the ‘right to life’ and is hence a part of Article 21, Part 3, of the Constitution of India. The verdict, though slightly ambiguous in nature, has got thumbs-up from the film fraternity, politicians and from the general public. In a country like ours, where the next-door- aunty keeps a tab on your coming and going out timings, where paparazzi chase celebrities to death, where one can draw hints about your private life from the social media...declaring ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right is a praiseworthy step. What needs to be seen now is how it safeguards privacy!

Private life

“Privacy is part of our liberty, part of freedom, which must be respected; it helps people make better decisions and safeguard our family,” shares filmmaker Amit Prasher, who reminds us of the one-line answer that actors and actresses have in response to whom are they dating or if they were seen with someone – ‘It’s my personal life’. “No one has any right to question them or print their personal pictures on social networking sites,” he adds. Amit has raised a valid concern but with celebrities willing to share their personal pictures on social networking sites, it is all a bit chaotic. “Celebrities want to share their pictures all the time and then they want to guard their privacy fiercely,” says Mandy M, singer-actor. Mandy is also of the opinion that the verdict might curtail the loose talk that people do about celebrities on social media; morphing pictures, writing about their personal choices.

Right choice

One of the key conclusions of the judgement is that privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacy, the sanctity of family life, marriage, home, procreation and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes right to be left alone. Dhananjay Mangalmukhi, first transgender student at Panjab University, draws our attention to this point. “It is my business what I do in my bedroom; whom I stay with, what I wear, is my right. Tomorrow, they can even install cameras in washrooms, which will be total violation of privacy.” Vivek Trivedi, Chandigarh-based social worker, however, has his concerns. “We already have six fundamental rights that are violated on a daily basis. Right to privacy will only hold some value if there is a law backing it, which will allow prosecution, otherwise this will be another fundamental right with exceptions.”""Privacy is part of our liberty, part of freedom, which must be respected; it helps people make better decisions and safeguard our family. ""

Great verdict

""I am truly overwhelmed by the Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy and the parts of the judgement which specifically mention that sexual orientation should be a guaranteed right under the Constitution. This is a big day for the LGBTQ community in India, who have been fighting for their rights for over two decades. This verdict vindicates our appeal for equal rights as citizens of India. I feel truly happy and free.""

83% metro residents feel life has become more uncertain: Survey,"Mumbai, August 20

A vast majority of people living in metros feel more uncertain about their lives compared to their non-metro peers, says a survey.

Concern over uncertainty is high across the country and has increased in the last four years. As much as 83 per cent of those living in the metros feel more uncertain about their lives compared to 67 per cent in non-metros, it said.

The online survey was conducted by Birla Sun Life Insurance among 1,540 people in the age-group of 15-22 years.

In contrast, 77 per cent of the surveyed metro residents had felt in 2013 that their life had become uncertain, while the figure for non-metros was 68 per cent.

As per the survey, women are more uncertain about their lives compared to men and their worries have increased over the last four years.

Three major categories of uncertainties are self and family; wealth and savings; and dreams and goals.

However, child’s future emerged as the top concern, followed by focus on self. Financial goals also feature in the top five priority list.

Men are most uncertain about child’s education, whereas for women, protecting their health and having an active life tops the chart.

The report said there is increased awareness about the need to protect family against uncertainties.

Around 76 per cent of the people surveyed were aware of the need to protect their families against uncertainties.

The awareness is equal among both metro and non-metro residents, it said. PTI"
"Not allowed to protest, Punjab AAP MLAs break police cordon","Ravi Singh

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 24

AAP MLAs from Punjab, led by Leader of Opposition Sukhpsl Singh Khaira, were on Thursday detained by the Delhi Police after they tried to break the police cordon.

The MLAs were denied permission to proceed from Punjab Bhawan to the residence of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal to stage a dharna by the Delhi Police.

The MLAs staged a sit in protest outside Punjab Bhawan against the police move.

Khaira said the decision to hold a dharna outside Harsimrat's residence was against the Centre's decision to extend special tax concessions to the hill states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand for 10 more years.

He alleged 30,000 small and medium size industrial units in Punjab have either closed down or shifted to the nearby hill states.

Khaira said the agitation outside Harsimrat's residence was to expose the alleged double standards of the Shiromani Akali Dal.

He said Harsimrat Badal was signatory to the decision of the Cabinet to extend special tax concessions to the hill states. He said: “The AAP wants the Centre to rollback its decision to extend special tax concessions to the hill states or else grant the same benefits to Punjab.”

He said that if this does not happen, then the SAD should break ties with the BJP.

Khaira also criticised Punjáb Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh for not taking up the matter with the Centre.

The MLAs were detained while they tried to break the police cordon. The MLAs were taken in a bus and left at nearby Jantar Mantar area. Baring three MLAs, all others were present."

Rocky rocks!,"MOVIE REVIEW - ROCKY MENTAL

Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill. Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment. The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill. Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise. Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man. Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed. The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots. Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

"Astronaut urine may be recycled into nutrients, plastic","Washington

Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make long duration space trips more feasible.

Astronauts cannot take a lot of spare parts into space because every extra ounce adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape the Earth's gravity.

""If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we will need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them. Atom economy will become really important,"" said Mark A Blenner, from the Clemson University in the US.

The solution lies in part with the astronauts themselves, who will constantly generate waste from breathing, eating and using materials.

Unlike people on Earth, Blenner said, spacefarers would not want to throw any waste molecules away.

Researchers are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.

Some essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, have a shelf life of just a couple of years, said Blenner.

They will need to be made en route, beginning a few years after launch, or at the destination.

""Having a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing what they need, when they need it, is the motivation for our project,"" Blenner said.

The biological system includes a variety of strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. These organisms require both nitrogen and carbon to grow.

Researchers discovered that the yeast could obtain their nitrogen from urea in untreated urine. Meanwhile, the yeast obtains its carbon from CO2, which could come from astronauts' exhaled breath, or from the Martian atmosphere.

However, to use CO2, the yeast requires a middleman to 'fix' the carbon into a form they can ingest.

For this purpose, the yeast relies on photosynthetic cyanobacteria or algae provided by the researchers.

One of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers. Those polymers could then be used in a 3D printer to generate new plastic parts.

Researchers are continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerised into different types of polyesters with a range of properties.

For now, the engineered yeast strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients, but the scientists are working on boosting output.

They are also looking into applications here on Earth, in fish farming and human nutrition. For example, fish raised via aquaculture need to be given omega-3 fatty acid supplements, which could be produced by Blenner's yeast strains. PTI"

"Global challenges, local solutions","American students travelling through India realise answers to climate change could well be within us

Neha Kirpal

Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.” These oft-repeated lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner hold true in these times more than they ever did. Water is scarce, and not just in the third world. Its repercussions are being experienced across the globe. This is what a group of 25 young high school students — 20 from the US and five from rural and tribal communities in India — found out while travelling through Delhi, Agra and Ladakh in a unique ‘learning through travel’ programme recently. The programme, spread out over three weeks in July, aimed to make potential future leaders socially, culturally and responsibly global citizens. Leadership collective 360Plus, theatre group Junoon and travel services provider Voygr brought together the teenagers from more than 15 diverse geographies and demographics. The theme for the year was climate change, its affects and global challenges. This was the first year that Indian students participated along with students from the US. The group first embarked upon heritage walks around old Delhi. During the old Delhi tour, they were taken to the fascinating Ugrasen ki Baoli. A step well that is used to hold water for villagers, the baoli has been around for about six centuries. Fascinated by the structure, Daviontea Bass, a student from Chicago, did a little research for herself and shared it with us. “Baolis were made around the country in hotter places because people needed a cool place to chill, swim, sleep and eat,” she observed and was surprised that they were still functioning. There were the usual tourist spots too, but not without that twist of education. Take the trip to Taj Mahal, for instance. Farhan Mashud, a student from New York, was fascinated to discover the importance of water in building and maintaining the structure of the historic monument. “It was interesting to know that the monument was built on wells that contained water and were filled with wood. This is said to have increased the life of the wooden foundation,” he said. Two artist facilitators travelled throughout with the students and took them through art processes and workshops that stimulate enquiry, reflection, exploration, perspective and expression. Sanjna Kapoor, co-founder Junoon, said, “To get a chance to work with this group of youngsters and artists together to explore the implications of climate change in our lives is a beautiful way of creating learning opportunities.” While they had heard about how climate change is directly affecting Ladakh in a session on climate change with environmental activist Dr Vandana Shiva, it was only after a visit there that they realised what it meant. Ladakh, with decreasing snowfall, melting glaciers and prolonged summers, is one of the frontiers of the climate change debate. After acclimatising to the altitude, the group got to spend some time at the eco-friendly Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) campus. Located on the banks of Indus river, the mountainous Hemis National Park in the background and a clear night sky, it made for the perfect place to live in the midst of nature. Here, students from the Leadership Collective gave talks, presentations and English conversation classes to local students. The group noticed that the river was swollen by seasonal snowmelt and its chocolate colour was indicative of pollution. However, when the students tested a water sample from the river, it was negative for nitrites, nitrates and had healthy levels of iron and hardness. It was refreshing to see that even though access to water is rapidly changing in the region, the river continues to remain relatively pristine. Through the three-and-half week journey, the group experienced bonding, learning and contemplating together on themes that impact the world. From changing spring sources in rural California, seminars about green economics in San Francisco, the drying of the Agressan ki Baoli in Delhi and the staining of the Taj Mahal in Agra, the students were able to see the connections… and maybe find some answers too."
Indian-origin CEO racially abused by Trump supporters in US,"New York, August 23

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump's Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

. @RavinGandhi1 I am told on a daily basis to go back to India. Like you, I was born here and proud of my roots. Thanks for speaking out. — Ameya Pawar (@Ameya_Pawar_IL) August 22, 2017

""I recently told the New York Times I was 'rooting' for certain aspects of Trump's economic agenda,"" Gandhi wrote in the op-ed.

""After Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don't look like him.""

Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters.

Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should ""get your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.""

The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take ""that other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,"" referring to the US envoy to the UN.

""She's (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don't tell us that you gave him a chance. We don't give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We're going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,"" the woman said.

In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should ""go clean up your own (expletive) country, it's a filthy mess.""

Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said.

""It was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,"" he said. ""I wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.""

""Even though my race is a complete non-issue in my day- to-day life, the sad reality is there's a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,"" he said in the report.

""I wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there's this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected.""

Gandhi added that the fact that Trump ""equated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up"" as he called Trump's moral leadership on the issue ""reprehensible.""

He said while his sharing a ""bigoted"" voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so.

""My heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let's be honest — I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I'm suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don't have resources really are suffering.""

"Now, make a privacy law","Madabhushi Sridhar

A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court, in a path-breaking judgment ruled that the right to privacy is a fundamental right, like the right to life. This verdict will impact national and global jurisprudence on privacy vis-a-vis information-based economy and governance.

Madabhushi Sridhar

THE basic concept and definition of privacy rendered by Justice BP Jeevan Reddy in the Rajgopal case (1994) and the emphatic dissent of Justice Subbarao in the MP Sharma case formed the solid basis of the nine-judge bench recognising and declaring that the right to privacy is the intrinsic part of life under Article 21 and a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Now the Aadhaar link has to be decided on the Aadhaar of this unanimous order of the Supreme Court. Justice Chandrachud referred to the landmark order of Justice Jeevan Reddy, who said: “The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. It is a 'right to be let alone'. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his home, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent — whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. The position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy”. Recently, in the Ram Jethmalani case, the Supreme Court held the revelation of the details of the bank accounts of individuals without the establishing wrongdoing would be a violation of the right to privacy. The judges cited catena of orders from India and abroad to explain how privacy assumed fundamental importance as a basic right. This judgment will have a significant impact on the Government's Aadhaar scheme, under which the state is collecting huge personal details and biometrics to identify beneficiaries for accessing social benefits under various welfare schemes. The question that another five-judge bench of Supreme Court is going to decide is: Whether the Aadhaar programme is a breach of privacy, informational autonomy and bodily integrity? The Union contended that the right to privacy was not fundamental, while four state governments — Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab and Puducherry —where non-BJP political parties are ruling, opposed the Centre's contention and pleaded for the right of privacy. The Maharastra government said that it is a concept and not a stand-alone right. This landmark declaration that it is a fundamental like the right to life will impact national and global jurisprudence on privacy vis-à-vis information-based economy and governance. The Supreme Court overruled its earlier verdicts in MP Sharma and Kharak Singh. As an eight-member bench in MP Sharma decided against the fundamental right status of privacy, this nine-member bench was necessitated. The Supreme Court prepositions subsequent to the Kharak Singh case were held to be correct position in law. The Attorney General's argument of doubtful status of privacy based on the Supreme Court orders in the MP Sharma and Kharak Singh cases was rejected emphatically. In MP Singh, the Supreme Court held that a power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence an overriding power of the State for the protection of social security and that power is necessarily regulated by law. The Court felt that the Constitution makers did not subject the regulation by law of the power of search and seizure to a fundamental right of privacy. The decision in the Kharak Singh case held that clause (b) of Regulation 236, which provided for domiciliary visits at night, was violative of Article 21. The bench observed that Kharak Singh regards the sanctity of the home and the protection against unauthorised intrusion an integral element of “ordered liberty”. The Supreme Court agreed with the dissent of Justice Subbarao in Kharak Singh. He held that the rights conferred by Part III have overlapping areas. Where a law is challenged as infringing the right to freedom of movement under Article 19(1) (d) and the liberty of the individual under Article 21, it must satisfy the tests laid down in Article 19 (2) as well as the requirements of Article 21. Justice Subba Rao recognised a constitutionally protected right to privacy, considering it as an ingredient of personal liberty. Justice Chandrachud' draft was signed by Chief Justice Khehar, Justices RK Agrawal, Abdul Nazeer, and approved by Justices Chalameshwar, S A Bobde, R F Nariman, Abhay Manohar Sapre, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, by separate judgments. Referring to the informational privacy, he says: “In aggregation, they disclose the nature of the personality: food habits, language, health, hobbies, sexual preferences, friendships, ways of dress and political affiliation. In aggregation, information provides a picture of the being: of things which matter and those that don't, of things to be disclosed and those best hidden”. The bench finally cautioned that the judicial recognition of the existence of a constitutional right of privacy is not an exercise in the nature of amending the Constitution nor is the Court embarking on a constitutional function of that nature which is entrusted to Parliament. The Parliament has to perform its constitutional obligation of making a law on this vital point. Such a law if made should not encroach upon privacy, and if it does it has to withstand the touchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental rights. Such a law shall stipulate a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. Thus, a law of privacy with reasonable restrictions to advance security and public interest is the need of the hour."

SDM Khamano Isha Singal held a meeting with prominent residents of the area and appealed to them to help the administration in dealing with the situation if need arises. She appealed to them to educate the masses to maintain peace. DSP Khamano Gurmeet Singh Singh said the police are maintaining a vigil and required number of police personnel and para-military forces have been deployed at main points.

Heavy police force in Jagraon

Jagraon: Heavy police force has been deployed in Jagraon as well as the surrounding areas. The situation kept the police authorities on toes throughout the day. Apart from Jagraon, tight security arrangements have been made in rural areas, where the number of dera followers is considerably high.

Apart from the local police, several companies of paramilitary forces have also been deployed to keep the situation under control. SSP Jagraon Surjit Singh said: “We have asked the Dera followers to practice restraint and be careful of rumours that can create tension. The dera followers have assured us that they will not create any law and order problem.” There is heavy police and paramilitary forces’ deployment at the entry and exit points of almost all villages. A flag march was also carried out in the city. Amid reports that dera followers could stock petrol, lathis and other weapons at naam charcha ghar, the SSP has asked top police officials to be alert. “No one will be allowed to disturb the peace and law and order situation in the state. Anyone found trying to disturb the peace of the state would be strictly dealt with,” the SSP said.

Silence outside naam charcha ghar near Malakpur village

Khanna: There is complete silence in and around the naam charcha ghar situated on the Khanna-Bhari Road near Malakpur village and there is no gathering of premis inside as well. As per the SSP, there are only some sewadars inside. It is under strict watchfulness and four nakas have been set up around it. Security has been tightened in Khanna police district. Nakas have been put up on all key points and a large number of police personnel and paramilitary forces are on guard at these nakas. A fire brigade and an ambulance have been stationed outside the naam charcha ghar apart from the police personnel guarding the nakas around this site.

SSP Khanna NS Mahal said four companies of paramilitary forces including that of the Border Security Force and CRPF have been called and deployed at key points along with police teams. Meanwhile, Samrala SDM Amit Bamby said they have taken requisite steps and were ready to deal with any eventuality although he said there was no naam charcha ghar in their jurisdiction.

Security up at naam charcha ghar in Jagera village

Mandi Ahmedgarh: The rank and file in the police and civil administration remained on toes completing proactive measures for handling any unsavory situation on Friday, when the CBI court in Panchkula is expected to pronounce the verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh. Besides enhancing security at naam charcha ghar at Jagera village on the Ludhiana-Malerkotla highway and one near Jalaldiwal village on the Raikot-Barnala road, the administration organised flag marches at Ahmedgarh and Raikot to boost the morale of residents. Circle officers Rachhpal Singh Dhindsa, Parminder Singh Cheema and SS Dhanoa lead the marches in their respective areas. Peace meetings were organised by SDM Ahmedgarh Dr Preety Yadav and SDM Raikot Kannu Thind at various localities falling under their jurisdiction. Apprehending clashes between premis and the security forces, the administration advised all in charge, managers and owners of government and private hospitals to supplement and update arrangements to meet any emergency. Executive Magistrate Badal Deen advised senior functionaries at the hospital to ensure that no doctor or member of paramedical staff is absent from duty without reason. Meanwhile, uneasiness prevailed in the region. Though the situation was near normal till last week, it became charged after some of the office-bearers and activists of regional units of the Dera Sacha Sauda declared to adopt do or die policy in case the verdict of the court turns out to be against the dera chief. However, a majority of senior dera followers and premis have already left for Sirsa and Panchkula with an intent to show solidarity with the counterparts from other parts of the state. — Mahesh Sharma

"Citing Dera tension, verdict on 2 cases against Rampal deferred","Deepender Deswal

Tribune News Service

Hisar, August 24

A local court on Thursday deferred a verdict in two criminal cases against self-styled godman Rampal to August 29.

Rampal has been in jail since a violent confrontation with the police in November 2014 at Satlok Ashram near Barwala. The court fixed the next date after the Hisar Police requested it citing tension in Haryana in view of the hearing on Dera Sacha Sauda sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

The court of Judicial Magistrate (first class) Mukesh Kumar has completed the process of evidence in the FIR numbers 426 and 427 registered in Barwala police station on November 17 and November 18 in 2015, respectively.

Rampal had resisted the police operation to arrest him on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court while holed up inside his Satlok Ashram in Barwala town of Hisar. The standoff turned violent resulting in death of five persons and injuries to several others.

Among the accused are Rampal and some of his key associates, including Purshotam Dass , Rajkumar, Mahinder Singh, Rajender Singh and Rajkapoor.

Rampal is presently lodged in Hisar district jail.

Sources said the accused were facing charges under Sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC in the two criminal cases. The court can deliver the verdict in both the cases today."

Dehradun, August 24

Vulture conservationists have stressed on the need to form state Vulture Conservation Action Plan to protect the species as electrocution continues to be a major threat to them in Uttarakhand.

A study conducted by researchers of Doon University and Himalayan Institute for sustainable Environment and Research Society during January 2015 to August 2017 states that more than 100 vultures, including Himalayan and Egyptian vultures were electrocuted in Dehradun and Haridwar districts during last winter.

The state provides suitable habitat for eight vulture species out of nine found

in India. Of these eight species, three have been categorised as critically endangered, one endangered, three near threatened and one as least concern.

The survey managed to record 7 vulture species except the critically endangered, slender-billed vulture. Among these seven recorded species, the numbers of white-backed vulture population were found to be low while the near-threatened Himalayan vulture, a winter migrant, had the maximum population. The Egyptian vulture was also found in good numbers from Kalsi to Tanakpur.

Khima Nand Balodi, who led the study, attributed carcass dumping near high voltage power transmission lines as the major reason behind vulture electrocution.

“Dead livestock are dumped by contractors and farmers near high voltage power transmission lines. Also, the municipal solid waste dumping sites are in the vicinity of the powerlines. This makes vultures vulnerable to electrocution,” argued Balodi.

The study stressed on need to draft a comprehensive plan—Uttarakhand State Vulture Conservation Action Plan—for long term conservation of the specie. It also suggested initiation of awareness and outreach programmes in the state.

The study was supported by Conservation Leadership Programme and Oriental Bird Club, UK, among others.

"AAP, with NRIs’ help, adopts debt-ridden farmers; gives them aid","Varinder Singh

Tribune News Service

Bathinda, August 23

With the help of NRIs, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has come to the rescue of beleaguered families of those farmers who committed suicides due to debt caused by farm loans in Punjab.

The AAP alleged that the Centre and the state government were responsible for the plight of the farmers and farm labourers in the country and have launched “Peedat Kisan Khet Mazdoor Muhim” movement to help them.

Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Wednesday disbursed one-time financial aid of Rs 50,000 each to 20 families whose male members had committed suicides in the Malwa region.

“The party has adopted 50 other such families and they would be given a monthly aid of Rs 2,500 for a period of at least five years from today onwards,” Khaira said.

While, 50 families have been “adopted” by two California-based doctors, Dr Harjeet Singh Gill and Sangram Singh Gill from Jhingar Kalan village near Dasuya, through the AAP, the one-time financial help of Rs 50,000 each for the 20 suicide victim families of the Malwa region has been extended by NRIs based in the US, Canada, the UK and other countries.

Khaira said: “The party is not in a position to get the farm loans waived or to compensate any loss of life, but it has taken an initiative to motivate the NRIs and other people to come and help distressed farmers at a time when the Central and the state governments have “failed” to provide any relief to them.”

“We are not doing a favour on farmers, but it is our duty. There are more than 50 lakh Punjabi NRIs. If each of them comes out with a help of just one dollar they would roughly be contributing a good amount of Rs 35 crore for the help of small and marginal farmers. I urge all NRIs and people belonging to all sections of the society to come forward and help these farmers,” said Khaira after handing over cheques to farm-suicide victims.

He said: “The BJP Government has turned a blind eye towards big industrial houses and influential families who owes Rs 2 lakh crore to banks and financial institutions. But it cannot waive farm loans, which is around Rs 1 lakh crore. If the government can extend special tax concessions to the hill states then why can’t it help farmers.”

Khaira alleged that more than 200 Punjab farmers have committed suicides during the five-month-old Congress rule in the state.

“Farmers and farm labourers are increasing taking to suicide path for they have got frustrated over false promises made by the Congress just for the sake of usurping power in Punjab. Capt Amarinder Singh already knew that Punjab owed a huge Rs 2 lakh crore debt well before the Punjab Assembly polls. Still, he went ahead with his promises of complete waiving of loans of farmers in the run-up to the polls. Now, the Congress is washing its hands off by saying that Punjab has no money for complete payment of farm loans,” Khaira said.

AAP co-convener Aman Arora and MLAs, Prof Baljinder Kaur, Rupinder Kaur Ruby and Najar Singh, were also present."
"Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat crash out of World Wrestling Championship","Paris, August 24

Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik crashed out in the first round while compatriot Vinesh Phogat’s campaign also ended in a whimper as Indian grapplers continued with dismal show at World Wrestling Championship.

After three listless days, the onus was on Sakshi and Vinesh to end India’s medal drought but both failed to live up to the expectations.

Sakshi and Vinesh went down in their respective Round of 16 bouts.

Sakshi was stunned by Luisa Niemesch of Germany 1-3 in women’s 60kg, while two-time junior world champion Victoria Anthony of USA got a fall over Vinesh Phogat in 48kg. It was a humiliating defeat for Vinesh, who was unfortunately injured during the Rio Olympics.

This was after Vinesh had earlier won her qualification round.

Other Indians in the fray today—Sheetal Tomar (53kg) and Navjot Kaur (69kg) — also bowed out of the tournament with contrasting performances.

Navjot was beaten 5-10 by Mongolia’s Ochirbat Nasanburmaa in 69kg, but surprisingly lesser-known Sheetal emerged as the lone Indian woman wrestler to win her Round of 16 round when he got the better of Jessica Mcbain of Australia 10-0 in 53kg.

However, Sheetal could not maintain her rhythm and lost the quarterfinals against Estera Dobre of Romania, going down 2-4.

There were high expectations from Sakshi, who became the first Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal at the Rio Games last year but she hardly put up a fight today against a lower-ranked opponent.

Sakshi had recently climbed up a division to 60kg category at the Asian Championship in May this year, after her successful stint at the Olympics in 58kg.

The 24-year-old had finished with a silver medal at the Asian Championship and decided to compete in the 60kg weight division here as well.

However, it was all over for Sakshi in the opening round itself.

Now India’s only hope are the men’s freestyle wrestlers, especially Asian champion Bajrang Punia (65kg) and Olympian Sandeep Tomar (57kg) on the last two remaining days of the tournament.

A 24-member Indian contingent had been attending special training sessions at de Bercy’s wrestling centre in Boulevard de Bercy borough here since August 6 but the grapplers do not seem to have benefitted by the rigorous practice much. — PTI"

Washington

A NASA rocket mission is set to form white artificial clouds that will glow in the night sky, to study disturbances in the upper atmosphere that interfere with communication and technology systems.

The artificial clouds will be visible to residents of the Republic of the Marshall Islands during two rocket flights to occur between August 29 and September 9, the US space agency said.

The Waves and Instabilities from a Neutral Dynamo (WINDY) mission will study a phenomenon that occurs in the ionosphere - a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere.

Known as equatorial spread F (ESF) these disturbances occur after sunset at latitudes near the equator in part of the ionosphere known as the F region.

The disturbances interfere with radio communication, navigation and imaging systems and pose a hazard to technology and society that depends on it.

The WINDY mission consists of two NASA suborbital sounding rockets that will be launched nearly simultaneously in a window between 8 and 11 pm local time from August 29 through September 9 from the island of Roi-Namur .

The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands is near the magnetic equator, where post-sunset ionosphere storms are more intense, making the site an ideal location for these studies, NASA said.

One rocket will carry a substance called tri-methyl aluminium (TMA), which will form the white artificial clouds that glow in the night sky.

Scientists on the ground photograph the movement of these clouds to measure the winds and energetic particles that are in motion in the upper atmosphere. The clouds are expected to be visible for about 30 minutes.

The first rocket launched, a two-stage 47-foot long Black Brant IX rocket, will carry and release both TMA and lithium.

The release of the lithium vapours is not visible to the naked-eye but can be viewed with special cameras on the ground.

Both TMA and lithium, which are harmless to residents on the ground when released at these altitudes, move with the atmospheric winds and can therefore be used to determine the wind speeds and direction over the area where these ionosphere storms are occurring.

TMA reacts spontaneously on contact with oxygen to produce a pale white glow visible from the ground.

For the WINDY mission, sunlight reflected by the Moon, will illuminate lithium producing an emission that can be detected with cameras equipped with narrow-band filters.

Using moonlight allows the launches to occur later in the evening when the critical ESF conditions occur.

The second rocket, a two-stage 36-foot long Terrier- Malemute, will be launched five minutes after the first rocket.

It will carry instruments to measure ionosphere densities and electric and magnetic fields present in these storms.

The ionosphere is defined as the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is ionised by solar and cosmic radiation.

Ionisation occurs when incoming energetic radiation strips electrons from atoms and molecules, creating temporarily charged particles. —PTI"
"5,000 cops to stand guard in city","Chandigarh, August 23

Around 5,000 cops will stand guard in Chandigarh on August 25, when the special CBI court in Panchkula will pronounce its verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. The UT police will also seal its borders with Panchkula and Mohali to restrict dera followers from entering the city. UT DGP TS Luthra said intelligence was being gathered about the arrival of the dera followers in the city. He said the police was in constant touch with the followers, who had been asked to maintain peace in the city. The DGP said while 5,000 police personnel would be deployed across the city, there would be a standby reserve force, which will act if required. “All important roads, entry points, bus stands and the railway station are under surveillance. Those arriving in the city are being checked,” the DGP said. The leave of all police personnel has been cancelled to ensure that there are enough cops on duty to maintain law and order. A flag march was also carried out by the Chandigarh Police at the Industrial Area and near the railway station in the morning and near the Sector 38 gurdwara in the evening. Buses entering the city from Mohali, Zirakpur and Panchkula were stopped and checked. The DGP said videographers would be deployed at all sensitive places on August 25. — TNS"
SC verdict on privacy a major blow to fascist forces: Rahul,"New Delhi, August 24

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday welcomed the Supreme Court verdict upholding the right to privacy as a fundamental right and said it was “a major blow to fascist forces” and a rejection of the BJP’s ideology of “suppression through surveillance”.

SC decision marks a major blow to fascist forces.A sound rejection of the BJP's ideology of suppression through surveillance#RightToPrivacy — Office of RG (@OfficeOfRG) August 24, 2017

The judgment was a “victory for every Indian”, Gandhi said on Twitter.

“Welcome the SC verdict upholding Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of individual’s liberty, freedom and dignity.

""The SC decision marks a major blow to fascist forces,” he tweeted.

It was a “sound rejection” of the BJP’s ideology of “suppression through surveillance”, Gandhi said.

In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously declared that the right to privacy was a fundamental right under the Constitution.

A nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar ruled that the right was “an intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and the entire Part III of the Constitution”.

The ruling on the highly contentious issue dealt with petitions challenging the Centre’s move to make Aadhaar mandatory for people seeking to benefit from various social welfare schemes. PTI"
Go the genome way,"Gauri Chhabra

One of the quickest growing fields in bio-medical science is that of Genome Sequencing. It deals with the study of biological changes in living organisms. It is the branch of biotechnology that deals with the study of cells, structural and functional unit of living organisms. Nearly every cell in the human body — from the ones in the fingernails to the ones deep inside the brain-contains a complete set of DNA, the operating instructions that influence everything from a person’s hair colour to susceptibility to disease. For years, doctors have been able to test specific genes to detect the presence of mutations associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. But only recently have scientists been able to map out a person’s entire genetic code, or genome, by sequencing all 20,000 or so genes in one fell swoop. There has been a huge movement in affordable rapid genome sequencing recently and this will produce massive numbers of new genetic data on individuals, as well as populations. The challenge is now on for a new generation of scientists who are able to combine genetics and bioinformatics in an effort to understand how various genomic changes can cause life-threatening diseases such as cancer. This will enable the development of new treatments, through combining drug and gene therapy, along with prevention strategies.

Getting in

If you are interested in getting admission in bachelor courses, you have to complete higher secondary examination with physics, chemistry & biology. The duration of this course is three years. Some colleges also conduct an aptitude test for admission in genetics course. To get admission in master’s course, you must have done a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field from any recognised college or university. Some institutions also give admission in genetic courses on the basis of the merit list of the qualifying examination.

Career Scape

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors collect and analyse data about patients’ medical and genetic histories. You will also provide information and help families and individuals about the occurrence, risk and minimisation of inherited diseases. You can also have job duties in areas such as administration, research, teaching and lab work. Institutions such as hospitals, universities, laboratories, research facilities and government agencies can employ genetic counselors. Laboratory Geneticists: These are specialists in genetics with relation to laboratory medicine and DNA testing. You will research genetic material to assist and work for agricultural, pharmaceutical, clinical medicine and law enforcement organisations. Many laboratory geneticists have 4-6 years of postsecondary education, while lab directors may hold either a Ph.D. or an MD degree Clinical Geneticists: Clinical geneticists are generally licensed physicians, and may also be involved in the field of medical genetics. You can be specialised in areas such as oncology, pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology, and work in hospitals, medical centers or other research centers. In addition, clinical geneticists may manage a team of genetic counselors and work together to help identify and minimise the risk factors for certain hereditary diseases. Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors play a key role in helping patients and their families get the care that’s right for them. Genetic counselors work with doctors and other members of the health care team to help patients understand what their family history means to them, decide what genetic tests to have, and know how to use the test results to make the best treatment choices. This is especially helpful today as medicine becomes more personalised, and treatment plans increasingly are tailored to a patient’s individual needs.

The road ahead

What is Genome Sequencing?

The technique that allows researchers to read and decipher the genetic information found in the DNA of anything from bacteria to plants to animals is called genome sequencing.

Genomics involves measuring everything about a genome and the changes between genomes.

Genome sequencing involves the determination of the order of DNA bases. You may be wondering what makes these bases so important. In a strand of DNA, there are some simple units known as nucleotides. These nucleotides have a 'backbone' that consists of sugars and a phosphate group.

Commonly used techniques in genomics are DNA sequencing, microarrays, and PCR.

Genomics is being increasingly used in medicine to help diagnose disease since an individual’s DNA sequence can provide insights into the potential for developing specific diseases.

Genomics is one of many ""-omics"" disciplines that is becoming more prominent in biotechnology and research as a whole.

Discoveries in this field often allign with innovations in the technologies available to conduct analysis and perform sequencing or assays.

The very basic unit of the human genome is a single DNA nucleotide. This nucleotide is made up of minuscule atoms, which create a challenge for even an advanced microscope to be used for detection. Researchers still, however, need to be able to determine the sequence of bases in DNA.

Twitter can help track opioid misuse,"New York

Researchers have found that Twitter can be a useful tool to find out how widespread the misuse of prescribed opioid drug is in a particular state or town, or to track the dynamics of opioid misuse in a given locality over time.

""Traditional methods of gauging opioid misuse in an area rely on compiling reports from local emergency rooms and poison control call centers,"" said lead researcher Michael Chary from the Department of Emergency Medicine of New York Presbyterian Queens hospital.

""Through social media we can observe a much larger fraction of the population, perhaps intervening before things reach the level of needing emergency medical care,"" Chary added.

Chary and his team analysed more than 3.6 million tweets and found that the information about opioid misuse was significantly correlated with federal surveys over the last three years.

For the study, published in the Journal of Medical Toxicology, the research group curated a list of keywords related to the misuse of prescribed opioids.

Based on these keywords and with the help of a software, the researchers extracted English-language tweets between the years 2012 and 2014.

In the process 3,611,528 tweets all containing at least one of the selected keywords about the misuse of prescribed opioids were selected.

The software then identified linguistic characteristics that distinguished tweets that credibly mentioned opioid misuse from spam tweets and clustered them based on semantic distance.

The team then used metadata from Twitter to identify the location of each tweet. To validate their findings, Chary and his group compared the Twitter data to geographical data contained in the 2013-2015 National Surveys on Drug Usage and Health (NSDUH).

NSDUH is a government funded confidential survey conducted annually by professional interviewers, and includes information obtained from about 70,000 Americans. It is commonly used to determine countrywide trends in substance use.

Mentions about the misuse of prescribed opioids on Twitter were found to strongly correlate with state-by-state information contained in the NSDUH.

The correlation was highest for individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 years old.

The findings from this new study show that social media can also be used to track public interest in opioid misuse, or perhaps other substances, Chary said.

""We found that our estimates agreed with national survey data, suggesting that social media can be a reliable additional source of epidemiological data regarding substance use,"" Chary said.

9 killed as strongest typhoon Hato hits China,"Beijing, August 24

At least nine persons were killed and one remained missing as Hato, the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, made its landfall in the city of Zhuhai in the southern Guangdong province.

Typhoon Hato made landfall on Wednesday, bringing winds of up to 160 kilometre per hour to the mouth of the Pearl River and heavy rain to nearby regions, the local meteorological bureau said.

When the typhoon swept past Macao, a wall brought down by strong winds killed a man. Another person died after falling from the 11th floor of a building, and a third after being hit by a truck, according to Macao health authorities.

They also confirmed two more deaths and 153 injuries last night, state-run Xinhua news agency reported yesterday.

There was a brief blackout in Macao but power resumed at 2 pm. In Guangdong, four people were killed and one remained unaccounted for. The government has evacuated 26,817 people to temporary shelters. About 664 hectares of farmland has been damaged.

Power transmission facilities suffered heavy loss, disrupting electricity supply to 1.91 million households.

About half of the households had power back by late yesterday.

In Zhuhai, a ship which lost control amid gales and high tides hit a pier of a major bridge, causing the bridge surface to tilt. The bridge, part of a coastal highway, remains cordoned off.

Alerts for landslides, flooding, and other geological disasters have been issued.

“Compared to other typhoons, Hato moved fast, quickly grew more powerful and caused massive amounts of rainfall,” said Wu Zhifang, chief weather forecaster at Guangdong meteorological bureau.

Meteorologists had earlier warned of unusually high flooding as the typhoon came during high tides.

Hundreds of thousands of residents in low-lying areas, workers on coastal fish farms, and tourists have been transferred to safer places.

In one of the hardest-hit areas, 19 villages near the town of Guanghai, Taishan city, were flooded and power was cut off. However, no casualties have been reported as the evacuation started early.

In Zhuhai, trees and billboards have been blown down. At a wharf, boats were pushed onto shore while vehicles on the roads were floated.

But floodwater has begun to recede.

Huang Xin, an employee of a fishing gear shop at the wharf, said the shop’s gate and windows were broken by huge tides. Boats, though being moored, were damaged.

Across the province, classes and work were suspended in many cities yesterday. Several expressways were closed and train services halted.

"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","TORONTO: Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

Toronto

Scientists are developing an artificial intelligence based system to help detect melanoma — a deadly form of skin cancer — in its early stages.

The system, built by researchers at University of Waterloo in Canada, analyses images of skin lesions and provides doctors with data on telltale biomarkers of melanoma, which is deadly if detected late, but highly treatable if caught early.

It deciphers levels of biomarker substances in lesions, adding consistent, quantitative information to assessments currently based on appearance alone, researchers said.

In particular, changes in the concentration and distribution of eumelanin, a chemical that gives skin its colour, and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, are strong indicators of melanoma, they said.

The artificial intelligence (AI) system — trained using tens of thousands of skin images and their corresponding eumelanin and hemoglobin levels — could initially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, a significant health-care cost, researchers said.

It gives doctors objective information on lesion characteristics to help them rule out melanoma before taking more invasive action.

""This could be a very powerful tool for skin cancer clinical decision support. The more interpretable information there is, the better the decisions are,"" said Alexander Wong, a professor of systems design engineering at Waterloo.

""There can be a huge lag time before doctors even figure out what is going on with the patient. Our goal is to shorten that process"" Wong added. PTI"

Amitabh Bachchan reveals the reason behind his 17-year association with KBC

Megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who is back with the latest edition of Kaun Banega Crorepati, recently talked about his 17-year-long association with it and also revealed the reason that motivates him to take up the game show season after season. Speaking at the launch of the ninth season, Big B said, “The opportunity I get to meet people of this country that we hear about, we read about, thanks to the media, but we never actually get an opportunity to meet them live and for me that becomes a very realistic moment. When I can shake hands with them, when I can sit across the table virtually and listen to their stories, and feel for them.” “It’s a very emotional moment when you hear the kind of hardships they go through; whether it is a young girl, who has been prevented from being educated because she is going to be married off or more. You feel extremely sad for them, but defying those social norms that may have been prevalent in their lives or villages for so many years and to fight them, and to come out and sit in front of me on that hot seat and to be able to narrate those moments and then succeed in fulfilling their vision is so inspiring,” he added. —ANI"
Travel curbs imposed in Bhaderwah,"Tourism industry takes a hit, hoteliers facing losses as bookings cancelled

Ranjit Thakur

Doda, August 24

The advisory issued by the police for tourists to take prior permission before visiting famous tourist destinations in Bhaderwah by drum-beating has created panic among the hoteliers and those connected with the tourism industry. They termed it as a highly irresponsible move of the police. Chaos and confusion gripped Bhaderwah on Thursday when a drum beater reportedly hired by the Police Department started reading the advisory regarding restrictions and conditional visit to the famous tourist destinations, including Padri on Bhadarwah-Chamba inter-state road, Seoj Dhar, Ramtund and famous pilgrimage destination Kailash Kund without giving any reason. President, Travel Trade Association, Bhaderwah, Tariq Choudhary said, “Within a few hours of the advisory, many hotel bookings and packages have been cancelled in Bhaderwah. We were expecting a large number of tourists from different parts of the country ahead of the Bhaderwah festival, but due to the unfortunate restrictions imposed by the police many tourists have cancelled their bookings. We are now facing massive losses.” “We held a meeting yesterday with people associated with the tourism industry and showed our resentment against the advisory. 2017 was a golden year for tourists in Bhaderwah.” he said, and added, “If restrictions are not taken back immediately, we will be compelled to come on to streets and surrender the keys of our hotels and guest houses to the administration.” “I am unable to understand that what the police want to prove by resorting to drum-beating. If there is some apprehension, they can set up a police post instead of asking people not to visit there,” a local said. While trying to clarify the issue, Sub-District Police Officer (SDPO), Bhaderwah, Brijesh Sharma said, “The civil and police administration had issued the advisory by drum-beating to convey people that the Kailash yatra has concluded and there is no medical or security camp in the Chattri, Ramtund and Kailash areas. So, anybody going towards these areas should intimate the Tehsildar’s office and the Bhaderwah police station to avoid any untoward incident. There is lack of oxygen and the area is prone to movement of wild animals.” In 2017, nearly 5 lakh tourists have visited Bhaderwah from various parts of the country, including 2.5 lakh tourists for the pilgrimage in August. With record number of tourists visiting these places in the past three months, the sudden order came as a shocker for those associated with the tourism industry here."
Bars along highways to reopen soon,"Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 23

The order of the Supreme Court has paved the way for the reopening of bars in hotels situated on state and national highways in the city, which were lying closed for four months. With the clarification that the order passed by the court on December 15, 2016, will not prohibit licensed establishments within the municipal areas, the reopening of the bars is now a matter of days. Sources said the Administration would now seek a legal opinion, which was a formality, and start issuing licences to hotels and restaurants soon. The court had said, “The order will only deal with the sale of liquor along and in proximity of highways... which provide connectivity between cities, towns and villages. The order does not prohibit licensed establishments within the municipal areas.” Ankit Gupta, president of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association, said they were grateful to the apex court for issuing a clarification that the liquor ban on highways was not applicable to licensed premises within the municipal limits of a city. The association requested the Administration to restore the status quo of March 31, on payment of the licence fee, for hospitality outlets affected by the ban. Kirron Kher, Member of Parliament, said the efforts of the Chandigarh Administration had been applauded by the whole country. The Chandigarh Administration’s sincere fight against all odds for a decision from the Supreme Court had paid off. Hotels and restaurants faced a loss of around Rs 70 crore in the past four months following the order of the Supreme Court banning the sale of liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways. The order had affected the business of approximately 90 hotels situated on the National Highway-21 and the state highway (Madhya Marg) in the city. A majority of the hotels are situated in Sectors 26, 35 and 43, which fall on the national highway. The hotels were also forced to lay off approximately 5,000 employees. Gurvinder Juneja, secretary of the Chandigarh Hotel and Restaurant Association, also welcomed the decision."
Zlatan Ibrahimovic back with Manchester United; to wear No. 10,"August 24

Manchester United have re-signed striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a one-year contract, the Premier League club announced on Thursday. He will wear the number 10 jersey vacated by Wayne Rooney.

The 35-year-old Swede joined United on a one-year deal as a free agent last season and scored 28 goals in 46 appearances for Jose Mourinho’s side before suffering a knee ligament injury in April.

“We are delighted Zlatan is on the road to recovery and we are equally delighted to have his ambition and experience back with us,” Mourinho said in a statement on United’s website.

“After his contribution last season he deserves our trust and we will be patient waiting for him to return. I have no doubt that he will be important in the second part of the season.”

Ibrahimovic, who helped United to win the League Cup and Europa League in his debut campaign in England, said he was keen to finish what he had started at Old Trafford.

“It was always mine and the club’s intention for me to stay,” he added.

“I cannot wait to get back out on that Old Trafford pitch, but I also know that I have to take my time to make sure that I am ready.” — Reuters"
Amendments to deal with today’s ills,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

Is it true that the Reserve Bank of India has amended the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to expand its jurisdiction? If so, can you please give some details?

Yes, the 2017 amendment to the Banking Ombudsman scheme has widened the scope of the scheme and brought under the ambit of the Ombudsman, a number of hitherto excluded issues pertaining to the banking operations.

To be more specific, the amendments finally provide for redress of a large number of highly vexatious problems faced by bank customers in recent years such as fraudulent withdrawal of money through electronic banking as well as stolen and cloned debit and credit cards, besides mis-selling of insurance, mutual funds and other investment products. Similarly, the amendments have also brought under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman issues such as erroneous reporting of credit information to the Credit Information Bureau and the failure to rectify such factual inaccuracies. These are all issues on account of which consumers have for long suffered not just financial loss but also harassment and mental anguish. And in the absence of any redress at the ombudsman level, they have had to fight long battles before the consumer court. Finally, consumers can seek resolution of their disputes in these matters through the Ombudsman.

The revised ombudsman scheme, which came into effect from July 1 this year, includes in the list of ‘Grounds for complaint’, non-adherence to the instructions of the Reserve Bank vis-à-vis mobile banking/electronic banking services in respect of delay or failure to effect online payment or fund transfer and unauthorised electronic payment/fund transfer . Similarly, one can complain against banks for sale of unsuitable, improper financial products such as insurance and mutual funds, besides lack of transparency in such sale and delay in facilitating after sales service.

Another positive change brought about in the Ombudsman Scheme is the provision to award compensation for harassment and mental anguish, besides loss of the complainant’s time and other expenses, up to a limit of Rs 1 lakh. Despite the low limit, I really welcome this because earlier the Scheme provided for such compensation only in cases of credit card operations. So, extending this to all complaints is really good. Second, the compensation awarded for any loss suffered as a direct consequence of the bank’s omission or commission (or the pecuniary jurisdiction to pass an award) has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to 20 lakh.

Are there any pre-conditions that one must remember while filing a complaint before the Ombudsman?

One of the most important conditions is the requirement of the complainant going to the Ombudsman only after exhausting the complaint redress system available with the bank. The Scheme requires the complainant to first write to the bank (preferably the nodal officer) and approach the ombudsman only if there is no response within a month or if the response is not satisfactory. Consumers must remember this because a number of cases before the Ombudsmen are rejected for this reason.

Otherwise, filing a complaint before the Ombudsman is easy — you can even send it electronically. You do not need any lawyer and the process of resolution of the complaint is very simple. First and foremost, the Ombudsman will try to promote a settlement through conciliation or mediation between the parties and if it is agreeable to the complainant, will pass an order. If not, the Ombudsman will pass an award after giving both the parties an opportunity to present their case. One can also file an appeal against the order of the Ombudsman before the Appellate Authority.

The complaint has to be filed before the Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the bank branch concerned is situated. However, in case of credit card and other types of services with centralised operations, a complaint can be filed before the Ombudsman under whose territorial jurisdiction the billing address of the complainant is located. You can get the details of the scheme as well as the addresses of the 20 Ombudsmen in the country from the website of the Reserve Bank of India."

A check on an increasingly intrusive State

Also in this section

No ‘good’ criminals

Thursday’s Supreme Court judgment declaring privacy a fundamental right gives the citizen a little more space to breathe. Overturning the two previous judgments on the issue, the apex court has provided the citizen protection against surveillance by the State. It has put limits on the might of an ever-expansionist and overbearing State. Even though a dilatory and expensive justice system is a deterrent to seeking redress of rights violations, the significance of the apex court’s ruling cannot be underestimated. In the prevailing circumstances, it is overwhelming. In no uncertain terms the judiciary has told the executive to be a little more respectful of individual rights, including the right to privacy. The verdict is obviously a rebuff to the Modi government, which had contended before the court that the right to privacy could not be extended to “every aspect” of privacy. Attorney-General KK Venugopal had argued that privacy at best was a “sub-species of liberty and every aspect could not qualify as being fundamental in nature”. Before him, his predecessor, Mukul Rohtagi, had scoffed at suggestions that citizens could refuse to provide iris scans or fingerprints to the government, saying “the concept of absolute right over one’s body is a myth”. Of course, every right is subject to “reasonable restrictions”. Whether the contested act of seeking personal details for the issuance of Aadhaar violates the right to privacy will be judged separately by another Bench of the Supreme Court. The issue of privacy violation rose over the State diktat to citizens to provide the State agencies personal information for Aadhaar. Started as a well-meaning digital initiative to make welfare and subsidy payments transparent, Aadhaar has been made mandatory for a host of other activities, including financial transactions, bank and mobile accounts, and filing of tax returns. The pervasive fear is the Modi regime may misuse personal information to target opponents, or deny benefits to “undesirables”, apart from the under-played threat of pilferage of data. After yesterday’s judgment, the government will have to do a rethink. It will have to convince the court that forcing citizens to give fingerprints and iris scans does not violate the right to privacy."
The Tribune: Sport news,"PALLEKELE: Mahendra Singh Dhoni's oodles of experience in pressure situations came in handy as he successfully anchored a tricky chase, guiding India to a three-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in the second ODI, here today.

Pallekele, August 24

Mahendra Singh Dhoni's oodles of experience in pressure situations came in handy as he successfully anchored a tricky chase, guiding India to a three-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in the second ODI, here today.

The former skipper scored a patient unbeaten 45 off 68 balls but more importantly mentored Bhuvneshwar Kumar (53 not out) as they added 100 runs for the eighth wicket to reach the revised victory target of 231 in 44.2 overs under Duckworth- Lewis method.

India now take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.

This was after unheralded mystery spinner Akila Dananjaya (6/48 in 9 overs) infused life into a series, which has been panned by all and sundry for the lopsided contests starting with the Test matches.

India were reduced to 131 for 7 when Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar joined forces. Tbe pitch which looked easy for batting 15 minutes prior to their union, was looking venomous after the Indian batting line-up for the first time in the past one month were asked a few testing questions.

Dhoni, whose finishing skills have been put to test in recent times showed that experience worth its weight in gold as he tapped around for singles and doubles. The target being a modest one and the run-rate being under check also helped his cause as his innings only had one boundary.

The former skipper soaked in the pressure initially as Bhuvneshwar played a lot of dot balls. However once the partnership crossed 40, the UP criketer showed that he is more than a capable batsmen.

Dananjaya was hit for two boundaries in the 40th over by Bhuvneshwar when the match decisively swung in India's favour.

It ended in an anti-climax when the winning runs came through a wide delivery.

But the match will also be remembered for a 15-minute mayhem that had left the much-vaunted Indian batting in complete tatters.

Chasing a revised victory target post rain interruption, India were cruising along with Rohit Sharma (54 off 45 balls) in sublime touch. Alongside man of the moment, Shikhar Dhawan (49 off 50 balls). The duo put on 109 runs for the opening stand before Dananjaya bowled a flipper which saw found Rohit missing a sweep shot.

He was adjudged leg-before and the review was wasted.

Within four runs, left-arm spinner Milinda Siriwardana got rid of Dhawan to have India 113 for 2.

However the drama unfolded in the 18th over when Indian batsmen were simply unable to read Dananjaya's googly.

Kedar Jadhav (1) didn't show any footwork as the wrong 'un rifled into middle and leg stump.

Within a couple of deliveries, skipper Virat Kohli (4) was deceived by flight as he yorked himself to a googly.

KL Rahul's indecisive footwork saw India slump to 119 for 5 by the time the over ended.

In his very next over Dananjaya completed his maiden five-for when Hardik Pandya (0) jumped down the track to get stumped.

Axar Patel became Dananjaya's sixth victim but got a debatable leg-before decision before Bhuvneshwar joined forces with Dhoni as India were looking down the barrel at 131 for 7.

Exactly 100 runs were needed and the duo were up for the task.

Earlier, Indian bowlers once again put up an impressive performance to restrict Sri Lanka to 236 for 8. Indian team would rather be disappointed as they had Lanka on the mat at 121 for 5 before a 91-run stand between Milinda Siriwardana (58) and experienced Chamara Kapugedera (40) enabled the home team reach a semblance of respectability.

This was after Virat Kohli won his fifth consecutive toss on this tour and opted to field.

Put into bat, Niroshan Dickwella (31) and Danushka Gunathilaka (19) made a quick start to their innings. India handed the new ball to Bhuvneshwar Kumar (0-53) and Jasprit Bumrah (4/43). The two openers showed aggressive intent.

Bumrah was taken for a few runs in his initial spell as Dickwella hit two sixes off him.

Lanka's 50-mark came up in the 9th over but Bumrah had got his revenge when he had Dickwella caught at short midwicket in the 8th over.

Kusal Mendis (19) then joined Gunathilaka and put on 29 runs for the 2nd wicket before the latter was stumped off Yuzvendra Chahal (2-43) in the 15th over.

It was Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 99th stumping in ODI cricket, equalling Kumar Sangakkara's record albeit in fewer games.

Skipper Upul Tharanga (9) then edged a simple outswinger from Hardik Pandya (1-24) to slip in the 16th over. Then Mendis was out leg before sweeping off Chahal in the 24th over as Lanka were reduced to 99/4.

It seemed a familiar script as Angelo Mathews (20) too followed back to the dressing room, out LBW to Axar Patel (1- 30) in the 29th over.

But Siriwardana and Kapugedara pulled their team out of the hole with a resolute partnership. The duo played within themselves and didn't seem to be in any hurry to score runs, even as they didn't let the scoring rate dip too far.

They were helped in that Pandya had to go off in the 28th over as he seemed to have strained his left calf.

The all-rounder came back on the field twice, but finally hobbled off in the latter stages of the innings. Kedar Jadhav (0-32) completed his quota of overs. PTI"

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour.

[ + read story ]

Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation.

n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health.

n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details.

n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone.

n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you.

n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc.

You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it.

n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour.

n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour.

n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills.

Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Beep, beep, cut, cut… as long as the lord of controversies Pahlaj Nihalani remained at the helm of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he and the films he censured/censored made headlines.

Nihalani's exit and lyricist poet and ad guru Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the new CBFC chairperson is indeed not just a routine change of guard. There is much to read here, may be a lot to cheer, if Nihalani’s words “god bless those who are celebrating my departure” are to be taken seriously for once. If there was little doubt about Nihalani’s absurd ways of working, there can be no questions about Joshi’s finesse as a poet and sensitivity as a writer. But can one man’s elevation and another’s sacking be the answer to all issues that ail filmmakers?

Director Hansal Mehta, whose film Aligarh ran into trouble with the CBFC, doesn’t think it’s fair to put the blame of all that’s wrong with the outdated cinematograph Act on just one person. Certainly tempers ran high when Mehta’s Aligarh, a film on homosexuality, was given an adult certificate, stalling possibilities of the film’s promotion. Time and again producers or directors found themselves at the receiving end. The list of movies that had to bear the brunt of CBFC, running in hyperactive mode under Nihalani, is endless: Udta Punjab, Spectre, Lipstick Under My Burkha, Babumoshai Bandookbaz…. Rare was a film that did not have a run in with the man obsessed with sanskar, Indian ethos and values. Lip locks, abuses, use of words like intercourse… anything and everything even a reference to a city or state could raise his hackles.

But with Nihalani out of sight, Mehta can perhaps rationalise that may be Nihalani was just implementing rules, or following the information and broadcasting ministry orders. If the latter is true, uneasy lies the time ahead. Ashoke Pandit, former member of CBFC (during Nihalani’s tenure) however, is more scathing in his assessment. He believes, “Rules were merely a fig leaf with which Nihalani tried to cover his misdeeds. Which rules say there had to be a banned list of cuss words? Or that words like Kanpur and Kishore Kumar can't be referred to. Nihalani wanted directors to make films as per his individual sense and sensibility. Which filmmaker would agree to that?” Besides, he reminds that the same films he censored were ultimately either cleared by FCAT or the courts.

Pandit believes Joshi is the right man for the job. “In sync with today's times, Joshi understands the world cinema and has worked with the very best makers in the country.” Mehta, however, feels that the CBFC should not be personality driven, instead be guided by crystal clear guidelines. That’s precisely why he would not jump the gun and hail the newly constituted CBFC as the panacea.

Actor Aahana Kumra stands pleased and fearless like the bold character she played in Lipstick Under My Burkha, the film that was even denied certification and is rumoured to be the real trigger for Nihalani's ouster. She says, “I am hopeful that with Joshi as the chairperson and actors like Vidya Balan on the board, path-breaking films, especially women centric subjects, will be viewed favourably.” Producer director Prakash Jha who has been at loggerheads with the CBFC has only one word answer — no censorship.

Is absence of censorship a guarantee of good cinema? May be not… after all there is censorship in Iran and the country's makers have been producing world-class cinema. In a democracy that India is, artists feel strongly against censorship which they insist connotes backwardness, just as George Bernard Shaw would say, “The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.”

Whether Joshi can ensure that scissors are laid to rest remains to be seen. Right now Joshi, too, doesn't have the answers, only claims to have the right intent. And that's what really matters feels Pandit. “If Nihalani had the inclination to change, instead of bothering about nitty-gritties, he would have worked towards implementing Benegal committee recommendations which have been around for a year now.” Mehta is not sure whether the Benegal committee guidelines are a fit-all solution or that there can be a please-all policy. But Pandit reasons, “If implemented, Benegal guidelines would be a good start for sure.” Propelled by Joshi’s vision who clearly doesn’t endorse micromanagement, he foresees happy times for the Indian cinema. Round one of sniping and snipping may have lasted too long but for now votaries of cinema seem to heave a sigh of relief and reassurance."

Ahead of the verdict in the Dera Sacha Sauda case, Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh today appealed to Sikhs to be vigilant. “The sauda saadh (Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh) and his Premis might try to cause a commotion. The need of the hour is to ensure the safety of gurdwaras. Though it’s the responsibility of the government and the local administration to maintain law and order, I appeal to the gurdwara managements and Sikh volunteers to remain on alert,” he said. On the Qadian gurdwara row, the Jathedar asked CM Capt Amarinder Singh to intervene, while alleging that Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa’s supporters had overpowered the pathis. Bajwa said, “I respect the sanctity of Akal Takht and the Singh Saheb. This is a tussle between Akalis and the gurdwara management headed by Master Johar Singh, a former Akali MLA. Giani Gurbachan Singh is being misled by SAD leaders.”"

Convinced that they have an infallible god in Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, his followers, having laid siege to the city and occupying open spaces in swarms for the last three days, are all set for the CBI verdict in the rape case against the dera head. “We will dance right back to where we came from because truth will prevail and ‘Pitaji’ will be acquitted. If the verdict does not uphold the truth of his innocence, we should not be blamed for how the situation will pan out. The verdict will decide our next step,” says a charged Kamlesh from Mandhar village in Punjab’s Malout. Women far outnumber men among the followers who have “captured” the shade of every tree in sight and every inch of pavement and open space around the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Sector 3. Lying stretched out on plastic sheets covered with bedsheets, using their bags as pillows, the dera followers are all over the place and the three days of sleeping in the open spaces or pavements has not fatigued them a wee bit “We have locked our houses, left our young children behind and have come for ‘Pitaji’s’ darshan. We will not tolerate an adverse order of the CBI court. These breaths we take are his alone and we will willingly give these up for him. He can do no wrong. If they want to take him, it will have to be over our bodies,” say Sushma and Kiran Bala of Yamunanagar who reached the city two days back. As other women nod in unison, a saner group among them says that “Pitaji” has not taught them to respond to injustice with violence. “We don’t even want to hear that the judgment can be adverse. ‘Pitaji’ will be absolved in the case and the lies will be exposed. If the unexpected happens, we will quietly go back,” maintains Rekha from Indrapuri in Ghaziabad, adding that there is no iota of truth in information of followers reaching the city armed with sticks and swords and stones. As she and her group of women open their bags to show they are carrying only two sets of clothes and some snacks since langar is served, a group of women from Noida, camping under the shade of a tree for the last three days, chip in to express their devotion. “Guruji does not preach violence. This entire police bandobast is meaningless. We mean no harm to anybody. If our worst fears come true, we will immolate ourselves to free ourselves from the suffering of seeing our god suffer. We have not come here with the intention of creating a ruckus,” says Meera who is indebted to the dera chief for curing her husband and giving him a new life. Accompanied by her 15-year-old daughter, Simlesh, also from Noida, says her drunkard husband recovered after she started going to the dera in Sirsa. “This is our chance to show our gratitude and we will do so by being his armour,” she emphasises. Kamlesh Insaan from Ghaziabad, associated with the dera for 20 years, sums up the sentiment among the followers when she says that the judgment will be favourable because when god wills, all winds bring rain.

How exactly does yoga benefit mind-body health?,"Washington

From increased strength to flexibility to heart health, benefits of yoga and meditation are countless. However, we still have much to learn about how exactly these practices affect mind-body health. A new research article investigates the effects of yoga and meditation on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the activity on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) effects and inflammatory markers. By studying the participants of an intensive three-month yoga and meditation retreat, the researchers found that the practices positively impacted BDNF signaling, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and immunological markers, and in addition improved subjective wellbeing. In this study, the retreat participants were assessed before and after participating in a 3-month yoga and meditation retreat that involved daily meditation and Isha yoga, accompanied by a vegetarian diet. The yogic practices consisted of physical postures, controlled breathing practices, and seated meditations during which the participants focused on mantra repetition, breath, emptying the mind and bodily sensation. The researchers measured psychometric measures, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), circadian salivary cortisol levels, as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. They also collected data on psychometric variables including mindfulness, absorption, depression and anxiety, and investigated the relationship between psychological improvements and biological changes. The data showed that participation in the retreat was associated with decreases in both self-reported anxiety and depression as well as increases in mindfulness. The research team observed increases in the plasma levels of BDNF, a neuromodulator that plays an important role in learning, memory and the regulation of complex processes such as inflammation, immunity, mood regulation, stress response and metabolism. They also observed increases in the magnitude of the cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is part of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), suggesting improved stress resilience. Moreover, there was a decrease in inflammatory processes caused by an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 and a reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-12 after the retreat. ""It is likely that at least some of the significant improvements in both HPA axis functioning as exemplified by the CAR as well as neuroimmunologic functioning as exemplified by increases in BDNF levels and alterations in cytokines were due to the intensive meditation practice involved in this retreat,"" says corresponding author Dr Baruch Rael Cahn (University of Southern California, USA). The research team hypothesize that the pattern of biological findings observed in their study is linked to enhanced resilience and well being. ""The observed increased BDNF signaling possibly related to enhanced neurogenesis and/or neuroplasticity, increased CAR likely related to enhanced alertness and readiness for mind-body engagement, and increased anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines possibly indicating enhanced immunological readiness,"" explains Dr Cahn. ""An intriguing possible link between the effects on BDNF and the CAR is hippocampal functional integrity, since increased BDNF levels due to physical exercise has previously been shown to relate with hippocampal neurogenesis and likely relate to its positive effects on well-being and depression."" In the light of previous studies of the positive effects of meditation on mental fitness, autonomic homeostasis and inflammatory status, the researchers think that their findings are related to the meditative practices that the retreat participants engaged in. However, they suggest that some of the observed changes may also be related to the physical aspects of the retreat — yoga practice and diet — and that the observed change patterns are a reflection of well being and mind-body integration. The next step will be to conduct further research in order to clarify the extent to which the positive changes on mind-body wellness and stress resilience are related to the yoga and meditation practices respectively, and to account for other possible contextual factors such as social dynamics, diet and the impact of the teacher. ""To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine a broad range of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers in a healthy population before and after a yoga-meditation intervention. Our findings justify further studies of yoga and meditation retreats assessing for the replicability, specificity and long-term implications of these findings,"" concludes Dr Cahn. The findings have been published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience."
Green is their kind,"As the pitfalls of global warming and jungles of concrete swarm our planet, some unknown, unsung heroes are quietly working to make our environment and world a little better

Eesha Duggal

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
"Home Secy, DGP emerge ‘troubleshooters’","Chief Minister, ministers keep ‘low profile’ ahead of CBI court verdict

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 24

The BJP government is pinning hopes on the bureaucracy to defuse the ‘crisis-like’ situation in the wake of the rape case verdict against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Ram Niwas, Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), Home, and BS Sandhu, DGP, have emerged as ‘trouble shooters’ for the government even as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, his Cabinet colleagues and senior BJP functionaries are keeping a ‘low profile’ apparently due to ‘political considerations’. This time around, the ACS and the DGP have been quite ‘proactive’ as against February 2016 Jat agitation when the bureaucracy and the police virtually ‘let down’ the government. In fact, the DGP had already visited the sensitive districts and the ACS has been leading from the front. Though the ministers had been asked to be present in their respective constituencies to help maintain law and order, senior BJP functionaries had not been proactive on the issue. Even Khattar had last issued a statement on the issue on August 22, appealing the dera followers to maintain peace. He had also asserted that the dera chief would appear in Panchkula court on August 25. With the influential dera apparently not happy with the state government’s alleged ‘media hype’ on the issue, senior BJP functionaries have gone in a ‘silent mode’ till the pronouncement of the verdict by the Special CBI court on August 25. BJP sources said party’s ‘ambivalent’ stand on dera issue in the run-up to the August 25 verdict was a calculated move not to further ‘annoy’ the dera which had played a significant role in its victory in the 2014 Assembly elections. “The law is taking its own course. We will wait for the pronouncement of the verdict on August 25 before making an official statement on the issue,” a senior BJP leader said.

Abhay praises dera chief

Ahead of the verdict in a rape case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Leader of Opposition Abhay Chautala was all praise for the dera chief saying that he had played a yeoman’s role in establishing brotherhood in the state. The dera had been engaged in a number of social welfare projects, including sanitation drives and blood donations camps, he said, adding that the court’s decision must been respected by every citizen of the country. He came down heavily on the BJP government for creating an ‘emergency-like’ situation in the state."

Study stresses action plan to save vultures,"Jotirmay Thapliyal

Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 24

The state provides suitable habitat for eight vulture species out of nine found in India.

Of these three are critically endangered, one endangered, three near threatened and one as least concern.

Vulture conservationists have stressed on the need to form state Vulture Conservation Action Plan to protect the species as electrocution continues to be a major threat to them in Uttarakhand. A study conducted by researchers of Doon University and Himalayan Institute for sustainable Environment and Research Society during January 2015 to August 2017 states that more than 100 vultures, including Himalayan and Egyptian vultures were electrocuted in Dehradun and Haridwar districts during last winter. The state provides suitable habitat for eight vulture species out of nine found in India. Of these eight species, three have been categorised as critically endangered, one endangered, three near threatened and one as least concern. The survey managed to record 7 vulture species except the critically endangered, slender-billed vulture. Among these seven recorded species, the numbers of white-backed vulture population were found to be low while the near-threatened Himalayan vulture, a winter migrant, had the maximum population. The Egyptian vulture was also found in good numbers from Kalsi to Tanakpur. Khima Nand Balodi, who led the study, attributed carcass dumping near high voltage power transmission lines as the major reason behind vulture electrocution. “Dead livestock are dumped by contractors and farmers near high voltage power transmission lines. Also, the municipal solid waste dumping sites are in the vicinity of the powerlines. This makes vultures vulnerable to electrocution,” argued Balodi. The study stressed on need to draft a comprehensive plan—Uttarakhand State Vulture Conservation Action Plan—for long term conservation of the specie. It also suggested initiation of awareness and outreach programmes in the state. The study was supported by Conservation Leadership Programme and Oriental Bird Club, UK, among others."
The Java connect,"Pulsating with performances, art and life, the city of Yogyakarta in Indonesia gives you the feel of being in a different era

Akash Mehrotra

An ancient city and the last remaining Sultanate of Indonesia, Yogyakarta has been a cradle of art and culture and for long nurtured the Javanese connection with the outer world. Old ways of life exist side by side with bustling modernity here and the city decorates itself with the symbols of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. From shadow puppetry, the age old extraordinary Buddhist temple of Borobodur and the equally impressive Hindu ones of Prambanan, socially aware graffiti on the wall to the beautifully styled Batik designs; Yogyakarta, Indonesia’s second most visited spot, is a cultural palette on display.

The city comes as a huge relief from the urbane madness of Jakarta; narrow roads lined with trees, old buildings wearing a colonial touch, shops styled as pagodas, alleys lined with themed restaurants, art cafes often buzzing with some performances, random music bands performing on streets, endless boards advertising batik designing lessons, and strangers wearing a gracious smile; Yogyakarta gives you a feeling of being in a different era.

The city is always throbbing with performances, mostly unannounced. An art gallery will host a performer or a dance troupe visiting the city performing an ancient myth, puppetry shows in some random corner around the Sultan’s palace, rappers set up on a plaza, some impromptu performance in some coffee shop or even private homes inviting strangers for a local gamelan performance; festivals can pop up in any corner.

And as you remain on the lookout for the art scenes, don’t miss to do what all travel blogs tell you. Yogyakarta is a Unesco heritage site for its old temples and its age-old puppetry tradition. Put these in your ‘must-do’ list and then proceed. Start off your day with the Krotan Palace, snaking your way through the alleys of the old town, an area owned by the Sultan. The palace stands like a happy collision between the conformist and the iconoclastic. Perhaps, the most captivating, the Gamelan music, an ensemble of bronze percussion instruments, including gongs, xylophones and drums, often combined with string and wind instruments as well as vocals, can be experienced regularly throughout the week.

At a stone’s throw is the water castle. At a walkable distance from there, through the narrow alleys, housing some painters, designers and artists is the underground masque.

Cut to evening and brace yourself for some more artesia. In the north of the airport stands another emblem of Yogyakarta cultural heritage — the Prambanan temple. The towering temples with spires and spectacularly sculpted walls are a treat to watch. The temple also serves a backdrop of the Ramayana ballet, a spectacular staging of the South Asian Hindu epic, in a dance drama form, with firelights, extravagant costumes, gamelan orchestra, grandeur and an adroit mastery in story-telling. The town seems to have grown up with the Ramayana tales, no wonder many kids (including Muslim kids) have been named after characters of The Ramayana.

The Borobodur Temple

Ditch that urge to lie in late and take an hour-long drive past the enchanting countryside to the Borobodur temple, the largest Buddhist temple excavated in the early 19th century by the then British king of Indonesia, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Sitting atop a hill, surrounded by volcanoes, Borobodur haunts with its striking architectural beauty. A colossal 30 metre-high step pyramid, housing some 500 Buddha sculptures perched around and lower terraces built as balustrades with countless sculptures from Buddha’s life and teachings, the temple is a sight to behold.

In the early 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of the site and ordered its excavation. Even though one can find enough cues of this decay in the temple, Borobodur stands as a defining architectural piece and attracts hundreds of travellers and art lovers from across the world, for academic revelations and picture perfect moments.

Both Prambanan and Borobodur, give a peep into how elegantly Yogyakarta embraced and nurtured different cultures and religious ideals, which still live in the daily rituals of the common folk in the form of rituals, myths, stories passed on from one generation to other, puppetry shows, music, dance forms or just as symbols hung on doorsteps."

Ludhiana August 23

In the wake of the CBI court verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the Ludhiana Commissionerate has made adequate security arrangements. Hinting that on-the spot FIRs would be lodged against trouble makers, jail authorities have been instructed to keep adequate arrangement to accommodate people in case of urgency.

The police have deployed adequate security outside two naam charcha ghar of the dera located in Moti Nagar and Koomkalan.

Director General of Police, Punjab, Suresh Arora also visited Ludhiana and held a meeting with the Commissioner of Police RN Dhoke; SSP, Ludhiana Rural, Surjit Singh and IG Jalandhar Range Arpit Shukla. He instructed officials to remain alert to meet any sort of emergency.

DGP, during the media interaction, said: “The Punjab Police have made adequate security arrangements so that law and order can be maintained in the state. Don’t go by any rumours being spread on social media.”

Police Commissioner RN Dhoke said: “Every thana SHO has conducted a meeting with dera premis, who assured to the police that law and order situation in the city would not be disturbed. We have one company of Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) containing around 100 men. They will be deployed at strategic points to keep a tab over the situation.”

CP Dhoke said Section 144 of the CrPc is also in place, which will prevent assembly of persons or carrying of arms or sharp weapons and if anyone violates the section, he/ she would be put behind bars.

Troublemakers beware!

Police sources said the Ludhiana Commissionerate has written a letter to the authorities at Central Jail Ludhiana asking them to keep a space of over 2,000 persons in jail. The police have clear instructions from the headquarters to arrest troublemakers and put them behind bars. Even a special magistrate has been attached with the ACP-level officer for the purpose.

Cops on leave called back

Cops in the police commissionerate have been told not to ask for leave till the time the dera verdict phase passes off peacefully. Only those cops would be eligible for leave, who are facing any unavoidable emergency. The cops, who were on leave, have been asked to join back.

Cooperate with admn, Khamano residents told

Khamano: The civil and police administration of Khamano is taking all steps in view of Dera Sirsa Chief’s verdict on August 25. SDM Khamano Isha Singal held a meeting with prominent residents of the area and appealed to them to help the administration in dealing with the situation if need arises. She appealed to them to educate the masses to maintain peace. DSP Khamano Gurmeet Singh Singh said the police are maintaining a vigil and required number of police personnel and para-military forces have been deployed at main points.

Heavy police force in Jagraon

Jagraon: Heavy police force has been deployed in Jagraon as well as the surrounding areas. The situation kept the police authorities on toes throughout the day. Apart from Jagraon, tight security arrangements have been made in rural areas, where the number of dera followers is considerably high.

Apart from the local police, several companies of paramilitary forces have also been deployed to keep the situation under control. SSP Jagraon Surjit Singh said: “We have asked the Dera followers to practice restraint and be careful of rumours that can create tension. The dera followers have assured us that they will not create any law and order problem.” There is heavy police and paramilitary forces’ deployment at the entry and exit points of almost all villages. A flag march was also carried out in the city. Amid reports that dera followers could stock petrol, lathis and other weapons at naam charcha ghar, the SSP has asked top police officials to be alert. “No one will be allowed to disturb the peace and law and order situation in the state. Anyone found trying to disturb the peace of the state would be strictly dealt with,” the SSP said.

Silence outside naam charcha ghar near Malakpur village

Khanna: There is complete silence in and around the naam charcha ghar situated on the Khanna-Bhari Road near Malakpur village and there is no gathering of premis inside as well. As per the SSP, there are only some sewadars inside. It is under strict watchfulness and four nakas have been set up around it. Security has been tightened in Khanna police district. Nakas have been put up on all key points and a large number of police personnel and paramilitary forces are on guard at these nakas. A fire brigade and an ambulance have been stationed outside the naam charcha ghar apart from the police personnel guarding the nakas around this site.

SSP Khanna NS Mahal said four companies of paramilitary forces including that of the Border Security Force and CRPF have been called and deployed at key points along with police teams. Meanwhile, Samrala SDM Amit Bamby said they have taken requisite steps and were ready to deal with any eventuality although he said there was no naam charcha ghar in their jurisdiction.

Security up at naam charcha ghar in Jagera village

Mandi Ahmedgarh: The rank and file in the police and civil administration remained on toes completing proactive measures for handling any unsavory situation on Friday, when the CBI court in Panchkula is expected to pronounce the verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh. Besides enhancing security at naam charcha ghar at Jagera village on the Ludhiana-Malerkotla highway and one near Jalaldiwal village on the Raikot-Barnala road, the administration organised flag marches at Ahmedgarh and Raikot to boost the morale of residents. Circle officers Rachhpal Singh Dhindsa, Parminder Singh Cheema and SS Dhanoa lead the marches in their respective areas. Peace meetings were organised by SDM Ahmedgarh Dr Preety Yadav and SDM Raikot Kannu Thind at various localities falling under their jurisdiction. Apprehending clashes between premis and the security forces, the administration advised all in charge, managers and owners of government and private hospitals to supplement and update arrangements to meet any emergency. Executive Magistrate Badal Deen advised senior functionaries at the hospital to ensure that no doctor or member of paramedical staff is absent from duty without reason. Meanwhile, uneasiness prevailed in the region. Though the situation was near normal till last week, it became charged after some of the office-bearers and activists of regional units of the Dera Sacha Sauda declared to adopt do or die policy in case the verdict of the court turns out to be against the dera chief. However, a majority of senior dera followers and premis have already left for Sirsa and Panchkula with an intent to show solidarity with the counterparts from other parts of the state. — Mahesh Sharma

"Statins may help fight typhoid, malaria","Washington, August 22

Statins, used to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, may also provide protection against a host of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, a study claims. Scientists from Duke University in the US have discovered that a gene variant which affects cholesterol levels could increase the risk of contracting typhoid fever. They also showed that a common cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) could protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the nasty infection. The findings, which appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease. They also point to possible avenues to protect those who are most vulnerable to pathogens - like the Salmonella bacteria - that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells. ""We need to try this approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before we can consider taking this into the clinic,"" said Dennis C Ko, assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine. ""What is so exciting is that our study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,"" Ko said. Ko and his team used hundreds of cell lines from healthy human volunteers and exposed them to the exact dose of Salmonella Typhi, which had been tagged with a green fluorescent marker. They then looked for genetic differences that distinguished cells that had higher rates of bacterial invasion from those that did not. The researchers found that a single nucleotide of DNA in a gene called VAC14 was associated with the level of bacterial invasion in cells. When they knocked out the gene, the cells were invaded more readily and more of the cells glowed brightly with green bacteria. They also unexpectedly found that those more susceptible cells had higher levels of cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes that Salmonella binds to invade host cells. Researchers tested DNA from subjects in a group of 1,000 Vietnamese people, half of whom had typhoid fever and half did not. They found that the VAC14 gene variant was associated with a moderately elevated risk of typhoid fever. ""Discovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins for high cholesterol,"" said Ko. ""We wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,"" he said. Monica Alvarez, a graduate student in Ko's lab and lead author on the study, added a cholesterol-lowering drug (ezetimibe or Zetia) to their water and then injected the fish with Salmonella Typhi. She found that the treated animals were more likely to clear the bacteria out of their system and survive. — PTI"
A travel back in time,"Shailesh BR’s most recent work, Tarka, looks like an interpretation of childhood memories

Monica Arora

Shailesh BR’s work is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected that you may have seen amongst contemporary artists in the recent times, and that is what makes it all the more engaging and awe inspiring. He draws inspiration from several concepts in Sanskrit, a language he studied and mastered for some 14 years during his early childhood. His creations reflect the rural upbringing and simplicity of life as in his village, where even an electric bulb was regarded as a huge miracle. In an interview during a Khoj workshop in 2015, Shailesh had articulated, “I do not know how to work, but I sure can create for my own and from my own.”A post-graduate from Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU, Baroda, the artist uses the ordinariness of mundane objects to turn their notion or existence around. He recently put up his first solo show at the Vadhera Art Gallery in New Delhi as part of Foundation for Contemporary Indian Art (FICA)’s Emerging Artist Award Programme. This show was known as Tarka, being derived from Tarka Shastra or the art of debating, enquiring and logical reasoning as prescribed in ancient Sanskrit philosophy. Through his myriad creations, he has questioned the origin, life journey and end of several objects and that is what draws onlookers to this unique body of work. Occupying centre piece at the exhibition was the Kshir Dhara, a series of sculptures that explore repeated actions whilst performing religious ceremonies such as the grinding of chandan on a slab or application of tilak on the forehead. These are used as metaphors in sculptures made from material such as wax, motor, sandalwood, honey, motor, water, milk, copper. Created from rubber, motor, iron was The Tongue, a set of kinetic sculptures that represents the various sensory functions and organs of the body that pertain to sensations of touch, taste, smell, sight and so on. Similarly, the Hot Tongue, comprising of plaster, coil and iron mesh, seems to be a satirical statement on the art of glib talking and nonsensical jargon, which is innately ingrained in the political and bureaucratic machinery. The most evocative of all creations was the Philosophy Machine. Essentially a wooden rotating disc fitted with lamps arranged in a circle, it has a gas flame pipe to light the lamps at one end and a blower pipe to extinguish them. This remarkable creation is a representation of the circle of life and is a stunning commentary on the fact that death is inevitable. Philosphy Machine Drawings was a series of 48 drawings. These inhabit little corners at the gallery and are mostly arranged as asymmetrical drawings on vintage, sepia-tinted and yellowing paper that appear as blueprints or pages from a novella or a personal diary or an old school examination. In most, there is no attention paid to any spelling or grammatical errors and reflect a childlike innocence with several drafts, cuts, scratches and random musings. Also, the 46 tongue drawings are an extension of the sculpture and endeavour to decode the tongue as an organ of taste, articulation and hence, as an allegory for human emotions, sensory as well as of the mind faculties. It’s almost as if he had taken tiny bits of childhood memorabilia and when he saw similar objects during adulthood, he re-interpreted those in a completely different manner and re-arranged the conventionality and typicality associated with them."
Right to privacy is a fundamental right: SC,"Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 24

In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court on Thursday declared right to privacy a fundamental right under the Constitution, saying it was “the constitutional core of human dignity"".

“The right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III (Fundamental Rights Chapter) of the Constitution,” a nine-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar ruled in a unanimous verdict.

However, the Bench clarified that like other fundamental rights, the right to privacy was not absolute and any encroachment will have to withstand the touchstone of permissible restrictions. A law to survive a challenge on the ground of violation of Article 21 must be fair, just and reasonable.

Noting that informational privacy was a facet of the right to privacy and dangers to privacy in an age of information could originate from both the state and non-state actors, the Bench asked the Centre to put into place a robust regime for data protection. “The creation of such a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state,” it said.

“The legitimate aims of the state would include for instance protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits,” the top court said.

The court said, “These are matters of policy to be considered by the Union government while designing a carefully structured regime for the protection of the data.

“Since the Union government has informed the Court that it has constituted a Committee chaired by Hon’ble Shri Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge of this Court, for that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with appropriately by the Union government having due regard to what has been set out in this judgment,” it added.

The verdict, which lays down the law on right to privacy, would have a bearing on petitions seeking to declare illegal Section 377 which criminalises gay sex. It will also affect the outcome of petitions challenging ‘two-finger test’ conducted on rape victims.

The government’s ambitious Aadhaar scheme will get impacted as petitions challenging it on the ground of violation of right to privacy would be decided by a smaller Bench separately on the basis of the law declared by the nine-Judge Bench.

The verdict assumes significance in the age of social media, as individuals can claim constitutional protection for their data. It will also impact the outcome of petitions challenging WhatsApp privacy policy pending before a five-judge Constitution Bench.

The bench said life and personal liberty were ""inalienable rights"" and they were ""inseparable from a dignified human existence"".

""Privacy with its attendant values assures dignity to the individual and it is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true substance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity and is a core value which the protection of life and liberty is intended to achieve,"" the Bench said.

The all important ruling came on petitions filed by former Karnataka High Court Judge KS Puttaswamy, child rights activist Shanta Sinha, former bureaucrat and activist Aruna Roy, former Major General Dr Sudhir G Vombatkere and others who contended that right to privacy was a fundamental right and Aadhaar scheme violated it.

The nine-judge Constitution Bench specifically overruled two earlier verdicts that said right to privacy was not a fundamental right under the Constitution.

In MP Sharma and others versus Satish Chandra, an eight-judge Constitution Bench had held in 1954 that right to privacy was not a fundamental right. A similar view was taken by a six-judge Bench in 1962 in Kharak Singh versus the State of Uttar Pradesh.

It was on the basis of these two judgments that the then Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi had asserted before the top court in 2015 that citizens didn’t have a fundamental right to privacy, inviting criticism from civil society and rights activists.

But during the hearing, Rohatgi’s successor KK Venugopal had conceded that right to privacy was a fundamental right. He, however, had asserted that it was a qualified right and the government had a right to regulate it through a law.

Now, the nine-judge Constitution Bench has specifically overruled these two decisions and affirmed the subsequent verdicts that took a contrary view and held that right to privacy was a fundamental right.

In all there were six separate but concurring verdicts. The CJI, who didn’t write one, pronounced the operative part of the verdict signed by all nine judges in a jam-packed courtroom at 10.39 am.

Other judges on the Bench are Justices DY Chandrachud, J Chelameswar, SK Kaul, SA Bobde, RF Nariman, AM Sapre, RK Agarwal and Abdul Nazeer.

The main judgment was authored by Justice Chandrachud for himself, the CJI, Justice Agrawal and Justice Nazeer. Rest all judges wrote separate but concurring verdicts.

The issue of right to privacy was referred to the nine-judge Bench by a five-judge Bench after it was pointed out that two earlier decisions of eight-judge and six-judge Benches had ruled that right to privacy was not a fundamental right under the Constitution.

The Bench, which assembled on July 19, had heard several senior advocates, including Attorney-General KK Venugopal, for six days in its endeavour to reach a conclusion on the contentious issue and reserved the verdict on August 2."
Dera chief verdict: Congress MLA s adopt cautious approach,"Rajmeet Singh

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 24

Ahead of Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh’s verdict in a rape case, MLAs of the Congress — the ruling party — on Thursday remained mum over the party’s stand in the case.

Admitting that the party that did not get support of the Dera during the last assembly elections, an MLA said they were caught in a piquant situation.

“Whichever way the decision goes, it could lead to trouble between the Dera followers and the radicals in the state in the Malwa region. The party leaders do not want to fish in troubles waters,” admitted a senior leader from Malwa region.

Fearing a repeat of the 2007 violence in Bathinda, Congress leaders are adopting a wait-and-watch policy as they keep their fingers crossed.

Refusing to comment on the political situation arising out the verdict tomorrow, PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar said law and order is being maintained at any cost.

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh also sounded confident while stating that nobody wants trouble in Punjab.

The Dera Sacha Sauda Premis are also Punjabis and do not want to destroy peace, he said.

An MLA from Malwa, however, admitted that despite the Dera followers largely supporting the SAD in the assembly elections, they had been advised to adopt wait-and-watch policy.

Rajpura MLA Hardyal Kamboj said he has been meeting the Dera followers in his area, urging them to maintain peace."
When stalking goes beserk,"GOOD MOTORING

Several things can go wrong on the road. You must know how to counter these

H. Kishie Singh

There was a very unpleasant ‘happening’ in Chandigarh recently: the Varnika episode. However, there are some important lessons to be learnt. The one thing that stands out is that Varnika Kundu is a very brave girl. But what saved the day was the girl’s presence of mind. That is the first lesson. Had Varnika panicked for one moment, the outcome would have been very different. According to media reports, the situation was extreme: two drunken goondas out for fun. Even under such a life threatening situation, Varnika followed a set procedure. The goondas allegedly followed her car and then drove alongside. Frightened and alone, she made all the right moves. She zig-zagged through the sectors — this is called evasive action. She was trying to get on to Madhya Marg when the goondas blocked her way. She reversed and zoomed off. They followed her. When she got to the next traffic light, a goonda got out again, banged on her window and tried to open the door! The police were waiting at the red light and nabbed the man in action. While being chased, she had the presence of mind to call the police. Another lesson learnt. Keep your phone handy, within easy reach. Make sure the last call was to the police before you start driving so you don’t waste time in scrolling. Do this before you start driving. Make sure your seat belt is on. Even if the goonda does manage to open the door and tries to drag you out, the seat belt will defeat his nepharious designs. Here is another very effective safety device. An after sales fitment is a remote open-lock switch. When the car reaches 20 kmph, all four doors lock automatically. Also, worth taking up is the fact that women have a habit of leaving their bags on the seat, where it is easily visible. Better keep it on the floor boards, out of sight. If in full view, the street urchins will not hesitate to open the door at a red light, grab the bag and disappear! A pepper spray is another effective deterrent. It should be instantly available at hand. Speed of action is your weapon. Even if the goonda opens the door or shatters the glass, welcome him with a blast of pepper spray. Blinded and in pain, he will stagger away. This is all the time you need skedaddle. Another deterrent you need is a whistle, easily bought at a children’s store. A shrill blast, continuous or spasmodic, establishes authority. It also alerts people of the danger and draws attention. If you are driving late at night, put it around your neck. Even if you are separated from your cell phone and pepper spray, this will be in easy reach and ready to use. A shrill, ear-splitting shriek from the whistle will stop the goonda in his tracks. The cell phone and pepper spray should be in a secure place. All cars have cubby holes for easy storage. Don’t put them on the passenger seat next to you. Should you have to slam on the brakes, these items will go flying onto the floor boards. If you have to fumble, the goonda will have the upper hand. There are so many things that can go wrong. Think about them and how to counter them. Goondas are bullies. The minute they face resistance, they crumble. Learn from Varnika, girls, and feel proud. Chandigarh has given you a braveheart!

Decrypting your home loan eligibility,"Harshil Mehta

Home is where the heart is. Though owning a home may mean different things to different individuals, one thing is common —we all want to own a home. Given the expense involved, most people prefer to avail a home loan to finance this dream, which is one of the most important decisions and undertakings in his life. Applying for a home loan can often seem like a complex process but one must be aware about some of its key aspects. Some important factors to be considered while applying for a home loan are as follows:

Income

This is the most important factor with a strong bearing on home loan eligibility. If the applicant is a salaried employee, then banks and financial institutions will consider his salary and age. This basically means that the loan eligibility will be evaluated on the basis of his income and the number of years the individual has worked. Lenders also reconfirm the individual’s repayment capability and the tenure of his job. One can also club his spouse’s income to enhance his home loan eligibility and can apply for a joint home loan.

Age factor

While applying for a home loan, banks and financial institution check the age of the borrower as this assesses the number of years the applicant would work. It is often believed that a joint home loan is easily available, but this is not the case always. Age of the co-applicant is also vital while applying for a home loan. For example, Brinda Roy, 29 years old takes a home loan with the co-applicant being her mother who is 60+, then the loan tenure will be calculated mainly on the basis of the age of the older person. The tenure of the loan will be restricted from 10-15 years depending on the bank or financial institution. If Brinda was individually applying for a home loan then her eligibility would depend more on her individual credit score than her age.

Debt

If an individual is applying for a home loan with other outstanding loans such as a car loan or personal loan it may affect his home loan eligibility. If one already has an existing home loan with over 12 unpaid instalments, banks and financial institutions generally take this into account while calculating the borrower’s eligibility. In such a situation, it is important to prepay full or half of their existing outstanding loans to improve their eligibility and ensure that their new application for the home loan remains unaffected.

Credit score

To qualify for a home loan, a good credit score is very important which usually ranges from 400 to 900. Banks and financial institutions prefer to lend to borrowers with credit score higher than 750 since it reflects stronger credit worthiness. This gives a clear picture about the applicant’s credit history, past payment behaviour and makes way for attractive interest rates for the borrower. Before applying for a home loan, it is most critical to check eligibility criterion. It is also very important for the applicant to know the amount they are eligible for and at what interest rate, which will help you to optimise chances of loan approval. Additionally, improving one’s loan eligibility will also have positive impacts on one’s personal financial planning and help move towards better financial security in life. The writer is CEO, DHFL.

Welcome Lord Ganpati with colour,"Half-saree, dhoti saree or floral western dress—what’s your pick for the festive season?

A week-long festival has begun to mark the arrival of Lord Ganesha. This festive season we bring to you handpicked fashion trends right from the celebrity closet, fresh and new from the ramp that has set the tone of Ganpati season. Try these different looks each day and be the best dressed of the season.

Bright side

Kareena Kapoor Khan was spotted in Delhi last week, wearing a beautiful mehendi coloured shalwar kameez with a red-bordered the dupatta. This Anamika Khanna-creation had a boat cut neck and the dupatta was fully embroidered with much shimmer on the top too. The colour is for the season, making it festive appropriate.To wear a saree and look comfortable might only seem like a dream, but it’s a reality now and Dia Mirza rocked it. She wore an Anamika Khanna half-saree with a shimmery ivory dupatta with a black crop-top, paired with black leggings. A modern twist to a saree that’s easy to drape and move around wearing.

Big shine

Don’t want to stick to the traditional outfits for each day, take a cue from Kriti Sanon in a black dhoti and asymmetrical top by Antar Agni brand. The desi addition to this look was with the long tribal neckpiece that gives it a festive feel without being over-the-top.We recently spotted this beautiful Varun Bahl creation at a fashion show which would make anyone look pretty. A gown with a woman’s portrait embellished onto it. The lower part is even more interesting with ruffles below.

Trendy floral

Floral as a trend is here to stay. If you’re someone, who enjoys wearing western outfits more than Indian, then this mustard yellow gown with pink florals from AnjKreations is just for you. Sleeveless, halter-neck and coloured outfit, what’s not to love?The festival of Ganpati is hugely celebrated in the state of Maharashtra and this blessed week could be an opportunity for you to dress up in a kashti saree but you don’t have to worry about draping it. A Sonaakshi Raaj golden saree with gold motifs borders and a waist-length red designer blouse makes it easier to look like a modern Marathi girl on Ganpati."
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."

Sirsa Deputy Commissioner Prabhjot Singh has announced imposition of curfew in Sirsa and nearby villages Shahpur Begu, Nejia and Bajekan from 10 pm tonight. In the morning, Dera followers took the authorities by surprise when hundreds of them assembled outside police lines. Later, the authorities closed the Barnala road that leads to the courts premises and police lines near the PWD Rest House. The police as well as Rapid Action Force staged a flag march on various roads of the town. Senior IAS officer V Umashankar and IG Amitabh Dhillon, who are camping in Sirsa to assist the district administration, DC Prabhjot Singh and SP Ashwin Shenvi accompanied the flag march. The Dera chief was accused of rape in 1999. The CBI took over the investigation in 2002. On August 17, the special CBI court of Panchkula concluded hearing in the case, but reserved pronouncing the verdict for August 25. For the August 17 hearing, Gurmeet was exempted from appearing in person at Panchkula by the court. The Dera chief had cited medical reasons for not attending court in person. The case was registered by the CBI in 2002 against the Dera chief after allegations of sexual exploitation of two women followers through anonymous letters. The hearing has been going on since 2007."
Centre to speed up issuance of ‘identity certificates’ to refugees,"Dinesh Manhotra

Tribune News Service

Jammu, August 24

Amid the debate on Article 35A, the Centre today announced to expedite the process of issuing ‘identity certificates’ to the West Pakistan refugees. Union Minister of State (MoS) for Home Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, who was in Jammu today to review the progress of the implementation of the rehabilitation package announced for the refugees of J&K, said the West Pakistan refugees were facing the worst instability in their lives since 1947. “The Union Home Ministry had decided to issue identity certificates to the refugees but the progress of issuing such documents is not up to the mark,” the minister admitted. He said he had given directions to issue identify certificates to the refugees. The opposition National Conference and separatist groups raked up the issue last year when the decision was taken to issue the certificates to the refugees. On August 17, 2016, the then Deputy Commissioner, Jammu, had issued an order, directing all tehsildars of Jammu district to issue identify certificates to the West Pakistani Refugees in the state so that their children could get jobs in the Indian Armed Forces. Despite passing of one year, the local administration has failed to issue the certificates to the refugees living in the Jammu province. Ahir also expressed concern over the illegal settlement of Rohingyas in Jammu. “The illegal settlement of Rohingyas in Jammu is a matter of concern. We had a detailed discussion during a review meeting here with the authorities,” he said. He said: “We have asked the officials concerned to identify the number of families of Rohingyas living in Jammu for further action.” Ahir said. “Their activities should be watched and what businesses they are running and their source of income must be noticed.”"
"Undefeated and unloved, Floyd Mayweather eyes final payday","Two years after retiring from boxing, Floyd Mayweather climbs back into the ring on Saturday chasing history and one last mammoth payday.

The 40-year-old former welterweight champion will become the first boxer in history to post a perfect record of 50-0, if as expected, he proves too strong for Conor McGregor, the mixed martial arts star fighting in his first ever boxing contest.

The 50th bout of Mayweather’s 21-year professional career has been disparaged variously as a freak show, publicity stunt or simply “bad for boxing.”

Mayweather, who has spent years crafting an image as the fighter that fans love to hate, is not even remotely fazed by the catcalls.

Because not for the first time the boxer who delights in displaying the trappings of his wealth across social media will be laughing all the way to the bank.

Mayweather, whose career earnings reportedly topped USD 700 million following his last bout in 2015, could, according to some estimates, pocket another $200 million this weekend.

It is the latest money-spinning stop on a career that has seen Mayweather go from 1996 Olympics bronze medallist to be regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history.

Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on February 4, 1977, Mayweather was destined for the ring.

His father, Floyd Mayweather Sr., was himself a talented former welterweight who once fought 10 rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard.

Floyd Sr. taught his son to box almost as soon as he could walk.

Floyd Sr. was holding his infant son in his arms when he was shot in the leg during a family dispute, an injury that effectively ended his career.

“He was training to be a fighter in the crib,” Mayweather Sr. said of his son.

Mayweather, who grew up in a cramped apartment with seven relatives, frames his early life as a battle for survival.

‘Never been easy’

“It’s never been easy for me. Boxing is easy but life has never been easy,” Mayweather says.

“I had a father who was a hustler and a mother who was on drugs. I was the man in the house from 16. That’s just the way it was.”

When Mayweather fought at the 1996 Olympics, his father was serving a five-year prison sentence for drug-trafficking.

In Floyd Sr’s absence, his uncle Roger had taken over the training of the young fighter, overseeing his entry to the professional ranks.

Within two years, the skilful, lightning-fast Mayweather had won his first world title, knocking out the WBC superfeatherweight champion Genaro Hernandez in eight rounds.

Years of domination followed as Mayweather ploughed through the divisions up to welterweight.

In 2006, he took the unusual step of buying out his contract with promoter Bob Arum, in order to take greater control of his career.

Since then Mayweather has been able to dictate terms for most of his fights, taking a cut of the back-end profit in exchange for upfront risk.

It means that the dollars have continued to flow in ever-increasing numbers, from USD 25 million to fight Oscar De La Hoya in 2007 to around USD 220 million for his 2015 fight against Manny Pacquiao.

But while the dollars have rolled in and the bank balances have swollen, Mayweather has struggled to build up a reserve of public goodwill.

Multiple convictions for domestic violence point to the fighter’s dark side, while in boxing terms he has faced accusations that he ducked his most dangerous opponents, such as Pacquiao, until they were past their peak.

His cagey, cautious style inside the ring, while earning grudging approval from purists, has also frustrated fans hoping to see him take a more aggressive approach.

Mayweather, who insists Saturday’s bout with McGregor will be the last time he ever enters a ring, is unapologetic about the tactics that have guided his career, believing his is a template that many rivals would like to emulate.

“When a person has been so dominant in his era, I think other fighters are going to pay attention,” he told reporters recently.

“The main fighters are going to pay attention because they want to be at my level and they want to do the same thing—they want to dominate with ease.” — AFP"
The Tribune: Jobs and Careers,"One of the quickest growing fields in bio-medical science is that of Genome Sequencing. It deals with the study of biological changes in living organisms.

Gauri Chhabra

One of the quickest growing fields in bio-medical science is that of Genome Sequencing. It deals with the study of biological changes in living organisms. It is the branch of biotechnology that deals with the study of cells, structural and functional unit of living organisms.

Nearly every cell in the human body — from the ones in the fingernails to the ones deep inside the brain-contains a complete set of DNA, the operating instructions that influence everything from a person’s hair colour to susceptibility to disease. For years, doctors have been able to test specific genes to detect the presence of mutations associated with disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. But only recently have scientists been able to map out a person’s entire genetic code, or genome, by sequencing all 20,000 or so genes in one fell swoop. There has been a huge movement in affordable rapid genome sequencing recently and this will produce massive numbers of new genetic data on individuals, as well as populations. The challenge is now on for a new generation of scientists who are able to combine genetics and bioinformatics in an effort to understand how various genomic changes can cause life-threatening diseases such as cancer. This will enable the development of new treatments, through combining drug and gene therapy, along with prevention strategies.

Getting in

If you are interested in getting admission in bachelor courses, you have to complete higher secondary examination with physics, chemistry & biology. The duration of this course is three years. Some colleges also conduct an aptitude test for admission in genetics course.

To get admission in master’s course, you must have done a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field from any recognised college or university. Some institutions also give admission in genetic courses on the basis of the merit list of the qualifying examination.

Career Scape

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors collect and analyse data about patients’ medical and genetic histories. You will also provide information and help families and individuals about the occurrence, risk and minimisation of inherited diseases. You can also have job duties in areas such as administration, research, teaching and lab work. Institutions such as hospitals, universities, laboratories, research facilities and government agencies can employ genetic counselors.

Laboratory Geneticists: These are specialists in genetics with relation to laboratory medicine and DNA testing. You will research genetic material to assist and work for agricultural, pharmaceutical, clinical medicine and law enforcement organisations. Many laboratory geneticists have 4-6 years of postsecondary education, while lab directors may hold either a Ph.D. or an MD degree

Clinical Geneticists: Clinical geneticists are generally licensed physicians, and may also be involved in the field of medical genetics. You can be specialised in areas such as oncology, pediatrics or obstetrics and gynecology, and work in hospitals, medical centers or other research centers. In addition, clinical geneticists may manage a team of genetic counselors and work together to help identify and minimise the risk factors for certain hereditary diseases.

Genetic Counselors: Genetic counselors play a key role in helping patients and their families get the care that’s right for them. Genetic counselors work with doctors and other members of the health care team to help patients understand what their family history means to them, decide what genetic tests to have, and know how to use the test results to make the best treatment choices. This is especially helpful today as medicine becomes more personalised, and treatment plans increasingly are tailored to a patient’s individual needs.

The road ahead

Genetics has become popular, and there are many areas in biology and medicine that require genetics. Therefore, this is one field which offers immense opportunities.

What is Genome Sequencing?

The technique that allows researchers to read and decipher the genetic information found in the DNA of anything from bacteria to plants to animals is called genome sequencing.

Genomics involves measuring everything about a genome and the changes between genomes.

Genome sequencing involves the determination of the order of DNA bases. You may be wondering what makes these bases so important. In a strand of DNA, there are some simple units known as nucleotides. These nucleotides have a 'backbone' that consists of sugars and a phosphate group.

Commonly used techniques in genomics are DNA sequencing, microarrays, and PCR.

Genomics is being increasingly used in medicine to help diagnose disease since an individual’s DNA sequence can provide insights into the potential for developing specific diseases.

Genomics is one of many ""-omics"" disciplines that is becoming more prominent in biotechnology and research as a whole.

Discoveries in this field often allign with innovations in the technologies available to conduct analysis and perform sequencing or assays.

The very basic unit of the human genome is a single DNA nucleotide. This nucleotide is made up of minuscule atoms, which create a challenge for even an advanced microscope to be used for detection. Researchers still, however, need to be able to determine the sequence of bases in DNA.

The Aims of Democracy,"LAHORE, SATURDAY, AUGUST 25, 1917

THERE is one mistake that is made in connection with the future constitution of India-that is the Home Government should make certain concessions to India in view of the part taken by this country in the war and the demands made by her people. This presumes that the British democracy has no duty to change the form of government in pursuance of its democratic aims apart from rewarding India for war-services and doling out concessions to a discontented people. But we are afraid that this is not the object of the political reformer, either in India or in England, who is urging constitutional changes at present. The great outstanding fact is that, even if there were no agitation in India and no demands necessitated by the war, the aims of the British democracy are to establish self-government in this country."
Unrelenting BJP forces adjournment,"ASSEMBLY IN SESSION

Shimla, August 24

The logjam in the Vidhan Sabha continued for the third consecutive day today as an unrelenting BJP stuck to its demand for a debate under Rule 67 on the failing law and order situation, compelling the Speaker to adjourn the Assembly after business for the day was completed amidst complete pandemonium. Efforts by the Speaker to pacify BJP MLAs failed even after the House was adjourned for 15 minutes at 11.45 am. Later, the Opposition trouped to the well of the House and raised slogans and stood around the Speaker on the dais, before he adjourned the Assembly after four Bills were introduced hurriedly amidst complete mayhem. The moment the Assembly started, the Speaker allowed Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh to make a statement, evoking strong protest from the BJP. While BJP members were still objecting to it, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Agnihotri took the paper from the Chief Minister and read the statement amidst complete uproar. The opposition was on its feet, objecting to CM’s statement on the ground that no statement can be made before the question hour. “Please specify under which rule you allowed the CM or the minister to make a statement which could have been done only if you had suspended question hour. Please do not adopt double yardsticks and violate the norms and rules yourself”, Leader of Opposition PK Dhumal asked the Speaker BBL Butail through a Point of Order. This House is run on rules, which you are yourself not upholding, he added. The Speaker categorically said that he had allowed the CM to make the statement and there was nothing wrong in it. “The government always has the prerogative of making a statement anytime. Today is private member day but government business takes priority over everything else”, remarked Butail. He added that he had rejected BJP MLAs notice for debate under Rule 67 and converted it into Rule 62, which can be taken up tomorrow. Repeated pleas by the Speaker to the BJP legislators to allow taking up of the question hour were ignored as Opposition indulged in sloganeering against the government and Virbhadra Singh. An enraged Mahender Singh pointed out that the Speaker had not responded to his notice under Rule 67 for a debate on the incident where a 15-year-old girl from Dharampur was picked up three youth and raped in a hotel and dumped in the market the next day. The local Congress leaders pressurised the police to hush up the case, he alleged. Maheshwar Singh too joined in and said that a 17-year-old girl had been raped in Kullu. Similar incidents were cited by other legislators, including Ravinder Ravi and Jai Ram Thakur. “I gave notice for debate under Rule 62 to discuss the murder of Forest Guard Hoshyar Singh but even that has not been allowed. You are not allowing debate under Rule 62, 67 or 130, so what do you expect us to do,” said Jai Ram. He said last night his vehicle had been chased and stopped by two youth up to Vidhan Sabha gate and despite telling SP (Shimla) no action was taken. Dhumal pointed out that rape of minor girls had taken place in Kullu, Dharampur, Tissa and Sarkaghat and had police acted promptly in Kotkhai these cases wouldn’t have happened. “Please keep your age and stature in mind while making statements about BJP MLAs. I demand an apology from the CM for calling using unparliamentarily language against BJP MLAs,” he demanded. BJP’s Chief Whip Suresh Bhardwaj said in a democracy, issues can be resolved only through debate, which was not being allowed."
"Supreme Court slams BCCI, summons officials","Asks CoA to draft new constitution

New Delhi, August 23

The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked BCCI’s acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry to appear before it and explain their failure to comply with the court’s order to implement the Lodha Committee’s recommendations. A three-judge Bench, headed by Justice Dipak Misra, expressed its displeasure over the non-implementation of its order and asked the trio to appear personally before it on September 19. “The whole problem is that nothing has been implemented. We will issue show-cause notices and direct for personal presence,” Justice Misra said after amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium pointed out that nothing had been done to implement the recommendations. The Bench also agreed to hear Cricket Association of Bihar’s plea accusing Choudhary of disregarding the court’s directions by inviting disqualified cricket administrators to the BCCI meetings. Subramanium alleged that BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, who was accompanied by the legal advisor of the Committee of Administrators (CoA), was not allowed to attend the July 26 special general body meeting, wherein none of the recommendations and the directions passed by the top court were implemented. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, representing the board officials, contested Subramanium’s submissions saying that after the July 26 meeting, the board officials had sent out e-mails to everyone concerned that all recommendations must be complied with. “You have expressed your helplessness. Beseechment is not the solution,” the Bench responded. The Bench directed CoA to prepare a draft constitution of BCCI in terms of its earlier judgments on the Lodha panel recommendations. “We think it appropriate that CoA shall prepare a draft constitution in terms of the main judgement as well as the July 24 order of this court,” it said, adding that the copies of the draft constitution be handed over to all the parties. In its fifth status report, CoA had sought the removal of Khanna, Choudhary and Chaudhry. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, said there were certain issues which required to be dealt with by the court. The Bench, however, said it would deal with these aspects after CoA file the draft constitution."
Drive smart with Telematics,"Sourabh Chatterjee

With technology fuelling a lot of changes around us, we are now witnessing motor insurance covers that not only pay for our claims, but also assist us to improve our driving behaviour. Here's everything that you need to know about telematics - the technology behind this transformation. n Technically put, telematics is a conjunction of a GPS system with your vehicle's on-board diagnostic system. By putting these two together, complete details of a car can be mapped, from its location to its speed to even its engine health. n This is done by fitting a dongle like device to your car's OBD II port, which then communicates all the relevant data to the insurer over a mobile network. This data is then used by the insurer to interpret your driving behaviour as well as your car's diagnostic details. n The data so interpreted is then communicated to you via your smartphone. Usually the insurance companies integrate these features to the company-specific app that they have developed for their customers. After purchasing a telematics- based policy, the customers are required to enter their policy details in the app, on the basis of which, the insurer syncs their device to the app. This is a must to avail the features of this facility through one's smartphone. n Through the App you will be able to get a complete connected experience where you will be notified on your car's engine and battery health, and shall receive a detailed driving summary where you would be advised on better driving techniques. Even stats on optimal utilisation of the fuel would be shared with you. n There are additional features such as alerts on over speeding, rash driving etc. along with notifications on the approaching renewal dates of your insurance, PUC, car servicing etc. You can even Geo-Fence your car i.e. define geographical boundaries for your vehicle. If the vehicle moves out of these set boundaries, you will instantly be notified about the same. This feature has several uses, esp. in case of chauffer- driven cars, where you can monitor your car's movement and hence ensure the safety of your loved ones using it. n Till date the insurance companies used static parameters such as vehicle make, model, region of registration etc. to compute a vehicle's motor insurance premium. But with this technology, individuals can avail better pricing and renewal discounts basis the real time feedback of his/her driving behaviour. n This means that good drivers will no longer have to compensate for the bad driving behaviour of their fellow motor car owners. They can avail better discounts and lower premiums basis their good driving behaviour. n Though telematics as a concept is new to India, there are insurance companies that have clubbed this technology with their motor insurance offerings. Anyone with a smartphone and a car can avail the facilities of this motor insurance and get benefitted for their good driving skills. Telematics as a technology is being used for years in Formula 1 races to track the movements of all the race participants. Insurers, now equipped with this technology, are offering their customers 24X7 connected experience. Not only is this going to make the Indian roads safer, but is also going to promise you safety, security, convenience and a lot of savings.

Sangrur, August 24

In more trouble for security agencies, lakhs of followers of Dera Sacha Sauda have closed their shops and other business establishments across the state and along with their families, have started moving towards Dera headquarters Sirsa and Panchkula to express solidarity with Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Sources among Dera followers said that after a discussion, all followers who run various businesses and shops across the state, have closed their establishments and have converged in their respective Nam Charcha Ghars from where they are moving towards Sirsa and Panchkula in small groups. Premis, as Dera followers are known, from Samana, Patiala and Nabha also shut their shops and left for Panchkula.

They say they will camp for the night on the streets and wait for the court verdict tomorrow.

Hundreds of them, including women, have left for Panchkula.

“No one asked us to close our shops, but we have decided on our own. I, along with my family, am going to Panchkula to attend the court hearing on Friday,” said Ravinder, a local Dera follower who runs a shop in the main market. Followers have booked local vehicles. All devotees wear special lockets of the Dera and they have hidden them under their vests. “All Dera followers have closed their shops and other business establishments on their own without any direction from the Dera. All are moving towards the Sirsa Dera and Panchkula. They have great respect for the court, but they want to express solidarity with the Dera head during the court hearing,” said Harinder Insan Mangwal, a member of 45-member Punjab state executive committee of the Dera."
Secure garden,"GROUND REALTY

Jagvir Goyal

A spurt in cancer cases in North India and awareness about the ill effects of excessive use of pesticides has made people look for organic food or make effort to grow their own vegetables. While a company has launched vegetable and fruit purifier which has not been much successful, trend of growing own vegetables is fast catching up in urban areas. ‘Plant to Plate’ is becoming a tagline for the urban elite. As a result everyone wants to have his own kitchen garden, grow vegetables and enjoy healthy and pesticide-free food. As far as one is living on the ground floor, there is no problem in developing a kitchen garden. One can always find a corner or some space in the front or back courtyard to develop the kitchen garden. And there are no structural issues involved. The challenge lies in developing a kitchen garden while living on the first floor or higher elevations, in flats or apartments. Here, the front or back balconies are considered to be most suitable locations for developing kitchen garden because plenty of sunlight and air are available. What is more important to watch are the structural features of the kitchen garden. Let’s have a look at the related engineering aspects of this new trend:

Structural features

Developing a kitchen garden in a balcony or on the terrace means deposition of extra earth load over the balcony or terrace slab. This extra load on the slab causes stresses in it and at the slab supports. Application of water to the plants may cause retention of water on the balcony or terrace leading to dampness in the area. Then establishment of proper drainage system has also to be taken care of. Thus, there are three major structural features: Structural design, water proofing and drainage arrangements. design: The design of the floor slab over which a kitchen garden is to be developed, needs to be rechecked by taking into account the extra load of earth and other items that shall be rested over the slab. Often the weight of earth is counted but the weight of extra pots that are laid there is ignored. Weight of pots is significant and needs to be considered as ‘pointed load’. It is better to use stands for the pots instead of placing them directly on the slab to disperse their load over a wider area.To cause lesser load on the slab, wooden, plastic, aluminium or fibre pots should be selected. The weight of soil should be considered as saturated slab so that weight of water also gets counted. Normally, the thickness of soil mixed with manure layer thickness is 8 inch to 10 inch. By rechecking the design, it should be ensured that the slab and its supports can wear the extra load being put on it without causing any cracks in them. Cantilevers: If a kitchen garden is being developed in a balcony, be extra cautious. Most of the balconies are designed as cantilevers and cantilevers are infamous for their failure in the history of civil engineering. A cantilever is simply projecting from a wall without any other support below it. If the cantilever slab is found to be unsafe for extra load being caused on it, supports below it should be provided before developing kitchen garden in the balcony. It should also be seen that making all this arrangement of extra supports below the cantilever slab is not uneconomical. Waterproofing: Needless to say that waterproofing of kitchen garden slab is as important as its structural design. To provide waterproofing, proper treatment should be given to the slab before laying the garden. The slab surface should be cleaned well with wire brushes and then treated well by applying polymer-based flexible water proofing layers on it. While doing this, if any cracks are noted in the slab, these should be treated well by converting them into small V-shaped crevices and then filling them with a polymer modified mortar. For waterproofing, it is better to lay a layer of 6mm thick 1 : 3 cement sand mortar over the slab after adding waterproofing compound to the mortar. Over the mortar layer, a layer of tiles can be laid in slope as per drainage plan. Drainage arrangement: In case of balconies and terraces, it is common practice to provide proper slope to the slab area during their construction, for drainage of rain water through rain water pipes. A concrete ‘gola’ at the junction of the slab and parapets is also provided in normal practice as these junctions are the vulnerable leakage points. While developing a kitchen garden in balcony or on terrace, a 2 inch thick layer of water-borne aggregate or shingle or pebbles should also be laid over the tiles in the same slope by maintaining the two-inch thickness uniformly so that the slope of tiles is acquired by the stone layer also. This whole system shall provide effective drainage arrangement. All these loads should be considered while rechecking the structural design of the slab. Geo-membrane provision: For creating best kitchen garden arrangement, it is better to lay a thick layer of geo membrane on the tiles before covering them with the pebbles or stones. However, this is optional as the geo-membrane layer will causeadditional cost. Otherwise, a HDPE net layer can be laid over the stones. This geo membrane or HDPE net layer will prove helpful in holding back the soil while excess rain water in balcony gets drained off to the rain water pipes. Next, the soil layer can be laid as the base for it is now ready to receive the soil. The water connection: Provision of a water connection in the balcony or terrace is essential for a productive kitchen garden growing vegetables. Generally, we keep a tap on the terrace or balcony to draw water. Same tap can be used for watering the vegetable plants in kitchen garden. Outsourcing the job: As growing on vegetables is becoming a craze among people, many companies who undertake development of kitchen garden now exist in every city. An online search will tell you about their existence. And howsoever small space be available with you, they would develop your kitchen garden in it. Even a 4 x 4 feet space is converted by them. Contact them and assign them the job. However, just ensure that all structural aspects are taken care of and joy of having a kitchen garden is not marred by structural cracks or dampness or leakage or failure of balconies. — The writer is former HoD and engineer-in-chief, civil engineering department in

Chandigarh, August 24

With all educational institutes–schools, colleges and even Panjab University–closed as a precautionary measure in the wake of the Dera verdict, Chandigarh and Mohali on Thursday wore a deserted look while Panchkula was abuzz with activity. All the roads and streets in Chandigarh and Mohali were free of usual traffic congestion as there was no school/college/university transport plying and many government employees also skipping office as a precautionary measure. The local police, with the assistance of paramilitary force which has reached Panchkula, Chandigarh and Mohali in large numbers, have taken positions. While all exit and entry points of the tricity region comprising Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali have been put under security check-points, the area in and around the CBI court complex in Panchkula has turned into a garrison. The vehicles entering Panchkula are subjected to extensive checking, following which there are reports of queues at the nakas while those plying in and between Chandigarh and Mohali are randomly checked.

BJP chief deploys ‘half the govt’ in forthcoming state polls,"Jaitley made election in-charge of Gujarat, Gehlot in HP, Javadekar gets Karnataka

Vibha Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 24

BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday appointed eight top-ranking ministers looking after more than 15 key departments in the Narendra Modi government as in-charge of three states —Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka, due for elections this year and early next year.

While senior leader and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who has also held the responsibility in the past, has been given the charge of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah’s home state Gujarat, HRD Minister Prakash Javedakar and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot will take care of the BJP’s fortunes in Congress-ruled Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, respectively.

Notably, in Gujarat Jaitley will be assisted by an array of senior central ministers. They include Narendra Singh Tomar, Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh and PP Choudhary.

While the move is indicative of the importance Gujarat holds for BJP, the fact that in addition to the PM and Shah (who will obviously be actively campaigning in their state) five top ministers have been positioned to oversee Gujarat polls perhaps also shows that “all may not be well” for the saffron party in the state.

Even as the BJP juggernaut rolls on with Shah in the driving seat, events in Karnataka and Gujarat show the party may not be as comfortable position as he would like it to be.

For example Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s win in the Rajya Sabha polls, despite the best efforts by Shah, proved what appears on the surface could be different from the realities on the ground.

Besides, ever since Modi moved to the Centre, Gujarat has been a hot spot of major anti-BJP agitations, including the Patidar protests led by Hardik Patel and the Dalit revolt after the Una flogging episode.

In Gujarat, the BJP is not just facing an anti-incumbency of 17 years but also a built-up over Prime Minister’s economic moves like demonetisation and switchover to the GST.

As far as Karnataka is concerned, where Union minister Piyush Goyal will assist Javadekar in building the BJP campaign in the Congress-ruled state, the grand old party appears to be on a roll after the launch of ‘Indira Canteen’ — a new programme of the Siddaramaiah government to provide food at subsidised rates.

In Himachal Pradesh, a relatively smaller state which appears to be “quite under control”, Gehlot will be relying upon State leaders for help, say BJP leaders.

Seven key states — Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh (November-December), Meghalaya (February) Karnataka (April-May next year), Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan (September-October 2018) — will go to polls before the 2019 General Elections."

Jalandhar, August 24

Jalandhar has been put on high alert and prohibitory orders imposed ahead of the court verdict in the alleged rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

The Deputy Commissioner has imposed section 144-A in the entire district. Likewise, people have been debarred from carrying weapons and wireless sets except the police and para-military forces.

Though intelligence reports have ruled out any riot-like situation in the district, DC Varinder Sharma has directed all officials to be prepared for any exigency that may come after the special CBI court will announce its verdict tomorrow in the dera chief case.

Along with the deployment of the police force, the BSF and the Sashashtra Seema Bal (SSB), the Army has also been put on standby for help to maintain law and order, while the Centre has assured all possible help to both states.

According to Jalandhar Police Commissioner Praveen Sinha, the situation in Jalandhar is expected to remain peaceful as there are only 2,000-3,000 followers in the entire district. “While the dera leaders have assured all cooperation to us in maintaining peace and harmony in the area, much will depend on the court’s verdict tomorrow and its cascading effect that may reach the city as well,” said Sinha.

Though the district administration has not issued any advisory to the religious organisations, the police have tightened security around religious shrines as well.

Later, in a meeting held with all the Sub Divisional Magistrates and Executive Magistrates, the DC told them to keep a strict vigil over the law and order situation in the areas of their respective jurisdiction in the wake of the impending judgment against Dera Sacha Sauda head.

He told officials not to leave their stations for two days. Sharma categorically said that any sort of callousness towards duty in this hour was not tolerable, adding that the officials should tie up with their counterparts in the Police Department and prepare a joint strategy for dealing with any sort of untoward situation.

He also said that a strict check must be kept over rumour mongers so that people were not misled by anyone. He directed the officials to adopt zero tolerance towards the miscreants or anti-social elements trying to create any sort of disturbance.

Sharma said officials must lay major thrust on maintaining law and order situation in the district along with promoting the ethos of communal harmony, peace and brotherhood at every cost.

The Deputy Commissioner also solicited the support of people for the maintenance of peace and harmony. He said people should not get panicky as the district administration was fully vigilant to tackle any sort of situation.

Sharma told the officials to ensure that in compliance with the orders of the state government all educational institutions within their jurisdiction were closed tomorrow. He said strict action would be taken against the educational institutes violating the directions of the state."
Tobacco users prone to poorer academic performance,"Kochi

A study that surveyed more than 7,500 high school and higher secondary school students in Kerala's Ernakulam district has found that tobacco users are prone to poorer academic performance.

It also proves that tobacco is a 'gateway drug', one that leads users to other potent drugs.

Lead author Dr TS Jaisoorya said in a release that they took up the study to evaluate psychological issues among school going adolescents who often have multiple vulnerabilities.

A high 76.3 per cent of lifelong tobacco users — those who had smoked or used smokeless tobacco throughout their life — had failed in a subject compared to 57 per cent of non-users, the release said.

Further, 24.7 per cent of such users had failed a year of studies as against 9.1 per cent non-users.

The study also found that tobacco users had significantly higher usage rates of alcohol and illicit drugs.

Alcohol use among lifelong tobacco users was found to be 67.8 per cent as compared to 11 per cent in non-users.

In the case of illicit drugs, the rates of use were 33 per cent versus 6.1 per cent in tobacco users and non-users, respectively.

These findings recently published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research are part findings of the larger study looking at psychological issues among adolescent school students, done by the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS).

The National Health Mission (Kerala) and Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Kerala also associated with the study.

In what could be good news to enforcement officials, the study reports decreasing trend of tobacco use among adolescent high school students compared to previous studies done among students in South India, and in Kannur district.

In the survey, 6.9 per cent students reported having used tobacco in any form, with the proportion of males using tobacco being 12.5 per cent and females 1.2 per cent.

Most users still initiated early with the mean age of initiation among users being 14 years.

Further, a majority of users (67 per cent) were using it hazardously in their school years signifying that they had a very high risk of progression to addiction, the release said. PTI"

The Supreme Court has made the right to privacy a fundamental right. So, will it work in letter and spirit? Well-known faces from the region share their take

Jasmine Singh

The Oxford dictionary defines privacy as a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people,; now, the word finds an approval from the Supreme Court, which, in a verdict on Thursday, passed the ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right.

Chief Justice JS Khehar said the ‘right to privacy’ is intrinsic to the ‘right to life’ and is hence a part of Article 21, Part 3, of the Constitution of India. The verdict, though slightly ambiguous in nature, has got thumbs-up from the film fraternity, politicians and from the general public. In a country like ours, where the next-door- aunty keeps a tab on your coming and going out timings, where paparazzi chase celebrities to death, where one can draw hints about your private life from the social media...declaring ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right is a praiseworthy step. What needs to be seen now is how it safeguards privacy!

Private life

“Privacy is part of our liberty, part of freedom, which must be respected; it helps people make better decisions and safeguard our family,” shares filmmaker Amit Prasher, who reminds us of the one-line answer that actors and actresses have in response to whom are they dating or if they were seen with someone – ‘It’s my personal life’. “No one has any right to question them or print their personal pictures on social networking sites,” he adds.

Amit has raised a valid concern but with celebrities willing to share their personal pictures on social networking sites, it is all a bit chaotic. “Celebrities want to share their pictures all the time and then they want to guard their privacy fiercely,” says Mandy M, singer-actor. Mandy is also of the opinion that the verdict might curtail the loose talk that people do about celebrities on social media; morphing pictures, writing about their personal choices.

Right choice

One of the key conclusions of the judgement is that privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacy, the sanctity of family life, marriage, home, procreation and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes right to be left alone. Dhananjay Mangalmukhi, first transgender student at Panjab University, draws our attention to this point. “It is my business what I do in my bedroom; whom I stay with, what I wear, is my right. Tomorrow, they can even install cameras in washrooms, which will be total violation of privacy.”

Vivek Trivedi, Chandigarh-based social worker, however, has his concerns. “We already have six fundamental rights that are violated on a daily basis. Right to privacy will only hold some value if there is a law backing it, which will allow prosecution, otherwise this will be another fundamental right with exceptions.”

Great verdict

""I am truly overwhelmed by the Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy and the parts of the judgement which specifically mention that sexual orientation should be a guaranteed right under the Constitution. This is a big day for the LGBTQ community in India, who have been fighting for their rights for over two decades. This verdict vindicates our appeal for equal rights as citizens of India. I feel truly happy and free.""

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."

Jalandhar, August 24

Jalandhar has been put on high alert and prohibitory orders imposed ahead of the court verdict in the alleged rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

The Deputy Commissioner has imposed section 144-A in the entire district. Likewise, people have been debarred from carrying weapons and wireless sets except the police and para-military forces.

Though intelligence reports have ruled out any riot-like situation in the district, DC Varinder Sharma has directed all officials to be prepared for any exigency that may come after the special CBI court will announce its verdict tomorrow in the dera chief case.

Along with the deployment of the police force, the BSF and the Sashashtra Seema Bal (SSB), the Army has also been put on standby for help to maintain law and order, while the Centre has assured all possible help to both states.

According to Jalandhar Police Commissioner Praveen Sinha, the situation in Jalandhar is expected to remain peaceful as there are only 2,000-3,000 followers in the entire district. “While the dera leaders have assured all cooperation to us in maintaining peace and harmony in the area, much will depend on the court’s verdict tomorrow and its cascading effect that may reach the city as well,” said Sinha.

Though the district administration has not issued any advisory to the religious organisations, the police have tightened security around religious shrines as well.

Later, in a meeting held with all the Sub Divisional Magistrates and Executive Magistrates, the DC told them to keep a strict vigil over the law and order situation in the areas of their respective jurisdiction in the wake of the impending judgment against Dera Sacha Sauda head.

He told officials not to leave their stations for two days. Sharma categorically said that any sort of callousness towards duty in this hour was not tolerable, adding that the officials should tie up with their counterparts in the Police Department and prepare a joint strategy for dealing with any sort of untoward situation.

He also said that a strict check must be kept over rumour mongers so that people were not misled by anyone. He directed the officials to adopt zero tolerance towards the miscreants or anti-social elements trying to create any sort of disturbance.

Sharma said officials must lay major thrust on maintaining law and order situation in the district along with promoting the ethos of communal harmony, peace and brotherhood at every cost.

The Deputy Commissioner also solicited the support of people for the maintenance of peace and harmony. He said people should not get panicky as the district administration was fully vigilant to tackle any sort of situation.

Sharma told the officials to ensure that in compliance with the orders of the state government all educational institutions within their jurisdiction were closed tomorrow. He said strict action would be taken against the educational institutes violating the directions of the state."
Indian-origin Malaysian man jailed for life in Singapore,"Singapore, August 23

A 30-year-old Indian-origin Malaysian man has been jailed for life in Singapore along with 24 strokes of cane-lashing for smuggling drugs.

Saravanan Chandaram, 30, who pleaded guilty to two charges of importing the controlled drugs, also received the maximum 24 strokes of the cane, the Straits Times reported.

The prosecution submitted a certificate to the court stating that Saravanan was only a drug courier and had substantively helped the authorities to disrupt drug trafficking.

This gave the judge the discretion to impose a life sentence instead of the mandatory death penalty.

Saravanan was found with 10 bundles containing at least 1.38 kilogrammes of cannabis, and at least 3.29 kilogrammes of cannabinol and cannabinol derivative.

On November 5, 2014, he rented a car and met a drug syndicate leader, known only as Aya, in Skudai in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, where he collected the 10 bundles of drugs.

Saravanan, who worked for Aya as his bodyguard and personal driver, hid the bundles under the armrest of the rear passenger seat.

Defence lawyer Singa Retnam, in his closing submissions to the court last month, said that Saravanan had borrowed Malaysian Ringgit 4,000 (Singapore dollars 1,270) from Aya as he did not have enough savings for his son's operation.

When Saravanan returned to Johor on November 5, 2014, he was asked by Aya to repay the money, but he could not do so immediately, the Strait Times report said.

He had no choice but to adhere to his boss's demands and agreed to deliver 10 packets of tobacco, for Malaysian Ringgit 2,000, according to the defence's submissions.

The defence said that Saravanan believed he was delivering 10 packets of tobacco, instead of cannabis.

However, the prosecution said that Saravanan's belief was unfounded when there were clearly suspicious circumstances surrounding the delivery of the drugs.

There were also inconsistencies in his account as he had initially said he was promised Singapore dollars 5,000 for the delivery, but later claimed he was promised Malaysian Ringgit 2,000.

The prosecution noted that Saravanan was being paid a disproportionately high amount of Singapore dollars 5,000 for a relatively simple task of delivery. —PTI"

THE runway at Agartala had a general east-west alignment before 1947. After the creation of erstwhile East Pakistan, the border ran west of the airfield. Resultantly, the aircraft had to cross over the border. To avoid this, another runway was constructed parallel to the border. My company had been deployed to guard the airfield since mid-November 1971. On our west was Chandpur village, occupied by the enemy. The area was thickly wooded. Around 7.30 pm on December 3, the field telephone in my bunker rang. It was urgent summons from the battalion headquarters. Shortly, a jonga with headlights off halted at the end of the runway and I was off. Having told us that Pakistanis had attacked our western airfields, the Commanding Officer tasked my company to capture Chandpur the next morning. It was past 10 pm when I got back. I called my order group to issue necessary instructions. Bhawani Singh, all of 22, was my quiet companion. He must have possessed sixth sense. By the time I returned to the bunker around midnight, he had cleaned my carbine, checked magazines for ammunition, primed two grenades and ensured their safety pins were in place. My field upholstery was laid out neatly; a bottle had been filled with water. He ensured that my identity discs were worn on my person. In one corner, was his own kit in complete readiness. He brewed tea on the stove and gave it to me in a mug. Free of these worries, my mind went over operational details. We spoke little. Before withdrawing to his nearby dug-out, he quietly reminded me to write a letter to the family. I also told him to write to his parents; he was to be married in three months. At the crack of dawn, on December 4, we launched the attack. Bhawani was next to me, carrying the radio set. Many lives and limbs were lost but we managed to capture the objective and began to reorganise to face a possible counter attack. Bhawani and I dug a 30-inch trench and crouched in it with our weapons. We remained under shelling throughout the day and continued to suffer casualties. At dusk there was a call from the battalion headquarters wanting to know the map reference of our position. The map was with the mortar officer, some 30 ft away in his trench. Bhawani volunteered to fetch it. He had hardly gone halfway when a shell landed near our trench throwing mud all over. I heard his groan. I jumped out and rushed to him. He was hit in the chest by a huge splinter; his entrails were out. I took his head in my lap and shouted for the stretcher bearers. Four of them from the medical platoon were the only medical help. They came quickly, but Bhawani was gone — the 10th casualty of the day. Tears welled up in my eyes on the loss of a close companion, a comrade-in-arms. In military glossary definition he was an orderly. In common parlance, he was a sahayak."

"The Tribune, Business news","BENGALURU:Infosys co-founder and former CEO Nandan Nilekani was tonight named Chairman after incumbent Chairman R Seshasayee, co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan and executive vice-chairman Vishal Sikka quit the Board.

Bengaluru, August 24

Infosys co-founder and former CEO Nandan Nilekani was tonight named Chairman after incumbent Chairman R Seshasayee, co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan and executive vice-chairman Vishal Sikka quit the Board. Venkatesan will however, continue to be an Independent Director.

""I am happy to return to Infosys, now in the role of non-executive chairman, and look forward to working with my colleagues on the Board and in executive management on the business opportunities we see before us and delivering benefits to our clients, shareholders, employees and communities,"" Nilekani said in a statement.

Given that Sikka's new contract as executive vice chairman has not yet been executed, the company said the Board had decided to complete all resignation formalities as per his employment contract as MD and CEO.

Sikka will receive 90 days' base pay in lieu of notice of $246,575, a variable pay of $205,572 and company-paid employee health insurance benefits for 90 days. All equity awards outstanding as on separation date to the extent such awards are unvested will terminate on the date of separation.

""A separation agreement reflecting this and other terms such as a mutual release and non-disparagement obligation has been approved by the Board,"" the statement said.

Nilekani took over as CEO from NR Narayana Murthy in March 2002 and passed on the reins to his successor Kris Gopalakrishnan, who took over as CEO in 2007.

The latest developments mark a dramatic turn of events for what has been a roller-coaster week at Infosys that began with Vishal Sikka’s decision to step down as CEO and the company’s subsequent statement blaming Murthy for Sikka’s exit. The events shocked stock markets and wiped out nearly $4 billion of Infosys’s market value.

The Board has been locked in a dispute for months with the company’s founders, led by former chairman Narayana Murthy, who have accused the directors of governance lapses. The dispute led to the resignation of the company’s Chief Executive Vishal Sikka last week.

Sikka, a former SAP executive, who joined Infosys as its first non-founder CEO in 2014, resigned amid what he said were “baseless, malicious and increasingly personal attacks”, sparking a massive selloff in Infosys’ shares and wiping billions of dollars off its market value.

Nilekani and his family own about 2.3% of Infosys, and have a net worth of $1.7 billion according to Forbes.

V. Balakrishnan, ex-CFO, Infosys, who has been siding with Murthy in the recent disputes, said Nilekani becoming the chairman of the Board will give comfort to all stakeholders. — Agencies

"The Tribune, Amritsar news","AMRITSAR: The Punjab Police have been on their toes in order to meet any eventuality in view of the CBI court’s verdict in a rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, here tomorrow.

Tribune reporters

Amritsar, August 24

The Punjab Police have been on their toes in order to meet any eventuality in view of the CBI court’s verdict in a rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, here tomorrow.

Police teams have been conducting rehearsals and drill in the Police Lines while the district administration and police officials have coordinated with the Army authorities in this regard.

A company of the Border Security Force and extra forces from the Punjab Armed Police (PAP) have been summoned to oversee the security arrangements while the entry and exit points have been sealed. Around 400 jawans of the police have been equipped with tear-gas and anti-riot gadgets to control the agitating mob, if the need arises.

Deputy Commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha and Police Commissioner SS Srivastava along with senior police officials today appealed to the people to keep calm and desist from any activity that could lead to a law and order problem in the holy city. They urged the people to respect the judgement of the CBI court.

Sangha urged the public not to believe any misinformation and rumours being spread through social media. Rumour mongers would be dealt with strictly, he said.

The police have made elaborate security arrangements to thwart any untoward incident. “The city has been divided into five subdivisions and each of these would be looked after by Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police and Assistant Commissioner of Police rank officers,” said the Police commissioner, adding that every police officer would be in the field to counter any law and order problem.

He added that over 2,000 cops had been pressed into service while all vulnerable areas were identified. Security arrangements have been made for these areas.

He said the district administration and the Police Commissionerate had imposed Section 144 of the CrPC. Besides, carrying licensed weapons or gathering of more than five persons was banned.

He said if anybody tried to damage government or private property, he would be dealt as per the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act.

Sanjhi Rasoi to remain closed

Amritsar: In view of the fact that the CBI court will pronounce a judgment tomorrow on the rape allegations against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the district administration has announced that the Sanjhi Rasoi, which provides food to the poor at subsidised rates, would remain closed on Friday.

Prez Xi pledges to properly address differences with S Korea: Xinhua,"Beijing, August 24

China’s President Xi Jinping pledged to make concerted efforts with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in to address differences between the two countries properly, the official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.

“Xi made the remarks in a congratulatory message sent to Moon on the 25th anniversary of the establishment of China-South Korea diplomatic relations,” Xinhua said.

Development of China-South Korea relations makes a positive contribution to regional peace and development, Xinhua cited Xi as saying. The news agency did not provide further details.

South Korea and the United States agreed to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in response to the growing missile threat from North Korea.

However, the move has angered China, which says the system’s powerful radar will look deep into its territory and undermine regional security.

China has pressured South Korean businesses through boycotts and bans, such as ending Chinese group tours to South Korea and closing most of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group’s Lotte Mart retail stores in China.

Moon has also pushed China, North Korea’s most important ally and trading partner, to do more to rein in Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the beginning of last year, significantly raising tension on the heavily militarised Korean peninsula and in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July resulted in a new round of tougher global sanctions. Reuters"
Maxwell suffers mild heatstroke in Bangladesh,
Iceland in a nutshell,"The landscapes, seascapes, lava fields, glacier and hiking trails of Snaefellsnes Peninsula make it worth exploring

Kanika Kalia

There is no doubt that Iceland is one of the most beautiful and traveller-friendly destinations in the world. Its dynamic landscape, mystery of geysers, legends of Vikings and beauty of northern lights has captivated travellers for years now. While most people visiting Iceland straightway shoot to the Golden Circle and south Iceland, the Snaefellsnes peninsula in west Iceland is truly a hidden gem just waiting to be explored. Why Snæfellsnes? Well for starters, it is a true testament to Iceland’s dynamic nature. It has almost everything that Iceland has to offer: breathtaking landscapes, alluring seascapes, lava fields, glacier, abandoned farms, and great hiking trails. No surprise that it’s often called ‘Iceland in a nutshell’. It makes for a great destination for a day trip (and even multiple if you have time). This is a much-less visited corner of Iceland compared to the typical touristy areas of the South Coast, and that being said, you will have some areas exclusive to yourself. Now, of course, in winters trying to explore this whole area in a day is literally like racing against the time. But if you have made up your mind and set off for a day of exploring, these tips will help you in planning.

Rent a car at the airport in Keflavík. This is the most convenient way of exploring the area. Though there are some tour companies that offer day trips to Snaefellsnes Peninsula , it will be best to drive it by yourself and do it at your own pace.

Depending on the number of days you intend to spend, base yourself out of Reykjavik.

According to google maps, the entire loop starting and ending at Reykjavik is almost about 500 km and takes six hours if you drive non-stop. But since there are so many scenic viewpoints and you are bound to make frequent stops, it will easily take 10-12 hours to explore the peninsular region.

For all you winter explorers, start your day early so that you may cover maximum in daylight.

There are not many restaurants in this area, so do not forget to pack lunch.

Fill your gas tank as and when you see a gas station. In winters, not all gas stations are open and you may not find one for hours.

Make sure you keep an eye on the weather and road conditions.

If you take the route via Hvalfjordur bay, you will have to pay the toll 100ISK. You can pay by card or in cash.

Things to see:

You can drive through Snaefellsnes Peninsula starting from Reykjavik in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, provided you reach the Kirkjufell mountain before sunset to enjoy a gem of the view. For this sole reason, it is recommended to drive anti-clockwise in winters. But Kirkjufell is not the only thing to see in this area. Here is list of stoppages you can make in your journey.

Mt. Helgafell: An easy 15-20 minute hike up Mt. Helgafell will reward you with a beautiful view. Legend says if you hike up Mt Helgafell keeping mum and not looking back, your three wishes come true. Definitely worth a try.

Eldborg volcanic caldera: A dirt road from the highway will take you to the closest parking spot near the crater. From there, it is about 15 to 20 minutes hike up.

Gerðuberg Basalt Columns: The beautiful hill gives an illusion of being on the sets of Game of Thrones. These basalt columns are nature’s masterpiece and give an illusion of castle’s fortification.

Bjarnarhöfn Shark Museum: This museum is not like any ordinary museum at all. What makes it unique? Well coupled with randomness and shabby appearance, this place will tell you about an intriguing Icelandic snack, fermented shark, called hákarl. Of course, you can’t leave the place without trying this peculiar delicacy.

Berserkjahraun (Lava field): While driving on Route 54, you will see lava field on both sides of the road. The landscape is breathtaking. To enjoy the beauty of these lava fields, you have two options. You can park your car somewhere near Berserkjahraunvegur road and go for a long walk. Or you can take a dirt road and explore it by car. If you do it by car, make sure your car has good tyres.

Vatnshellir: The 8000-year-old volcanic cave is bound to leave you speechless. There is only one way to explore this cave, and that is taking a group tour. In winters, this place often gets closed.

Kolgrafarfjördur Fjord: This fjord is known for the maximum concentration of marine life. In year 2003-4, there had been an incident of mass death of marine life in this fjord because of lack of oxygen and since then, it has been a popular stop for visitors. The area is beautiful and definitely worth spending some time and taking beautiful pictures.

Kirkujafell Mountain: The Kirkujafell Mountain is the climax of journey of Snaefellsnes Peninsula. It is the most photographed mountain of Iceland. When you reach this spot, you will understand God’s perfect set up: waterfall, mountain, sea — all in one sight. And if you are lucky, you will also find Icelandic horses running in the barn. Keep in mind that parking lot is small at this spot, so it does take some amount of waiting as this place remains crowded. For photographers, you will have to be in line to get the chance to photograph the mountain from the perfect angle."

The Guru of light,"The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn this work

Kuldip Singh Dhir

Birth of Guru Nanak marks an enlightening era in the darkest period of medieval India. Nugatory rituals, superstitions, dogmas, fatalistic outlook, caste divisions, gender discrimination and diffidence to stand up against injustice, oppression or tyranny had rendered people hapless invertebrates. He took upon himself the task of redemption from all this as an assignment from the heavens. The motive force for this lifelong mission was his intimate communion with the Ultimate which forms the leitmotif of this biography. This mystic connection becomes apparent for the first time when Nanak disappeared at the Bien river to reappear after three days.

His message was of oneness of the transcendent. He argued politely but compellingly against futile customs and orthodoxy, liberating people from senseless beliefs, hatred, malice, cowardice, immorality, and delusions which had created a plethora of problems. Profoundness of his simple and persuasive teachings had an immediate impact. Extra-ordinary story of the Guru has been told time and again, but it does not take long to appreciate that this narrative is privileged to stand apart. It relates to the reader as much through the emotive word as through scintillating brush-strokes. Its storyline leans on factual details available in the Sikh scripture Vars of Bhai Gurdas, Janamsakhi traditions, Mahima Parkash and Twarikh Guru Khalsa. Sumeet has vetted these with the help of Bhai Vir Singh, Macauliffe, Dr Ganda Singh, Prof Harbans Singh, Dr Gopal Singh, Prof GS Talib, Dr JS Garewal and McLeod.

The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn the leaves of this work. These are based on author’s own paintings and those of renowned artist Devender Singh, who happens to be his father.

These visuals speak in terms of multilayered creativity and boundless imagination, transcending determinate Cartesian barriers of everyday language. Flesh-and-blood characters, hermeneutical implications, mystical aura and creativity coalesce in this text. Abstract depiction of birth of the Guru, his refusal to wear the sacred thread, the Bien episode, discussion with Pir Dastgir and Sidhas, description of the Divine court (Sodar), the celestial song (arti), moods evoked by various Ragas / months of the year, and socio-cultural reality portrayed in the hymns are a testimony to it.

Starting with the birth of the Guru, Sumeet ends the introductory chapter with Nanak preparing for his missionary journeys after the Bein episode. We have a glimpse of his birth place Nankana Sahib, the birth of the extraordinary child, his family, and his father’s efforts to mould Nanak in the social, religious, cultural and educational framework of his times failing badly. The child prodigy astonishes everybody with rational thinking impeachable knowledge and precocious queries. The four chapters that follow present Nanak disseminating his message of oneness of God, dignity of labour, universal love, peaceful coexistence and socially responsible life, couching it in hymns of postmodernist plural tone.

Nanak acknowledges that his message was derived from a divine vision saying: “As the word comes, so do I describe it.” The people and places, customs and beliefs, habits and habitats, flora and fauna, natural environs and landscape, mountains, rivers and desolate lands, ascetic’s yogis and preachers of diverse faiths all come alive as if with a magical touch. He sang the divine praises all along. He often directed his Muslim companion Mardana to play on his rabab as he vividly sang the bani or Divine Word descending upon him from the skies.

Guru’s settled life in Kartarpur, his handing over his mission to Bhai Lehna, anointing him as Guru Angad and an insightful summary of Nanak’s teachings have been taken up next. The last three chapters give us a peep into the mind and message of the Guru by taking up three of his masterpieces, Japji, Asa di Var and Bara-mah. This unique biography combines skillfully narrative with the descriptive, real with the imaginary, and word with the brush-strokes to capture the persona of Guru Nanak."
