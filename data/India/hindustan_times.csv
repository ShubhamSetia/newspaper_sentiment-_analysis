"Pune’s highest junior college cut-off 97.4pc in 2016, 2017 said to get higher","With the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) results for Class 10 declared on June 13, pre-admission anticipation among students and parents have already began. The admissions to junior colleges across Maharashtra will be decided based upon the Centralised Admission Process (CAP) under the first year junior college (FYJC) admissions. Dates for the commencement of FYJC are yet to be declared.

With the official cut-off marks for the FYJC awaited, we take a look at last year’s cut-off marks in the top colleges of Pune.

In 2016, the first common merit list had shown a two per cent increase in the cut-off marks owing to the reduction in the number of seats under the open category. According to officials from the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), this was due to the introduction of in-house quotas and an overall increase in the marks of students under various quotas.

The officials added that a similar graph could be anticipated this year, as the resolution for extra marks had enabled SSC student’s marks to go up by a maximum of 100 per cent. 193 students across Maharashtra have secured 100 per cent results in Class 10.

Last year, among science colleges in the city, Pimpri Chinchwad’s City Pride School and Junior College had put up the highest cut-off of 97.4 per cent. Under the open category, their cut off mark was 487 out of 500. Laxmanrao Apte Prashala came second in the list, with their first list putting up an 87.45 per cent cut-off for aided students, and an 85.63 per cent cut-off for unaided students. In the second list, the cut-off for aided students was brought down to 86.90 per cent and unaided students needed to have a minimum of 84.72 per cent for getting an admission in the college. In total, only two lists had come out last year, filling up 260 seats, MSBSHSE officials confirmed.

Further, the PMC-run Rajiv Gandhi Academy of E-Learning had a cut-off mark of 480 on 500, while Fergusson College had a cut-off mark of 474 on 500 for their science streams.

Commerce had received the maximum number of applicants last year, leading to a total of 37,839 applicants for 22,634 seats in the city. Among the commerce colleges, the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce(BMCC) held the highest cut-off percentage of 94.2 per cent. Students aspiring for admissions at BMCC had to have a minimum of 471 marks on 500.

Fergusson College had the highest cut-off marks for the arts stream at 95.4 per cent. Students had to secure a minimum of 477 marks on 500 to get an admission at the college.

This year almost 17 lakh students had appeared for the SSC exams, of which 88.74 per cent students had passed."

We did the math: Replacing all the old currency will likely take several months,"It’s been over a week since demonetisation, but the queues and the chaos continue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose decision to scrap ₹500 and ₹1,000 rupee notes has been intensely criticised, has asked for patience.

“I have asked the country for just 50 days,” Modi said during a speech in Goa on Sunday. “Brothers and sisters, give me 50 days.”

New notes are being printed, officials say, and those notes are being distributed to banks and ATMs as fast as possible. But will that happen in 50 days? The answer is, probably not.

Printing new notes could take about six months

Here’s the math. The new rupee notes are being printed at four mints. Together, they can print about three billion notes per month.

The mints have to replace about ₹14 trillion taken out of circulation — roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Portugal. If half that value is printed in ₹500 rupee notes and the other half is printed in ₹2,000 rupee notes, the mints will have to print around 17.5 billion total notes to replace the value of the notes taken out of circulation."
"Virat Kohli praises Pakistan, says can beat anyone after ICC Champions Trophy win","Praising Pakistan for their brilliant all-round performance in the Champions Trophy final here on Sunday, Indian skipper Virat Kohli said the green brigade can upset any team on their day. (INDIA vs PAKISTAN highlights)

Kohli said Pakistani players were more intense and passionate in the final which also helped them outplay the India team in every department of the game. (IND v PAK scorecard)

Pakistan dominated with both bat and ball to thrash a rather off-colour India by 180 runs and lift the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy on Sunday.

This was the first Champions Trophy title for Pakistan. The south Asian nation claimed their third ICC tournament, having earlier won the 50-over World Cup in 1992 and the World Twenty20 in 2009.

Put in to bat, Pakistan rode on a century by opener Fakhar Zaman to post a massive total of 338/4 in the allotted 50 overs.

In reply, India were all out for 158 runs in 30.3 overs.

“It was disappointing. Congos to Pakistan. The way they turned things around, it was amazing. They can upset anyone on their day,” Kohli said after the match. “I have a smile on my face because I am very proud of the boys. Credit to Pakistan. They outplayed us. They were more intense and more passionate. With the ball, we could have had more wicket-taking opportunities. Sometimes, the opposition does play very well. Even with the ball, they were very aggressive,” he added.

Kohli also praised young all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who was the highest scorer among the Indians with 76 runs off 43 balls.

Pandya scripted the fastest half-century in a world One-Day International (ODI) final, reaching the landmark in 32 deliveries with three consecutive sixes off leg-spinner Shadab Khan.

The 28-year-old skipper partially blamed pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s no-ball which gave opener and century-maker Fakhar Zaman -- who was on three at that time -- a life which helped Pakistan post a massive total.

“Hardik played well. Small margins can be massive in cricket. We need to move on and learn from our mistakes,” Kohli said."

Current account deficit narrows in 2016-17: RBI,"India’s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed during last fiscal due to a contraction in the country’s trade deficit.

According to data furnished by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the CAD for last fiscal narrowed to 0.7 per cent of the GDP from 1.1 per cent in 2015-16 on the back of the contraction in trade deficit.

The current account is the net difference between inflows and outflows of foreign currencies.

India’s trade deficit during the fiscal under review narrowed to $112.4 billion in 2016-17 from $130.1 billion in 2015-16.

“Net invisible receipts were lower, mainly due to moderation in both software exports and net private transfer receipts, and higher outgo on account of primary income (profit, interest and dividends),” the RBI said in a statement.

However, the data showed that net FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) inflows in 2016-17 marginally declined to $35.6 billion from $36 billion reported during 2015-16."
"Time for Indian cricket team to introduce upgrades, take call on MS Dhoni","“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” goes the saying, but one was left wondering whether the corollary could be true after India suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the ICC Champions Trophy final on Sunday.

Virat Kohli’s side was a clear favourite going into the match as India’s strengths and Pakistan’s weaknesses were analaysed threadbare. In the end, an inspired Pakistan proved too much for their neighbours.

Once the emotion of a crushing defeat in the final, that too at the hands of Pakistan, subsides, it would become clear that the time has come for India, despite not much being broken, to seek upgrades.

Top-order plans

Ahead of the semifinal against Bangladesh, something seemed to snap in Virat Kohli when a journalist asked him to assess India’s consistency in ICC tournaments. After all, the 2011 World Cup winners claimed the Champions Trophy two years later and then reached the 2015 World Cup semifinals, losing to the team that was, by far, the best in the competition.

The new breed

Finishing as a finalist in the latest ICC tournament shows India’s strengths in limited-overs cricket. In between, they also reached the World T20 semifinal in 2016, losing to the West Indies, the eventual winners.

🎥 Relive all the Indian wickets as Pakistan secure the #CT17! 🏆🇵🇰 pic.twitter.com/WSaA0mvoRm — ICC (@ICC) June 19, 2017

“I’m very happy you have said semifinal is consistency because hamare yahan agar India jeetega tho kharab tournament ho gaya (in our place if India win then it is considered a bad tournament)!” One is not sure about the touch of cynicism but it could be aimed at heavy criticism by the media and fans if the team slips up.

Kohli went to explain why he was happy with the breed of new players, and the importance of winning itself.

“In our country, the happiness of winning a game is something so special,” he said.

But with the next World Cup only two years away, India may have to give their plans a shakeup. The concerns of what will happen if the top three batsmen fall in a heap, and early, came true. Pakistan could have perhaps won only in one way, getting Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli early and cheaply. They did that, and against an inspired bowling attack, India’s innings folded with almost 20 overs left.

That means the template of a steady rather than spectacular start may have to be changed to make batting more robust going forward.

In England (2013 and 2017 Champions Trophy) and Australia (2015 World Cup), the pitches were rolled out nicely, but in this tournament, teams were also lucky not to feel the full force of the Australian bowling as rain played havoc.

Bulging middle

The other big question for India ahead of the 2019 World Cup, to be played in England, is the need to get a middle-order in place that can allow the top three to play without too much concern.

MS Dhoni, no longer an impact batsman in the end overs, will be almost 39 when the World Cup arrives. Although he is up there in terms of fitness and reflexes at the moment, the selectors can’t afford not to nurture young talent and ensure he gets enough games to be ready for the big tournament.

Yuvraj Singh too is in the mid 30s. India will need batsmen who can rally the team after early setbacks like Sunday, as well as contribute on the field. The time for rebuilding is thus upon the team.

Fresh hands in the middle-order become so vital as only Hardik Pandya among the three all-rounders – Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja the others – has been delivering with bat and ball consistently."
"JEE Advanced 2017: JEE (Mains) topper fails to repeat performance, bags AIR 109","Udaipur’s Kalpit Veerwal, who topped the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main 2017 in April, grabbed the All India Rank of 109 in the JEE Advanced 2017, results of which were declared on Sunday.

Veerwal, however, led the list of toppers in the scheduled caste (SC) category of JEE Advanced 2017 by scoring 303 marks out of 366 in JEE (Advanced).

A student of Kota-based Resonance Eduventures Private Limited’s branch in Udaipur, Veerwal hogged the headlines after emerging as the topper of JEE Mains. He scored 360 out of 360.

Veerwal said he was satisfied with his rank in JEE Advanced 2017.

“Scoring AIR Rank 109 in JEE Advanced 2017 among 2.20 lakh aspirants is no less an achievement and I am satisfied with my AIR Rank in JEE Advanced,” Veerwal said.

“It is very satisfying that I am the topper in the SC category of JEE Advanced 2017,” he added.

When asked about his plans, Veerwal said he has not decided about the Indian Institute of Technology he would like to join as yet. “First I will do a BTech from IIT and then would decide about future,” the 17-year-old added.

A son of a compounder, Veerwal scored 95.2% marks in the Central Board of Secondary Education’s Class 12 board exams.

When asked whether he had a different approach for JEE Advanced, Veerwal said he solved test papers, attended dedicated coaching classes, revised study material and studied around 10 to 12 hours a day.

Nearly 2 lakh candidates appeared in the JEE (Advanced) - the second of the two-phase exam held in May for over 11,000 seats available in the 23 IITs across the country. The performance of a candidate in JEE (Advanced) forms the basis for admission to the IITs and the Indian School of Mines (ISM) in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad.

Haryana’s Sarvesh Mehtani secured the AIR 1 in JEE (Advanced) 2017, the results of which were declared on Sunday."

5 literary heavyweights to watch out for in 2017,"From a wicked parody about marriage to hidden truths about Osama bin Laden, here are some of the most awaited books from famous authors that will adorn bookshelves towards the latter half of the year...

The Rub of Time by Martin Amis

One of the most talented writers in the world, Martin Amis returns with a collection of essays from 1986-2016. It includes ruminations on writers like Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, a tribute to best friend Christopher Hitchens, an insider’s look at the porn industry, essays on Princess Diana and John Travolta, and plenty of political criticism including a skewering of Donald Trump.

The Sparsholt Affair by Alan Hollinghurst

He made history when The Line of Beauty was the first gay novel to win the Man Booker Prize. Now Alan Hollinghurst returns with another long-ranging tale about a sexual-political scandal in 1960s England and the lives that were affected by it.

Here’s your reading list for the next few months

The Nothing by Hanif Kureishi

His prose can slice like a paper cut with their honesty and sharpness. Hanif Kureishi’s wicked new novella is about lust and deceit, where an ailing famed filmmaker Waldo suspects his wife of having an affair with his old chum and plans an elaborate revenge to expose them.

Salman Rushdie returns to his home city in his new novel. It’s said to be a thriller about a mysteriously wealthy family from Mumbai who desperately want to forget their tragic past surrounding 26/11 and move to New York in the hopes of reinventing themselves. Not surprisingly, the rise of a ‘media-savvy villain’ with strangely coloured hair (Donald Trump) also makes an appearance.

Have no option but to attack India’s top order: Mickey Arthur,"about the video

Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur believes his team has got no other option but to attack Indian batsmen in order to give themselves the best possible chance to win the much-anticipated, high octane ICC Champions Trophy final at The Oval on Sunday.

ICC Champions Trophy: Mohammad Hafeez hails Pakistan spirit after win over India,"Mohammad Hafeez hailed Pakistan’s team spirit as the key to their stunning ICC Champions Trophy final triumph against India. (HIGHLIGHTS)

Just two weeks ago, Pakistan were at a low ebb after crashing to a humiliating 124-run defeat against India in the group stage. (SCORECARD)

But Pakistan batsman Hafeez says his team-mates vowed to stick together despite the avalanche of criticism and they reaped the rewards in memorable fashion on Sunday.

Gaining sweet revenge over India, Pakistan thrashed their arch rivals by 180 runs at The Oval to win the Champions Trophy for the first time.

“It’s a great team effort. After losing the first game, we had no chance to lose again,” said Hafeez, who played an important role in the win with a classy 57 not out.

“We showed great character. I’m so happy for the nation of Pakistan who have been waiting for this for a long time.”

Fakhar Zaman’s maiden one-day international hundred laid the foundations for Pakistan’s formidable total of 338-4.

After man of the match Fakhar finished on 114, Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Amir ripped the heart out of the India batting line-up with the wickets of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli.

India, looking to retain the Champions Trophy, went down without a fight as they collapsed to 158 all out and Amir felt his spell was crucial.

“Rohit, Dhawan and Kohli have been in tremendous form so I was looking for early wickets -- and I did it,” he said.

Pakistan’s first global 50-over title since the 1992 World Cup reflected well on their Australian coach Mickey Arthur, who kept his squad from losing focus after their dismal display against the Indians earlier in the tournament.

Arthur admitted Pakistan were desperate to prove they could go toe to toe with tournament favourites India with the title up for grabs.

“It’s been an up and down ride for us but I’m so proud of the boys,” Arthur said.

“The whole group kept believing, we knew we were better than what we showed in the first game against India.

“That was an aberration. We want to be more consistent as a team. We will work really hard to keep this momentum going.”"
Delhi Police cadets from the Northeast fight stereotypes,"Till last year, there were only 37 men and women from the Northeast in Delhi's 80,000-strong police force. After incidents of hate crimes against people hailing from the Northeast triggered strong protests, the government inducted over 400 constables, including 134 women from the eight sister states. For a city that was notoriously unfriendly towards its northeastern population, especially women, this was an important step.

Nearing the completion of their training, the young women constables are set to join the force. But before they can don their badges, there is grueling training, packed with physical activities, commando training and classroom lectures, with hardly any moments to spare in between.

As part of their intensive preparation, the women cadets have fired AK-47's and INSAS rifles, Glock and 9MM pistols and MP 5 sub machine guns."
"India v Pakistan, Champions Trophy final: ‘Sarfraz’s chance to create a legacy’","Cricket fans, we have a dream final! Pakistan vs India, and yes it just doesn’t get any bigger than this.

I am not sure how many people tipped the two arch-rivals to clash in the final, especially after the one-sided defeat Pakistan had to endure in its opening match in Birmingham. But the unpredictability and never-say-die spirit of Pakistan cricket is here for all of us to celebrate again as we all await with bated breaths for what promises to be an epic clash at The Oval in London.

(Read | ‘It’s India’s batting vs Pakistan’s bowling in ICC Champions Trophy final’)

Before I dwell on Pakistan’s strategy for the big match, I want to say that the final has given Sarfraz a God given opportunity of leaving a lasting legacy. The feisty wicket-keeper batsman is still learning the art of captaincy, yet has grown in stature as leader in every game this tournament. My advice to Sarfraz for the final is simple - take all decisions wholeheartedly and without any fear whatsoever.

(Read | India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: ‘PAK has nothing to lose’)

In big games, you need captains to have a clear mind since they are the ones who have to steer the ship. Sarfraz needs to back his own abilities to the hilt since a confused or timid approach can hurt the team and dampen the chances of success.

As I have said earlier, Pakistan’s seniors Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez need to come to the party for the big game, both these players have contributed in many wins and Sunday is the time for them to deliver once again on the biggest stage of all.

(Read | India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: 5 most memorable clashes)

Hafeez’s cameo against England will hold him in good stead for the final. Malik has had a quiet tournament by his standards but I expect him to come good on the big occasion. We all need to back the seniors which will help them focus and help the youngsters in the team who might have some nerves or stage fright on Sunday.

I am heartened by Pakistan’s opening partnership of Fakhar Zaman and Azhar Ali. The two have done a fantastic job for the team at the start of the innings and one more partnership of substance can give the side the required momentum for a possible victory.

(Read | Golden opportunity for Pakistan to avenge loss to India: Imran Khan)

Azhar has been a revelation for me. Leading up to the tournament, his presence in the eleven was questioned by many, yet he has once again displayed that he is a strong character who makes a genuine effort to adapt to different situations in a match.

If Fakhar gets out early, Azhar should take the charge and focus on minimizing the dot balls, Pakistani batsmen need to remember that strike-rotation is as important as hitting boundaries in an ODI.

(Read | ICC Champions Trophy: TV ad rates rocket ahead of India vs Pakistan final)

Meanwhile, the biggest challenge for Pakistan I believe is combatting the Indian batting line-up. Virat Kohli’s team has already proved its credentials as the best batting unit in the tournament. Its top-order is in great nick and it has a powerful trio of MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Hardik Pandya in the middle-order.

The Indian batsmen look unfazed even in a pressure situation, Kohli’s scarcely believable record while chasing is known to all and I believe that Pakistan would have to target taking wickets with the new ball since strikes at the top of the innings are likely to be crucial for the game’s outcome.

(Read | India vs Pakistan: Mohammad Amir fit, Jasprit Bumrah says anything can happen)

In the matches leading up to the final, middle overs have been the game changers for Pakistan. I feel that the same strategy can be deployed for the final, which means that Sarfraz would have to try and keep the runs dry till that stage of the game, especially if there are no strikes with the two new balls.

Pakistan has defied all expectations, so in a way, that should ease the burden on the players. The management needs to convey to the team that they should enjoy the occasion and free their minds from negative thoughts or emotions.

(Read | ICC Champions Trophy: It’s Team Virat Kohli for PAK captain Sarfraz Ahmed’s uncle)

I would also want the cricketing world and the ICC to keep a close eye on the significance of an Indo-Pak cricket match of this magnitude and what it means to the fans of the game all around.

I really hope that we see resumption of bilateral cricket between the two countries and would request the Indian cricket board and the Indian government to soften their stance.

Having captained Pakistan in the 2011 World Cup semi-final at Mohali, I know the importance of the game and how it brings the two nations to a standstill while underlining the message of peace and tolerance for each other.

Cricket can be an actual source of bringing the two nations together and reducing the tensions. I, like the rest of the world, can’t wait for the match to start. Let us hope that we see a game of epic proportions that is remembered for a long, long time.

Go well Pakistan!

2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying: Spain beat Macedonia to stay ahead of Italy,"Spain kept their noses in front of Italy in the fight for automatic qualification for next year’s World Cup as David Silva and Diego Costa were on target in a 2-1 win in Macedonia on Sunday.

The two European giants remain locked on 16 points at the top of Group G of UEFA qualifying after Italy saw off Liechtenstein 5-0 in Udine.

And Spain host the Azzurri in their next qualifier at Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu on September 2.

Victory extends Julen Lopetegui’s unbeaten record as Spain boss since replacing Vicente del Bosque just under a year ago, and the visitors looked to be set for an easy night in Skopje after a dominant first 45 minutes.

Silva has been the talisman of Lopetegui’s reign and took his tally to eight goals in his last 10 international caps by finishing off a fine move involving Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba for the opener on 15 minutes.

Isco was rewarded for his brilliant form towards the end of Real’s La Liga and Champions League double-winning campaign with a rare start for his country and looked keen to make an impact.

He stung the palms of Stole Dimitrievski before driving another effort just over the bar.

There was no stopping Isco midway through the half, though, as some sublime skill took him past Kire Ristevski before his low cross was turned home by Costa at the back post.

Isco should have added a third before half-time when he dallied before firing too close to Dimitrievski at his near post.

However, Spain looked like a side in need of a rest after a long season as they took their foot well off the gas after the break to allow Macedonia back into the game.

It took an individual moment of brilliance from Stefan Ristovski to give the hosts hope, though, as the right-back charged forward below blasting high into David de Gea’s top left-hand corner.

Dimitrievski was forced into one final fine save four minutes from time to prevent Costa adding a gloss to the scoreline, but Lopetegui’s men comfortably saw out the final stages for a hard-earned three points."

If de Villiers forced to rule out of the match, Faf du Plessis is most likely to step in as stand-in captain while Farhaan Behardien is likely to be called-up into the Playing XI.

With all the four teams of Group B tied on two points each, Sunday’s encounter between India and South Africa is effectively a quarter-final, with the winner of the match making it to the semi-finals while the loser will be heading home."
"India vs Pakistan, Champions Trophy final: Why Virat Kohli didn’t play hockey","The Indian cricket and hockey teams may be just 20 minutes away from each other in London, but they have remained in their own worlds ahead of their respective India versus Pakistan matches on Sunday.

Perhaps for the first time in the history of sports, India and Pakistan will clash in two world events and in the same city.

While Virat Kohli’s India play Pakistan in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy at The Oval, Manpreet Singh will lead the hockey team in a crucial match of the FIH World Hockey League semifinals.

Ignoring the hype

Both India’s cricket and hockey teams have played down the hype around such blockbuster engagements.

While Virat Kohli wished the hockey team luck, former striker Jugraj Singh, a member of Hockey India’s coaching staff, said: “We are aware of India’s cricket final but we want to focus on our match.”

Jugraj said the media hype around an India versus Pakistan event is “for the public”.

“As players, we prefer to treat this like a normal match and not get over-excited by the occasion,” said Jugraj.

Fear of injury

At The Oval on Saturday, Kohli spoke on exactly similar lines but in the process revealed why he never dared to play hockey.

“I’ve played with synthetic hockey balls indoors, but never tried hockey. It’s very scary I feel, getting hit on the face with a penalty corner. I don’t know how those guys do that,” said Kohli.

“You need a lot of guts to do that. I wish our team the best. I’ve never tried my hand in it, but they’re pretty good, so I’m sure they’ll be fine,” he added.

Interestingly, lot of hockey players have gone on to become famous cricketers.

In recent memory, South African skipper AB De Villiers played hockey at high school for a year and former Zimbabwean captain Dave Houghton was a national team goalkeeper and even won praise from former World Cup champions, Pakistan.

Houghton is Zimbabwe’s highest Test scorer – 226 versus Sri Lanka in 1994-95. He is currently the batting coach of Middlesex."
"India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy 2017 final – A stat breakdown","Finally, cricket will witness a dream match for millions in the sub-continent, India vs Pakistan in the final of a major ICC event. This is the first time India and Pakistan will clash in the final of a major ICC ODI event and it promises to be a tense encounter with plenty at stake.

Since the beginning of ODIs in 1971, India and Pakistan have played in the finals of multi-nation tournaments 10 times, with Pakistan holding the edge. However, India hold a massive advantage over Pakistan in ICC events. Ahead of their crucial match at the Oval, here are some key numbers for both sides.

10 - This will be the first time since 2007 that India and Pakistan clash in the final of a major ICC event. In 2007, both clashed in the final of the World T20 in Johannesburg. India had won the match by five runs.

9 - Number of years since India and Pakistan clashed in the final of a multi-national event. Their last encounter was in Dhaka during the Kitply Cup of 2008 and Pakistan registered a 25-run win.

8 - Number of wins for India in ICC matches against Pakistan. The teams have played each other 10 times in ICC ODI events, with India winning all six matches in the ICC 50-over World Cup while registering two wins in the ICC Champions Trophy. Pakistan’s two wins have come in this tournament, in 2004 and 2009.

7 - Number of wins for Pakistan in finals against India. Remarkably, both teams have played each other 10 times at this stage with Pakistan having a huge advantage. India’s last win against Pakistan in the final came in 1998, during the Silver Jubilee Independence Cup held in Bangladesh.

5 - Number of centuries by Pakistan batsmen in finals against India. Salman Butt holds the record for the highest individual score with 129 in Dhaka in 2008. Surprisingly, only one Indian batsman has scored a century against Pakistan in the final. Sourav Ganguly (124) is the only Indian batsman to achieve this feat.

2 - Number of five-wicket hauls by bowlers in finals between India vs Pakistan. Both have come from Pakistan. Aaqib Javed’s 7/37 in the final in Sharjah in 1991 and Azhar Mahmood’s 5/38 in Bangalore in 1999 are the only instances. India’s best bowling performance is 3/29 by Rajesh Chauhan in Sharjah in 1994.

32 - First time since 1984/85 that India are clashing with Pakistan in the final of a multi-national tournament. Their first encounter came in the Benson and Hedges Tournament in Melbourne and India emerged victorious by eight wickets.

14 - Number of fifties by Indian batsmen in finals against Pakistan. In contrast, Pakistan batsmen only have five fifties."

Budget 2017: Here’s how homebuyers will benefit from government’s thrust on affordability,"As announced in the Budget, infrastructure status for affordable housing will be a good thing for the middle class as it will make homes cheaper and spacious. This will be made possible by laws which will make it mandatory for financial institutions to lend to developers of affordable projects – and that too at low rates. Developers will in all likelihood pass on the benefits to homebuyers. Measurements of the housing units have been specified, so expect bigger and better ‘budget’ accommodation

Developers so far reluctant to touch the affordable housing segment despite high demand are likely to be attracted by the easy access to capital at lower (because of affordability) rates and tax incentives. Even big brands will now be encouraged to get into this segment.

The months after June are likely to see a momentum in a market severely impacted by demonetisation. More affordable launches might happen, giving people more investment choices, especially in the Delhi NCR areas. Depending on the location and cost of land, housing units in these projects are roughly estimated to cost anything between Rs 15 lakh to Rs 25 lakh.

Developers can take infrastructure funding from financial institutions at a rate lower than 10% for constructing affordable housing. With borrowing costs going down, the benefit will definitely be passed on to the homebuyers, says Pradeep Aggarwal, co-founder and chairman – Signature Global, a company that already launched 7,000 units in Gurgaon and Sohna under the Haryana affordable housing scheme.

The infrastructure status proposal is likely to impact all projects under construction. Builders are expected to quickly move to comply with the affordability requirements – limiting the size of housing units to 60 sq m (carpet area), developing projects within 25 km of the municipal limits of four metro cities.

“All these projects will now qualify as infrastructure and get easy access to financing. While existing buyers will now be assured of timely completion, new buyers and new launches may receive some relaxation in terms of pricing. Some buyers will also now qualify for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana subsidy,” says Manoj Gaur, managing director, Gaursons India.

Currently most states have their own affordable housing policies. In Haryana, external development charges (EDC) and internal development charges (IDC) are exempt while in Uttar Pradesh EDC/IDC charges, land use charges, service tax and stamp duty charges are waived off. As for housing unit size, don’t expect pigeonholes as the government has clearly specified that instead of built-up area (which includes public space for lifts and corridors in a building) the carpet (wall to wall) area of 30 and 60 sq m would be considered.

The 30 sq m measurement is applicable for affordable housing projects located in the four metro cities while a limit of 60 sq m will apply for projects located within a distance of 25 km from the municipal limits of these four main cities. The demand for affordable homes is likely to increase given the extra cash people will have in hand due to proposed deduction of the income tax rate to 5% for taxpayers earning less than Rs 5 lakh.

Added to this will be the interest subvention of 4% and 3% on loans of up to Rs 9 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, respectively, as announced by the prime minister in his New Year eve’s speech for some people. “The real estate market is likely to see maximum launches in the affordable housing segment. There will also be a structural shift in pricing and not a price cut. The benefits that builders will get under the scheme include a profit tax holiday which means that they will not have to pay tax on the profits earned from these projects. More builders will thus enter this segment. This will ensure that buyers will get more housing options,” says Samantak Das, chief economist and national director - Research, Knight Frank (India) Pvt Ltd.

Developers will also get five years to complete the project instead of three years at present out of which maximum time goes into getting approvals. Getting priority sector lending will get builders more funds at reasonable rates and these benefits they may pass on to the customers,” he says.

To cite an example, if a 60 sq m apartment in Greater Noida today is currently priced at Rs 3,500 per sq ft (around Rs 27 lakh), the same unit under the scheme will now be 30% more spacious (around 800 sq ft with carpet area being taken into account) and cost much less because of the tax holiday benefits being offered to developers.

The government has also extended the time of completion of such projects from three years to five years. Builders who do not complete projects on time will not get the incentives."
ICC Champions Trophy: Decision on Anil Kumble keeps Indian team on tenterhooks,"There is a strong indication that Anil Kumble’s job as the Indian cricket team’s head coach is on the line.

Although the Cricket Advisory Committee, comprising Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman, is keen that the former leg-spinner continues at least till the end of the limited overs series in the West Indies, Kumble may not like to.

READ | Will Anil Kumble resign as Indian cricket team coach? Signs are strong

As per Kumble’s one-year contract with the BCCI, his term expires at the end of the ICC Champions Trophy but the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, led by Vinod Rai, wants Kumble to continue only if he is keen.

While reports of rift with captain Virat Kohli may not be totally true, Kumble’s presence in the dressing room is not welcomed by senior players, revealed a top BCCI source. “Yes, players do not want him and there will be a change in coach for sure,” the official said. The question is when?

“The CAC is really worried about this issue and given the fact that the Caribbean series is upon us, this is not the right time to change the coach. But it will eventually happen,” said the Board official.

READ | ‘Advantage India in ICC Champions Trophy final vs Pakistan’

TIGHTLIPPED

The Indian team will travel to the Caribbean on June 20 for the limited-overs series. A decision on who will travel as coach with the team will be taken in the next 48 hours.

No one wanted to confirm. Everyone HT spoke to was tightlipped and that raises suspicion that something is amiss.

If India beat Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday, it will be a good occasion for Kumble to end his association with the Indian team.

KOHLI LOVES BANGAR

Kohli once again spoke highly of batting coach Sanjay Bangar after India battered Bangladesh by nine wickets in the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal at Edgbaston on Thursday.

READ | India vs Pakistan: Mohammad Amir fit, Jasprit Bumrah says anything can happen

Not only Bangar, Kohli mentioned Raghu, one man who throws balls to players trying to perfect their strokes for hours during nets.

“Bangar’s inputs have been priceless. If I have become a better batsman, it’s because of Bangar and Raghu,” said Kohli.

The separation with Kumble would have been smoother if Kohli was not involved in this mess, said the BCCI official.

READ | ICC Champions Trophy: Virat Kohli and his art of living cricket to the fullest

Should Kohli be given the superpowers to even select a coach? That’s not an ideal scenario for the CAC. That will be setting a bad precedent too. Given the fact that Ganguly believes in complete powers for the team captain, Kohli may just win the battle.

One thing is for sure, Virender Sehwag is a rank outsider even though the CAC, which has the complete faith of the BCCI, is keen on an Indian head coach."
Cannes 2017: Naomi Kawase’s Radiance is radiantly refreshing,"The Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, is a Cannes Film Festival veteran, and has had several of her movies play here. She has also been on Cinefondation and Short Film Jury in 2016. Her 2015 Sweet Bean (An in Japanese) - which was part of the festival’s A Certain Regard -- was a extraordinarily touching story of an old woman who helps a dorayaki shop to become popular with her yummy bean paste.

Equally moving is Kawase’s latest, Radiance (Hikari in Japanese), where the auteur takes us into the world of the blind and partially-sighted -- tracing the relationship between a photographer whose vision is fading and a woman who pens movie audio descriptions.

Kawase uses disability most artfully to weave a love story between Misako (Misaki Ayame) - who is writing a description for the visually challenged -- and Nakamori (Nagase Masatoshi), a celebrated photographer. He is one of Misako’s listeners. On the verge of blindness, he is caustic and angry. Misako has her own tragedies to grapple with: a father who mysteriously disappeared several years ago and a mother sinking into dementia. Perhaps these misfortunes push her to understand Nakamori’s frustration.

Radiance is a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr.

Radiance -- Kawase’s fifth work to debut in the festival’s Competition and a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr -- draws us softly into Nakamori’s and Misako’s world that sees disillusionment, rage and arguments till a chance meeting pulls them towards each other. An emotionally charged scene in which he feels her face is far more erotic than a kiss they share later.

Brilliantly photographed in soft light, Radiance is a work that haunts us with its delicate treatment and subtle messages. Something that is a typical Kawase, whose Radiance loyally follows in the path of her many films in the past, particular Sweet Bean.

Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”,"Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”

The government’s rankings of the cleanest cities in the country, released last week as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, had some surprising outcomes. “Is Varanasi really cleaner than Bhubaneswar?” my editor asked in an article earlier this week. Others have asked some version of the same question: How were these rankings produced? And is the methodology sound? The rankings consider three broad categories of data: documentation provided by civic authorities, feedback from citizens, and independent ground assessments. Intuitively, one might think that the ground assessments — which involve unbiased people observing how clean the city actually is — would be the most important source of data. But the way the Ministry of Urban Development calculated the rankings, ground assessments are the least important. Instead, 45% of the ranking comes from documentation provided by the cities, 30% comes from citizen feedback, and the remaining 25% is derived from the ground assessments. What if these categories were weighted differently? We’ve built a tool that lets you find out. Adjust the weights of the three categories below, and see how the rankings change.

Use the white handles to adjust the weights. Documentation Ground assessment Citizen feedback

Or, use these buttons.

Reset Documentation only Ground assessment only Citizen feedback only All three are equal

View chart City Your rank Gov't rank Change in rank Each dot represents a city or civic authority. Hover over a dot for details. Scores get higher with your weights or lower with your weights.

So what if we scrap the documentation and citizen feedback, instead relying entirely on the ground assessment? Bhopal rises to the top of the list, while Indore falls to 11th. Varanasi actually improves, rising from 32nd to 28th, while Bhubaneswar improves from 94th to 70th, still far behind. If we only consider citizen feedback, Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, rises from 136th to the top of the charts. Apparently, Neemuch’s citizens think their city is very clean, even if the government and independent assessors disagree. And if only documentation matters, Chandigarh becomes the country’s cleanest city, rising from its former rank of 11th. Why did the government choose to weight documentation so heavily? “In initial years, you have to push municipalities to do work,” said Quality Council of India’s Anay Agarwal, who directed the survey project. “Even if results are not visible on the ground, they have to be awarded — in terms of higher ranking — for starting the work.“ In other words, by weighting the rankings as it does, the government wants to encourage cities to demonstrate an institutional commitment to staying clean. By this thinking, cities that provide documentation of their clean-up efforts demonstrate a commitment to the process, even if the results have yet to show up on the ground.

UP board result 2017: Yogi Adityanath to give away cash rewards to 10 toppers,"Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath will give away cash rewards to the 10 high school or Class 10 and intermediate or Class 12 students, who figured in the merit list of the UP Board examinations, the results of which were declaredon Friday.

The CM expressed happiness over the performance of girls who scored better than boys once again. In the high school exam, 86.50% girls passed as against 76.75% boys. Similarly, the pass percentage of girls was 88.80 as compared to 77.16 of boys in the intermediate exam.

“Girls outsmarting boys in this examination indicates Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has brought positive changes in the society,” Adityanath said.

Adityanath congratulated the successful candidates of UP Board high school and intermediate examinations and said directives was issued to the state’s secondary education department to take necessary steps so that he could felicitate the toppers with cash.

However, the amount of the prize has not been finalised yet.

The percentage of students who cleared the UP Board Class 10 and Class 12 exams witnessed a decline as compared to last year and experts attributed it to the strict measures deployed by authorities to check unfair means.

This year, 81.18% students cleared the Class 10 or high school exams and 82.62% examinees were declared successful in Class 12 or intermediate.

In 2016, the overall pass percentage in high school exams was registered at 87.66 which was 3.92 points more than the previous year. In intermediate, 87.99% students passed in 2016 or 0.84% less than in 2015."

Iran celebrates as national football team earns 2018 World Cup spot,"Iran celebrated on Monday as the country’s national soccer team qualified for next year’s World Cup finals by beating Uzbekistan 2-0 with goals from Sardar Azmoun and Mehdi Taremi.

Azmoun’s goal midway through the first half at the Azadi Stadium put them on track to qualify for a place in Russia before Taremi added a second two minutes from time as Iran reached back-to-back World Cup tournaments for the first time.

The three-time Asian champions, who also missed a penalty just after the break, became the second nation after five-times champions Brazil to qualify for the finals by securing a fifth World Cup appearance at the 32-team tournament.

Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani congratulated the nation and the players on clinching a place at the finals. “Your victory made all of us happy... Guys well done for the qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia,” he tweeted.

Thousands of Iranians spilled onto the streets after the match with impromptu street parties in Tehran and across the country as people danced, waved flags and honked car horns.

“People are shouting ‘Iran, Iran’... It is like a carnival … We are so happy and proud of our team,” said Iran fan Reza Ghanbari in northern Tehran’s Tajrish Square.

The win means Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz’s Iran team will finish in the top two places in Group A of Asia’s final round of qualifying. Uzbekistan are eight points adrift of the leaders in third place and have only two games remaining.

The top two teams in each of Asia’s two qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals while the teams in third place go through a series of playoffs.

Azmoun opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when Alireza Jahanbaksh’s through ball found the FC Rostov striker with time and space behind the Uzbek defence to roll the ball under goalkeeper Aleksandr Lobanov and into the net.

But Taremi calmed Iran’s nerves when he added the second goal late on by curling a low shot into the corner of Lobanov’s goal to spark the celebrations amongst the home supporters."

Most of the TV spots for the final, to be played in London, were pre-booked with firms such as Nissan Motor, Intel Corp, Emirates, Chinese mobile maker Oppo and Indian tyre maker MRF signed up as commercial partners for the tournament.

Fewer than 10 percent of the slots are left for the final, a person in the sports broadcasting industry said.

India captain Virat Kohli is the only cricketer among the world’s 100 highest-paid sportsmen, ranking 89th with annual income of $22 million, according to a list compiled by Forbes.

Before the Champions Trophy, the last time India and Pakistan played a one-day international was during the 2015 World Cup. That game, won by India, was one of the top-six most viewed sporting events, along with the soccer World Cup final and Usain Bolt’s 100-metre sprint at the 2012 Olympic Games, the sports broadcasting industry source said.

“That was a league game, this is the final,” the person said. “You can expect this to be even bigger.”

India and Pakistan have already met during the tournament’s group stage, with India winning easily. More than 200 million people watched that game, according to Indian media, citing BARC India. For Sunday’s final, viewership is expected to be 30-40 percent higher.

TROUBLED HISTORY

Cricket between the neighbours and rivals has been limited because of their longstanding political problems.

They last played a bilateral series in 2012-13, when Pakistan toured India for two Twenty20 games and three one-day internationals.

It was their first series since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when Pakistani militants went on a killing spree that left 166 people dead in India’s financial capital. India has since refused to play Pakistan outside International Cricket Council events.

“There is still some time left for the monsoon to arrive and we shall be able to complete the remaining desilting and rainwater harvesting work within the coming three weeks,” said MCG commissioner V Umashankar.

“By July, we will be better prepared and equipped to tackle waterlogging issues,” he said.

Umashankar added that the drainage work in sectors 28 and 29 has been hampered due to a land dispute. He said the MCG and the Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda) officials are coming to a settlement with the land owners of a 60-metre tract. The dispute over it has been preventing work on connecting drains in the area."
Pakistan consign India to horror defeat in Champions Trophy final,"A fearsome burst of pace bowling from Mohammad Amir consigned India to a horror 180-run defeat at The Oval on Sunday as Pakistan won their maiden ICC Champions Trophy title with plenty to spare. (HIGHLIGHTS | SCORECARD)

Chasing Pakistan’s 338 for four, India went down without a fight as the defending champions lost three in-form batsmen in the first nine overs. Hasan ‘bomber’ Ali took three wickets for 19 to polish off the Indian tail. Pakistan won with 117 balls to spare.

Hardik Pandya’s 43-ball 76 was the lone bright spot in India’s batting, but his run out gave Pakistan an easy passage to victory.

On Saturday morning, the Indians were practising ‘banana’ freekicks. On Sunday, Mohammad Amir literally bent the ball like Beckham to catch Rohit Sharma plumb in front of the wicket and then got the better of an indiscreet Virat Kohli.

Kohli had been preaching the message of composure throughout the Champions Trophy but on a big day, the captain lost control even after enjoying a life the previous ball.

When Azhar Ali spilled a regulation catch after Kohli edged Amir to first slip, Pakistan’s heart sank. Did Pakistan drop their first ICC Champions Trophy?

Kohli did not learn from his mistake. To Amir’s credit, he bowled the next ball cross-seam and pitched just back of length. Kohli’s mistimed flick went to backward point.

If Kohli’s wicket gave Pakistan resolve, Amir found the edge of Shikhar Dhawan’s tentative bat to add extra belief. The wicket also exposed India’s untested middle order.

India lost Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni in the space of four balls. Yuvraj looked good for his 31-ball 22 but leg-spinner Shahdab Khan won an LBW decision via the TV umpire. Dhoni too lost composure, pulling Hasan Ali to deep square leg.

Imad Wasim’s diving catch at deep square leg reflected Pakistan’s eagerness to play good cricket. They never lost control even after Pandya launched into their spinners. After Junaid Khan got rid of Ravindra Jadeja, it was just a matter of time.

Earlier, Fakhar Zaman’s maiden ODI hundred (114) and his 128-run opening wicket stand with Azhar Ali helped Pakistan pile on a formidable 338 for four wickets.

A classy fifty by Azhar Ali (59), Babar Azam’s 46 and Mohammad Hafeez’s cavalier 57 not out off 37 balls added muscle to the Pakistan innings.

Fakhar Zaman stood out with his cavalier knock after enjoying a huge slice of luck when on 3. He had edged an expansive drive to the keeper, but Jasprit Bumrah had bowled a no ball. That came to hurt India in a game where the margin of error was virtually nil.

THE ‘LIFE’ THAT HURT

That ‘life’ emboldened the 27-year-old left-hander to launch into the Indian attack that was far less impressive with its line and length on an all-important day. Fakhar made India pay through their nose.

India chose to field after Virat Kohli called correctly. It looked the right decision considering the fact that the pitch was a new one with a tinge of green and India’s quick bowlers – Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar – had delivered in the previous matches against South Africa and Bangladesh.

India conceded 56 runs in the first 10 overs. This was the first time in this ICC Champions Trophy that India’s bowlers gave away so many runs in the first powerplay. India conceded 91 runs (five fours and four sixes) in the last 10 overs, taking just one wicket.

ERR IN LINE

Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar erred in line and length. Full toss on the pads, width outside off and short balls with no venom were punished easily by the Pakistan batsmen. The pulls and cuts were used liberally.

Pakistan paced their innings well. With wickets in hand, their middle order was in full cry.

Mohammad Hafeez used his experience and footwork to score runs at a rapid clip. Having smashed three fours off the first seven balls he faced, Hafeez raced to his 32nd ODI 50 off 34 balls. He produced an invaluable 71 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket with Imad Wasim, who remained undefeated on 25."
Rafael Nadal to skip Queen’s tournament to be fit for Wimbledon 2017,"Rafael Nadal confirmed he has pulled out of next week’s Aegon Championships at Queen’s in order to rest and prepare for Wimbledon.

The 31-year-old Spaniard has had a hugely successful clay season, claiming a record 10th French Open crown on Sunday to earn a 15th Grand Slam title.

The world number two said on his Facebook page that he was sad to skip the tournament as he loved Queen’s and a good performance in this tournament allowed him to perform well in Wimbledon.

Nadal won clay titles this season in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid in addition to Roland Garros.

He won Queen’s in 2008 before going on to lift his first Wimbledon title, again taking the Grand Slam trophy at the All England Club in 2010. Wimbledon begins on July 3.

Organisers confirmed Nadal’s withdrawal on their Twitter account.

Unfortunately, Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the Aegon Championships at Queen’s.

UK election result 2017: Why a hung parliament is good news from Britain,"There are no visible winners from the British election. Except the British people.

For the voters, the election was about Britain’s future in the European Union, about its embrace of the free market, about pensions and housing, health and affordable education. It was also a measure of how far down right the country would go in the face of repeated terrorist attacks and growing anti-immigrant chatter from the ruling Conservatives.

Insofar as returning a divided mandate Britain has shown it was unwilling – just like France a month ago – to give up on its reputation for optimism, fairness and the spirit of enlightenment for a dark, pessimistic, xenophobic nation with a diminished relationship with the world.

For that alone the British people deserve the global applause Americans could have earned had they been more discerning when it came to electing Donald Trump as president.

In the run up to the election, it was easy for Britain to slip into a society closing in on itself rather than staying open.

It was a society torn over the referendum to leave the European Union. The economy looked uncertain, business confidence was hit, the pound traded 15% lower to the US dollar since the referendum and the wage-inflation gap was narrowing, signalling an income squeeze.

Then came the terrorist attacks, three deadly strikes over as many months that led Prime Minister Theresa May to speak of “far too much tolerance of extremism in our country”.

All this was the perfect grist for the mill for the narrative of fear-mongering, persecution and xenophobia that was used to fuel the rise of the far-right in many other parts of the world.

If it doesn’t descend into a coalition of chaos over complex policy decisions such as Brexit, a multi-party government can ensure against Britain pandering to any erratic and unhelpful global order.

Should May continue as prime minister in such a coalition, her political partners would be loath to support her idea of a special relationship with the United States or undermine any policy of social coherence focused on upholding human rights.

As for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-war campaigner who is May’s rival for the top job, he is known for calls to end “unilateral aggressive wars of intervention” and refusal to “scapegoat” migrants.

In politics, a landslide victory often triggers the tyranny of totalitarianism. That’s why the British election mandate may not be all that bad."
"Champions Trophy 2017: The men who have propelled India, Pakistan so far","Defending champions India and Pakistan cricket team have had contrasting routes to the ICC Champions Trophy final. While the Indian cricket team, who started the tournament as one of the favourites, have been clinical (even in the loss against Sri Lanka), Pakistan have been riding their luck among other things to reach the summit clash. But, both the teams have enjoyed some stellar performances from key players.

We list out five starts from both the teams who have propelled the teams so far.

INDIA

Rohit Sharma: The stylish batsman is enjoying a superb run of form and has been instrumental to India’s success in the Champions Trophy. With 304 runs in his kitty, he will be expected to again provide a perfect start with partner-in-crime Shikhar Dhawan.

Shikhar Dhawan: Since the start of the IPL, Dhawan has been in a belligerent mood with the bat and has maintained his form in the Champions Trophy. While he’s held back his shots and started slowly, when he accelerates, he ensures the match turns on its head. Barring the first game against Pakistan, Dhawan has hit at least a half-century in every match, including a century against Sri Lanka at the Oval.

Virat Kohli: Cometh the hour, cometh the man. There were questions raised about his form as he was going through a rare lean patch before the start of the Champions Trophy but the Indian captain has struck form in style with three half-centuries in the tournament, staying unbeaten in each of those knocks.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar: Alongside Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, he has completed the famed Indian pace quartet that has been in superb form over the past few months. However, it’s the variations coupled with his ability to swing the ball both ways that has helped Bhuvi at the Champions Trophy. Thus, although Bumrah has been India’s most economical bowler, Bhuvi has been the strike bowler with six wickets.

Jasprit Bumrah has been Indian cricket team’s trump card during the death overs and the pacer, with his consistent and accurate yorkers, have always delivered when called into action by skipper Virat Kohli. (Getty Images)

Jasprit Bumrah: Sharing the dressing room with Lasith Malinga during the IPL season, Bumrah’s yorkers have become as effective as the former’s in his heyday. He’s fast, has a good slower-one up his sleeve and can mix his deliveries well in the course of an innings. Thus, while batsmen usually stick to their ultra-defensive game to see off his overs, runs dry up quickly.

PAKISTAN

Hasan Ali: He is the tournament’s highest wicket-taker (10 wickets) and will be crucial if Pakistan are to stop the Sharma-Dhawan-Kohli juggernaut on Sunday. Ali usually clocks over 140 kph but what makes him effective is the way he gets the ball to dart back in, gain movement in the air and bowl variations.

Junaid Khan: It’s often said fast bowlers hunt in pairs. For Pakistan, it’s the Hasan-Junaid pair that the entire country will pin their hopes on. Although Hasan leads the tally, Junaid isn’t far behind, with seven wickets and shares the role with Hasan. The two will be instrumental if Pakistan are to take early wickets and bring pressure on the Indian middle-order.

Azhar Ali: He’s the leading run-getter for Pakistan in the tournament and has already hit two half-centuries (50, 9, 34, 76). He has been consistent, but hasn’t been able to consolidate on those starts by scoring big. With opening partner Fakhar Zaman, they can upset India’s plans on Sunday.

Fakhar Zaman: Fakhar Zaman made his international debut against South Africa in the second group game and impressed before heading back on 31. The loss against India had called for changes in the side and he grabbed the opportunity, hitting half-centuries in the next two matches to help Pakistan come out on top in the crunch games.

Fakhar Zaman is the find of the ICC Champions Trophy for Pakistan cricket team. He made his debut in the tournament and has scored two half centuries, both for a victorious cause, and will be a key player in the final against Indian cricket team. (Getty Images)

Mohammed Hafeez: With just 91 runs in the tournament, he may not have made a big impression so far but is still the third highest run-getter for his side. His scores of 33, 26 and 31* indicate he has lost his wicket after settling down. His part-time spin has fetched him just one wicket so far."
MP: Fugitive ‘king of Dewas’ surrenders over farmer’s murder in 2015,"Vikram Singh Puar, the 27-year-old son of the deceased “king” of the former Dewas royals in Madhya Pradesh, surrendered on Wednesday after being on the run for more than a year for his suspected role in a murder.

He has been accused of leading a fatal clash with 12 armed supporters over a land dispute in Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas.

Puar and his gang allegedly tried to take away the wheat harvest of a farmer, Pratap Lodhi, on March 19, 2015. Lodhi and his family members resisted and, in the ensuing clash with firearms and lathis, the farmer was gravely wounded. He died on March 22.

The young former royal was on the run since then and a special court granted him anticipatory bail for 15 days in June 2016 as his father, former BJP minister Tukojirao Puar, was in his death bed.

His bail application was approved so that he could perform last rites of his father who died of brain haemorrhage on June 19. A day later, Puar was crowned “King of Dewas” at a private ceremony in the family’s palace.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Babulal Gaur and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had attended the senior Puar’s funeral.

The new “king”, however, escaped and remained in hiding until he surrendered before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.

Dewas police arrested Puar at a local hospital where he was admitted earlier in the day. The magistrate sent him to judicial custody till January 7.

Superintendent of police Shashikant Shukla said Puar’s police remand was not sought because “there was nothing to recover from him”.

But several questions remained unanswered: Where was the fugitive hiding? What was he doing? Who was he with? Who all helped him helped him during the period?

A murder charge has been registered at Barotha police station in Dewas after the farmer’s death. But a court acquitted 12 of the 13 accused last December, making the case weak against Puar, legal experts said.

"HC orders CBI inquiry into theft of machine from RRCAT, Indore in 2004","Bhopal/Jabalpur: High court Jabalpur bench ordered a CBI inquiry on Friday into theft of a machine from Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Department of Atomic Energy, government of India at Indore that took place in 2004. The machine was worth Rs 5 lakh.

The HC bench of Sanjay Yadav passed the order on a petition filed by Krishna Kumar Mishra, who was employed with the Centre as a scientific assistant/D. Mishra alleged in the petition he had to resign from his job in July 2004 as a result of victimisation.

The court observed, “In view of the correspondence entered into between the concerned authorities and the affidavit sworn in by Gopalkrishnan Venkatesan, administrative officer-III, RRCAT, gravity and seriousness of the crime which is subject matter of investigation cannot be ruled out and since the local Police is unable to investigate the crime effectively, this court is of the considered opinion that the same deserves to be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation.”

Levelling various irregularities in the institute in his petition the petitioner demanded a CBI inquiry into the matters raised by him especially ‘in case of mysterious theft/ disappearance of petitioner’s lock-in-amplifier, interception of telephones/e-mails/postal letters/ bugging of domestic conversation of the petitioner, suicide of Lt Thirumal, suicide of Lt Attar Singh, suicide of Rajesh Topno and other financial irregularities prevailing in the RRCAT, Indore’.

The court, however, didn’t entertain the petitioner’s prayer to remove the head of the institute and order a CBI inquiry into all the issues raised by him. The court ordered the CBI inquiry in context of the FIR lodged with Rajendra Nagar police station in Indore vide crime no. 36/2005. The FIR was lodged against unknown persons in respect with the theft of lock-in-amplifier that had taken place in the year 2004.

Police had filed a closure report before additional chief judicial magistrate, Indore on April 28, 2005 in connection with the FIR but the court didn’t accept the closure report as the statements of the petitioner and one Shailja had not been recorded."
Who will win the US presidential election?,"Predicting the outcome of the US presidential election is hard. There are dozens of polls, none of which seem to agree with the others. Even betting markets, which are at least as predictive as scientific polls, list different prices.

To get around this problem, election forecasters combine poll results, betting market prices, as well as economic and historical factors to produce predictions about who will win the presidency. But even the forecasters don’t always agree. Often, they assign different odds to the candidates; sometimes, they even predict different winners. So how do you know which forecast to trust?

One approach is to trust none of them individually, but to trust all of them collectively. I’ve selected some of the leading election forecasters — the Upshot, FiveThirtyEight, Daily Kos, and PredictWise — and put their predictions all on one chart that shows you where the race stands and where it is heading.

Which forecasts are we tracking?

Daily Kos — The Daily Kos presidential forecast combines public opinion polls and three other variables which appear to have had an affect on previous presidential election outcomes. Those are (1) the incumbent president’s net approval or disapproval rating in June of the election year, (2) the percent change in America’s gross domestic product from the first to the second quarter of the election year, and (3) whether the incumbent party has held the presidency for two or more terms. Read more about the Daily Kos’s methodology.

FiveThiryEight — FiveThirtyEight (the name comes from the number of electors in the Electoral College) produces three general election forecasts: one based only on the polls, another based on the polls and other factors, and a “now-cast” showing what would happen if the election were held today. I have shown only the polls-based forecast here. FiveThirtyEight rounds its predictions to the nearest one-tenth of a one percent. For the sake of simplicity, I have furthered rounded it to the nearest percent. FiveThirtyEight also includes a prediction for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, whose chances are negligible and who has been removed from this page. Read more about FiveThirtyEight’s methodology.

PredictWise — PredictWise’s general election forecast is based not only on public opinion polls, but also on betting markets, where “investors” can buy and sell “futures” in candidates, the prices of which are determined by market activity. Such betting markets have been shown to be at least as predictive as polls. Read more about PredictWise’s methodology.

The Upshot — The Upshot is the New York Times’s data blog. Its general election forecast is mostly based on hundreds of state and national polls. It also incorporates, to a lesser extent, the voting history of every state. Read more about the Upshot’s methodology."

India vs Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy final: Confidence vs resurgence,"Sunday will be a unique day in the sports history of India and Pakistan. While the cricket teams will battle in the final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy at The Oval, the arch-rivals will also clash at the Olympic Park in a match of the FIH World Hockey League semi-finals.

But both cricket and hockey will be in their respective realms as focus and composure will be the key factors on Sunday as Pakistan eye their maiden Champions Trophy win and India their third.

This year’s Champions Trophy has seen several twists and turns. Three Asian teams making the last four of the tournament that brings the best eight ODI teams in the world is a huge statement of the sub-continent’s domination.

If defending champions India were one of the fancied sides, Pakistan’s amazing turnaround in the tournament has been an eye-opener. This is the first time India and Pakistan will clash in the Champions Trophy final, and in the circumstances, there will be no favourites.

Pakistan, who have never been in the final of a Champions Trophy, came in as the lowest ranked side. No one gave them a chance after India walloped them by 124 runs in their opening group B fixture in Birmingham on June 4.

But then calculations went haywire in both groups.

South Africa, the world’s No. 1 ODI team, former champions Australia and dark horses New Zealand failed to cross the group stage. Pakistan stunned favourites England by eight wickets in the semi-final at Cardiff and India blew away Bangladesh by nine wickets at Edgbaston to set up a dream final that is sending the ICC and the host broadcasters laughing all the way to the bank.

Intense India

After being on the road to London from Birmingham on Friday, India were back at the nets on Saturday morning. Under a blazing sun, Virat Kohli’s men spent an intense three hours breaking sweat. A lot of that training was dominated by fitness drills.

Football plays a big role in training these days. In David Beckham’s country, the likes of Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya were practising set-pieces – banana kicks and putting the ball between two wickets (read goalposts).

The set-pieces will be significant in terms of the match on Sunday. Irrespective of the teams, both batsmen and bowlers will have to eschew flamboyance and build a pace that will be ensuring solidity throughout the 100 overs.

Amir fit to play

Pakistan’s bowlers, particularly left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir is fit to play the Champions Trophy final. He is perfectly capable of the banana swing, although the white ball hasn’t swung much in UK.

But the reverse swing and cutters will come into play and Hasan Ali, Pakistan’s ‘bombshell’ seamer, will be the man that India’s top order needs to play well.

India are unlikely to change the playing XI that hammered South Africa and Bangladesh in back-to-back matches. With a taped right knee, there is slight doubt on Ravichandran Ashwin’s full fitness but India will need him against a team that has specialist left-handed batsmen. If Ashwin misses the final, pacer Umesh Yadav should be back.

Pakistan will be targeting India’s top three batsmen for sure. Although Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli have scored buckets of runs they will treat the Pakistan attack with respect. Early wickets will expose the middle order which has not been tested.

But Virat Kohli is nonchalant. “The middle order is waiting for an opportunity to strike and guys like Hardik Pandya can produce that match-winning performance on a big day,” said the skipper.

The IPL factor

On hindsight, the IPL seems to have done a world of good to the Indian players. The entire team is used to playing pressure games and the squad looked in a comfort zone of another world final.

Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said his players were “excited” for the final match and the mood in the dressing room is upbeat.

“The loss against India in Birmingham was an aberration. We have trained hard for this tournament and if we have beaten England, I am not surprised. The young team has no fear of losing and we are backing ourselves in the final,” said the South African with vast coaching experience.

India may be the form team but this Pakistan team is a galvanised lot under an intelligent captain Sarfraz Ahmed. The wicket-keeper batsman is unlike a boisterous Shahid Afridi and wants his team to do all the talking with its batting, bowling and fielding."

"With pastures for cattle shrinking, India may have to import milk by 2021","India may have to import milk in four years, if it cannot increase fodder supply for its 299 million cattle, as rising pressure on land reduces pastures nationwide.

Spurred by rising incomes, a growing population and changing food preferences, the demand for milk and milk products will grow to at least 210 million tonnes by 2021–22, a rise of 36% over five years, according to government estimates. To meet this demand, production must grow by 5.5% per annum, according to the State of India’s Livelihood (SOIL) report. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, milk production grew at 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

To boost milk yield, India would need to generate 1,764 million tonnes of fodder by 2020, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of government data. But existing sources can only manage about 900 million tonnes of fodder–a shortage of 49%.

Demand for private consumption has risen from 5% per annum in the period 1998-2005 to 8.5% per annum between 2005 and 2012, according to an Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, report.

This demand and supply gap has pushed up milk prices by an average of 16% per annum, according to the according to the 2015 SOIL report.

States with top milk yields have more pastures

In the decade to 2015, milk production went up 59% from 92 million tonnes to 146 million tonnes in 2015. But fodder shortages may knock India off its position as the world’s top milk producer (it contributes nearly 17% of global production).

The milk productivity of India’s livestock is less than half (48%) of the global average: 987 kg per lactation compared to the global average of 2,038 kg per lactation.

The availability and quality of fodder has a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of milk productivity, the data show. All the three states that topped milk productivity in terms of gram per day–Rajasthan (704), Haryana (877) and Punjab (1,032)–had earmarked more than 10% of their cultivable land for pastures, according to the 2015 SOIL report. The national average is 337.

Currently, all three types of fodder are in short supply–green (63%), dry (24%) and concentrates (76%). Only 4% of total cultivable land in India is used for fodder production, a proportion that has remained stagnant for the last four decades.

Demand And Supply Of Fodder: An Estimate

Considering the demand for milk, land under fodder production needs to be doubled, according to this December 2016 report of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture.

Shortages are forcing states to now source fodder from elsewhere. “The quality of fodder is a concern. We are now looking to source fodder from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh),” said Sudhir Mishra, who runs a dairy farm in Ranchi (Jharkhand).

But major portions of grazing lands have either been degraded or encroached upon, according to the Parliamentary Committee report.

However, the availability of crop residues, the largest single source of fodder, has been impacted by increasing pressure on land and the replacement of traditional cereal crops, especially coarse ones. Crop residue includes coarse and fine straws, leguminous and pulses straws.

Given the importance of food and cash crops, it is very unlikely that the area under fodder cultivation will increase substantially, the parliamentary committee report said.

“If India fails to achieve substantial production growth, the country would need to resort to significant imports from the world market which has the potential to cause prices to spurt since India is a large consumer,” said 2015 SOIL report.

To cut costs, easy access to fodder is important for small farmers

Feed cost constitutes about 60-70% of operating expenses on dairy farms. Nearly 70% of India’s milk production comes from small and marginal farmers, who depend on homegrown fodder. Unlike big operators like Mishra, they cannot afford to buy fodder from other states.

Take the case of Dundappa Patil, a 10th-class pass from Belagavi in North Karnataka, who took a loan of Rs 35,000 for dairy farming eight years ago.

The process of applying and getting a loan for the enterprise was simple and quick because Patil was covered by a scheme for unemployed youth in Karnataka. He went through a crash course in dairy farming in Belagavi and in less than a month, set up business with four buffalo.

Patil’s target was to sell 20 litres of milk every day to a local co-operative society. But the yield per buffalo on Patil’s farm was less than 2 litres a day; his buffalo produced less than half the milk he hoped they would.

“I realised that just buying a good buffalo was not enough, quality and quantity of fodder too had to be good,” he said. “You have to be ready to spend a lot of time and money on sourcing fodder.”

Patil said he and other villagers were using a common pasture on a hill 5 km from the village. “But that is seasonal and not enough for the all the village cattle,” he said.

So, he tried buying the fodder, but then the business did not look viable.

The contribution of livestock to the incomes of landless and small farmers ranges between 20-50%, and the poorer the family, the greater the potential of dairy farming’s contribution to livelihood, according to the SOIL report.

Unlike agriculture, which tends to be seasonal, dairy farming provides returns through the year. It can minimise the risks agricultural households face when they run short of cash.

In Belgavi, that scenario did not work for Patil because he could not overcome the fodder shortage–an issue India must address if it is to be self-sufficient in milk and dairy farming is to succeed.

Eventually, after a year, Patil sold the buffalo and repaid half the loan. The bank waived the rest after failing to recover it. Today, he is a construction worker in Belagavi city.

ICC Champions Trophy 2017: India vs Pakistan - most memorable final clashes,"The ICC Champions Trophy 2017 is all set to create history on June 18, 2017. After 46 years of ODI cricket, India and Pakistan are clashing in the final of a major ICC ODI event for the first time. It is a dream match for the millions of fans from both sides. Finally, an India vs Pakistan clash in the final of a big event.

Virat Kohli’s Indian cricket team have a dominant record against Pakistan in ICC events. They have a 6-0 record in ICC 50-over World Cups, 5-0 scoreline in ICC World T20s and a 2-2 head-to-head record in the ICC Champions Trophy, giving India a magnificent scoreline of 13-2 over Pakistan.

Sarfraz Ahmed’s team, however, have a better head-to-head record in overall contests, winning 72 and losing 52 in 128 ODIs so far.

The winner of the final will create history in one way or the other. India will become the first team to win the Champions Trophy thrice while Pakistan will become the third team after India and the west Indies to win the treble of ICC events.

However, heading into the final, this is one stat that will please Pakistan fans.

In 10 major tournament finals beginning from the Benson and Hedges World Championships in Australia in 1984/85, India and Pakistan have contested 10 finals in multi-nation tournaments and Pakistan have emerged winners seven times. India have won only thrice.

What will alarm India is that the last time the team won the final against Pakistan was way back in 1998 in Dhaka, when Hrishikesh Kanitkar’s last ball heroics helped the team chase down a record score.

Heading into the summit clash, here is a look back at the list of the most memorable India vs Pakistan final encounters in triangular and multi-nation series

Result: India won by eight wickets

What happened: This was the first clash between the arch-rivals in the final of anu major tournament. Pakistan chose to bat but they were bowled for 176, with Kapil Dev and Laxman Sivaramakrishnan taking three wickets each.

Fifties from Ravi Shastri and Kris Srikkanth propelled India to a magnificent eight-wicket win. Following their triumph in the 1983 World Cup, this title made India kings of the world.

Guns and Sugarcane Nawazuddin Siddiqui bites the bullet.,"Guns and Sugarcane : Nawazuddin Siddiqui bites the bullet Photos and Text by Reuben Singh



It's nearly mid-day and it is beginning to get quite muggy, yet our man keeps his cool. Dressed in a slick light grayish-blue suit and sporting a pair of aviators, he poses for the next shot leaning against a bicycle. This is home. He need not pretend or try too hard. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was a star here much before he became one in Bollywood. The patent look on his face is intense and he goes with the flow. Everybody knows him in district Muzaffarnagar, the location for our shoot for a story in this weekend’s HT Brunch. The date is Saturday, September 24, and the campaign by Hindu activists that forced him to pull out of participating in the Ram Leela in his hometown has not erupted yet.

Nawaz continues to live the life he led before becoming a star. Rolling his own cigarettes in between conversations, he's totally at ease with his surroundings. One does not get this opportunity when one interviews or shoots a star actor in the usual hyper sanitized and obsessive publicist-controlled events in Delhi or Mumbai. The village life suits him. He has been up early many mornings, working and driving his farm tractor around the sugarcane and mustard fields that he knows since childhood. “It's necessary that I do this,” he says when I ask him about farming. He's trying to implement pivot irrigation as a sprinkler system for smaller crops to aid water conservation. This is necessary as the water table in this area has fallen drastically. “I learnt this from a French actor who own farms around Nice,” he says, referring to his visit to Cannes this year.

“The last decade in cinema has seen the rise of character actors and there is now space for them in the mainstream apart from the big names who rule Bollywood,” says Nawaz. It's clear that he takes pride in his accomplishments and the fact that he's carved out a niche for himself through roles that have become synonymous with him. We wrap up some shots of him playing gilli danda with village boys, some of whom are children of his childhood chaddi buddies. An old friend sports a neat looking pistol, hanging from his waist belt. Quite different from the expected katta, the crude, local handmade gun synonymous with the hinterland. After all, this is one of the most crime-prone belts of western Uttar Pradesh.

Nawaz sets the tone for my next portrait of him, now indoors, holding the gun in his hand after carefully removing all the bullets. “The shots seem a bit planned and obvious,” I mutter. He improvises quickly, posing with a bullet between his teeth, his trademark mischievous, wicked grin back on his face.

Post a late afternoon nap, when the heat becomes a bit more forgiving, we head out to a beautiful, red-brick kiln, with the entire village in tow. It takes some convincing by Nawaz's entourage of brothers, bodyguards and old friends to clear the horde of curious onlookers and allow us to carry on with the shoot. We climb rickety stacks of freshly-made bricks piled high. I set up my lights as Nawaz chews on a stub of sugarcane from a nearby field. After a few shots, the sun sets. We sit down on the dry mud with Nawaz, but there are no starry airs, only unfiltered rustic breeze."
"2017 FIFA Confederations Cup: Russia get off to winning start, beat New Zealand","Russia cruised to a comfortable 2-0 win over New Zealand as the hosts made a confident start to the Confederations Cup.

Three of the previous nine Confederations Cups have been won by the host nation and Russia, playing in the tournament for the first time, impressed with victory in Saint Petersburg.

After having two early chances cleared off the line, they took the lead when Michael Boxall scored an own goal after Denis Glushakov had struck the post.

Russia made sure of victory in the second half, with Fyodor Smolov’s third goal in four internationals ensuring president Vladimir Putin, who called for improved performances in the event, was applauding happily in the stands.

New Zealand are now without a win in 10 Confederations Cup matches and struggled to make an attacking impression.

Portugal and Mexico, who meet on Sunday, are the other two teams in Group A.

Russia made a rapid start, with Aleksandr Golovin having a drive unconvincingly dealt with by New Zealand goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic, before the hosts were twice denied by goal-line clearances.

Russia started off strongly in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup with a solid win over New Zealand. (AP)

First, Aleksandr Samedov’s corner found Viktor Vasin, whose diving header from 12 yards struck the inside the post before being hacked clear off the line by Michael McGlinchey.

Russia came so close again when Dmitry Poloz chested down a cross from right and stabbed his effort from six yards past Marinovic, only for Tommy Smith to get back on the line to clear.

Poloz had a penalty claim turned down when he rounded Marinovic and went to ground, with referee Wilmar Roldan receiving no help from the video assistant - while Georgiy Dzhikiya’s powerful strike was pushed wide by the keeper.

Smolov’s goal was rightly ruled out for offside, but dominant Russia were not to be denied, taking the lead on 31 minutes.

After New Zealand lost possession in a dangerous area, Poloz’s neat touch released Glushakov, who clipped his finish over Marinovic and off the post before Boxall bundled the ball into his own net as he and Smith frantically tried to clear.

New Zealand had a penalty claim for handball against Vasin turned down early in the second half, before Marinovic made a key double save at the other end - keeping out Poloz’s powerful header and Aleksandr Erokhin’s follow-up from close range.

The New Zealand keeper made another great stop from Poloz after a swift Russia counterattack, while Samedov curled over from a free-kick as Russia looked to put the result beyond doubt.

And Smolov sealed victory with 21 minutes remaining, finishing simply from six yards after starting a move that led to Boxall failing to clear Samedov’s threatening right-wing cross.

New Zealand had their first major chances when Ryan Thomas’ powerful effort forced an impressive save from Igor Akinfeev and Smith’s header from the resulting corner was hacked off the line by Yuri Zhirkov.

Marinovic denied Aleksandr Bukharov from point-blank range, but Russia were untroubled throughout and now turn their attention to a crucial clash against Portugal on Wednesday."
"PSEB Class 10 results 2017: Majha region records highest pass percentage, Gurdaspur leads with 89.97%","The Majha region of Punjab recorded the highest pass percentage in the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) Class 10 board examinations, the results of which were declared on Monday, even though the state toppers do not belong to the 4 districts in the area.

Majha topper wants to teach

Apart from being a region topper, Simranjeet Kaur has bagged the 9th rank in the state. Kaur, the daughter of a driver, said she was always supported and backed by her father to shine throughout.

“Scoring 634/650 was not a cake walk. I have put in a lot of hard work day and night to score that well. I owe my success to my teachers as I was not dependent on any tuition. I am currently pursuing non-medical and would become a meritorious professor one day,” Simranjeet, a student of Navjot Modern Senior Secondary School, said.

Cannes 2017: Now Godard reframed by The Artist director Michael Hazanavicius,"One remembers French director Michael Hazanavicius’s The Artist, a beautiful black and white portrait of the silent Hollywood. He has now returned to the Cannes Film Festival – six years later that is – with his yet another gripping work, Redoubtable. A wonderful tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Redoubtable has been adapted from a biography of the celebrated auteur penned by his former wife, Anne Wiazemsky.

A still from Redoubtable.

Hazanavicius’ movie revolves around the time when Godard was helming what is famously known as his revolutionary work, La Chinoise. The time was 1967, a turbulent period in French history, which saw a workers’ demonstration followed by a serious student unrest.

As the Festival enters its sixth day on Monday, Redoubtable has been one of the few films that impressed this critic. It has been executed with remarkable finesse, has noteworthy performances and it narrates the story of a marriage gone sour at times when the French literary circles were driven by unending contradictions. Godard was an integral part of it.

What is the story all about? Godard’s short but passionate marriage to an actress – who later became a fiction writer -- Anne Wiazemsky. She was almost 20 years younger than Godard, and was everything that the man was not. He was brooding, critical, restrictively conservative when it came to her (there is a scene where he asks Anne not to do a movie because every scene has a nude shot of her’s and well, the poor director changes his script to have only the hero strip – a hilarious take that it then becomes) and so damn difficult when it came to other aspects of life and living.

In fact, much of the film is based on Anne’s biography, titled Un An Apres (One Year Later), and much of the celluloid work is seen from her point of view. She narrates much of it, indeed.

Godard was 37, and Anne barely 19, and the auteur was passing through a troublesome phase in his career. He was making La Chinoise, a movie influenced by Mao. She was acting in it, but when the the film runs into rough weather critically, Godard gets moody and irritable and argumentative. “Nobody can win an argument with you” says one of his friends.

The movie’s failure was followed by the unrest in 1968 – a year that saw Godard and his friends like Francois Truffaut storming the Cannes Film Festival and forcing it to pull its curtains down, One is told that Truffaut, who had been declared persona non-grant by the Festival because of his acerbic criticism of French cinema, sneaked into Cannes to cause mayhem. Both felt that Cannes should not run when there was so much suffering all around.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe.

At home, Godard was facing his own little tempest, and the relationship with Anne was hitting the rocks.

All this has been pictured most realistically – with a touch of wit and sarcasm (one often felt that the film was also an indictment of all things wrong with the French society then). We clearly see Godard’s fear of ageing , his nagging doubts about his own creative ability and his narcissistic tendencies. All these rob his life and marriage of peace – the political storm outside his home adding to his own disquiet.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe. For much like Satyajit Ray and Tagore – who have been deeply ingrained in the psyche of an average Indian (certainly Bengali) – Godard and Truffaut will remain forever in these parts of the world.

And this is precisely what Hazanavicius told the media soon after his movie was screened on Saturday night. “Anybody making cinema today owes something to Jean-Luc Godard. He unlocked so many doors, created so many spaces and made cinema possible for many people”.

Anne’s account gives the movie a kind of rare insightfulness. “The intelligence of Anne Wiazemsky’s account lies in the way she manages to retain the aspect of an intimate diary. She doesn’t recount the story from the point of view of the woman she is now, but rather the woman she was then. There is a real Jean-Luc Godard who exists, but no one really knows him. My aim is not to create a carbon copy of Godard. I am inventing Jean-Luc Godard out of the Jean-Luc Godard created by Jean-Luc Godard. Anne Wiazemsky’s account is another variation of a Jean-Luc Godard also created by Jean-Luc Godard”, the director quipped.

Finally, one can say with a lot of conviction that Hazanavicius has managed to make a film on a subject as heavy as Godard with a breeze. Nowhere did this critic feel Redoubtable too heavy or languid. Rather, it was lighthearted and even funny. Not an easy task, though.

ICC Champions Trophy: Pakistan showers praise on Twitter after win vs India,"For a country which has not played cricket at home since 2009, was ranked eighth and lowest coming into the ICC Champions Trophy and suffered a humiliating defeat, that too at the hands of their arch-rivals India in the opening game, Pakistan have surely turned things around -- reminiscent of their fantastic victory in the 1992 World Cup in Australia.

Twitter went berserk late on Sunday evening after Pakistan thrashed India by 180 runs in the final at The Oval in London.

‘#CT2017Final’ remained the top trend throughout the game, and even after it, on Twitter apart from several other Indian and Pakistani players who were regularly being talked about on social media.

From collision to cover-up: the inside story of the Chennai oil spill,"“This is a massive screw up,” said Abhijit Singh, who heads the Observer Research Foundation’s (ORF) Maritime Policy Initiative . “Something isn’t adding up. The initial reaction was very tardy and there was an attempt to hush up.”

What follows is the first detailed account of the collision and its aftermath, revealing a series of oversights and operational missteps that put India’s eastern coast at peril .

Port officials have prevaricated on everything from the quantity of oil spilt and the time needed for cleanup, to the long-term effects on the region’s fragile and besieged marine ecology.

A fortnight after the Dawn Kanchipuram spilt an estimated 75 tonnes of bunker oil — a heavy petroleum residue used to start ship engines — port authorities are yet to explain how two enormous tankers, each freighted with inflammable hydrocarbons, could collide three kilometres off the Chennai coastline.

The errors began as soon as the Maple left its berth. At Kamarajar Port, like elsewhere in the world, specialist navigators, called pilots, accompany large ships out to sea.

But according to a police report filed by A.K. Gupta, the port’s Director for Marine Services, the Maple let go of her pilot, V. Karunanidhi, well before his designated disembarkation point as Capt. Sahadevan was confident of navigating the ship by himself.

M.A. Bhaskarachar, Chairman and Managing Director of Kamarajar Port, said Karunanidhi continued to monitor the Maple’s progress and even messaged the Maple at 3:24 am to say: you are going to collide, be careful.

It is unclear if the Maple acknowledged this message. The ship stayed its course and continued to pick up speed until it collided, 20 minutes later, with the Kanchipuram at 3:45 am.

“Every harbour has its own idiosyncrasies. Captains, irrespective of experience, must rely on a pilot – those are the rules.” - Former harbour pilot

Once the collision occurred, the port’s pollution response fell apart.

The authorities claimed only one tonne oil had spilt, and then said 20 tonnes after the Coast Guard issued a separate statement. The final quantity of spilt oil, officials privately admit, could rise to 100 tonnes.

“The port should handle a spill of this size, but couldn’t. We came in because they asked us for help,” said a senior officer in the Coast Guard. “By then much of the damage was done.”

One plausible scenario is that the port panicked, sought to suppress news of the incident, and called the Coast Guard only once they realised the scale of the spill.

So when did port authorities learn of the accident?

“We cannot say anything, investigation is underway,” said A.K. Gupta, Kamarajar’s Director for Marine services. But a press release states the Coast Guard was informed at 6:15 am and spill containment measures began at 7 am, three hours after the incident.

This may seem like a short time, but experts disagree.

“If a tanker is involved, you need to send a team in half an hour,” said Singh, from the ORF, “These are standing operating procedures, it is not a discretionary decision.”

In 2012, the Indian government hired Saab, a Swedish military supplier, to set up a network of radars, radio receivers and cameras — called the National Automatic Identification System (NAIS) — to improve coastal surveillance in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attack.

“The system can track anomalies and send alerts if a ship suddenly veers off course, or if a ship suddenly stops or collides,"" said an expert who has worked with the system, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive technology.

“The coastguard has a guy tracking the NAIS at all times,” said a retired Coast Guard official, noting that the NAIS has a centre in Chennai. “In this day and age, no one needs to inform anyone about anything, just look at your damn screen.”"

ICC Champions Trophy: ‘Sri Lanka played fearlessly and freely against India’,"This was a great victory for Sri Lanka and a much-needed one. It meant a lot to the Sri Lanka team to chase down that very stiff total and to do it with such ease will have been hugely satisfying. (Highlights)

Read more | ICC Champions Trophy: New Zealand vs Bangladesh live updates, score

There is no doubt, Sri Lanka would have had a few worries coming into this game given recent form, injuries to key players, and the suspension in the last game of stand-in captain and in-form opener Upal Tharanga.

Tharanga’s suspension though created a great opportunity for Dhanuska Gunathilake. He had previously been left-out of the playing XI but remained in the squad with a point to prove. And what an inclusion he proved to be, as he led the Sri Lanka run-chase, ably joined by Kushal Mendis. The two youngsters are two stars for the future and they showed that they not only have youth and skill, but also the temperament.

The return of Angelo Mathews naturally strengthened the Sri Lanka side immensely. He was missed sorely against South Africa and he guided the Sri Lanka middle-order with just the innings that Sri Lanka needed. He knows how to play under pressure, he is the best batsman that Sri Lanka has, and he showed it again today with a masterful knock, guiding Sri Lanka to victory.

Asela Gunaratne, one of my batsmen to watch from the start of the tournament, was sent in ahead of Dinesh Chandimal and contributed a wonderful little cameo. But with the two run-outs under pressure, the innings that Kushal Perera played was outstanding.

Sri Lanka had a wonderful combination of youth and experience together in the middle-order, doing what they needed to get the team a much-needed victory. They are now set up for their next encounter against Pakistan as a virtual quarter-final.

But Sri Lanka should not get too carried away with the win. They should be realistic about the issues that Sri Lanka may still face.

Kushal Perera might miss his next game with his hamstring injury. Hopefully, the team won’t have a captain penalised again for a slow over-rate and, in the field, Sri Lanka can get a lot better. The bowling lacked bite and penetration. We also had a couple of questionable bowling changes, such as Gunaratne bowling three overs for seven runs and not being bowled again.

I was very impressed with Thisara Perera, coming in again after being left out, another like Gunatillake deemed not good enough and not the match-winner the team have hoped for. But he proves that sometimes when you trust players, push them and believe in them, they respond. Thisara bowled really well under pressure and he was key to limiting India to 320 after a stage when it could have gone on to score a lot more.

India, on the other hand, will rue what it might consider a missed opportunity. It batted beautifully with Shikhar Dhawan excelling having set the tone early on. He forms a brilliant opening partnership with Rohit Sharma that is giving India great starts and a lot of confidence.

For its next match up, India might be looking to change its line-up and maybe bring in Ravichandran Ashwin, maybe leave out Hardik Pandya, possibly Kedar Jadhav. But, whatever it decides to do, it needs to do it decisively, because for it the South Africans now await in another effective quarter-final.

Cricket, has once again proved its eternal unpredictability. I expected India and South Africa to dominate the group, but now its wide open with two classic matches ahead.

Today, though, the story was all about Sri Lanka and how, after a rocky start to its ICC Champions Trophy campaign, it played like the young talented team that they say they are, playing fearlessly and freely with strong belief.

"Microsoft: 500M Windows 10 devices, half of 2018 goal","Microsoft says a half billion devices are now running Windows 10, its latest operating system.

That’s up from 400 million disclosed last September, but far short of a goal of 1 billion by 2018. Microsoft has already acknowledged it won’t hit 1 billion in time . Getting halfway has taken nearly two years.

Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after a disastrous Windows 8 launch and heavy competition from phone systems such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Getting more devices on Windows 10 will help encourage companies to make more apps and services for it.

CEO Satya Nadella disclosed the figure Wednesday at a Microsoft conference in Seattle.

After getting Microsoft on track to prioritizing mobile devices and internet-based services, Nadella says artificial intelligence will get a bigger focus."
ICC Champions Trophy 2017: Australia hope weather plays ball in England showdown,"Australia remain confident of beating England in their make-or-break Champions Trophy clash at Edgbaston on Saturday, even if defeating the English weather has so far proved beyond them.

Steven Smith’s side endured the frustration of having Monday’s clash with Bangladesh abandoned due to rain, just days after their opening Group A fixture against New Zealand was also washed out.

(Read | England favourites in do or die match for Australia: Michael Hussey)

On both occasions, it has been Australia who were batting in the early stages of their innings when bad weather ended play.

What made the Bangladesh washout at the Oval especially tough to take was that Australia had reached 83 for one in pursuit of 183 to win and required only four more overs to be bowled to ensure they would take maximum points via the Duckworth-Lewis rule used in rain-affected matches.

With two points from their two matches, Australia now have to beat England to be certain of a place in the semi-finals of a tournament featuring the world’s top eight one-day intentional teams.

“I think it makes the equation pretty simple for us,” said Smith, whose side suffered an Edgbaston defeat by England during the last Champions Trophy four years ago.

“We have to beat England and then I think we’re through. I haven’t really read into anything else that’s happened.”

Smith’s powerful top order have spent precious little time in the middle this tournament but the skipper said: “You know, most of the guys have been playing a lot of cricket, anyway, having been at the IPL (Indian Premier League) and things like that.

“I think once they get out in the middle, things will just click into place, and yeah, hopefully we can play well in Birmingham,” added Smith of a line-up where the big-hitting Chris Lynn, fresh from his IPL exploits, could be recalled.

Australia’s pacemen, led by Mitchell Starc, have started to find their form and they would love nothing more than a go at the old enemy this weekend.

England, by contrast, have managed to dodge the bad weather sufficiently to beat both Bangladesh and New Zealand in convincing fashion to book their semi-final spot regardless of Saturday’s outcome.

But captain Eoin Morgan wants no let-up against World Cup champions Australia as England go in search of their first major International Cricket Council 50-over title.

“I think if we’re truly going to be contenders for this tournament, we need to beat the best teams -- and Australia are one of the best teams,” he said.

“They always are going into a white-ball tournament. They seem to produce limited-overs cricketers at will,” added the ex-Ireland batsman.

“So to go into a game like that with no other attitude than winning is very important to us.”"
PCB chief manhandled after India vs Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy final,"Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi said he was manhandled, pushed and shoved by a small group of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters at The Oval after the India vs Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy final.

“I was manhandled pushed and shoved by a small group of PTI supporters. Police pulled me to safety. Overwhelming love and affection though,” Sethi tweeted.

“Several journalists & eyewitnesses confirm a group chanting pro-PTI slogans was involvd in manhandling @najamsethi outside Oval #PakVsIndia (sic),” said a Twitterati, to which Sethi replied, “That is correct.”

Pakistan came out with a splendid all-round performance as they defeated arch-rival India by 180 runs to lift their maiden Champions Trophy title.

Chasing a challenging total of 339 runs, India bowed down before the Pakistani bowlers and got all out for mere 158 runs in 33.3 overs.

Chasing such a big target, that too in the finals was never going to be easy and India had pinned all its hopes on Virat Kohli, one of the best chasers in the world as he had done so many times for the Men in Blue in the past."
"‘Virat Kohli’s positive vibe rubbed on India, AB De Villiers couldn’t do that’","It was perfect Sunday for Team India. We got things right from the start by winning the toss and electing to bowl. It was important to put South Africa under pressure. The manner in which India’s bowlers operated in the first 10 overs was the perfect example of how not to give away cheap runs.

It was a game in which the desire to win mattered a lot, and South Africa simply did not turn up. Their approach and intent wasn’t positive and that essentially played a very crucial role in the way it lost. They needed to rise to the occasion and South Africa just didn’t do that.

Watch | India vs South Africa, ICC Champions Trophy 2017, match video highlights

At the international level, the margin for error is always minimal, and South Africa did not play the big moments well. Not only did their batting unit suffer a collective failure, but also made silly mistakes, thereby, allowing India to control the game.

You don’t see three run-outs in an innings that often. Dismissing AB de Villiers and David Miller with their brilliant fielding, Team India enjoyed a huge boost in confidence.

I did not expect South Africa, the world’s top-ranked ODI side team, to choke yet again. I thought they had shed the choker tag, but I was clearly wrong. I just don’t understand why South Africa fall short of expectations at the global tournaments year after year.

It was always going to be an easy chase for India, considering they had dismissed a world-class team for a paltry total of 191 runs. This was a very commendable feat and special credit must go to the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, who was just fantastic. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and the spinners also chipped in when it mattered.

Read | India vs South Africa: Soft dismissals cost us the match, says AB de Villiers

It was a fantastic bowling effort from India. The pacers did a great job by bowling dot balls in the first 10 overs. It surely must have made South Africa go on the back foot. That effort went a long way in helping India dominate South Africa on the day.

Talking about the batting department, Shikhar Dhawan just keeps getting better with every outing in this tournament. You can expect the likes of Virat Kohli to come and keep things steady right till the end, especially when the team is chasing. Just like last Sunday, this was a 10-on-10 performance.

Read | Champions Trophy: You have to sometimes say things that hurt, says Virat Kohli

Kohli and de Villiers are teammates in the Indian Premier League, playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore, but you can tell how apart they are right from the manner in which they approach games.

Kohli’s intent has always been so positive. It shows when he steps on to the field. On the other hand, you just don’t see that from de Villiers. This is where Kohli beats him. And such things do matter, even more so when you’re the captain of the side. The team catches on to such vibes and that’s what separates a winning team from the rest.

Read | ICC Champions Trophy: South Africa missing spark in game, says Graeme Smith

Despite the defeat, South Africa is still a very good, quality side. All they need to do is get together and believe in themselves. South Africa need to change the approach like how England did after the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. You can see how expressive its game has become since then.

South Africa needs to come up with a plan and figure out why it doesn’t perform well in major tournaments. It is a quality side, but sadly it doesn’t play as well as India and the other big guns. That needs to change if it is to win anything major in the future.

Feed The Future Now: movement to serve 5 billion mid-day meals by 2020,"The initiative to serve 5 billion mid-day meals by 2020 is just what India needs as it has the world’s highest malnourished, stunted kids. Recent data shows that almost two in five Indian children under five years of age are stunted, or too short for their age.

India was rated as a country with “serious” hunger levels in the 2016 Global Hunger Index (GHI), with fifth highest GHI score in Asia— better than only Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, Pakistan, and North Korea.

On the occasion of World Hunger Day that is on Sunday, May 28, The Akshaya Patra Foundation along with nine leading corporates and Government of India flagged off a movement to raise awareness about importance of nourishment amongst children and its impetus to education.

Christened as ‘Feed The Future Now’, this movement aims to serve 5 billion meals to children across India by 2020 with a view to create a ‘Poshit Bharat, Shikshit Bharat.’

Maneka Gandhi, minister for women and child development, flagged off the movement.

“Malnutrition is one of those issues that require urgent attention. The focus should not be on feeding just food, but providing a nutritious meal,” said Gandhi.

“I believe children should be provided packets that contain 600-1000 calories and nutrients and urge The Akshaya Patra Foundation to take up this initiative. I congratulate all the corporates for partnering with this cause and I am sure you will achieve great results through this movement.”

There is a growing need to ensure children are well nourished at the age of 0 – 12 years.

“Food is not charity. Food is life. Setting a child on a proper course with good daily nutrition and the ability to attend and succeed in school is our collective social responsibility and one which reaps unlimited rewards as new generations grow and thrive,” said Shridhar Venkat, CEO- The Akshaya Patra Foundation.

The movement envisions a public-private partnership and engages the civil society at large, so that reducing malnutrition becomes a common mission for everyone.

The corporates that have partnered with The Akshaya Patra Foundation are GSK Consumer Healthcare, Reliance Fresh, Nestlé India, PepsiCo India, Viacom18, Reliance Broadcast Networks Ltd, PVR Ltd, Facebook and The LaLiT."

Binge on these five super TV shows to escape the disaster that has been 2016,"Demonetisation. The US election outcome. Pollution. Leonard Cohen no more. Kashmir. Kanpur train derailing… And these are events that have occurred only over the last few weeks. The list gets longer and longer as you go back month-on-month to the disaster that has been 2016. So if you, like us, are feeling overwhelmed and need a different world to flee to – even if figuratively – here are five fantastic TV shows to binge-watch that promise an escape, alright. So get streaming and wake up (to a better reality, hopefully) when December ends.

Stranger Things

This Netflix-original that debuted in July this year, and which is possibly one of the best shows of 2016, is a sci-fi thriller with a liberal dose of mystery, drama and jumpy horror moments thrown in. But what makes Stranger Things so special – apart from the nail-biting plot and stellar cast – is the possibility it offers of an alternate universe where everything is just the same as yours, yet quite not so. The ‘Upside Down’ may not exactly be the kind of world you were hoping to escape to, but it is exciting no less.

Black Mirror

The third season of this highly acclaimed satirical sci-fi series released last month and the ratings have already been through the roof. Unlike the first two seasons that had three episodes each, this has six marvels, each with a different plot and cast. And each is a terrifying study into our world today – obsessed with technology, social media and keeping up appearances online – and the world we might be living in if we aren’t careful enough. As series creator Charlie Brooker said in a 2011 The Guardian interview when the show first premiered, “They’re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes’ time if we’re clumsy”.

The 100

Another science fiction, this one is a post-Apocalyptic action drama that rolls both utopia and dystopia into one action-packed, heart-thumping show. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war wipes out civilisation on earth, a spaceship housing the last lone survivors starts running critically low on life support. So it sends back 100 juvenile lawbreakers back to earth in the hope of repopulating the planet. You’ll be making a mistake if you plan to leave the rest to imagination.

The Returned

Adapted from the 2012 French series Les Revenants, this supernatural thriller that released last year will give you all the creeps, and then some feels. A sleepy little mountain town is suddenly thrown into complete chaos when several locals come back from the dead. No, literally! As if resurrecting from their other worlds wasn’t enough, they also haven’t aged and are unaware of their own deaths. The shock of their families is only understandable, but what is difficult to comprehend are the strange happenings that begin to occur in the town following their arrival. [PS: You might want to watch the French original, as the English one was called off air abruptly. Talk of strange happenings!]

The Night Of

This crime thriller that premiered in August this year had even Shah Rukh Khan hooked, reportedly. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that there is not even a hint of any other world in this – it’s simply set in present-day New York. Sometimes, a different world can exist in your own mind, where the sequence of events is vastly different from what is presumed by others to have occurred – especially when there’s alcohol and a cocktail of drugs involved. This is what happens when after a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder. Add prevailing racial tensions in the mix, and you’ve a total mind-bender.

21:37 hrs IST: Mohammad Amir: At the start, Kohli. Rohit and Shikhar.. they were in great form but I did it. To be honest, it is a teamwork. After the South Africa game, the way we played. That game gave us the momentum.

21:00 hrs IST: Another big six from Pandya. He is playing an absolute blinder. Pakistan are taking this too lightly one feels. Another six and Pandya is closing in on a ton.

20:54 hrs IST: Third six and it is Hardik Pandya’s 2nd fifty in ODIs. This is great hitting and he finishes the over with a crunching cover drive. 23 runs in Shahdab Khan’s sixth over and it has spoiled his figures totally.

20:50 hrs IST: Another massive six. Pandya sizes up on another flighted delivery and deposits it into the stands at deep mid wicket. Next ball, he follows up with another massive six over long on. This is great hitting.

20:46 hrs IST: Pandya gets India past 100. That was a poor ball from Shahdab as India stay afloat in this match. Can Pakistan finish the job?

18:48 hrs IST: Fakhar Zaman: I got lucky with the no-ball. The experience has been very good. It is a final and versus India, I just enjoyed my evening. I wasn’t feeling well after the practice session yesterday but thanks to the physio I am here. He was me all through the night. I thought I wouldn’t be able to play but he convinced me. There was a bit of swing in the wicket and I was taking my time

17:38 hrs IST: Shoaib Malik gets into the action now. He comes down the track and hammers Jadeja inside out over deep extra cover for a boundary.

17:33 hrs IST: Hardik Pandya has been the pick of the bowlers so far along with Bhuvneshwar. However, he errs in line and bowls short as Azam slams a pull shot to deep mid wicket.

17:32 hrs IST: Attempted yorker from Bumrah but he bowls a full toss on the pads as Azam whips it to the deep square leg.

17:25 hrs IST: WICKET! Great catch by Jadeja. Zaman tries to slice it over backward point but Jadeja runs back and takes a great catch. Ends a fantastic knock from Zaman. Fakhar Zaman c Jadeja b Hardik Pandya 114 (106). Pakistan 200/2 after 33.1 overs.

17:22 hrs IST: Pakistan are 200/1 after 33 overs. The platform is now set for the final onslaught. If Azam gets his timing back, Pakistan can then think of going past 350.

17:19 hrs IST: Zaman is trying to be aggressive after going past 100 but he is mistiming the shot. However, he gets his timing right by launching Ashwin into the stands at deep mid wicket. Shades of Phil Hughes when he played that slog sweep.

17:14 hrs IST: Point to be noted! India might not be too disheartened by Zaman’s 100. In the history of the Champions Trophy, whenever a batsman has scored a 100 in the first innings, the team has lost.

17:12 hrs IST: Second drinks break. This is an excellent exhibition of batting from Fakhar Zaman. Remember this name. Can Pakistan go past 300 or will India strike at regular wickets?

17:09 hrs IST: Brilliant! Sublime! Take a bow, Fakhar Zaman. You are indeed a superstar. Flighted delivery and wide outside off, Zaman reaches out and thwacks the pull to deep square leg. Gets to a hundred off 92 balls. The Pakistan fans go berserk. This has been a great exhibition of batting.

17:05 hrs IST: Babar Azam is struggling to middle the ball. The partnership has reached fifty between Zaman and Azam with the left-hander contributing 40 of them.

17:02 hrs IST: Only one run in the 28th over. Ashwin pulls things back but things are far from ideal for India.

16:56 hrs IST: Should Kedar Jadhav be introduced into the attack? Kohli must try to get Zaman out at least.

16:54 hrs IST: 17 runs in Ashwin’s seventh over. Zaman is on 89*. The off-spinner’s figures currently read 7-0-53-0. Pakistan are 167/1 in 27 overs. A total of over 300 is on the cards.

16:53 hrs IST: Awesome batting from Zaman. He reaches out to a slow delivery and forehands it down the ground for another six. He has really accelerated it.

16:50 hrs IST: Brilliant batting. Jadeja tosses this delivery up and Zaman dances down the track to wallop it to the deep extra cover boundary. Pakistan are 151/1 after 26 overs.

16:48 hrs IST: Crunch! Zaman launches Jadeja over long on for a 96-meter six and next ball, he slaps a short ball to the deep backward point fence. That will get him going after the run-out of Azhar Ali.

16:46 hrs IST: India are pulling things back slowly here. After 25 overs, Pakistan are 134/1.

16:43 hrs IST: Babar Azam is the new batsman. Zaman has to stay calm if he has to build on Pakistan’s great start.

16:41 hrs IST: WICKET! Poor running. Azhar nudges it to mid wicket but the batsman is watching the fielder, but Bumrah dives and Azhar is sent back. Easy run-out and Pakistan lose their first wicket. Azhar Ali run-out 59 (71).

16:39 hrs IST: Appeal for a run-out but Zaman is safe. Good throw from Yuvraj.

16:35 hrs IST: Poor bowling this from Jadeja. Azhar pounces on two short and wide deliveries as Pakistan find the boundary on a regular basis. Pakistan are 125/0 after 22 overs.

16:29 hrs IST: Brilliant stuff from Zaman and Azhar as they bring up their fifties. This is Azhar’s 12th fifty while for Zaman, it is his third consecutive fifty. What a star this left-hander has become.

16:25 hrs IST: Cracking shot from Zaman again. Short and wide outside off from Jadeja, Zaman rocks back and crunches the square cut to the deep point fence.

16:23 hrs IST: Both batsmen are nearing fifties. India are trying to dry up the flow of runs. Pakistan are 103/0 after 19 overs. Not a huge run-rate though but it is decent for a final.

16:18 hrs IST: Fantastic shot from Zaman as he steps down the track and thwacks it to deep mid wicket for a boundary. Pakistan have crossed 100. Virat Kohli might be a bit worried.

16:16 hrs IST: Drinks are on the field. This is a dream start for Pakistan. India, for the first time, are under pressure.

16:11 hrs IST: In the air but safe! Short ball on leg stump, Azhar looks to pull to mid wicket but miscues it totally, one hand came off the bat handle as the ball lands safely. India are 93/0 after 17 overs.

16:09 hrs IST: This is now the highest opening stand for Pakistan in ICC events against India. The previous best was the 84-run stand between Aamer Sohail and Saeed Anwar in Bangalore in the 1996 World Cup.

16:04 hrs IST: Azhar survives a stifled LBW appeal as Zaman continues to attack the short ball. Good end to the over as Azhar Ali cracks a short and wide delivery to point. Pakistan 86/0 after 15 overs.

16:00 hrs IST: The partnership is moving on at steady pace. Ashwin is not finding either his line or length as Pakistan comfortably tackle him.

15:56 hrs IST: Bumrah continues to leak runs as his figures read 5-0-36-0. Pakistan are 74/0 after 13 overs.

15:52 hrs IST: Great news for badminton fans. Kidambi Srikanth wins the Indonesian Superseries with a 21-11, 21-19 win over Japan’s Kazumasa Saki. Magnificent stuff. Congrats.

15:51 hrs IST: Fine way to end the over. Zaman dances down the track and flicks it to deep mid wicket for a boundary. Pakistan are 69/0 after 12 overs.

15:48 hrs IST: Glorious shot from Zaman as he punches a full ball straight down the ground for another boundary. Pakistan are 63/0 after 11 overs.

15:47 hrs IST: Missed run-out! Azhar Ali nudges it to mid wicket and takes off for a quick single. Rohit Sharma has a shy at the bowler’s end but misses. Azhar would have been a goner.

15:43 hrs IST: Inside-edge but safe! The quicker ball from Ashwin and Zaman hangs back on the crease, he gets an inside edge and it rolls to fine leg. Pakistan are 56/0 after 10 overs.

15:41 hrs IST: Another maiden over from Bhuvneshwar. His figures currently read 5-2-10-0. Azhar Ali brings up the 50-run opening stand with a sweep off Ashwin. India need to break this stand urgently.

15:36 hrs IST: THUMP! First six of the match as Azhar Ali launches Ashwin over long off. This is now a solid opening partnership.

15:35 hrs IST: Ravichandran Ashwin into the attack. Key period this for both Zaman and Azhar. Pakistan have to build on a strong start.

15:32 hrs IST: Bhuvneshwar Kumar pulls things back with a tight over. However, on the second ball, Azhar Ali survived a close chance as the edge fell short of the bowler. Pakistan 38/0 after seven overs.

15:28 hrs IST: This is a confident start from Pakistan’s openers. Azhar Ali clips a full and slow ball on the pads to the deep square leg boundary and India are 36/0 after six overs. In Indonesia, Kidambi Srikanth has won the first game 21-11 in the final.

15:25 hrs IST: Edged and four! India’s bowlers are under pressure. Azhar Ali flashes hard and it races away to the third man boundary. Pakistan are 31/1 after 5.1 overs.

15:24 hrs IST: Zaman once again goes for the attack. He steps down the track and hacks a pull shot to the deep square leg boundary.

15:22 hrs IST: Bhuvi tries the bouncer and Zaman goes for the pull, but the ball clangs the helmet and goes away to the third man boundary for four leg-byes. The left-hander has a weakness for the short ball but he still goes for the shots.

15:20 hrs IST: Two boundaries in the over. First, Zaman courtesy an inside edge and Azhar Ali through a forehand slap down the ground. Pakistan 19/0 after four overs.

15:17 hrs IST: EDGED and TAKEN! India strike or have they? Fakhar Zaman edges an away-swinger from Bumrah to the keeper but he has overstepped. Wasted opportunity for India

15:11 hrs IST: Missed run-out chance! Zaman taps it to short cover and sets off for a quick single, the fielder swoops in and has a shy at the bowler’s end but misses. Zaman would have been a goner.

15:09 hrs IST: Steady start for Bumrah as well. Pakistan not showing any panic. After two overs, they are 3/0.

15:07 hrs IST: Today is father’s day and there has been plenty of posts about how the India vs Pakistan rivalry is like a father-son relationship. Many fans have called India the father of Pakistan.

15:05 hrs IST: Jasprit Bumrah opens the bowling from the other end to Fakhar Zaman. Survives a close LBW appeal first up but the ball was going down leg side.

15:03 hrs IST: Bhuvneshwar does not do a Zaheer Khan of 2003. He begins with a maiden. Some inswing and outswing on offer for Bhuvi.

15:01 hrs IST: Right, the Pakistani openers are out in the middle. Fakhar Zaman and Azhar Ali are opening the batting while Bhuvneshwar Kumar starts off proceedings with the ball.

14:55 hrs IST: The Indian national anthem is being played first, which will be followed by the national anthem of Pakistan. We are almost nearing action.

14:53 hrs IST: Mohammad Hafeez and Shikhar Dhawan are enjoying a wonderful moment as they laugh and chat . The teams are headed for the national anthems

14:48 hrs IST: For all concerned, the Srikanth final should begin by 3:15 PM while the Hockey match will start at 6:30 PM IST

14:47 hrs IST: Other than the mega-final in cricket, there is also the hockey match between India vs Pakistan in London. Plus, there is also the Indonesian Open final which will feature Kidambi Srikanth. Both will be covered here.

14:39 hrs IST: Here are the playing XIs of both the teams

Pakistan: Azhar Ali, Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w/c), Imad Wasim, Mohammad Amir, Shadab Khan, Hasan Ali, Junaid Khan

India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli(c), Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w), Hardik Pandya, Kedar Jadhav, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah

14:32 hrs IST: India win the toss and have opted to bowl versus Pakistan. Ravichandran Ashwin is fit for India and Kohli’s side are unchanged. Mohammad Amir is back for Pakistan, replacing Ruman Raees.

14:23 hrs IST: Just seven minutes to go for the toss. What should be the team’s strategy if they win the toss? Possibly bat first.

14:10 hrs IST: There are some question marks over Ravichandran Ashwin’s fitness. Will he play today? He will be effective against the left-handers, most notably against Fakhar Zaman.

14:06 hrs IST: The Indian team are in the huddle. Whatever one says about experience, this is an India vs Pakistan match and it brings about huge pressure. However, there is no doubt who the fans are supporting. Check this out.

14:02 hrs IST: Pakistan hold a 7-3 advantage over India in finals, but India hold a 8-2 advantage in ICC tournaments. Which stat will be prolonged or broken today?

13:53 hrs IST: For the first time since 1985, India and Pakistan are clashing in the final of a major ODI tournament. Here is a list of all the finals between India vs Pakistan.

13:30 hrs IST: The sun is out at The Oval today, something that will please both Indian and Pakistani fans.

India have been in prolific form in ICC Champions Trophy 2017, barring a shock defeat to Sri Lanka. Kohli’s side has batsmen who are in form and bowlers who have delivered when needed. However, Pakistan, under the captaincy of Sarfraz Ahmed, have come back strongly after their opening defeat and have peaked at the right time. Their win over England in the semi-final shows that they can beat any team on their day. (PREVIEW)

Key players

India’s top order has been in superb form so far, and they will be the key for India once again. Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli have all been scoring with ease, while Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Kedar Jadhav come in as solid back-up for the opening trio. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah will look to strike early with the ball.

For Pakistan, pacer Mohammad Amir is fit to play again, and will once again be key to their hopes. Fellow fast bowler Hasan Ali has played well after the opening game, and will look to continue his run in the final. The likes of Azhar Ali, Babar Azam, Sarfraz Ahmed and Fakhar Zaman will carry their batting hopes.

Quotes

Neither are we too intimidated nor are we too arrogant about what we are doing. It’s important to maintain the balance of being confident in your own skill and what you are doing as a team - Virat Kohli maintains calm ahead of the big final.

“The way youngsters have performed in this tournament is really encouraging for us, they all have played an important role in bringing Pakistan to the final of this tournament - Sarfraz Ahmed credits his youngsters for the turnaround in England."
Child's Play: Jogi Dera's young snake charmers,"Children of Jogi Dera, an ancient hamlet on the outskirts of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, indulge in an activity that their peers can’t even imagine – the art of playing with snakes. It is perhaps the most common sight in Jogi Dera, where a majority of the population belongs to a semi-nomadic tribe, ‘Baiga’ or ‘Sapera’, whose main occupation is snake charming.

“No snake can harm us as they know we care for them,” says Aina Nath, 13, who was born in Jogi Dera, as he lets a snake slither through his hands. The son of a snake charmer, Aina had his first encounter with snakes at the age of 2, when his father accidently left his basket open. “My father was asleep when I noticed a King Cobra sneaking out. I caught hold of the snake and put it back into the basket,” he says.

Aina was perhaps the youngest in the village to handle the deadly King Cobra. The incident made him popular among other children and handling snakes became a routine affair for him. Snakes interest Aina far more than his studies do. “I like this profession and want to master this art like my father. So, I have quit studying,” he adds.

Twelve-year-old Indu Nath, who is also a snake charmer like Aina, rues that he is yet to master the skills. “I am lucky that I haven’t experienced any snake bite so far. I keep anti-venom roots of medicinal plants (known as ‘jadi booti’ in local lingo),” he says. Chakarmukhi, Nagjadi, Jahar mohra, Sarp gandha— Indu Nath recites a list of his trusted jadi booti. “My father got these especially for me from the forest. Some of these have magical powers and suck away the venom,” he says.

Some children from the village assist their fathers in snake charming shows that they put up at street–side corners or local fairs. “We help out our parents in staging the acts to increase the income,” says Pukar Nath, a contemporary of Aina and Indu Nath. In Jogi Dera, there are many who have broken with tradition and given up their ancestral trade. Shamsher Nath, a snake charmer, says his son Virendra has moved to Rajasthan to work in a thread factory.

“I never wanted my children to get into this business,” says Shamsher. “I am fortunate that my son is settled.” Chumbak Nath, head of the Bagi tribe, whom the locals call Baba, says he has never discouraged people from moving out. Many young men are now working in metro cities in other trades. “There is hardly any money left in our profession. On an average, we earn Rs 200-300 a day which is too little to meet our family expenses,” he says.

Nath says that if the situation does not improve, he will rally the 42 villages inhabited by snake charmers in Kanpur Dehat to boycott the upcoming elections. According to Nath, the small community of snake charmers does not figure on the agenda of any political party. “The village is grappling with several civic issues. It has no brick road, no electricity. There are hardly any brick houses or drinking water facilities except for a few old wells,” he says."
"India v Pakistan, Champions Trophy Final: ‘Mercurial PAK shouldn’t be discounted’","Both Pakistan and India have stormed into the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 final with dominant performances in their semi-finals against the host, England, and Bangladesh, respectively.

Pakistan has surprised everyone in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 after being ranked eighth coming into the tournament, and was well and truly beaten in its first match against India. Since that match, every game has virtually been a knock-out game for it. It has played as though it has nothing to lose, with a freedom to express its skills, which is commendable considering the situation it found itself in.

There is a feeling of destiny with Pakistan.

During its last pool match against Sri Lanka, another must-win game, Pakistan looked dead and buried in its run-chase, but Sri Lanka could not land the knock-out blow with catches going down. As the pressure rose, the skipper, Sarfraz Ahmed, played an inspirational innings to put his team through to the semi-final stage.

(Read | ICC Champions Trophy 2017: India vs Pakistan - most memorable final clashes)

It carried that momentum to the England match, where everything clicked and now it has another opportunity to face arch-rival India in the final.

Pakistan doesn’t have an impressive record against India in ICC events. That said, the ICC Champions Trophy is the only event where it has defeated India, not once but twice – in 2004 at Southampton and in 2009 at Centurion. Although the two sides are locked at two-all on a head to head in the ICC Champions Trophy, I am sure Pakistan will get additional inspiration and motivation from its past successes in this event and will aim to extend its run come Sunday.

India has oozed class throughout the tournament with each player looking in great touch and clear with the role he plays in the team.

The cricketing world was shocked when Sri Lanka chased down India’s big total to win at The Oval, but other than that hiccup, India has looked, with England, the strongest team in the competition.

The top order of Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been remarkable, looking in total control out in the middle. They are intimidating opposition bowlers with their class and breathtaking stroke-play.

(Read | India vs Pakistan: Mohammad Amir fit, Jasprit Bumrah says anything can happen)

One concern for India is that there hasn’t been much work for the likes of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja to do with the bat and Pakistan could exploit this, if it gets early wickets in the final. It’s a big IF!!!

India also has great variety and balance in its attack with spinners turning the ball in opposite directions, pace and skill. It is amazing to think that someone of the class of Umesh Yadav can’t make the starting eleven.

Jasprit Bumrah is a very important part of the attack. He is one of the best death bowlers in the world, executing his slower balls and yorkers at will under pressure. From a batsman’s point of view, it is difficult to pick the ball up early out of his hand due to his unusual action and excellent deception when bowling his different deliveries.

(Read | ICC Champions Trophy: Zaheer Abbas urges Pakistan to take revenge vs India)

It was interesting listening to Virat Kohli in a press conference recently talking about his team maintaining its composure and controlling its emotions in big games. What that tells me is that he has enormous confidence in his side and if India plays any team on skill alone, keeping control of its emotions, then he would back his side to beat anyone in the world.

One of the keys to winning big games is each player being able to disregard all the outside distractions and focus on his role in the team. There will be many distractions when India lines up against Pakistan in the final, with a manic crowd likely to be out of control in the lead up and on match day as the hype for this match will be huge.

India is in a great place and must be favoured to retain the ICC Champions Trophy but no-one should discount Pakistan. It is a mercurial team and this tournament has thrown up so many upsets so far.

Could there be one more?

AIIMS MBBS result 2017: Top 10 from one Kota coaching school. Isn’t it odd?,"The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) MBBS 2017 examination results, which came out on Thursday, has baffled many of us. Here’s why: Ten students who were coached for the examination by a single tutorial, Allen Career Institute, in Rajasthan’s Kota have grabbed the top 10 ranks in these intensely competitive exams. Last year too, eight of Allen’s students had made it to the top 10 in the AIIMS 2016 exam while three had bagged the first top three ranks in National Eligibility and Entrance Test 2016, which is meant for admission to the MBBS/BDS courses in medical/dental colleges run with the approval of Medical Council of India/Dental Council of India under the ministry of health.

Without taking away anything from the super achievers who went through an insanely punishing schedule by the institute, an important question must be raised at this juncture: Has this particular institute cracked the code/pattern of these examinations to get such a perfect score? While there is no proof, it could have happened since the medical course is finite and does not change very often even through regular breakthroughs take place in the field of every day. So it could be possible that the institute/institutes have figured out a pattern in these exams by studying the questions of the last few years. Earlier, there have also been accusations against these institutes that they ‘buy’ the best students by offering them financial incentives, the best teachers, accommodation and world class facilities for free to ensure that the chosen ones get the top ranks. For the institutes, such good results ensure mileage to attract more students. Let’s not forget, for every successful student, there will be scores of others who will not make it. In fact, it’s not just in medical and engineering that we have such coaching factories; even for the prestigious Indian Administrative Services there are coaching institutes which have had a record of notching up top slots year after year.

If anything, the education policy-makers and all those who are involved in the setting the examination papers must treat the 2017 results as a wake-up call for screening the system.

They must investigate how these institutes are managing to produce such brilliant results year after year. While no one is denying that there is a lot of hard work involved in passing these examinations, the authorities must keep a strict watch to prevent anyone from ‘gaming’ the screening system so that all students get a fair chance to get into the top institutions."
"India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: ‘PAK has nothing to lose’","Pakistan bowling coach Azhar Mahmood feels his team has nothing to lose in the high-octane Champions Trophy final against India and it would be the Men in Blue, who would be under pressure at The Oval on Sunday.

“We’ve got nothing to lose - the pressure is more on them,” the Dawn quoted Azhar as saying.

(Read | India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: 5 most memorable clashes)

“They are ranked higher than us - so everyone is talking about India, India. But I can tell you one thing - we have come to win,” he added.

Going into the finals, title-holders India will be firm favourites against a Pakistan side, who were the lowest ranked of all the teams taking part in a tournament featuring the world’s top-eight ODI sides.

(Read | India v Pakistan, Champions Trophy Final: ‘Mercurial PAK shouldn’t be discounted’)

The Men in Blue have won all three of their previous matches against Pakistan in the knockout stages of International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments to date but Azhar feels there was no reason that the sequence could be extended this weekend as well.

“India have the upper hand in ICC tournaments but things can change, and this is the time for us to change the tag that we don’t perform well at ICC events,” said the 42 year-old.

(Read | ICC Champions Trophy: Virat Kohli and his art of living cricket to the fullest)

“History can change, and I hope we can [change it],” he added.

The former Pakistan all-rounder further claimed that the game between the two arch-rivals is bigger than that of the Ashes and thus pressure would be there on both the teams.

“It is massive,” said Azhar.

(Read | India vs Pakistan: Mohammad Amir fit, Jasprit Bumrah says anything can happen)

“But [now] on the biggest stage it is India v Pakistan. It is like the Ashes ... it is bigger than the Ashes - and expectation is high from both nations, crazy about cricket.”

“The pressure is high for both sides and their countries ... it is a dream final for the sponsors and the broadcasters,” he added.

Team India, the defending champions, registered their place in the Champions Trophy final after registering resounding nine-wicket win over Bangladesh in the second semi-final to set up another mouth-watering, high-octane clash with Pakistan in the finals.

Going into the match, India would be high on confidence having comprehensively defeated their Asian neighbour by 124 runs in the group stage.

However, it would not be an easy one for the Men in Blue to defend their title as they would face a charged-up and equally confident Pakistan, who surprised everyone by beating favourites England in the first semi-final at Cardiff on Wednesday.

And the Pakistan bowling coach believes his team’s victory would be no great surprise.

“It wouldn’t be a shock if we won. No one gave us a hope when we got here. We were the number eight ranked side, and no one gave us any credit,” said Azhar.

“But someone asked me before the tournament who would be in the final and I said Pakistan. I believe in my boys ... if we win it would be a great gift to the whole nation,” he added."
"No ICC World T20 in 2018, India to host next Champions Trophy in 2021","Twenty20 cricket may be lucrative business around the world but the International Cricket Council has decided not to host the 2018 World T20 due to a cramped schedule and lack of sponsors’ interest.

India hosted the 2016 edition, won by West Indies, but the World T20 will become a quadrennial event as per the original plans. Australia will host the next championship in 2020.

India will host the next ICC Champions Trophy in 2021. This will be the second time India will be hosting this eight-team event played on a group league-cum-knockout basis.

India hosted the fifth ICC Champions Trophy in 2006. Australia beat the Windies by eight wickets in the final match at Mumbai’s Brabourne Stadium.

READ | India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy 2017 final, live cricket score

At a time when there is a proliferation of T20 tournaments around the world – South Africa and England are in the queue to start IPL-like competitions – ICC’s decision to shelve the 2018 World T20 and stage a women’s event defies logic.

In 2018, the ICC will host the Under-19 World Cup and the 50-over World Cup qualifiers where the last four teams in the ICC ODI rankings will get a chance to qualify for the 2019 championship in UK. The next World Cup will be a 10-team event.

WORLD TEST CHAMPIONSHIP

The ICC has plans to start a world Test league and a Test championship but is not sure when that will materialise. A Test championship has been in the pipeline for long but with the top nations preferring to schedule their own bilateral series, the ICC has not been in full control.

The ICC Annual Conference will be held in London from June 19 and once again scheduling of matches will be discussed.

READ | India vs Pakistan, Champions Trophy final: Why Virat Kohli didn’t play hockey

The ICC is concerned that India and Pakistan are not yet ready to play each other, but understands political factors are beyond the control of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Pakistan Cricket Board.

A top ICC source said India’s “crazy” schedule upsets the balance in world cricket. Having played 13 Tests at home, India will be on a long road to fulfil commitments against ‘friendly’ boards.

“India’s scheduling may not be backed entirely by cricketing logic. It is also to win brownie points and votes at the ICC,” said the ICC sources, tongue-in-cheek.

INDIA TO GET EXTRA FUNDING

Meanwhile, a disgruntled BCCI is set to accept the 100 million USD additional funding from the ICC. This is in addition to the 293 million that was offered by the ICC in April.

Based on current forecast of revenues and costs, BCCI was offered USD 293 million across the eight-year cycle, but India demanded more because it brought in the largest share of revenue for the ICC.

"Family, friends and Pune’s LGBTI: The Pride Walk for 2017","Bindumadhav Khire founded Samapathik Trust to provide legal, medical, and social empowerment services to the LGBTHI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Hijara, Intersex) community through education, training, advocacy, and partnership with the greater Pune community. Today, he holds support meetings, counselling sessions and events to create awareness among straight community. Khire speaks to us about the LGBTI Pride Walk 2017 and more pressing issues in the community.

Tell us about the Pride Walk 2017.

Bindumadhav Khire: Samapathik Trust has been organising this walk for seven years now. This year the theme is to express gratitude to friends and families of LGBTI for their acceptance and support. The Grand Marshall will be a collective of the supporters and members. We want to thank the families and friends for their crucial support. We are expecting around 300 people. Last year we had three corporates join us at the March. We are hoping to see a few more this year.

You have been actively working on this issue since 2002, yet there is so much more to do. What changes does society need to bring in to help the situation?

BK: First and foremost, families and society need to educate themselves about LGBTI. One needs to understand that apart from our sexual orientation we are like every other being. We are not different or unique. It has nothing to do with science of culture, it is natural. If someone from your family has confided in you, be calm. Give it time and accept them. Talking to counsellors may help understand our perspective.

Should schools incorporate sensitising of LGBTI?

BK: Honestly, not many schools talk about sex education, which is a must. So, sensitising students about LGBTI is far-fetched. However, I believe the first step should be in training school counsellors. Counsellors should be able to understand and help students undergoing identity crisis and difficulty with their sexuality. They should be able to help students being bullied or pulled up. Counsellors should create awareness and speak to parents too.

How has media helped you in this struggle?

BK: English newspapers have been vocal and supportive in the past few years. They have aggressively supported our views and demands. They have also written strong and helpful articles, thus making life easy for us. On the other end, films made on LGBTI have been useful in comforting individuals and helping them come out of the closet. These films do nothing for the straight community because they cannot relate to it. The stereotypical portrayal of gay men in films does more harm to our community. It sends the wrong signal and society typecasts us.

What are the misconceptions about the community?

BK: People believe only human beings have LGBTI. This is not true as LGBTI traits have been noticed in animals too. Secondly, one assumes if one is sexually abused by the opposite sex as a child, then he/she turns gay. Third misconception is being LGBTI is a disease which can be treated. And, the fourth issue is that this is a fad adopted from the West, which is false again.

What changes does government need to make?

BK: The government has been helpful when it comes to including us in employment, housing and other schemes. But, our main focus is the curative petition of section 377. We need to have that legalised and live like normal people.

What are you working on right now?

BK: We are working on projects starting July 2017 till 2018. The first project is to conduct awareness workshops for journalism students, the second one is to have dialogues and discussion sessions with policemen, the third one is to train counsellors to understand sexual orientation among kids and how to deal with it. We are also looking at staging plays to create more awareness about the community. We will also have support meetings for families and friends of LGBTI.

"Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers under the ‘selfie spell’ of Pakistani sports anchor","Were India skipper Virat Kohli and his South African counterpart AB de Villiers undone by the ‘curse’ of a Pakistan sportscaster?

It may be a mere coincidence, but Zainab Abbas, who describes herself as a sports analyst for Dunya News on her Twitter handle, has become a rage on social media, which sees her as having wielded an invisible wand to cause Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers to slump during the ICC Champions Trophy in the United Kingdom.

Zainab, a Pakistan Super League (PSL) presenter, clicked a selfie with AB de Villiers ahead of South Africa’s Champions Trophy 2017 Group B clash against Pakistan in Birmingham on Wednesday. And de Villiers, known to destroy bowling attacks, was out for a golden duck at Edgbaston – his first in a 12-year One-Day International career!

Virat Kohli too seems to have suffered from the lingering effects of a selfie with the Pakistan TV presenter.

Zainab clicked the selfie with Virat Kohli before the high-voltage India-Pakistan game. Though Kohli struck a masterly 81 not out in India’s comprehensive victory, he was out for a duck in the loss against Sri Lanka on Thursday – the first time he failed to score in three years.

India lost to Sri Lanka by seven wickets despite amassing 321/6.

The Twitterati are raving about the strange coincidence. While some cricket fans are calling it ‘The curse of Zainab Abbas’ some other Pakistani fans are rejoicing over the failure of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers.

"Top ten rank holders in AIIMS MBBS entrance test our students, say rival schools","India’s coaching centres sell dreams to millions of young students, often claiming sureshot formulas to crack the country’s tough medical or engineering exams. Many of them also deliver on their promise.

But the cut-throat nature of the business played out in a bizarre manner on Thursday with two institutes laying claim to the top ten rank holders in the MBBS entrance exams conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

The results were declared at around 2 am on Thursday. AIIMS does not declare a list of toppers.

One of the institutes is based in Kota, a city in Rajasthan which is known as the coaching centre of the country with 40-odd institutes that admit 1.5 lakh students annually.

A few hours after the results were declared, the Kota-based Allen Career Institute said the top ten were its students, led by all-India topper Nishita Purohit from Surat in Gujarat.

Institute director Naveen Maheshwari gave out the names and positions of the others as well — Archit Gupta (2) followed by Tamoghna Ghosh, Nipun Chandra, Harsh Agarwal, Rishav Raj, Harshit Anand, Rinku Sarmah, Abhishek Dogra and Manish Moolchandani.

Later in the day, another coaching institute, Aakash Educational Services Pvt Ltd (AESPL), came out with its own list of 11 students who were placed in the top twelve position. These students included several on Allen’s list.

“Out of the top 12 ranks, from our classroom programme, Tamoghna Ghosh secured 3rd AIR, Nipun Chandra secured 4th AIR, Harsh Aggarwal secured 5th AIR (classroom+distance), Abhishek Dogra secured 9th AIR,” an AESPL statement said.

AESPL also laid claim to the first and second toppers, Nishita Purohit and Archit Gupta, saying they were pursuing distance learning programmes. It said Harshit Anand (AIR 7), Rinku Sarmah (AIR 8) and Manish Mulchandani (AIR 10) were took distance cources.

At a press conference in Kota, Purohit, Gupta and Moolchandani (spelt Mulchandani by AESPL) said they were regular classroom students with Allen.

A relative who answered an HT call to Tamoghna Ghosh said he was a distance learning student of Allen and a regular with AESPL. Nipun Chandra’s family also said he was a regular with AESPL and had pursued two to three online tests with Allen.

Harshit Anand said he was a regular with Allen, as were Harsh Agarwal and Rishav Raj. Abhishek Dogra had done part of his coaching with Allen and part of it with AESPL.

The business of coaching in India is said to run into crores of rupees with lakhs of students seeking help to crack the competitive exams to secure a seat in one of the prestigious colleges, which in turn could land them a well-paying job. Experts, however, say the competition puts students under pressure, driving many to suicide."
Hasan Ali wants to ‘bomb’ Indian cricket team in Champions Trophy final,"Not Mohammad Amir, not Junaid Khan, Pakistan are looking up to rookie right-arm pacer Hasan Ali to finish India off in the ICC Champions Trophy final at The Oval on Sunday.

The 23-year-old has grabbed headlines with his wicket-taking ability and in conditions that have generally favoured batsmen, Hasan Ali has 10 scalps at an average of just 17.2, the best in ICC Champions Trophy 2017.

It is not Hasan Ali’s wicket-taking ability that is making headlines, but his celebration style has taken Pakistan fans by storm.

The spectacular celebration is a mix of Brett Lee’s clenched fist pitch punch that ends with those Shahid Afridi-like arms fully stretched in delight.

Hasan Ali explains his style resembles the ‘bursting of a bomb’ and he wants to do this “at least three-four-five times” against the fancied Indians, who are chasing their third Champions trophy title.

He picked three wickets each against South Africa, Sri Lanka and England (in the semis) and Hasan Ali is being seen as the man who can hit India hard.

“You can say that it is a dream, but I had set a goal after the West Indies series to become the top bowler while in England.

“I am close to my goal and will try to maintain my title of top wicket-taker till the end of final,” Hasan Ali said, adding that he was “not under pressure” against India in the Champions Trophy final.

Who is Hasan Ali?

Armed with medium pace, Hasan Ali started his first class career at the age of 19. His success at club cricket and the National T20 Cup won him a Pakistan cap in 2016. He made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin on August 18, 2016, and went wicketless in five overs.

Cardiff, where he broke England’s back in the Champions Trophy semis on Wednesday with figures of 3 for 35, is a happy hunting ground for the Peshawar Zalmi quickie. He took 4 for 60 in September 2016 to help Pakistan win by four wickets.

That Hasan Ali has big-match temperament is proven by the fact his two five-wicket hauls have come against Australia (5 for 52) in Sydney (Jan 22, 2017) and more recently against the Windies (5 for 38) in Providence (April 9, 2017.

He came into the Champions Trophy with 29 wickets and has been the tournament’s most striking pacer. Hasan Ali said tips from bowling coach Azhar Mahmood has worked wonders.

Earlier in the tournament, when India handed Paksitan a sound 124-run thrashing (June 4), Hasain Ali made little impact. He leaked 70 runs off his 10 overs and took Yuvraj Singh’s wicket.

If Pakistan are dreaming to change the course of history, Hasan Ali will have to disintegrate an Indian top order that has toyed with most bowling attacks in the tournament so far."

"India vs Pakistan: Sports has no boundaries, proves MS Dhoni, holding Sarfraz Ahmed’s son","The war of words had always been there, but the curses, trolls, and uncalled for verbal volleys on social media have made an India-Pakistan tie into a very ugly affair in the recent past and it isn’t much different in the build up to the ICC Champions Trophy final.

Not many treat an India vs Pakistan match as a game, it’s more like war where you can’t lose. While 22 players battle it out on the pitch, there’s hardly anything that helps calm the fans; both raring to go at each other at every instant.

However, when a picture surfaced of former India skipper MS Dhoni holding the baby of Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed in his arms on Saturday, the moment was more than an adorable one and it took social media by storm. It not only helped fanatics tone down their aggression but also ensured that a sport has no boundaries whatsoever.

Fans from both the nations took to social media to celebrate the moments with a user who goes by the handle @HumayounAK stating: “This picture captures the soul of Ind-Pak matches. Enemies on the field. BFFs off the field. Dhoni with Sarfaraz’s son, Abdullah.”

Indian cricket team will take on Pakistan cricket team at The Oval on Sunday, trying to lift the Champions Trophy for a third time and all eyes will be on veterans such as MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh, who could be taking part in the tournament for the final time.

Dhoni has been a vital cog in the batting line-up for the past few years but wasn’t required to bat against South Africa and Bangladesh. He, however, scored a fantastic 52-ball 63 against Sri Lanka; albeit for a losing cause.

India are the favourites going into Sunday’s game but face a formidable opposition in Pakistan who, despite losing their first game to India by 124 runs made a strong comeback to reach the final despite being the lowest-ranked side to enter the tournament. And against India, they’ll ensure they give their best shot."
Stephen Constantine: India have one foot in 2019 Asian Cup finals,"Sunil Chhetri has been India’s highest goalscorer for a while. Somewhere in the process, he also has taken over the mantle of being the team’s elder statesman in a manner that his predecessor Bhaichung Bhutia would be pleased.

More proof of that came on Tuesday night soon after a moment of brilliance from him had sealed the deal for India against Kyrzgyz Republic in this 2019 Asian Cup qualifier at the Kanteraava stadium. One that India coach Stephen Constantine said had got them one foot into the finals. “We will need another six points I think,” he said.

The claps were still ringing in their ears when Chettri took the podium with Constantine. Both got an ovation from the media before taking the interaction. And through it all, Chhetri spoke about what a stellar team effort this was.

Was fortunate: Chhetri

“I was just fortunate. If Jeje doesn’t pass, I don’t score; if Udanta didn’t pass I wouldn’t have scored (against Myanmar). My father had said ‘if you want to make money, become a striker’ but really this is a whole team effort and I include the guys who work tirelessly behind the scenes to make us look good on the pitch,” said Chhetri.

It was a thought he repeated through the interaction. “In 12 years that I am with the national team, this was one of the best performances. We were battered by the gaffer at half-time. This was our home game and he tore into us using language I can’t repeat here for giving them so much respect. But what I am particularly proud of is how the team showed character. From the goalkeeper to those in front. And what a performance it was, man!,” said Chhetri.

‘Don’t tumble’

The skipper said his only thoughts as he ran with the ball for that 69th minute goal was “don’t fall, don’t tumble… Then, when I passed to Jeje, I told myself keep running. After the goal, the first thing I did was look at the clock and told the team we have to score another and defend well.”

Chhetri, who turns 33 in August, said he is fortunate that he gets asked to rate his goals people think are memorable. “These three points are massive and that’s what sets this goal apart even though it was just one part of what we did.”

Constantine thanked the medical staff for getting Chettri ready to make that “unbelievable run, as he did against Myanmar. And I am glad I didn’t play him against Nepal because then he may not have made this run.”

“As he touched the ball, I understood what this means to football in India. For us to be six points, top of the table… Let’s not make mistake as we did against Guam (in the World Cup qualifier in 2015) but let’s also enjoy this moment.”

Asked if thought India could have won by more, Constantine said: “Let’s not get greedy.” But when it was pointed out that India have now won eight successive matches, he said: “Now, I want nine.”"

"Internet users in India to double to 829 million by 2021, says report","Internet users in India will double by 2021 to 829 million users from 373 million users in 2016, driven by digital transformation, according to a report.

This means roughly 59% of the Indian population will use the internet. Also, there would be two billion networked devices in 2021 up from 1.4 billion in 2016.

Overall IP traffic is expected to grow four-fold during the same period of five years at a compounded annual growth rate of 30%, the Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) Complete Forecast said.

“Combining device capabilities with faster, higher bandwidth and more intelligent networks is leading to wide doption of high bandwidth data, video and advanced multimedia applications that contribute to increased mobile and Wi-Fi traffic,” said Sanjay Kaul, managing director for service provider business at Cisco India SAARC.

“The need for optimised bandwidth management, network automation, end to end security and ultimately network monetisation through cost efficient data production is fuelling the growth of network automation, mass market 4G deployments and adoption, soon to be followed with 4.5G and 5G,” Kaul added.

The report further explained that mobile to mobile (M2M) connections will represent 22% of the total two billion devices and connections and will account for 5% of IP traffic by 2021.

Advancements in IoT applications such as smart meters, package tracking, digital health monitors and a host of other next-generation M2M services is driving this incremental growth.

Video will continue to dominate IP traffic and overall Internet traffic growth -- representing 76% of all Internet traffic in 2021, up from 57% in 2016, the report noted.

India will reach 84 billion Internet video minutes per month by 2021, which is 160,000 years of video per month, or about 32,000 video minutes every second, it explained."

What's it like to get trolled all day long? Take a look.,"What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included."
UP board result 2017: Pass percentage dips for both Class 10 and 12,"The percentage of students in Uttar Pradesh who cleared the UP Board Class 10 and Class 12 examinations witnessed a decline as compared to last year, results declared on Friday showed, which experts attributed to the strict measures deployed by authorities to check unfair means.

This year, 81.18% students cleared the Class 10 or high school exams and 82.62% examinees were declared successful in Class 12 or intermediate.

In 2016, the overall pass percentage in high school exams was registered at 87.66 which was 3.92 points more than the previous year. In intermediate, 87.99% students passed in 2016 or 0.84% less than in 2015.

“The new state government took over in March when the board examinations were on. The government declared that no cheating and frauds in examination would be tolerated and several surprise inspections were carried out in the examination centres,” a government school teacher in Lucknow, who did not want to be named, said.

“Strictness was maintained in the corrections as well and this led to the falling of pass percentage from previous years. The highest percentage scored by toppers of Class 10 and 12 examinations has also witnessed a dip,” the teacher added.

Like the previous years, girls performed better than boys in both Class 10 and 12 board exams. And, the toppers for both the classes were girls.

Tejaswi topped with 95.83% in high school exams and Priyanshi Tewari was declared the topper in the intermediate exam with 96.20% marks. Both are from Fatehpur district.

Over 60,61,030 candidates registered for the high school and intermediate exams this year. They included 34,04,715 examinees for Class 10 and 26,56,319 for Class 12.

However, due to strict vigilance following cases of cheating in the previous years, an unexpected 5,94,503 candidates left the exams midway and 1,862 examinees were caught copying.

In some districts, mass copying was reported due to which 69 exams of various subjects were cancelled and 91 schools were debarred from holding the board exams for the next five years.

This year, the board also provided coded answer sheets in 31 districts of the state that were identified as sensitive in order to check cheating during the exams.

The evaluation of around 4.6 crore answer sheets by 1.37 lakh teachers began from April 27 at 253 evaluation centres in the state."
"Honda to focus on self-driving cars, robotics, electric vehicles through 2030","Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co on Thursday spelled out for the first time its plans to develop autonomous cars which can drive on city streets by 2025, building on its strategy to take on rivals in the auto market of the future.

Unveiling its mid-term Vision 2030 strategy plan, Honda said it would boost coordination between R&D, procurement and manufacturing to tame development costs as it acknowledged it must look beyond conventional vehicles to survive in an industry which is moving rapidly into electric and self-driving cars.

Honda has already spelled out plans to market a vehicle which can drive itself on highways by 2020, and the new target for city-capable self-driving cars puts its progress slightly behind rivals like BMW.

“We’re going to place utmost priority on electrification and advanced safety technologies going forward,” Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said.

Developing new driving technologies, robotics- and artificial intelligence-driven services and new energy solutions also would be key priorities for Honda in the years ahead, the company said.

Honda established a division late last year to develop electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its long-held goal for lower-emission gasoline hybrids, plug-in hybrids, EVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to account for two-thirds of its line-up by 2030, from about 5% now.

By 2025, Honda plans to come up with cars with “level 4” standard automated driving functions, meaning they can drive themselves on highways and city roads under most situations.

Achieving such capabilities will require artificial intelligence to detect traffic movements, along with a battery of cameras and sensors to help avoid accidents.

BMW has said it would launch a fully autonomous car by 2021, while Ford Motor Co has said it will introduce a vehicle with similar capabilities for ride-sharing purposes in the same year. Nissan Motor Co is planning to launch a car which can drive automatically on city streets by 2020.

Honda has been ramping up R&D spending, earmarking a record 750 billion yen ($6.84 billion) for the year to March."

"India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: 5 most memorable clashes","The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy has reached its final leg and there couldn’t be an exciting game for fans across the globe than one between the teams that have reached the finals. On paper, it’s the defending champions taking on the World No. 8 side. Away from it, it’s India versus Pakistan. If there are three words in the Indian sub-continent that can turn anyone’s attention at one go, it’s bound to be this.

From children feigning sickness to bunking schools to office-goers taking a break from work, cricket has unified several sections of the society over a number of generations towards a common goal. The countries have fought three wars, there’s tension on the border, a few generations have grown up watching movies that portrayed the other in poor light and thus, this has become a fixture that no one wants to miss.

The tension and rivalry has often brought the best out of the teams as well. HT looks at such top five encounters:

1. That last ball six (April 18, 1986)

It was the final of the Austral-Asia Cup in Sharjah and India, the defending world champions then, had put up a formidable total after being put in to bat. Half-centuries from Krishnamachari Srikkanth (75), Sunil Gavaskar (92) and Dilip Vengsarkar (50) had given India a solid start before Wasim Akram and Imran Khan’s fiery spells restricted them to 245/7 after being 216/2 at one point.

In reply, Pakistan were on the mat right from the very start but a heroic knock from Javed Miandad (116* off 114 balls), the only player to cross the 35-run mark, took the fight to the wire with four runs required for victory off the final delivery. It was the last wicket and all three results were possible but Miandad did the unthinkable by lofting Chetan Sharma for a six, carving out the yorker as a full toss to launch it into the stands.

2. The sledging that went wrong (March 9, 1996)

This was the second time that the two sides met in the World Cup with India having won the previous tie in 1992. Pakistan, the then defending world champions, were on the backfoot at the innings break as India raced to 287 after batting first with Navjot Singh Sidhu (93) leading the charge while Ajay Jadeja (25-ball 45) put on a late onslaught. They, however, went to a flying start as Saeed Anwar (48) and Aamir Sohail (55) went all guns blazing right away.

Having hammered Venkatesh Prasad for a boundary, Sohail seemed to gesture the direction in which the ball went as to “There’s where I’m going to hit you for boundaries” to Prasad. Usually a calm and composed person, Prasad drudged back to his starting line-up but had Sohail’s timber shaken with the very next delivery. It was a game-changing moment and India then started picking up wickets at regular intervals to win the game by 39 runs.

3. Six short of double hundred (May 21, 1997)

The knock was so classy that it almost seemed evident once Saeed Anwar crossed 150. The Indian bowling attack, barring Abhay Kuruvilla and Robin Singh, had been going at over six runs an over with left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi getting plundered for 36 runs off his four overs. The knock, studded with 22 fours and five sixes, had taken the world by storm as word spread on the evening that Anwar was heading towards the unthinkable double hundred in an ODI.

However, on 194, he mistimed Sachin Tendulkar while trying to sweep him over the fine leg boundary and Sourav Ganguly took a fantastic catch running behind to complete the dismissal. The Indian crowd couldn’t help but admire the knock and gave a standing ovation to Anwar as he walked back. India had a centurion of their own as well during the chase, but Rahul Dravid (107) and Vinod Kambli (65) couldn’t help their side scale the 328-run target and fell short by 35 runs.

4. Tendulkar torments Pakistan (March 1, 2003)

With Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar all in their peak form, this was perhaps the best Pakistan side to take on India in a World Cup since they first met in 1992. Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Pakistan put up 273 for the loss of seven wickets thanks to a valiant 101 from Saeed Anwar.

In reply, India lost Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly in consecutive deliveries before Abdur Razzaq dropped Sachin Tendulkar just four balls later. India could have been three down for 57 but instead, Tendulkar ripped apart the Pakistan bowling attack and scored 98 off 75 deliveries before heading back to the pavilion. Rahul Dravid (44*) and Yuvraj Singh (50*) then guided India to complete the iconic victory and help keep their record intact against Pakistan.

5. “In any case, Javed Miandad wasn’t batting” (March 13, 2004)

It was the first of the five-match ODI series in Pakistan and India put up 349 after batting first; an all-round effort from the batsmen coupled with 38 runs coming through extras. Half-centuries from Rahul Dravid (99) and Virender Sehwag (79) had helped India’s cause while Sourav Ganguly (45) and Mohammad Kaif (46) provided them the perfect support in the middle-order. Pakistan, however, weren’t unnerved by the asking rate and steered their ship well after losing both their openers for just 32 runs.

Inzamam-ul-Haq played a captain’s knock en route to his 122 and found a perfect partner in Yousuf Youhana who struck 73. They had almost taken their side over the line but a brilliant final over from Nehra meant the hosts required six off the last ball to win the tie. However, there was no drama this time around and Nehra had Moin Khan caught at covers to seal the victory by five runs. On being asked at the post-match conference if memories of the Miandad saga had flashed during the last ball, Ganguly had remarked: “In any case, Javed Miandad wasn’t batting!”"
"Cristiano Ronaldo fires Portugal, France complicates path to 2018 World Cup","France complicated their task of ensuring automatic qualification to next year’s World Cup in Russia after falling to a dramatic 2-1 defeat in Sweden on Saturday.

Sweden snatched victory with an Ola Toivonen goal from the half-way line in extra time after a poor clearance from France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

The freak goal sent the massed ranks of yellow clad fans in Stockholm into a wild frenzy, but more importantly with four games to go it sent Sweden top of Group A, level on 13 points with France.

Only the winners of each group are guaranteed a place at next year’s finals in Russia, with the eight best second-placed sides competing in the play-offs.

The French will now play a crucial tie on August 31 against the Netherlands, who remain in the running after thrashing Luxembourg 5-0, while Cristiano Ronaldo led Portugal’s 3-0 triumph in Latvia.

France had pulled ahead through Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud after 37 minutes, but the Scandinavians levelled before the break thanks to Jimmy Durmaz (43).

And after more than three minutes of regular time Toivonen took advantage of a poor clearance from France captain Lloris with a soaring shot into the back of an empty net.

“It was a catastrophic scenario,” said coach Didier Deschamps, a World Cup winner in 1998 as a player with France.

“I’m not going to heap blame on Hugo, he has often been decisive for us, but it cost us.”

The coach added that “the draw was not the ideal result but would have been a good point, which would have allowed us to keep Sweden behind”.

For Deschamps’s side it was the first defeat in qualifying and they next face a tough test against the Netherlands in Paris.

Veterans Arjen Robben (21) and Wesley Sneijder (34) laid the groundwork for a Dutch victory in coach Dick Advocaat’s first game in charge.

In the second half Georginio Wijnaldum (62) and Quincy Promes (70) scored with Vincent Janssen, adding a penalty six minutes from time.

“We have the means to cause a surprise in Paris, the group has found a positive dynamic, we will go there to win against the Bleus,” said a defiant Robben.

Advocaat, who started his third stint as Oranje coach this week, was also confident.

“Of course we are capable of winning in France, the players will be ready, I have a good feeling,” he said.

Ronaldo show

In Group B, Switzerland remain top after beating the Faroe Islands 2-0, thanks to their stars Granit Shaka (36) and Xerdan Shaqiri (59), and are three points ahead of Portugal, the reigning European champions, who beat Latvia thanks to another Ronaldo goal scoring display.

In keeping with his great season finale, the Real Madrid star was decisive with two goals (41 and 63) and an assist for André Silva to score the third (67).

Ronaldo has scored 18 goals in his last eleven matches and after guiding Real Madrid to the Liga-Champions League double will try to extend his trophy collection with the Confederations Cup from June 17 to July 2.

The surprise result of the group was the defeat of Hungary against modest Andorra (1-0), leaving the Central European side virtually outside the World Cup.

Switzerland and Portugal will play the first place of the group, which qualifies directly for Russia-2018, and the second will have settle for a playoff.

In group H, Belgium took a big step towards qualifying by beating Estonia 2-0 with goals from Dries Mertens (31) and Nacer Chadli (86). Bosnia and Greece, the two teams pursuing Belgium, played out a goalless draw."

India were outclassed in all departments as a maiden ton from Fakhar Zaman led them to 338/4 before Mohammad Amir and Hasan Ali picked up three wickets apiece to bundle India out for a paltry 158.

This was the first time India lost to Pakistan in an ICC event since 2009. The victory also helped Pakistan become the fourth nation to complete the ICC treble, having won the World Cup in 1992 and the World T20 in 2009.

“We tried our best but Pakistan outplayed us in all departments of the game. It’s no shame losing to a better team,” Kohli had said in his post-match conference on Sunday.

However, there were a few who weren’t too pleased with the lack of explicit display of regret from the Indian players, and for them sharing a light-hearted moment with the opposition after a dismal loss.

“Some teams start very confidently and then they fade off. Some teams might not have the best starts, and they come back amazingly, which Pakistan have done. So everyone is aware of the kind of talent they have in their team, and on their day they can beat any side in the world,” Kohli had told reporters on Saturday."

India vs Pakistan: TV ad rates ‘rocket’ ahead of ICC Champions Trophy 2017 final,"Television advertising rates for Sunday’s ICC Champions Trophy 2017 final between India and Pakistan are 10 times the normal price, industry sources said, as millions of fans are expected to tune in for a clash that last time ranked among the six most-watched sporting events.

Pakistan, the lowest-ranked team at the Champions Trophy tournament, upset host and favourites England to set up a final with defending champions India, feeding a frenzy for a game that commands a fanatical following in the region and among its diaspora.

A 30-second spot during the final to be broadcast by Rupert Murdoch’s Star Sports is expected to cost nearly 10 million rupees ($155,267), far higher than the 1 million rupees that advertisers pay on average for most Indian shows, said a person involved in buying ads.

Most of the TV spots for the final, to be played in London, were pre-booked with firms such as Nissan Motor, Intel Corp, Emirates, Chinese mobile maker Oppo and Indian tyre maker MRF signed up as commercial partners for the tournament.

Fewer than 10 percent of the slots are left for the final, a person in the sports broadcasting industry said.

Companies still wanting to air their ads will be paying a higher rate than those who pre-booked, said the person, who did not want to be named, citing business confidentiality.

India v Pakistan Final .... !!!!!!!! All TV execs around the World are now cracking a nice bottle open to celebrate ..... #IndiaToWin — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) June 15, 2017

India captain Virat Kohli is the only cricketer among the world’s 100 highest-paid sportsmen, ranking 89th with annual income of $22 million, according to a list compiled by Forbes.

Before the Champions Trophy, the last time India and Pakistan played a one-day international was during the 2015 World Cup. That game, won by India, was one of the top-six most viewed sporting events, along with the soccer World Cup final and Usain Bolt’s 100-metre sprint at the 2012 Olympic Games, the sports broadcasting industry source said.

“That was a league game, this is the final,” the person said. “You can expect this to be even bigger.”

India and Pakistan have already met during the tournament’s group stage, with India winning easily. More than 200 million people watched that game, according to Indian media, citing BARC India. For Sunday’s final, viewership is expected to be 30-40 percent higher.

Troubled history

Cricket between the neighbours and rivals has been limited because of their longstanding political problems.

They last played a bilateral series in 2012-13, when Pakistan toured India for two Twenty20 games and three one-day internationals.

It was their first series since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when Pakistani militants went on a killing spree that left 166 people dead in India’s financial capital. India has since refused to play Pakistan outside International Cricket Council events.

Virat Kohli mania part of support for Indian team in ICC Champions Trophy 2017,"The annual migration of Indians to England during summer was aptly described by an observer: It’s bizarre that you fly out of Palam, arrive at Heathrow and feel like having landed back in Delhi!

This summer, all Indians, whether from London or Delhi, are cheering for the Indian team and if Virat was a candidate in last week’s election in England, he would have won hands down .He is the new star and after years of Sachiiiin, Sachiiin, the loud chant across cricket grounds is Kohliii, Kohliii. The buzz, the aura, the power and energy around Virat is unmistakable.

That he is special, supremely confident and has a decisive front-foot trigger movement is well documented .That Virat can hold his own and take on both friend and foe is also no state secret. That he is not one to be awed by any person or occasion was evident at the reception hosted by the Indian High Commissioner at Lord’s Long Room.

As the MC for the evening went around asking Mike Brearley, Andrew Strauss and others about India-England cricket, the guests present were busy chatting. Irked by this rather rude disturbance, Kohli quickly stepped in to request everyone, politely but firmly, to listen to the interesting cricket conversation and keep the socialising bit for later. Result of this gentle rebuke on the invited audience: hushed silence!

In England, Kohli mania is part of the enormous support for the Indian team. For them, every match, in Birmingham or Oval, is a ‘home’ game. Indian fans fill the stadiums and add colour, flavour and lots of noise to cricket in England. Traditionally, matches here are played in front of an appreciative crowd in dignified, respectful silence.

For India games, however, the norm has changed: cricket is now high octane, high decibel, dholak and dhamaal entertainment.

Not just ordinary stands, even top end corporate boxes/executive suites are run over by Indian fans. Cricket attracts everyone, the elite and the ordinary, and such is the cultural fusion, it is not unusual for the entitled to drink champagne, eat chaat papri and animatedly discuss the subtleties of cricket in English conditions.

The Oval, venue for the Champions Trophy, is traditionally an India-friendly ground. In the main pavilion is a marble tablet put up by Raj Singh Dungarpur (former BCCI president ) to commemorate Indo-British cricket. The more recent Vauxall Stand has an India Room inaugurated in 2005 by Sachin Tendulkar, funded by generous patrons Gulam Noon, Hinduja Foundation, Nat Purie and the Bagri brothers among others.

The Indian team played three day Test matches at the Oval, first in 1936 and later in 1946. Vijay Merchant was the star performer on both occasions, scoring 52, 48 and 129 in the three innings he played.

In 1971, Ajit Wadekar’s India beat England for the first time with Chandrasekhar getting 6 for 38. In 1979, there was crushing heartbreak at the Oval: Chasing 438 in the last innings, India, at one stage 366 for 1, fell short by 8 despite SMG’s monumental 221 constructed over eight hours of batting.

Every Indian fan, whether the Palam to Heathrow/ Palam variety or the hardcore local English, is hoping India does a Lord’s at the Oval. Kapil Dev in 1983, King Kohli this Sunday.

Virat Kohli defends dismal India show vs Pakistan in ICC Champions Trophy final,"Virat Kohli defended India’s poor showing in the ICC Champions Trophy final after Pakistan cruised to an 180-run win with 117 balls to spare. (HIGHLIGHTS)

“We tried our best but Pakistan outplayed us in all departments of the game. It’s no shame losing to a better team,” Kohli said in his post-match chat with reporters at The Oval. (VIDEO HIGHLIGHTS: India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy final - best moments)

On Sunday, India failed in two departments of the game that have won them matches in recent times. The bowlers failed to contain the Pakistan batsmen in the first 10 overs, lost the plot in the death overs and composure deserted the top-order batsmen when they chased Pakistan’s 338 for four.

Kohli said he was proud of India’s performance in the Champions Trophy and reiterated that “results can’t be guaranteed.”

READ | Pakistan consign India to horror defeat in Champions Trophy final

India lost wickets in clusters and Mohammad Amir’s three for 16 gave Pakistan the start they wanted. Kohli himself threw caution to the winds after surviving a dropped catch at slips. He was out next ball trying to flick a ball that was back of length and on the off-stump.

“No batsman goes out there to throw his wicket, no bowler wants to give away runs. It was a bad day in office for us and we must accept this loss and move on,” the Indian captain said.

FLICKER OF HOPE

Kohli said there was flicker of hope when Hardik Pandya started punishing the Pakistan attack. Described by Kohli as a ‘complete package’, Pandya hit the tournament’s fastest fifty off 32 balls, but the all-rounder was left with too much on his plate. His run out, thanks to Ravindra Jadeja, put Pakistan on the path to a landslide win.

“Can never tell in a chase what’s going to happen. Yes, we have shown the composure in pressure situations most often in this tournament, but that is no guarantee that you’re going to do it every time.

“Obviously your best effort is to try and do it every time, but cricket is not about doing well in every game that you play. You will have failures, and one team has to lose on the day, and today was our day to lose because the opposition played much better than us,” said a candid Kohli.

Kohli praised Pakistan’s opening duo that put on a match-winning 128-run stand. The captain, leading India for the first time in the Champions Trophy, said Fakhar Zaman’s innings took India by surprise.

CAUGHT UNAWARES

“Azhar is a very conventional cricketer, he plays shots that you can plan against, and you can still have bowling plans and so forth, but a guy like Zaman, when he gets going it becomes real difficult to stop them because I think 80 % of his shots were high-risk and they were all coming off,” said Kohli.

Kohli said the team will analyse this defeat. The captain was worried that 25 extras were conceded and one of them, a no ball from Jasprit Bumrah, gave Fakhar Zaman the opportunity to smash a decisive century that left the defending champions befuddled."
"After ICC Champions Trophy win, Sarfraz Ahmed urges India to play cricket in Pakistan","Pakistan used their maiden ICC Champions Trophy win to make a politically sensitive statement on Sunday. Skipper Sarfraz Ahmed, in his opening address to the media, said the win will boost Pakistan cricket and “hopefully all nations will now come to Pakistan.” He added: “It is sad that we have not been playing at home for eight years.”

All top nations refuse to play in Pakistan where security is at a premium. Pakistan play their ‘home’ matches in UAE and Sunday’s 180-run win against defending champions India was a perfect platform to send a strong message to the government in New Delhi.

READ | Pakistan consign India to horror defeat in Champions Trophy final

Successive Indian governments have refused to play bilateral cricket with Pakistan and it is unlikely that the result of the 2017 Champions Trophy will change the views of the Narendra Modi government.

Pakistan, however, were on top of the world after their victory. They came into the tournament as the lowest ranked team and after suffering a 124-run loss in a group match against India at Edgbaston on June 4, seemed to have lost steam.

“Not really, I told the boys that there was lot of cricket remaining to be played. Thanks to the coaching staff, it was possible to stage this turnaround and win the trophy.

“Hopefully everyone will remember this win, not today, not tomorrow, (but for a ) very long, long time,” said Sarfraz.

Losing the toss was good for us, said Sarfraz. “We would have loved to bowl first but I also thought that if we can score 280, it will put pressure on the opposition.,” he said.

The skipper was all praise for Fakhar Zaman, who timed his maiden ODI century to perfection.

“I told him to play his natural game, just the way he would in domestic cricket. He hit the ball really well and turned the tables on the Indian bowlers. At the end of it, it was a complete team effort,” said Sarfraz.

For Pakistan’s head coach Mickey Arthur, the win came as big relief. One of the top coaches in the world, Arthur has never won an IC C trophy and Sunday ended that jinx.

“It’s not about me and my career, it’s about 15 unbelievable players in that dressing room who have been absolutely fantastic for the last year. So that’s what it should be about.

“I was telling somebody the other day that I’ve had five semi-finals with South Africa and never got to a final. I got to one final with Pakistan and eventually got a medal. So that’s fantastic. But the credit goes to the players. They’ve been brilliant, and my fellow coaching staff and management team have been fantastic, as well,” said Arthur."
"Toyota sells all shares in Tesla, says tie-up ended by end of 2016","Toyota Motor Corp said on Saturday it had sold all shares in Tesla Inc by the end of 2016, having cancelled its tie-up with the US luxury automaker to jointly develop electric vehicles.

Japan’s biggest automaker had bought around a 3% stake in the Palo Alto-based automaker for $50 million.

Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the company had sold all of its shares in Tesla as of the end of 2016, part of a regular, periodic review of its investments, after it had initially sold down a portion in 2014.

“Our development partnership with Tesla ended a while ago, and since there has not been any new developments on that front, we decided it was time to sell the remaining stake,” he said.

In November, the Japanese automaker appointed its president to lead their newly-formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that it has been slow to embrace.

The charismatic striker started his professional career with VFB Stuttgart aged 18 and it was just a matter of time before he established himself as a first-team player. Werner’s speed and vision made him an asset to the team, and although he played a majority of his first two seasons as a winger, his talent caught the eye of football experts.

When Stuttgart were relegated at the end of the 2015-16 season, Werner decided to leave his hometown side and became the club record signing for newly promoted RB Leipzig. It was the perfect move for the youngster as he was given the centre forward’s position, and in manager Ralph Hasenhüttl he found a great mentor who taught him the tricks of the trade.

Werner had a relatively slow start to the season but his confidence grew with time and it was his brilliant goal-scoring record that took RB Leipzig to amazing heights. With 21 goals from 31 matches, he finished as the fourth highest scorer in the Bundesliga, and although his team missed out on the title by quite a margin, it was a huge achievement for a newly promoted team with no top-tier experience.

Werner was also quite prolific in the German youth set-up from a young age with 30 goals in 38 appearances for the German U-15, U-16, U-17, and U-19 sides combined. He played a bit for the U-23 team, and in March 2017, made his senior debut in a friendly against England.

Germany has struggled to find a true striker in the last few years and that was evident in Euro 2016 where they had to opt for a false No 9 formation with Julian Draxler acting as the front man. The team did have the seasoned Mario Gomez who scored two goals, but the 31-year old is not as fast as he used to be.

Since then, Joachim Loew has tried a variety of strikers like Max Kruse and Sandro Wagner in the centre forward’s role, but the position is still up for grabs. That is why the Confederations Cup can be the perfect opportunity for Werner to stake his claim.

Werner had an impressive Bundesliga season and with national team manager Joachim Loew going for a young squad, he was one of the perfect choices for the striker’s position. The absence of big names will mean more chance for Werner to shine and that is exactly what he needs. His speed (with and without the ball) will be a great addition to Germany’s aggressive brand of football and if he can shine in Russia, there is a good chance he will be the main striker for his country when they go back to Russia for the FIFA World Cup 2018."
"Triumph launches Street Triple S at Rs 8.65 lakh, eyes 90% local assembling by 2018","British superbike maker Triumph Motorcycles on Monday launched the 2017 Street Triple S in India at Rs 8.5 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The new Triumph is the base model of the Street Triple series, which has two other models -- Street Triple R and the top end Street Triple RS.

The new Street Triple S is powered by a 765 cc, three-cylinder liquid-cooled engine, which churns out 110 bhp of power when mated to a six-speed gearbox. It comes with switchable traction control, antilock braking system for safety, and LCD instrument pack and DRL headlights.

The company expects to sell close to 250-300 units of the new bike in the current year.

“We expect to sell in the range of 1,200-1300 units during the year and out of that, Street Triple S is likely to account for 250-300 units,” Triumph Motorcycles India managing director Vimal Sumbly said at the launch.

The company has already opened bookings for the model and deliveries from its 14 dealerships are expected to begin from the next week.

Why UP CM Yogi Adityanath could do the trick for the BJP in Bihar 2019,"A few days ago when Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath took a vow to oust Bihar’s much-touted Grand Alliance by 2020, it became amply clear that the BJP’s blueprint for the 2019 General Election was ready.

It will be a direct face-off between the two chief ministers – Nitish Kumar of Bihar and UP’s Adityanath, instead of Nitish versus Narendra Modi, as projected in the previous two electoral battles in the state.

The new rising star of the party, Yogi is a polarizing figure, something that can easily cut through the caste equations of the Grand Alliance that had turned the tables on the BJP in the Bihar assembly polls held soon after the 2014 general election.

The saffron-robed Yogi still carries the aura of a Mahant, which blurs his Rajput caste and charms both the backwards and the forwards.

Political observer Prof Rajesh Singh says the BJP needed a fresh face to match the stature of Bihar’s two regional satraps – CM Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad. Yogi fills that vacuum.

Despite the loss of face by Nitish’s decision to stand by his scam-tainted partner Lalu Prasad, both remain undisputed leaders of their respective castes – Kurmi and Yadav.

Other observers point out that contrary to speculation about a re-alliance between the BJP and the JD(U), it is now clear that the saffron leadership is keen to decimate Nitish, who could become the rallying point for expanding the Grand Alliance from Bihar to Delhi.

Second, while Nitish has never fought an assembly election since 2004, Yogi has won elections every five years. This could generate moral pressure on the Bihar CM to face the electorate.

The BJP leadership has seemingly realised that only Hindutva could counter the social equations in caste-conscious Bihar where even Modi’s development model had failed to cut ice with the voters in 2015.

That leaves the BJP with the same formula that clicked in Uttar Pradesh – consolidate upper caste and other backward castes and scheduled castes. Political expert HV Shahi says Yogi’s deployment in Bihar will help in two ways. First,Yogi will have traction for the forward castes that somehow cannot relate to Sushil Modi. Second, Yogi will be able to reach out to the OBCs, break their hegemony that had hurt the BJP’s prospects in the assembly elections.

However, more than the political planning it is the cultural and dialectical bonding of Gorakhpur with Bihar that will play out. Yogi who heads the Gorakhnath Peeth clicks in Bihar as he seen as one of their own, embedded in the same bati-chokha and sattu culture. Besides, the craze for home-grown leaders also gets stubbed by their ‘very own’ Yogi leading the BJP campaign.

Lakhs of politically dominant Bhumihars, when facing the heat during Lalu Prasad’s first stint as chief minister had shifted their base to Gorakhpur. Many later moved out their businesses too.

Bihar leaders often campaign in UP and vice versa, so much so that film star Shatrughan Sinha had even addressed rallies in a mayoral election in Gorakhpur few years ago.

Political expert Abhay Kumar says, “A polarising figure from western UP or even home minister Rajnath Singh would not have worked for the BJP as Mahant Yogi will.”

That Yogi will lead a team of UP ministers, who will campaign for the 2019 elections, was spelt out by Sushil Modi himself when he had said, “Yogi has been deputed to Bihar as part of the nationwide programme.”

Yogi will soon visit almost every district in Bihar, before other parties hit the campaign trail by mid-2018. Already, his Hindu Yuva Vahini has spread its wings in Bihar.

Interestingly, Yogi is also targeting Nitish’s strong constituency of women voters. While addressing a rally at Darbhanga recently, he said, “My government has banned illegal slaughterhouses, launched anti-Romeo squads and started collecting opinion on triple talaq. Women feel safe in UP.” Yogi was of course challenging Nitish to spell out his stand on the issue of triple talaq.

Clearly, from all indications, it is going to be Hindutva laced with development on Yogi’s platter for Bihar."
AAP Government in Delhi completes two years: A report card,"For Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, change only on paper

East Azad Nagar was authorised four years but the area still has poor civic amenities.(Raj K Raj/HT Photo)

In street number 4 of East Azad Nagar, January was the month for hectic wedding preparations. The neighbourhood was transformed with festive music, lights and flavours. Nothing, however, could fix the perennial waterlogging in the lane.

“My daughter’s wedding was an occasion to celebrate but the water-logging caused us so much embarrassment. We stayed inside most of the time. It is what we do the rest of the year too as the lane is always water-logged,” said 65-year-old Asha (name changed), who lives here.

The 3-feet wide lane is home to a row of multiple-storey houses built on 25-yard plots. Four years back, East Azad Nagar earned the ‘legal’ tag as its layout plan was approved by the municipal corporation. However, that changed nothing on ground for the residents.

Regularisation of unauthorised colonies — one of the biggest political issues in the Capital — stems from the failure of successive governments to provide planned housing. Official estimates peg the number of unauthorised colonies in the city at 1,650, with about 50 lakh residents. East Azad Nagar was one of the 895 colonies which were regularised by then Sheila Dikshit government in 2012.

Ahead of the 2015 assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party also promised to provide registration rights with regard to property and sale deeds in resettlement colonies.

“We will provide water, sewer lines, electricity, schools and hospitals in a systematic and phased manner. Multi-pronged approach is the only way to empower unauthorised colonies, and has never been attempted by the BJP or the Congress. Within one year, these unauthorised colonies will be regularised and residents will be given ownership rights,” the AAP manifesto promised.

Soon after coming to power, the AAP government announced the decision to open registry of property in unauthorised colonies bypassing the process to be completed by the municipal corporations. The government said in 2015 that soon after it sends the boundary details to corporations, it will also allow registry of property.

However, the process is now stuck as the Union urban development ministry has asked the Delhi government to submit details of plot size and population in these colonies.

“We have received a letter from UD ministry with a list of queries. They want to know the population of every colony, size of plots, vacant plots, details of land owning agency and cost of regularisation,” said an official in the Delhi urban development department of Delhi government. Officials say it will take time to prepare the report even as lakhs of people continue to battle with the living conditions on a daily basis.

“Government should acknowledge that these colonies have come up because of the failure of those in power. The onus is on the government as they were supposed to build these houses. The government should simply try to make the living condition better in these colonies,” said Dunu Roy, director, Hazards Centre.

However, regularisation and approval of layout hasn’t meant better amenities for these colonies. East Azad Nagar, for example, has the tiniest of roads, no parking infrastructure, open overflowing drains and dangling power wires. Moreover, the structural safety of buildings in these colonies is a major cause of concern.

“Regularised or not, our problems are the same. The main road has been carpeted several times because of which the level of our lane has become lower, hence the water-logging,” said Rakesh, a resident of East Azad Nagar’s street number four.

Subhash Chandra Kohli, president of East Azad Nagar RWA, agrees that nothing has changed on ground. “Delhi government is still to include the colony in the official map of authorised Delhi colonies,” he says.

Senior officials who worked on approval of the layout plan of East Azad Nagar in 2013 say several rules, as per the Master Plan, were bypassed in the process. “The law mandates a clearly defined minimum width of streets and bylanes, space for public utilities and emergency measures. On paper, most of these were done with riders. For example, the width of the streets has been increased by marking them with dotted lines. A rider has been inserted in the statute that whenever the property owner applies for reconstruction of house, the building plan will be passed taking into account the marked line on the map,” an official said.

Officials admit that the only possible benefits of regularisation will be ownership of property and making the area eligible for basic government services. Vijay Kumar, a resident of street number 19, A-block, East Azad Nagar concurs, “The only way it helps us is that we can now sell and purchase property legally.”"
Every key budget scheme in one chart,"In the Union Budget 2017-18, most schemes have been bolstered, but some have been cut.

The Indian government classified 73 expenditure programmes as “major schemes” in its Union Budget 2017-18. On average, the government plans to spend about 8% more on these schemes this year than they did last year. But some schemes have been bolstered more than others. Some have even been cut.

For example, expenditure on the crucial Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) was increased by about 1% from last year, less than the average. Sarva Shiksa Abhiyan, another important scheme, was increased by about 4%, also less than the average.

Other key programmes, on the other hand, were increased by more than average, such as Swachh Bharat Mission: Rural (32.84%), Green Revolution (32.64%), and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna: Rural(43.75%).

Finally, some important programmes suffered budget cuts: Urban Rejuvenation Mission, which includes Smart Cities, was cut by 5.85%, while the government’s Crop Insurance Scheme saw a 32.02% cut to its budget."
Civil Aviation minister fixes take-off for Pune’s new international airport: 2021,"Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha said the proposed international airport at Purandar will take another five to six years as the land acquisition process may take time.

Sinha, who was in the city on Monday, said, while the current airport at Lohegaon will soon reach to stage to handle eight million traffic, the new airport will come by 2021.

During the lecture on ‘Its India’s turn now’, Sinha elaborated his vision of the new India while emphasizing on the frugal nature of India’s economic development and its young demographic. “India has a unique frugal development model that can be exemplary in the world. Also, we have 50 crore of young population which is also the largest in the world. These two factors give us an advantage to lead the world in innovation and economic development,” he said.

Sinha presented statistics about India’s growing economy. India’s Growth Domestic Product (GDP) is currently growing at 7% to 8%. If it is looked at in the context of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) India’s economy is worth 9.5 trillion dollars. In the next decade, it will contribute 11 trillion dollars to the world economy. According to Sinha, these statistics put India on par with many leading countries in the world including United States of America (USA) and China.

“While achieving this development rate, we are using 25% of the steel and cement of China’s total usage. We are using 78% less carbon per unit and our debt to GDP is only 135% as compared to China’s 282%. This makes India the most frugal economy in the world. We make optimum use of resources and are extremely energy efficient. This unique development model helps us stand out in the world,” explained Sinha.

He also said that the current government is bringing reforms and have left behind the feudal dynastic nature of the Nehruvian government. “We have brought in the model of minimum government and maximum governance. This model has fostered a partnership between people and government. This will lead to broader, deeper and structured reforms,” said Sinha."
ICC Champions Trophy: Virat Kohli and his art of living cricket to the fullest,"Virat Kohli’s growing stature as captain is coming to the fore with every passing day in international cricket. Unlike many Indian skippers, Kohli is enjoying the art of giving and deriving pleasure from the success of others.

India’s emphatic win against Bangladesh in the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal in Birmingham on Thursday was another example of Virat Kohli preferring to live in the shadows of a prolific partner stroking the ball with gay abandon. How nonchalantly Kohli gave up scoring what would have been his 28th ODI ton. How many international batsmen would do that?

READ | ‘Advantage India in ICC Champions Trophy final vs Pakistan’

“Well, it’s not been difficult at all. I’m really enjoying the way I’m batting. For me, the number of runs does not matter at this stage. I’m really enjoying the process, and something which is, you know, giving me joy,” said Kohli.

While the batsmen have shone for India at #CT17, @imVkohli has lauded his opening bowlers as 'outstanding'https://t.co/1WRGZaRtAy pic.twitter.com/zDgA0JoUBT — ICC (@ICC) June 16, 2017

“So I’m pretty happy getting the team across the line, honestly. It doesn’t matter if it’s three figures or two or even one. I want to apply myself in any situation possible,” the captain said when asked about his less glamorous approach.

It was perhaps poetic justice that Kohli smashed the winning four against Bangladesh. His 78-ball 96 was no less classy but Kohli let Rohit Sharma have the bigger share of the fun as Bangladesh bowlers were caught like a deer in the headlights.

READ | Virat Kohli’s ‘Tongue’-in-cheek gesture vs Bangladesh sets social media abuzz

On Thursday, Kohli became the fastest man to score 8,000 ODI runs. The 28-year-old took all of 175 innings to get to this landmark, eight fewer than South Africa’s AB de Villiers.

There are other signs of the captain’s growing stature. The 28-year-old’s communication with players is fast improving and if that means giving young Jasprit Bumrah a piece of his mind for bowling loose balls, the captain doesn’t mind being a tad more expressive.

Kohli’s respect for his ‘priceless’ predecessor MS Dhoni is there to see. Senior cricket writers can’t recall when a captain has been so forthcoming of his senior in almost every media conference.

Kohli’s revelation that Dhoni played a hand in introducing Kedar Jadhav when Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim looked inseparable, underlines the captain’s honesty.

READ | Virat Kohli continues supreme ODI form, becomes fastest to 8000 runs

When a captain makes every member of his team feel important, is smart to react to situations and positively aggressive in approach, he is bound to be a team’s delight. Kohli has most of these qualities and more importantly, remains level-headed despite his enormous success.

Not one to put the cart before the horse, Kohli accepts cricket is a funny and cruel game. He refuses to accept that India are the fancied side going into Sunday’s final.

“No one is a winner beforehand, and you can’t predict anything in this game. We’ve seen some really surprising results, and it’s been amazing for the fans to watch and for the players to be a part of, as well.

“We just want to enjoy the finals and we deserve to be there. It doesn’t matter whether we win by nine wickets or we win by one wicket. We’re just going to go there and try to do the same things again and again. Be boring as a team, and hopefully the results will come.”

Fingers crossed."

"ICC Champions Trophy: How Pakistan can tame India, the giant prize-master","For the first time in 10 years, India and Pakistan will face off in the finale of an ICC tournament. The Men in Blue haven’t had a great run in ODIs in the past two years, but their performance in the eighth edition of the Champions Trophy has brought them on the verge of becoming a record three-time winners at the Oval on Sunday.

On the other hand, Sarfraz Ahmed-led Pakistan have played their best cricket so far in the tournament and the way they outclassed hosts and hot favourites England in the semi-finals was a treat to watch.

READ | India v Pakistan, Champions Trophy final: ‘Sarfraz’s chance to create a legacy’

But on Sunday, Pakistan will be up against a team that has done exceeding well in big tournaments, especially in the last seven years. Two trophies, one final and two semi-finals is not a bad record at all.

With Virat Kohli’s team ticking almost all boxes, can the ever mercurial Pakistan defy the odds and become the fourth team to win all three ICC trophies (50-over World Cup, World T20 and the Champions Trophy)? Well, this is how they can:

Catches Win Matches - This Theory Doesn’t Change

If Pakistan had not grappled with the age-old problem of dropped catches, India wouldn’t have defeated them by a mammoth 124 runs (Duckworth-Lewis method) in their ICC Champions Trophy opener. They had a chance to restrict the defending champions to around 270 but once Yuvraj Singh and Virat Kohli got an extra life, the duo smashed close to 100 runs in the last six overs.

Had Pakistan fielders not dropped Sachin Tendulkar four times in the 2011 World Cup semifinals, the story could have been different, India going on to win the title at home. Let’s not forget Rahat Ali’s drop of Shane Watson off Wahab Riaz in the quarters of 2015 World Cup.

Even on their best days with bat and ball, Pakistan have remained poor in the field. And on their bad days they’ve got even worse.

READ | ‘It’s India’s batting vs Pakistan’s bowling in ICC Champions Trophy final’

Every side in the world has bettered its fielding standards in the past decade or so, but when it comes to Pakistan, there would be accounts of endless dropped catches.

In fact, Pakistan’s South African coach, Mickey Arthur was blunt about where the team stood in these comments made in April.

“I’ve told the players that we were playing cricket that belonged in the 20th century. We hadn’t embraced the new modern game yet, and that was for a number of reasons, like not playing at home, or [not] having the exposure to the IPL that the rest of the world has had.”

India captain Virat Kohli and Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed pose with the ICC Champions Trophy at The Oval in London on Saturday. (AP)

Come Sunday, Sarfraz’s men must grab the chances they get as one drop, in all likelihood, could make the difference between victory and defeat for them.

Pull Off A Major Surprise - In Terms Of Strategy

The 30 overs of Mohammad Amir, Junaid Khan and the tournament’s leading wicket-taker Hasan Ali will hold the key to Pakistan’s chances at The Oval. But what if India’s openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, who have plundered a total of 621 runs in four innings, are successful in continuing their rampant run? Well, the preceding statement speaks for itself.

In such a scenario, the norm of handing the ball to your best bowler might not work. The idea of having two spinners from both ends towards the start of the innings could be a good option. Shoaib Malik or Mohammad Hafeez (both off-spin) to Dhawan and Imad Wasim (left-arm orthodox) to Rohit.

READ | India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: ‘PAK has nothing to lose’

It has been established that even if Rohit-Shikhar start slowly, both possess the ability to accelerate later on. For Pakistan’s spinners, it would be about two good deliveries in the first 8-10 overs. A little bit of drift and leg before opportunities could open up. Plus, an ill-timed shot can hand opposition the advantage.

Let’s take the example of 2016 World T20 final between West Indies and England. Even though Liam Plunkett, David Willey and Ben Stokes had bowled well throughout the tournament, it took Joe Root’s special, in the second over of the West Indies chase, to get rid of openers Chris Gayle and Johnson Charles.

Even though Darren Sammy’s men won, with Carlos Brathwaite’s flurry of final over sixes off Stokes, England skipper Eoin Morgan’s tactical brilliance was one of the highlights.

Defeat India Mentally - The Most Important Of All

There are many ways to defeat your opposition mentally in sport. It could be sledging, establishing dominance, staying one step ahead of your opponent by anticipating their next move and much more. In this case, it would purely be about how Pakistan are able to break India’s rhythm.

READ | India vs Pakistan, ICC Champions Trophy Final: 5 most memorable clashes

The case in point is India’s loss against Sri Lanka. Danushka Gunathilaka and Kusal Mendis showed why sometimes the best form of defence is attack. In pursuit of 322, Sri Lanka lost Niroshan Dickwella early but that didn’t hinder the other batsmen from playing their natural game, and going after the Indian bowlers.

When Pakistan were chasing 324 at Edgbaston, their middle-order played with an intent to provide stability, which stopped the flow of boundaries and resulted in a nightmare. In Sri Lanka’s case, the plan was simple. They lost Gunathilaka and Mendis at crucial intervals, but never seemed out of control. Their shot selection was clinical and they seized the moment. Even Kohli was in awe of SL’s batting approach, and openly admitted it.

Whether India bat first or bowl, it shouldn’t matter to Pakistan. All they need to focus on is not allowing Virat Kohli’s team to settle down, even for a small period.

But if that happens, it is obvious which team will be under immense pressure."
Cannes 2017: Fatih Akin’s In the Fade is all about a mother’s terrible sorrow,"Turkish moviemaker Fatih Akin, who lives in Germany, was back at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest outing, In the Fade. His last Croisette visit was as long ago as 2007, when he brought his The Edge of Heaven to clinch the best screenplay award. A story about loneliness, desperation and a sense of hope and hopelessness, The Edge Of Heaven was a great hit in Cannes.

But unfortunately, not In the Fade. Which seems to have divided opinion. An Indian journalist, revered and reviled for his right-wing extremism, saw Akin’s work as one propagating and promoting suicide bombing. This writer did not. Nor did a French lady, who works in one of the country’s government departments. She felt that it was “a beautiful story of a German mother’s angst at having lost her six-year-old son and her Turkish husband in a Neo-Nazi attack”.

In Germany and in some other places in Europe, radical Nazi tendencies are on the rise. There was a time when one saw posters proclaiming this political ideology even in Cannes - and cities like Paris.

So, Akin’s movie - if at all it has to be read as a political comment - must be viewed as one that underlines the futility of killing. Revolving around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground (NSU) - which has been targeting immigrants, especially Muslims, In the Fade draws us into a compelling, deeply disturbing drama about a mother (played with a touch of brilliance by Diane Krugger) -- who fails to get justice in Germany’s legal system when her little son and husband of Turkish origin are killed in a blast set off by a bomb outside his shop. The culprits are a young German couple. And after the courts falter and sets the couple free, the mother seeks revenge, planting a bomb under a caravan that the two use. She also kills herself.

In the Fade is the story of a German mother who seeks revenge for the killing of her son and husband of Turkish origin.

Akin, whose parents came to Hamburg in the 1960s, says he is very angry with that notorious group which perpetrated a series of murders in Germany between 2000 and 2007. He told the media here the other day: “The NSU scandals were huge in Germany in 2011. I was very angry when I heard what happened and that anger drove me to write this. As I started writing, other layers and characters were created to make the story believable. So it’s a character-driven movie more than a revenge or political thriller. It’s more about the evolution of grief, and what happens to a mother when you take her kids away from her. How does she continue to live?

“It disturbs me to be an enemy, just because I am who I am: the son of Turkish parents with brown hair and brown eyes. Or that you live in the West, and that you could be a target simply because of where you are from. We do not defend a political ideology but somehow we are targets. The only thing I can do is strike back with a film. My movie is a strike-back.”

The film revolves around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground.

In the Fade is narrated in three chapters. The first one is all about Katja (Krugger), who marries Nuri (Numan Acar), in prison. He is serving time for a drug-related offence. But he is soon out, and the couple live a happy life with their six-year-old son. The second chapter is all about the horrific nail-bomb attack in which the father and son are killed. The third segment takes us into revenge and retribution.

Akin’s work, competing for the Palm dÓr, is well shot, neatly executed and had the ability to keep this critic glued to his seat. Intelligently conceived, Akin’s In the Fade has the same power and punch that we saw in his earlier The Cut - a bold plot about the 1915 Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people were butchered.

The question now is, as we go closer to the Palm dÓr, whether Akin’s vengeful tale will shake the Pedro Almodovar jury to give it a prize. There are of course other equally strong contenders like Redoubtable (a lovely take on Jean-Luc Godard), the American Civil War drama, The Beguiled, and Francois Ozon’s Amant Double about a torrid love affair between a psycho-analyst and his young patient.
