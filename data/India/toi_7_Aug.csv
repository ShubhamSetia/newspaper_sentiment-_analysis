GST glitches only to be expected,"The GST Council has done well to revise rates on 19 services that include job work rate on textiles and also clear rules for e-way bill to remove border checkposts. Confusion over tax rates on goods was not unexpected, given that there are over 50,000 products that have come under the new levy. But ambiguity leads to classification disputes and provides the scope for buying favourable administrative discretion. That’s wholly avoidable. The remedy is to have a clutter-free GST. Goods and services have been classified as per the harmonised system of nomenclature, a globally standardised system of names and numbers.

This is welcome as identification of goods becomes easy through specific HSN codes, and also enables exporters to claim refunds on the tax paid on inputs used to make the final product. It would raise business efficiency if all products with the same four-digit HSN code were to have the same rate of GST.

Kota stone, for example, attracts the lowest 5% GST, compared to marble that attracts the highest rate. But kota stone makers want clarity on the classification to ensure that revenue authorities do not come calling on them. Recently, the government clarified that sarees, designer or embroidered, will be treated as fabric and not garment, and hence attract the lowest GST of 5%. Differential tax rates on the same kind of product should go.

The pricier products consumed by the well-off, will bear a higher tax burden, even if the rate of tax is the same as on a cheap alternative. A clean GST will ease administrative compliance. It would be useful to start an online forum for industry, especially small and medium enterprises, to raise their grievances, throw them open for public discussion, leading to resolution.

The rates for most products will go down now that excise duties and value-added tax have been subsumed in GST. Manufacturers and retailers must ensure that they stamp new prices on their pre-GST stock, instead of levying GST on top of the old maximum retail price. Surely, there is scope to converge GST rates once the tax base widens."
Existential Threat? Artificial intelligence won’t replace all human skills,"Today a great deal of debate is taking place regarding the fast pace at which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developing and the merits and demerits of the same. People like Tesla founder Elon Musk have called for proactive rules governing the development of AI. Apart from dangerous, autonomous killer robots, there are fears that AI will displace human jobs by the billions. Already many skilled human tasks have been replaced by automated platforms. And the thing about AI is that once it is out there, the genie can’t be put back into the bottle.

So the question is not so much whether robots can replace human jobs, but should they replace human jobs. Recently, I had to do something about a broken furniture in my house. But instead of throwing the thing out, I decided to get it repaired. The carpenter who showed up was an affable fellow from Bihar. And he was quite skilled. He quickly got down to the job at hand while engaging us in pleasant conversation. And as he worked, I couldn’t help admire his craftsmanship. There’s something beautiful about human hands creating things.

This got me thinking – in a futuristic scenario, if a robot had repaired the furniture for me, I wouldn’t have had this pleasurable experience. This wasn’t just a carpenter at work; this was a man who was leaving behind a piece of his skill and knowledge, acquired through years of training, in my home. A robot or furniture made in an automated factory simply couldn’t replace this. I accept the reality that increasingly we will have more and more automated factories churning out mass-produced goods. This is something that cannot be changed. However, this doesn’t mean that human craftsmanship will end.

In fact, I believe products made by humans will be even more valuable in the future. They will have a higher premium and people will take more pride in them. Sure, AI could produce paintings akin to Picasso. But an original composition stemming from the human mind will still hold more value precisely because it is human. For, such a creation won’t stem from perfect AI data-crunching, but imperfect, unpredictable human inspiration. So yes, the development of AI will replace many human jobs. But it won’t end human creation and creativity – the latter might even get sharper. In that sense, human limitations, unpredictability and imperfections are humanity’s greatest assets as we step into an AI-driven world."
Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."

We've been hearing a lot about how feminism is important and how oppression has taken over womanhood, but people, oppression is the only thing that's not gender neutral and it has hurt men and woman equally.

Just how women don't make good engineers, men don't make good chefs. Just how women can't pursue a career in basketball, men can't pursue a career in tailoring.

This guy's poem on manning up takes us on a touching ride of bygones, that is too close to reality. He forces us to reminisce about how our fathers, brothers, and sons have been asked to man up because some things are just not for them.

The poet has put down his emotions and years of struggle in this beautiful composition. Check it out.

We don't need feminism as much as we need equality. All of us should be an egalitarian, period.

"‘Khel Ratna a big honour but 12 years late … should have got this after Athens, what I did in Rio was nothing new’","Devendra Jhajharia, winner of two Paralympic gold medals (at Athens 2004 and Rio 2016) and holder of the world record in the men’s javelin throw F46 category, is the first para-athlete to be awarded India’s highest sporting honour: the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award. Jhajharia, who also won The Times of India Sports Award 2016, spoke to Jamie Alter about his career and what the award means for Indian para-athletes:

Last year you were on the panel to pick the Khel Ratna. Now you are a Khel Ratna. How does it feel?

I’m very happy. But to be honest, I feel I should have got this award in 2004-05 after I returned home from Athens with my first Paralympic gold medal, which was for a world record. This achievement stood in my absence from the Paralympic stage from 2004 to 2016 [the F46 category was not part of the Games in 2008 and 2012], so today I see it as a reward which has come 12 years late. Its a big honour, no doubt, and to be the first differently-abled athlete to be named for the Khel Ratna makes me feel very happy.

Do you feel you’ve received the respect and recognition that is due to an athlete of your stature?

Yes, I do. In 2004 no one knew me. I was a new entrant. I was young, naive. In 2016, however, people knew who I was. In Rio, at the athletes’ village, when I would enter for lunch and dinner, many world athletes who say ‘that is the Indian who is the world record holder”. That felt good. Also, I was the Indian team flag bearer, and PM Modi had spoken so kindly about us before we left the country. Kahin na kahin aap ke andar ek responsibility si jaag jaati hai, ki bas ab kuch aur karna hai desh ke liye. Holding the Indian flag in Rio was a different feeling altogether.

Has the perception of para-athletes changed post the rich haul of medals from Rio last year?

Yes, definitely. The government has recognised us in a very different way, we have been felicitated and honoured. We are recognised now. I would like to thank the media for covering us after the Rio Paralympics, but I urge you all to not stop after the Games. Look beyond that at the national level and state level, and cover what our para-athletes are doing at home and not just overseas.

What are your views on the state of para-athletics in India?

It has improved significantly, from where it was in 2004. A sea change, in fact. When I went to Athens it was very different to how we went to Rio last year. There was so much support for us, and Prime Minister Modi mentioned us on his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme. To hear him say that so much has changed in 12 years, but that Devendra has remained the same, that he has not changed or wavered in focus, was inspiring.

But a lot of work is needed, from the school level upwards. We need special training sessions and facilities. The infrastructure in India has to change. By change, I mean that the best para-athletes in the world should want to come here and train. We need former players to help promote para-athletics. We need more clinics, schemes and academies. We need to include a lot more youth. Work is on, I know it. The government has taken a much bigger interest.

There should be more special academies … javelin specific academies, for example. And kids need to be brought there and trained and given the freedom to express themselves. To win an Olympic medal you have to be special. And special talent needs special nurturing.

Can you elaborate on what needs to be done to improve the standard?

See, while the support from the government is obviously massive, I feel there needs to be more done at the state level. For example, we need more grounds for para-athletes. We face a lot of wheelchair problems at venues. Access is not always easy. There has been good work done so far, but more needs to happen to support para-athletes and make things simple. Most of this has to come from the state government, because they responsible for infrastructure. Start locally. Bring differently-abled people to the ground, make it easier for them to get there. Only then can their interest build.

Some states are better equipped than others and are doing well to support us. Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi, mainly. There are special jobs created, cash awards given, schemes created for para-athletes. All that is good, but it is very important for para-athletes to come to Delhi. I cannot stress enough on how important that is. When I started out, getting to Delhi was tough. It should not be tough today.

Are you satisfied with the support of the government and the Sports Authority of India?

Yes. I have benefited hugely from the TOP (Target Olympic Podium) scheme. From this, I was able to travel overseas, I was given access to better training at home and abroad, I got a personal trainer, learned more about dietary planning. My entire planning for Rio was enhanced because of the TOP scheme. I am grateful to the government for that.

Is there a disproportion between funding which Olympians and Paralympians receive from the TOP scheme?

Not that I have seen. I have nothing to complain about.

Is there para-athletic talent coming through?

I think there is plenty of potential, if the youth is encouraged and supported. Look at Mariyappan Thangavelu, who created history by winning gold in the high jump in Rio. He is 22, a long-term prospect. There’s something different about him. There’s a fire burning inside him. He doesn’t know anything else about from his sport. We cannot lose a talent like that. I hope the system supports such athletes.

In those early years, primarily leading up to 2004, how did you raise funding? Who helped you?

Dekhiye, ek junoon sa tha khud mein. I had a goal. I wanted to chase excellence. But I was from a humble farming background. My father was a farmer, but in Rajasthan there are not many returns for a farmer. It was tough to gather funding. I got a little bit of state support, and the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) helped too. Others helped out, but overall it was not easy. I used what little savings I had too. That time was very different, right from the media to the government. There was no social media either. Bilkul alag maahaul tha. How I got to Athens, and how I performed, only I know. It was extremely uplifting to win my first gold back then.

The category in which you won gold in 2004 (F46) was not part of the 2008 and 2012 Paralympics. Did that ever deter you from pursuing it?

Absolutely, yes. It was a very difficult time for me, from a sporting perspective. It is like preparing yourself for a big exam and then seeing that no one is ready to let you take that exam. To keep training so hard and then seeing that you’re not getting a chance to go to the Olympics left me considering whether it was worth pursuing sport. I did contemplate giving it all up. In 2010, preparations were on for the 2012 London Paralympics when it was announced which events were to be included. When I saw that my name was not there, because the F46 was not included for the second Games in a row, I was stunned.

This was the same time as when your wife Manju gave up playing kabaddi so you could pursue throwing the javelin?

Yes. I owe her everything. We sat down as a couple and talked it over. She told me she wanted to do everything she possibly could to keep my sporting career alive. “You chase your dream, you do well in sports, you make your name. My sport is not an Olympic one. You have so much ability,” she told me. I asked her what good my capability was when my event was not part of the Paralympics, after I had set a world record in Athens.

She told me forget about 2012, it will return in 2016. My response to her was that I cannot look that far ahead, and once again she told me to be positive and that’s when she told me that she would help me. She was a state level kabaddi player, and gave it up because only one of us could have pursue a career in sports. Along the way, we had a daughter too, so she had to raise her.

When I found out that my event was listed for the 2013 IPL Athletics World Championships, I immediately began training. My wife just said to not look back, only focus on getting ready for 2013. So I gave it my all and the result was a gold medal. When you consider all this, it was indeed a very long wait for Rio 2016.

And then, at 35, you broke the record you had set as a 23-year-old. Was that a prouder feeling?

Definitely. To do so at that age, and after that long absence from the international stage, was extremely satisfying. It was justification of all my hard work, of my wife’s sacrifice, of my coach’s conviction. I showed that nothing is impossible.

What was your training like for the Rio Paralympics? How do you stay so fit?

It all hard work and focus. I just immersed myself in training. Three hours at a stretch, sometimes four. I didn’t see what time it was, it was just about getting up and heading to the ground, giving my best. I had a strict schedule which my coach Sunil Tanwarji chalked out. No phones were allowed. Once, after the practice ground closed, I asked him what time it was. He said it was 8pm and that we should have go have dinner. I asked where, and he said in his hotel room, just as we were, with our kit bags, so that I didn’t waste time in the morning getting from where I was staying to the ground. Sabar ka phal meetha zaroor hota hai, magar uske liye bahut mehnat karni padti hai.

There is no official word yet on whether the F46 will be included at the 2020 Tokyo Games. You will be 39 then, but age is no bar for you, is it?

Not at all. Its all in the head. Its about fighting from your mind. Age didn’t get in my way when I was training for Rio, and having won a second gold medal at the age of 35, I am even more determined to win one at 39."
Sell Air India for one rupee: Right now it’s a giant black hole relentlessly sucking in taxpayer money,"Recently the Cabinet gave in-principle approval to sell Air India. It is an oft-repeated idea, but this time the resolve seems to be stronger. Government will really be doing our country a huge favour if it gets rid of this company, which is a giant black hole relentlessly sucking in taxpayer money.

As an ex-distressed banker, i can say this: some companies can be rescued from the hole they have dug themselves in. Others have dug it so deep, they can never, ever get out. Air India is in the latter category. There is no point saying, “But last time i flew, the service was good.” It’s irrelevant. The hard truth is this: the company is a dud. Sorry.

Here’s the math, as an example. Imagine your neighbour has a drinking problem because of which he racks up loans of over Rs 5 crore. But instead of earning money and paying back the loans, he continues to borrow even more and spends another Rs 70 lakh a year on his addiction. Over the decades you have rescued him several times. However, he refuses to change. Now the loans are too big. Even if he did try his best, he can’t make more than a couple of lakhs a year. Hence he can never repay his debts.

To understand Air India, multiply the numbers in the example above by 10,000. It has over Rs 50,000 crore of debt and is cashflow negative, reportedly by over Rs 7,000 crore a year – the numbers could be worse, as the company hasn’t released recent data and CAG has raised issues even about the data it has released.

Even in the best of scenarios, Air India can’t earn enough to repay its debt. So no new buyer can buy it as-is, with its mountain of debt. For there is no scope to repay it. Financially, right now Air India is the worst corporate in the country.

There’s no point in casting blame. When sins have been done over decades, no one person or set of persons is to blame. One does feel bad for the 20,000 plus employees, who may even be working hard at running the company day to day.

But the black hole is going to remain just that, and the taxpayer is paying for it. Air India’s annual cashflow loss is equal to what Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher owes banks. Air India costs us one Mallya a year, money that can be used to build hundreds of hospitals and schools.

Many lame arguments are given to not sell Air India. These include arguing that it is the flag carrier. Well, many countries no longer have flag carriers (including America). In other cases they don’t cost government so much. Flag carrier pride for a passenger airline is stupid. Air India is not the Indian Air Force.

Air India’s role in rescue efforts is also tom-tommed. Well, it beats all logic to keep such an expensive operation on standby for occasional rescues. It’s better the Centre gives money to private airlines in an emergency. Do we really think if there is a rare, genuine calamity, and government wants to pay to hire a plane, IndiGo and SpiceJet are going to refuse? And isn’t this far more efficient than burning Rs 7,000 crore a year?

These two noble arguments to keep Air India alive as-is hide the real reason. It is the neta’s and babu’s club in the sky. Politicians and bureaucrats, along with their families, friends and neighbours, all abuse Air India to get free upgrades and slavish service from the staff. Getting Air India off the government’s hands will end these VVIP joys.

Even if we want to pamper netas and babus, there are cheaper ways. Paying them money to fly business, or even first class, in private airlines will be cheaper than keeping the Air India monster alive. Government can buy upgrade vouchers for its senior functionaries.

So how does one sell Air India? Its assets, office infrastructure, running operation and landing rights have some value – though well below its debt. Government should give it to the highest bidder amongst various private players. Of course the bid is unlikely to pay off the entire debt, so the winning bidder will probably be someone who wants the least discount on the loan.

Employees may be retained or retrenched, something the new buyer will decide. But a decent retrenchment package (say three years’ salary) for the entire staff would cost around Rs 9,000 crore (given a salary bill of Rs 3,000 crore a year). The new buyers will take that into account in their bid.

Even in the best case, government will have to give a discount on the loan. It may even have to give the company to the new buyer for one rupee. The process will not make government any money. But it will get rid of a part of the loan and all of the cash burning enterprise. To that extent, this entire exercise is not so much a sale of Air India as good riddance. This is something we need to understand going into the sale, so we don’t have unrealistic expectations from it.

Beware opposing voices that will complain after the sale, “We sold Air India for nothing.” Tell them, we didn’t sell it, we got rid of it, and that has saved us a lot of money every year.

Let’s all keep up the pressure to ensure that the Modi government sells Air India. We will be doing the country’s finances a big favour."
Justin Gatlin's Tribute To Usain Bolt After Beating Him Is The Finest Example Of Sportsmanship,"The race is about to start. Usain Bolt is raring to go for one last time. He gets off to a slow start, then begins to accelerate by the 50th metre. But the swansong wasn't meant to be a golden one. Close on his heels was Justin Gatlin, who had plans to beat his old rival on the big stage. He, after all, wanted to preserve his best for the last. And he did.

AFP

By the 80th metre, Bolt knew he had lost it as he was a close third to the second sprinter Christian Coleman, another American. The race ends, and Gatlin emerges winner. Second spot belongs to Coleman. And Bolt, perhaps the greatest athlete in track and field games, was forced to embrace bronze. Bolt from the blue?

AFP

As Gatlin celebrated his victory, he knew there wouldn't be another race where Bolt would threaten to sprint past him. He now knew the tracks belong to him. And he now doesn't have to strategize against Bolt.

The rivalry has now ended and Gatlin did something that'd remain etched in Bolt's memory for years to come. He bowed in front of him out of sheer respect and love for his long-time rival. There clearly couldn't have been a better swansong for Bolt. Gatlin did what he could do best - win the race and win hearts across the globe.

AFP

Now Bolt fans have another admirer - It's Justin Gatlin. There's no denying that people booed him. But then realisations happen every now and then."
Movement in the mountains: Gorkhaland agitation is marked by a new sense of urgency. Someone will have to take note,"Sometime in the late ’80s, three boys barely in their teens headed towards a gushing mountain stream that goes by the name of Dhobikhola just outside Kurseong, an unassuming town overshadowed by the glamorous beauty of Darjeeling to its north and the pivotal importance of Siliguri to its south. The fog had lifted in the morning and there was promise that the sun would be out. Tiny ponds used to form in the crevices of kholas then – all dried up now – and young men would clamber up the slippery rocks to take a dip in the cold, clear pools.

The boys, on a break from school, had packed sandwiches and tea in a flask. They were excited about their little excursion. Suddenly a vehicle with CRPF jawans screeched to a halt in front of them and all three were bundled in. An officer asked for information on local leaders active during the agitation for a separate state of Gorkhaland that had erupted with Subhash Ghisingh in 1986. The jawans were cursing and hitting the boys.

One of the kids remembered advice he had been given by elders: if you are caught by CRPF, speak in English. “Sir,” he said in English, “I go to school and live in a hostel. My father is with the SBI. These are my friends and we don’t know the people you are talking about.” The beatings stopped and the officer asked if the statement could be verified. Then he said something that both terrified and relieved the boys. “Run home, don’t turn back. If you do, you will be shot.”

The boys ran and ran, like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. But unlike in the movie, the shackles never really came off. They don’t, if you belong to any of the communities on India’s margins. However hard one tries to integrate, osmosis remains difficult in a country that thwarts its own people.

It is that, apart from a sense of other injustices, which is fuelling the agitation for Gorkhaland this time in the hills of Darjeeling. If there is a difference in the nature of protests from those in the 1980s, it is that hundreds of thousands of young men and women have travelled out of the region in the past decades – some have returned, many have not – and all of them have grown up to ask one question: where do we belong? Where is home?

It is not the Darjeeling of Bengal, where they feel discriminated against, where at the best of times they are left to fend for themselves. The inquiry has become urgent – and articulate – with the new generation not content anymore just to join the army and unquestioningly serve a nation that doesn’t seem to care for or notice them.

The Gorkha, call him Nepalese if you will, has gone beyond the condescending stereotype that has forever defined him. He is a software engineer in Bangalore now, an actor in Mumbai, doctor in Delhi, fashion designer in New York and writer in London. And he’s had enough of it. Today he wants his space in the sun, he demands recognition.

There is another crucial change in the passionate voices coming from the hills. They no more belong to the leaders. The movement has passed into the hands of students, housewives, professionals, senior citizens.

In street meetings and town rallies, warnings openly go out from the public to local legislators and administrators. This time, you will not cheat us or mislead us, they say. You will not make contracts behind our back. In fact, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader Bimal Gurung, who snatched the baton from Ghisingh, has begun to look marginalised.

Though it was Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who lit the fire when she said Bengali would be compulsory even in the schools of Darjeeling where a majority speak Nepali – language, she should have known, is an intrinsic part of identity – and Gurung, battling shrinking political space and anti-incumbency, stoked it, the latest round of calls for a Gorkha homeland has taken a life of its own. It hasn’t mattered that BJP, which sent SS Ahluwalia to Parliament from Darjeeling with support from the Morcha, has turned its back on the people, looking as it does to make inroads into Bengal.

The party knows that its endorsement of Gorkhaland may backfire during the next elections, what with Mamata reiterating that she will not allow a division of her beloved state, however far the hills might be from Kolkata – ethnically, culturally, linguistically.

The indefinite bandh in Darjeeling is now its longest ever at 47 days and shows no sign of ending. Smartphone in hand and talking to a diaspora that has spread to every corner of India and the globe, never before has there been such communication of resolve, commitment to cause.

Solidarity videos are being streamed from Hong Kong and Manchester, marches are out in Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and all the 15 million estimated Indian Gorkhas seem to be sharing a common anguish, a hope that the shackles may finally be coming loose, a conviction that Gorkhaland is an idea whose time has come."
The Congress government’s cynical and seditious ways exposed by the media,"I was stunned to hear the narco confessions of Safdar Nagori- a SIMI mastermind on the Pakistani conspiracy behind the blasts on the Samjhauta Express. The fact that it was not only kept under wraps all these years but also totally ignored by the Congress Government, amounts to treason.

Why would the Congress coin Saffron Terror and play up a Hindu terror angle when all the facts showed that Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hafiz Saeed were behind the train blasts in February 2007, that killed 66 people and injured several others? The National Investigation Agency caught Pakistanis in India who were involved in the attacks but the Congress Government had them released! The First Investigating Officer Gurdeep Singh assigned to the case said that a Pakistani citizen Ajmat Ali was identified by eye witnesses as a possible planter of the bomb. The arrested Pakistani’s also had fake passports. He claimed that he was pressured by senior officers to drop this line of questioning.

Dr Subramaniam Swamy said it was a case of, “betrayal of the nation of the highest order.”

Why would a government elected by the Indian people want to hand India on a platter to Pakistan with this kind of treacherous and vindictive lie? Why would Sonia Gandhi allow this or perhaps encourage it?

Now every time we ask Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack to justice, they say what about the Samjauta express terror? Where are those perpetrators? How can we tell them they were Pakistani and we let them go? Why would they believe us when the previous government handed them the fiction of a Hindu terror attack?

To make matters even worse Rahul Gandhi told the American Ambassador that Hindu terror was more dangerous for India then the LeT? Where was the proof of this? And why was he trying to compromise India? Was he primed by his mother and Chidambaram?

The Americans knew of Pakistan’s role in the Samjauta terror. Their treasury department attached the accounts of four Pakistani’s who they claimed had a role in this attack.

Yet, The Congress government went on a witch hunt after Indians. Why?

It almost seems that the Congress was trying to appease Pakistan at the expense of India. And one has to wonder what the motives were and what the incentives.

Home Minister Chidambaram did this again with the Ishrat Jahan case where Pakistanis sent to kill Narendra Modi the CM of Gujarat, were given a clean chit and instead the police were sent to jail for what was termed as an encounter killing.

It really is mind blowing. And we, the citizens of India want to know.

Then in an interview on Pakistani television, Mani Shankar Aiyer asked the Pakistani’s to help get rid of a sitting Indian PM. Would any country in the world condone this? Would they not have tried such people for sedition?

Where was the “Tolerance Brigade” in all of this. Why did they not march against such obvious treason? Are they also bought by Pakistan?

Perhaps the worst thing the Congress allowed was the Hurriyat to dictate terms to them. Geelani and others were given crores both by Pakistan and India in a cynical and dangerous game against the Kashmiri people. Pakistan gave them money to create mayhem in the valley and India to stop it.

Now we have the separatists under scrutiny and hopefully they will be in jail soon. But for decades this completely immoral lot was blackmailing the Indian state and was allowed to do so. We should have said that that anyone who wants to separate from India has no business to be here. Instead they got Z Security, the best health treatment, and were allowed to meet the Pakistani High Commissioner to get packets of money to pay young Kashmiri boys to throw rocks at peace keepers.

Thus, a greedy destructive monster was created that sent their own children to safety and played with the lives of Kashmiri children. Their avarice was limitless and it is rumoured they have homes in Delhi and abroad and their children are doctors and executives.

They are well armed and have the incentive. Throw in religion and victimhood and you get a deadly combustible mix. I was not sorry to hear the Hizbul Mujahideen suddenly declaring that they would behead the Separatists as now they wanted an Islamic State and not Azadi! I would have loved to see the expression on their faces especially if the Indian Government had withdrawn the security they did not deserve. The sooner they are sent to a jail in the Andamans the better."
"Chris Pratt & Anna Faris Separate After 8 Years, Internet Declares It Has Lost Faith In Love","What’s the definition of love? For several people, it revolved around Chris Pratt and Anna Faris. People idolised the couple and couldn’t stop gushing over how head over heals they were in love with each other.

Twitter

But, it came as a shocker and broke several hearts when they announced about their separation on Facebook. In a joint statement, the couple wrote in an FB post:

“Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.”

And people all over the world are losing it; they have lost faith in love. It has just gotten tough to digest this fact.

Haryana stalking case: cracks appear in BJP’s defence of Subhash Barala,"The Haryana administration and top BJP leadership has maintained a studied silence over the alleged stalking case that has hogged headlines in mainstream media. The incident involves Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son – Vikas and his friend – accused of stalking a girl in Chandigarh at midnight on Friday. Though the police did arrest the duo but they were released on bail and opposition has been crying foul over the government for inaction. At a time when the entire BJP top brass had been blatantly defending senior Barala, one leader from their flock has complicated matters by asking for his resignation. The leader is none other than BJP MP from Kurukshetra, Rajkumar Saini.

It would be naïve to assume Saini is driven by probity in public life when he has raised the demand for Barala’s resignation as BJP state chief. This is the same leader whose animosity towards the dominant Jat community is well-known in the state. The main Jat organisation that had launched an agitation for reservation in the state – All India Jat Aarakashan Sangharash Samiti (AIJASS) – too had blamed Saini for making provocative statements to disturb communal harmony in the past.

How do you expect Khattar to sack Haryana BJP Chief for son's stalking when his big bosses were themselves stalking!https://t.co/U5x6Uifffk — Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1) August 6, 2017

Barala belongs to the Jat community and even though he was a first time MLA, he was appointed state BJP chief. This happened after Ram Bilas Sharma was elevated as a senior cabinet minister in the Manohar Lal Khattar government in 2014. Barala had defeated Congress heavyweight Paramvir Singh Tohana from Fatehabad assembly constituency despite INLD’s strong presence in the region. Barala being given the top party position in the state was done to appease the Jat community which was upset over Khattar (non-Jat) being appointed as chief minister.

Saini has cited the example of Venod Sharma being forced to resign as state power minister (part of Bhupender Singh Hooda government) on moral grounds after his son, Manu Sharma’s name, came up in the Jessica Lal murder case. So far BJP has stood united behind Barala. But Saini may have just provided the chink in the ruling party’s armour."
"Vijender Singh Proves He's A True Champion, Wants To Return Zulpikar's Title For Indo-China Ties","Vijender Singh is a true blue sportsman. That's not because he's won the ninth bout of his career, beating China's Zulpikar Maimaitiali. But because he has offered to return the WBO Oriental Super Middleweight title to Maimaitiali. He's said that in an effort to maintain peace at the Indo-China border.

Soon after winning the title, he said, ""I don't want this title. I want to give it back to Zulpikar. I want to dedicate this win to India-China friendship. There is some tension at the border, need peace.""

AFP

For a sportsman, returning a hard-earned title is not easy. But Vijender is attempting to do that for peace at India's border. Which by all means shows the passion he has for the country.

Vijender won the 10-round bout with considerable ease. He won it 96-93 95-94 95-94 and maintain his unbeaten streak in professional boxing.

AFP

Vijender was quite confident before entering the bout against Maimaitiali. Taking a potshot at his Chinese counterpart, he had said that Chinese things don't last long. And in the bout, things looked relatively easy because his height served as an advantage. He could easily ward Maimaitiali off. Zulpikar couldn't deal with his counter attack due to his lack of height.

AFP

Vijender is already dreaming of becoming world champion. In an interview after the fight, he said, ""Just pray for me, one day I will be a world champion. I would like to thank everyone who came for this fight. It was great to see you all.""

Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."
"As NASA's Mission Voyager-2 Enters Its 40th Year, Indian Classical Music Still Resonates In Space","Forty years on and 11 billion miles from earth in the huge vastness of space there is the sound of India. And how did this happen? As Nasa's ground-breaking Voyager-2 mission enters its 40th year this month, not many are aware that the spacecraft is carrying a golden record with different sounds of earth and international music and one of them are from India.

AFP/Representational Image

Voyager-2 was launched on August 20, 1977, and is the first spacecraft to have flown by all the four outer planets--Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter and Neptune. The music of India is a Hindustani classical composition called ""Jaat Kahan Ho"", rendered by Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar, a noted khayal singer of the second half of the 20th century.

The recording, which lasts for three minutes and 25 seconds, forms part of the 12-inch gold-plated copper disc carried by Voyager-2. Its twin, Voyager-1, launched on September 5, 1977, also carries a similar disc.

Reuters

The Indian music was chosen by a Nasa-appointed committee chaired by Carl Sagan. In the book ""Murmurs Of Earth - The Voyager Interstellar Record"", published in 1978, Ann Druyan, Sagan's wife, recalls that Robert Brown, then executive director for the Centre For World Music in Berkeley placed ""Jaat Kahan Ho"" at the top of his list of world music for outer space.

After a great deal of effort, Druyan finally located the record at a shop in New York.

Brown has stated: ""If I could extend the list, it would include the following: a lively mridangam solo from India in a tala of five beats played by Palghat Mani Iyer who may well be the world's best drummer ...""

AFP

Timothy Ferris, who served as a producer of the Voyager Golden Record, says Kesarbai, who was born in 1893 in Goa, was awarded the title of 'Surshri' in 1938 by Rabindranath Tagore on behalf of the residents of Kolkata.

""One of my favourite transitions on the Voyager record comes when 'Flowing Stream' ends and we are transported, quick as a curtsy, across the Himalayas to the north of India and from the sound of one musical genius, Kuan Ping-hu to another, Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar,"" Ferris says. ""The raga heard on Voyager is formally designated for morning performance, but its popularity has led to its use as a closing number, a kind of encore, for concerts day and night.""

He writes that Kesarbai made this recording when she was past 70. Apart from the music, the record also carries a message in Hindi which when translated means: ""We are citizens of earth: We are greeting you."" The other Indian languages represented in the record are Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Oriya, Telugu and Urdu.

Shankersinh Vaghela becomes kingmaker in crucial Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat,"With less than 24 hours to go before the crucial Rajya Sabha election for three seats in Gujarat, clouds of uncertainty still hang over senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s possible entry into the Upper House for a fifth time. The main person responsible for this is veteran leader and former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela who recently quit Congress. This led to a spate of resignations and defections which has left Congress floundering to a mere 44 MLAs with the Patel camp from the 57 it had few weeks ago.

Six Congress MLAs have already resigned while another six were not a part of the group that was shepherded to Bengaluru by the Patel camp. Congress needs 45 MLAs to win a lone RS seat but they stand on a very sticky wicket as of now. They claim support of two NCP, one JD(U), and GPP MLAs which pushes their number to a comfortable 48 votes. The problem is that these MLAs have been giving conflicting signals. This includes NCP as well despite their chief Sharad Pawar saying the party will stand by Congress in this hour of need.

Gujarat RS polls: As stakes rise for Ahmed Patel, Vaghela keeps mum https://t.co/Y8GljnFPRw pic.twitter.com/Nbkzs7Fivi — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 7, 2017

The wily Vaghela is not willing to commit which way he is headed, maintaining he is in touch with Patel and still shares cordial relations with him. BJP has fielded party president Amit Shah, textile minister Smriti Irani and Congress rebel Balwantsinh Rajput, who is also Vaghela’s relative in the RS polls. Vaghela has smartly countered the argument about his closeness with Rajput saying the rebel candidate and Patel have known each other for many years before he and Rajput became relatives.

By keeping the suspense alive over which way he and six rebel Congress MLAs him will vote, Vaghela has managed to keep the ball in his court till the very end. Irrespective of the outcome between Patel and Rajput on Tuesday, Vaghela finds himself in a unique position where he can claim credit for either side winning this battle of prestige in Gujarat."

11 Monsoon Hacks That'll Help You Enjoy Your Favourite Season To The Fullest,"Monsoons are cozy when you’re ‘chilling’ at home with a cup of coffee while watching it pour from your window. However, it can be very pesky if you’ve to step out when it’s pouring cats and dog and when you’re drenched.

To make life easier during monsoons, here are some easy hacks you can follow.

1. If your phone gets wet in the rains

YouTube

Despite guarding your phone more than your life, the raindrops somehow end up on your phone’s screen. The rainwater can cause nuisance by entering your phone and make it stop from functioning. To get your phone back to life, clean the phone with a dry cloth and then simply place it in a can of rice. The rice would absorb moisture from the phone and your handset would surely start functioning again.

2. To avoid falling sick

healthy food house

You can fall sick quite easily during this weather. To keep your immunity intact, keep sipping a cup of lime water with honey and ginger in it.

3. To ward off flies

thespruce

Pesky flies can really irritate you. To ward them off, cut a lemon in two and keep it on the window and put it on the door and on the windows. Cloves too can keep the flies away.

4. To keep your closets moisture-free

sitesatpennstate

If your cupboard becomes damp due to the rainwater, then put cloves and few naphthalene balls in the closet. Your closet would get dry again.

5. To keep your furniture dry

Wood can easily fall prey to termites during monsoon. To keep them away, polish the furniture with un-perfumed hair oil. This will prevent the furniture from getting damp and catching termites.

6. To dry off shoes easily

shared

If you’re too particular about your shoes getting dirty in rain water, then rub a wax candle on them and then step outside in the rain. You must also carry paper towels to wipe the dunk off your shoes, in case you’re in a hurry for a presentation.

7. To dry off your clothes

inside

Drying off clothes is a huge problem during monsoon as the dampness in the air doesn’t dry out the clothes. You will have to put up a clothesline inside your room, preferably where there is a fan and then switch it on, on high speed and then watch them dry.

8. Have you heard of portable socks dryer?

dornob

You will need this.

9. To de-frizz your hair

independent

Your hair could become quite frizzy during the monsoons. To de-frizz them, use a hand cream to de-frizz your hair. Take a blob of cream on your palm and just run them through your hair.

10. To fix your face

nyx

The rains can make your face blotchy, which can make your makeup vanish in thin-air. To avoid that, use a blotting paper to blot moisture from your face.

11. To stop smelling as a wet dog

You cannot go for drinks post work, if you’re all wet and smell like a wet dog. To get rid of that pooch smell, spritz some vodka on your outfit as it would act as a neutraliser and would neutralise the smell."
"Agra’s Mala Devi was no braid-chopping witch, just a soft target","Women across North India are having way too many bad hair days these days. This has been going on for over two months with over a hundred cases reported from villages in Rajasthan, UP, Delhi, Haryana. Mysterious forces are at work in places like Agra, Bikaner, Jaipur, Kanpur, Bareilly, Aligarh, Meerut, to name just a few, chopping off the lustrous locks of unsuspecting young ladies in deep slumber. What a story, Sirji! We could have had a good laugh and forgotten all about it, but for the tragic consequences. Like the case of Mala Devi, a 60-year-old woman with weak eyesight, who was lynched in Agra, after she lost her way late at night. The incident took place when she was returning home, after relieving herself in the fields close by at 3.45am. The poor woman landed up in a neighbour’s hut, instead of her own. What followed is shocking. Two men pounced on her with rods and sticks, suspecting her of being a braid-chopping witch. They later told the police they were defending the locks of their womenfolk, sleeping inside the hut. The women said they were sure Mala Devi was a ghost. Well, this is the first time we are hearing about a ‘ghost’ getting caught, then attacked and beaten.

Witches, of course, are soft targets. Any woman who doesn’t play by society’s rules can be branded a witch and killed. But here was Mala Devi, a neighbour, a senior citizen with a weak bladder and weaker eyes, who needed to urinate every two or three hours. Normally, she returned to her own hut within 15 minutes. This time, her five sons were woken up by villagers after an hour or so, and informed their mother was lying unconscious, with a swollen face and eye injuries. The police were summoned and Mala Devi named Sonu and Manish as the two who had mercilessly beaten her, instead of alerting her sons and escorting her back to her home. Later, Mala Devi was taken to the district hospital 30km from the police station on — hold your breath — a motorcycle! In her precarious condition — just imagine. She died of cardiac arrest soon after doctors discharged her. Mala Devi, a widow who had lost her husband six years ago, was a Dalit.

By then, the ‘braid-chopping’ stories were flying across northern India, with young girls posing with their lopped locks. It’s entirely possible the girls had taken scissors to hair themselves. Maybe they wanted a Bollywood cut, and their parents weren’t agreeing. Maybe, they were victims of mass hysteria. Or perhaps, they wanted their pictures in the papers. TV channels, as always, were the biggest culprits, playing up this absurd story, and ‘braid chopping’ became the new dengue — a killer epidemic.

Mala Devi was not a ‘braid chopper’. But she paid for these crazy rumours with her life. Her death has once again highlighted the abysmal sanitation conditions in our villages. Agra, the pride of India, host city of the Taj Mahal which is a World Heritage site, is filthy beyond description. Mala Devi’s village is a mere 19km east of the main city. Her village has no latrines. We talk of the tremendous strides made by the Swachh Bharat campaign. We sign on mega stars as brand ambassadors. CMs pose with brooms. Schools and colleges conduct cleanliness workshops. But just 19km from Agra city, in the village of Mutnai, two able-bodied young men attacked a 60-year-old woman with sticks and rods, ignoring her pleas to drop her home and spare her as her eyesight was poor and she had lost her way. Look at the number of subtexts in this single story: no latrines for women, no access to an eye doctor, no convenient transport to the nearest hospital, no required treatment available, no action taken so far against the assaulters. “Mala Devi died of cardiac arrest,” states the official report. Yes, she did. And didn’t. She died because of the shock she suffered at the hands of her neighbours. She died because of rumour-mongering in the region. She died because she was wrongly accused of being a ‘braid-chopper’. She died because she could not control her bladder. She died because the government simply does not care. The Mala Devis in India can live and die in conditions worse than hell. Nobody gives a damn.

Bona fide, scissors-carrying braid-choppers, beware. You may be next on the hit list. Hang on to your precious locks, young ladies. There are ghosts and witches all around you. And if you really want to resemble your favourite Bollywood actress, wait till you get to a haircutting salon in a city nearest you. Or else, more Mala Devis may lose their lives proving they are just vulnerable women trying to locate a secluded spot to relieve themselves in the dead of the night."

Heavy To Moderate Drinkers Are More Likely To Live Till The Age Of 85 Without Dementia Or Other Cognitive Impairments,"For all those struggling to fight their own case against their doctor or family members to lift the restrictions on their consumption of alcohol on a daily basis; here’s some good news that can help your cause.

maxim.com

A landmark 30-year study conducted by the University of California, San Diego concluded moderate-to-heavy drinkers are more likely to live till the age of 85 without Dementia or other cognitive impairments. More specifically drinkers were twice as likely to remain cognitively healthier than non-drinkers!

informe21.com

What does moderate or heavy drinking mean for gender and age-specific guidelines?

Moderate drinking involves drinking up to one alcoholic beverage a day for women of any age and men aged 65 or above, and up to two drinks a day for adult men under age 65. Heavy drinking is defined as having up to three alcoholic beverages per day for women of any adult age and men aged 65 or older, and up to four drinks a day for adult men under 65.

Drinking more than this is categorized as excessive and is not advisable!

portal.abczdrowie

Although this is not the first study to find a correlation between moderate alcohol intake and longevity it is one of the most conclusive ones till date!

""This study is unique because we considered men and women's cognitive health at late age and found that alcohol consumption is not only associated with reduced mortality, but with greater chances of remaining cognitively healthy into older age,"" said senior author Linda McEvoy, PhD, an associate professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

sciencedaily.com

""It is important to point out that there were very few individuals in our study who drank to excess, so our study does not show how excessive or binge-type drinking may affect longevity and cognitive health in ageing,"" adds McEvoy.

The study also doesn’t suggest that drinking is responsible for an increase in longevity and cognitive health."

This Streaker On The Track Hogged The Limelight At IAAF World Championships,"Do you think Usain Bolt hogged the limelight at the World Championships for running his swansong race? Or Justin Gatlin for winning the 100 mts sprint?

This streaker grabbed eyeballs around the world. This happened before Usain Bolt's race kicked off. The man, long-haired and remotely middle-aged, had 'Peace' and 'Love' written on his chest. And on his back was written 'Drug Free'.

The man was eventually caught by the guards and couldn't complete the race he attempted to run. Soon after this drama was over, Usain Bolt and Justin Gatlin ran in the 100m race. Bolt lost and his golden swansong was never meant to be.

Self-Driving Cars Are So Stupid That Just A Few Homemade Stickers Can Seriously Confuse Them!,"Even as self-driving car makers focus on beefing up their security systems to prevent hackers from gaining entry, there may be a more mundane MacGyver-esque way to mess with those autonomous vehicles anyway.

University of Washington

Security researchers at the University of Washington have demonstrated how they figured out a way to mislead the computer on board a self-driving car using nothing more than a few home-printed stickers.

The team used printed images, that they stuck to road signs, in order to confuse the computer vision systems on board self-driving cars. UW’s Yoshi Kohno explained that small stickers attached to a standard stop sign caused a vision system to misidentify it as a Speed Limit 45 sign. Car vision systems have an object detector, which identifies everything from pedestrians to lights, signs, and other vehicles, and a classifier that figures what they are and how to respond.

The team’s attack assumed that the would-be attackers were able to gain access to thi classifier, and used its algorithm in combination with a particular road sign to generate a custom image. Then, thanks to the subtle changes in their custom road sign stickers, which were simply overlaid over the real ones to look like simple vandalism, the team was able to make the autonomous vehicle misbehave.

While similar techniques have been demonstrated before, this is the first time the changes were subtle enough to possibly avoid human detection, as well as working from different angles. For example, one attack the team carried out was printing a full-size custom ‘Stop’ sign and pasting it over the original. While the new sign merely looked like a splotchy or fading sign to human drivers, the car instead consistently interpreted it as a ‘speed limit 45’ sign.

“Attacks like this are definitely a cause for concern in the self-driving-vehicle community,” said Tarek El-Gaaly, a senior research scientist at autonomous vehicle startup Voyage.. “Their impact on autonomous driving systems has yet to be ascertained, but over time and with advancements in technology, they could become easier to replicate and adapt for malicious use.”"
The Congress government’s cynical and seditious ways exposed by the media,"I was stunned to hear the narco confessions of Safdar Nagori- a SIMI mastermind on the Pakistani conspiracy behind the blasts on the Samjhauta Express. The fact that it was not only kept under wraps all these years but also totally ignored by the Congress Government, amounts to treason.

Why would the Congress coin Saffron Terror and play up a Hindu terror angle when all the facts showed that Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hafiz Saeed were behind the train blasts in February 2007, that killed 66 people and injured several others? The National Investigation Agency caught Pakistanis in India who were involved in the attacks but the Congress Government had them released! The First Investigating Officer Gurdeep Singh assigned to the case said that a Pakistani citizen Ajmat Ali was identified by eye witnesses as a possible planter of the bomb. The arrested Pakistani’s also had fake passports. He claimed that he was pressured by senior officers to drop this line of questioning.

Dr Subramaniam Swamy said it was a case of, “betrayal of the nation of the highest order.”

Why would a government elected by the Indian people want to hand India on a platter to Pakistan with this kind of treacherous and vindictive lie? Why would Sonia Gandhi allow this or perhaps encourage it?

Now every time we ask Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack to justice, they say what about the Samjauta express terror? Where are those perpetrators? How can we tell them they were Pakistani and we let them go? Why would they believe us when the previous government handed them the fiction of a Hindu terror attack?

To make matters even worse Rahul Gandhi told the American Ambassador that Hindu terror was more dangerous for India then the LeT? Where was the proof of this? And why was he trying to compromise India? Was he primed by his mother and Chidambaram?

The Americans knew of Pakistan’s role in the Samjauta terror. Their treasury department attached the accounts of four Pakistani’s who they claimed had a role in this attack.

Yet, The Congress government went on a witch hunt after Indians. Why?

It almost seems that the Congress was trying to appease Pakistan at the expense of India. And one has to wonder what the motives were and what the incentives.

Home Minister Chidambaram did this again with the Ishrat Jahan case where Pakistanis sent to kill Narendra Modi the CM of Gujarat, were given a clean chit and instead the police were sent to jail for what was termed as an encounter killing.

It really is mind blowing. And we, the citizens of India want to know.

Then in an interview on Pakistani television, Mani Shankar Aiyer asked the Pakistani’s to help get rid of a sitting Indian PM. Would any country in the world condone this? Would they not have tried such people for sedition?

Where was the “Tolerance Brigade” in all of this. Why did they not march against such obvious treason? Are they also bought by Pakistan?

Perhaps the worst thing the Congress allowed was the Hurriyat to dictate terms to them. Geelani and others were given crores both by Pakistan and India in a cynical and dangerous game against the Kashmiri people. Pakistan gave them money to create mayhem in the valley and India to stop it.

Now we have the separatists under scrutiny and hopefully they will be in jail soon. But for decades this completely immoral lot was blackmailing the Indian state and was allowed to do so. We should have said that that anyone who wants to separate from India has no business to be here. Instead they got Z Security, the best health treatment, and were allowed to meet the Pakistani High Commissioner to get packets of money to pay young Kashmiri boys to throw rocks at peace keepers.

Thus, a greedy destructive monster was created that sent their own children to safety and played with the lives of Kashmiri children. Their avarice was limitless and it is rumoured they have homes in Delhi and abroad and their children are doctors and executives.

They are well armed and have the incentive. Throw in religion and victimhood and you get a deadly combustible mix. I was not sorry to hear the Hizbul Mujahideen suddenly declaring that they would behead the Separatists as now they wanted an Islamic State and not Azadi! I would have loved to see the expression on their faces especially if the Indian Government had withdrawn the security they did not deserve. The sooner they are sent to a jail in the Andamans the better."
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
NASA Shares Safety Tips For Those In North America Eager To Catch The August Solar Eclipse,"Nobody wants to miss a chance to look at an eclipse; the rare beauty of the universe that's enticing, harmful and stunning. But these solar and lunar eclipses can be extremely harmful to your eyesight.

In a bid to keep people safe during the August 21 solar eclipse, NASA issues a safety guide for people.

According to NASA, one must only look at the sun with special glasses on and in any case, they must not do it directly. These eclipse glasses work as intense filters and save your eyes from the damage.

The ideal way to use these glasses is to put them on when you are still and while you're not looking at the sun. One must remove the glasses in the same way.

NASA also recommends that the safest time to look at the eclipse is when it has reached absolute totality. This will only last for 2 minutes and 40 seconds.

Punjab’s water stress foregrounds tough policy trade-offs,"A reply by Water Resources minister Uma Bharti to a Lok Sabha question on groundwater depletion foregrounds tough trade-offs facing India’s policymakers.

According to Bharti, an assessment of groundwater resources and usage showed that 16% of 6,584 assessment units in India are “overexploited.”

A table which accompanies her reply provides state-wise data. Here, Punjab stands out for the magnitude of overexploitation. If 16% of assessed units in India are overexploited, the figure rises to 76% in case of Punjab. It is the most water stressed Indian state.

Punjab also happens to be India’s most important state in providing food security. It is a massive contributor to the cereal-dependent public distribution system.

One way of looking at it is India’s food security is heavily dependent on a state which is perhaps the worst placed in terms of water stress. Punjab’s impressive agricultural production is partly an outcome of its irrigation coverage. About 98.5% of Punjab’s crop area is irrigated, mainly on account of groundwater irrigation. Without this supply of water, Punjab will surely not be a large contributor to rice procurement by state agencies.

It is not just quantity where Punjab’s farmers score. According to Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Punjab has the highest yield in paddy among states.

This is where a policy maker will face difficult trade-offs.

The easy solution will be to dramatically bring down electricity subsidies which will force farmers to divert to a crop which consumes less water than paddy. While this process takes place, how is it possible to guarantee that other states will offset the loss of rice procurement in Punjab?

Without a simultaneous offset in rice procurement, there will be other complications such as a revival of cereal inflation. Introducing a rational pricing policy to preserve groundwater is essential. But the sequence of steps needed to get there without collateral damage is very difficult."

With Inputs Reuters"
Healthcare: Public-private partnership-the missing Qs,"It is not an uncommon mistake, to mistake public-private partnership (3Ps) as halfway down the street in healthcare. It is but a common phenomenon for financing for setting up the infrastructure (resource power, plus manpower) to start the job. The bane today is of the haunt of the Qs–Are the directions and services, in which these projects laudably started, changed course due to lack of scrutiny, regulation, or an inability of the two parties to facilitate each other to remove the roadblocks that came in the way? The second “Q” is, are the consumers (patients) happy with the outcomes, both in terms of the payments and medical reprieve?

I would not label patients’ responses as “subjective”, more so after having heard so many praises for my colleagues, and the hospitals for having given their kin a second chance to live, as the common phrase of appreciation goes in India.

That brings the third “Q”, which is, whereas public-private partnership is never the question in any other industry, what processes is lacking that when it comes to evaluation and rating on a 1-10 scale, it appears unjust to exceed the figure of 5, as the highest performance.

No harm keeping high standards for human health!

The aspects of healthcare are many, right from childbirth, maternity care, nutrition, prevention from epidemic and endemic diseases. I presume various government departments, NGOs deal with them, and may have their own paradigms in correction and upscaling.

I would take up India’s valued “corporate hospitals” that indeed are the last stop for the poor as well as the rich, when it comes to cardiac interventions, neuro-surgical, kidney failures, interventions, organ transplant, and where the patients send posts to pillars for an undiagnosed ailment.

Some of these set-ups are also listed on the stock-exchange, and that brings answerability to the investors, and corporate practices (at least in terms of financial regulations), that need to be enforced to ensure more value for money spent. That goes in the favour of the hospital, patient, as well as the partners.

One may have certain deviations, or omissions in the strict corporate rules due to the universal imponderables in healthcare, but there is always a method to serve well and professionally, and yet keep the bottom lines higher than the hemlines to prevent a vulgar see for all.

One has to give concessions, that these enterprises were earlier to start, adopted corporate components, but, perhaps in the melee of politico-economic changes, were hesitant of taking the best foot forward, to work at containing bills through better processes, enforcing optimum professionalism in their specialists, and changing rules such that they may continue to grow in goodwill as in profitability, to keep ahead in the financial race.

Unfortunately, we have a group of such 3P setups, that more or less run on the same procedural cycles, complication as well as success rates, but no one came with a formula that would catch an expanse of 1.2 bn, with every possible disease, and raise the bar, by increasing internal patient flow. Huge turnovers bring costs down. Charity begins at home, but need not necessarily continue to prosper on the same paradigm.

It may sound jarring, but the spirit of “entrepreneurship and healthcare” are actually subordinate. The leaks and losses (finally to be recovered from the patient or the third party) actually occur down the line of say, middle management, where targets are to be met, but due diligence is lacking. A ripe apple rots between the time it leaves the stem and drops in one’s lap!

It is an unworthy rumour, and unworthy and rumour-us it ought to be, when one picks up conversations, that doctors are given “targets” to raise so much either as procedure or investigations to retain jobs, or to bag extra incentives. A rumour has its place, though it be a rumour, but transparent ethical actions need to be highlighted to keep people’s confidence up.

Hospitals can cut down on bills, by quick evaluations, relevant but instant investigations, elite professionals ascertaining a diagnosis without unnecessary referrals, and check out a healthy patient. Prolonged stays, waiting time for multiple referrals, which may be tackled in the outdoors, shortens stays. The fact is that sizeable margins are realized in the first few days, through whatever be the margins in emergency medicines, investigations, and relevant consults to diagnose and discharge a patient. The cost of services for a hygienic bed, nursing on the dot to dispense medicine as per each patient’s timing, room services, are what bleed hospital capital. Cutting down in-hospital time through scientifically co-ordinated medical management, can save hospital expenditures, and these expenses are absolutely ethical. Rapid turnover through professionalism is the key.

It’s a farce, but an absolute truth, that “complications” bloat up the bills. Besides, what may be preventable as procedural lapses, hospital acquired infections can lead to sub-optimal results, and has quite significant impact on expenses, that are of no good to the patient, and makes third party payers a bit unrelenting for a cashless policy.

The 3P model is an acceptable, at times irreplaceable financial model. Corporate hospitals with better regulatory policies shall see them in profits, which is necessary to keep up-grading their infrastructure, as well take care of their personnel. If through recognized management techniques, the hospital turnover and also the market prices rise, it shall attract more private money to the health sector.

Hospitals have started packages, for defined procedures. Un-imaginatively these are a summation of the total costs for stay. Any further stay on account of slow recovery, may add up few more lacs. Hospitals can, based on their success rate, charge an amount for stat insurance that may cover an extra five- day stay. If the success rate is as claimed, there would be a reason for a quick non- complicated rehabilitation, less financial uncertainty to the patient, and in- house insurance earnings to the hospital!

There is a case to accommodate more profits from the in-house dispensing, investigating departments in the balance sheets. Even if hospital stocks are a percent more in returns than fixed deposits, tax-free bonds shall see billions flow into healthcare!

Just to remind you, robotic surgery (to begin with prosthetic) in the US was started by a single department of urology (Sanjay Gandhi PGI), and half the robotic urologists there are Indians!

The moral: the 3Ps need to be mutually answerable to the 3Qs!

Rakhi signifies protection. India can start promoting it as “Patient’s Day”!

Those who sow Hindu terror will reap Muslim terror,"Prime Minister Modi and his partymen wax eloquent about the need to tackle and end terrorism. But what exactly is terrorism? The dictionary definition is “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims”.

Going by this definition, the lynch mobs that beat up and kill people suspected of carrying beef are terrorists. So too are Muslim lynch mobs killing policemen in Kashmir. All these lynch mobs are unlawful, use violence against civilians, and have religio-political goals. They fit the definition of “terrorist” like a glove.

Many in the BJP will not agree: they would like to say that Hindu sentiments have been hurt and anti-beef violence is an understandable though not entirely warranted reaction. The Hurriyat in Kashmir will also shed crocodile tears for the killed policemen but say the mob violence must be seen in the context of Indian military repression. Such excuses are as hollow and cruel as those given by al-Qaida or ISIS for their misdeeds.

The murder of 15-year-old Junaid Khan, for the crime of simply being a Muslim, has been condemned — after a typical long pause that will not discourage mobs — by Modi. Many of his ministers have also issued condemnations. Yet the lynch mobs have not appeared out of a vacuum: they have grown in a socio-political climate created by three years of BJP rule.

A deadly mix of communalism and ultra-nationalism has stirred communal passions despite an absence of major riots. One more Muslim was killed by gau rakshaks in Jharkhand after Modi’s call for peace, showing how difficult it is to put the genie back into the bottle.

My fear is that, unless checked quickly, Hindu terror will be met with Muslim terror, and the country will go up in flames. If the state cannot protect Muslims, there is a high risk that they will devise their own armed squads for protection. Hindu-Muslim terror can escalate with the state a helpless spectator.

Modi wants to sell India to the world as a global manufacturing hub. That will not be possible if India’s fastest growing industry is lynch mobs. Economist Dani Rodrik has shown that the ability to manage internal conflicts is an important determinant of economic growth and prosperity. Since Independence, despite a thousand flaws, India has succeeded in managing its internal conflicts reasonably well, and reaped the corresponding social and economic dividends. That achievement is now in jeopardy.

Fifteen years ago, President Bush of the US congratulated India on having 150 million Muslims but no terrorists. That plaudit was an exaggeration, yet it was not unearned. Given the strident rise of militant Islam across the world since 2001, the moderation of India’s Muslims stood out. That moderation owed a lot to strenuous political efforts to check majoritarian violence and persuade minorities that India was their land too. Alas, the rise of lynch mobs could signal the coming end of that phase.

Across the West, small Muslim terrorist groups (mostly homegrown) are wreaking havoc. They do not need financing or encouragement from ISIS or other foreign agencies: the expertise and knowledge for making bombs are on the internet. Militancy is not typical of Islam: the vast majority of Muslims in the West, as in India, are law-abiding citizens who condemn terrorism. Nevertheless, militants have become a menace in countries with just a few million Muslims.

India now has a Muslim population of 180 million. Even if 0.01% of these Muslims turn militant, that will guarantee havoc. And if 0.01% of Hindus interpret the violence of 0.01% of Muslims as a reason to bash all Muslims, communal terror can ratchet up. Even if 99.99% of both communities are against hate crimes, that will not save the situation, unless the sternest action is taken to halt vigilante groups.

Dawood Ibrahim’s bomb blasts in Mumbai did not occur in a vacuum.

They were a reaction to the anti-Muslim riots that followed the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992 and the Shiv Sena’s maha-aarti riots of January 1993. Thirteen bomb blasts hit prominent locations including the Shiv Sena’s headquarters. Fortunately, violence did not ratchet up further, and communal tempers gradually eased.

If Hindu-Muslim terror escalates today, it will not easily be doused. I fear that those who sow Hindu violence will reap Muslim violence and vice versa, in a vicious spiral."
Baba Ramdev Wanted Patanjali Employees To Work For 'Free' Claims Former CEO,"Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev's Patanjali is one of the biggest brands in India now and has shown signs of growing even bigger.

BCCL/ File

But it appears that the benefits of the sales worth Rs 10,561 crore in the last financial year is not reaching the people who made it possible.

According to former CEO of Patanjali, SK Patra, the company believes its employees are doing a 'seva' (voluntary service) and can work without being paid.

""Patanjali pay very little to the people who work for them. Babaji (Baba Ramdev) calls it ‘seva’. For instance, I was doing two jobs there — at Patanjali Ayurved and Patanjali Food Park. They had promised to pay for both. But he would announce to everyone that 'Patraji has come to do seva. Right now he is drawing salary, but soon, he won’t even take that…"" Patra told Mint.

Reuters/ File

Patra, an IT and IIM alumnus said he did not want to do 'seva' as Ramdev claimed and demanded money for the work he was doing.

""I used to respond, “No, I want my money.”... I said I don’t need it for myself. I have a family. I need money for my family, to support them and my relatives. Then Babaji relented and gave me a salary for one of the two jobs that I was performing. But basically his argument was — I have to offer free seva to his host of companies.""

Patra said he left the company due to the differences in their words and actions.

""I was also seeing the distance between their words and their actions and it troubled me. Eventually, it became too much. So I left.""

"Death registration: forget Aadhaar, improve the data collection","The government’s decision to make Aadhaar a requirement for death registration was met with incredulity and derision. Initial reports suggested that this was mandatory but the government quickly scotched this speculation. However, social media went ahead with new Aadhaar memes mocking the government and private sector’s growing propensity to enforce Aadhaar in every field of human activity. But lost in this chorus was another critical aspect of death registration.

What does death registration tell us? Though death registration is mandatory, and the cause of death must be accurately specified, lax regard is being paid to the latter aspect. Death registration has been compulsory since 1969. But it is only after the Millennium Development Goals emphasised the importance of birth and death registration in monitoring the effectiveness and impact of health and development interventions that developing countries focussed on this aspect. In 2014, death registration had improved to 74.3 per cent from 70.9 per cent in 2013. In other words, three out of four deaths were being registered. The Chief Registrar is forced to estimate the number of deaths to arrive at the registration rate.

But here is the nub. The two states which possibly account for the most number of deaths — Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — reported only death registration rates of 46.1% and 24.1% respectively. If the official numbers can be believed most other states are doing well in terms of numbers. But the other challenge is to ascertain the cause of death. It is estimated that over 75 per cent of deaths occurs at home and the cause of death remains unknown. Without this data, it becomes difficult for government, economists and policy makers to understand disease incidence, mortality and other health indicators.

However, in contrast to the Census Office claims that India has achieved almost 75% death registration, a recent WHO report World Health Statistics 2017 claims that India registers only 10% of deaths and the quality of data from death registration is “very poor”. There is a rider that this data could be from a period prior to 2010. If this is global perception about death registration, it needs to be corrected by the government urgently. If it is reflective of the situation on the ground — authorities recently had a tough time collective deaths caused by dengue from registration data — all the effort put into registration is ending up merely as a bookkeeping effort. Recently, there were even deaths attributed to small pox and polio in Delhi creating a minor scare. There are also allegations that people desiring to register births and deaths have to deal with corruption.

The Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1969 envisages penalties on registrars who fail to report registrations to higher authorities in a timely manner. Recently Haryana, Bihar, Jarkhand, and Goa failed to provide data to the union ministry of home affairs (MHA) about registration of birth and deaths while UP provided a part of the data. Haryana blamed it on “lack of computerization and governance issues”. The inaction of these states raise questions about the completeness and integrity of the birth and death data and justify the low score granted by the WHO to India.

These are weighty issues that must be dealt with. The government is spending considerable money in registering births and deaths and employing personnel to record the data. The joke is on those lampooning Aadhaar as a mandatory passport to death. There are much greater failings that they must hold the government accountable for."

Make what you share together worthy,"I was standing by the conveyor belt when i saw an elderly Indian couple walking out together. She was dressed in a traditional sari and he in a high waisted pant and shirt. Both had grey hair and must have been in their 70’s. What made this moment stand out was the way he had affectionately put his arm around her shoulders and the way this traditional middle-class couple were Smiling, chatting and holding each other while slowly walking out of the airport. I’ve seen a lot of public displays of affection abroad… but to see it happen in India, especially with elderly folks, is a rare sight. Often, I am asked what I miss the most being a single woman. A moment like this sums it up so beautifully. Growing old with someone who cares and shows it… being a couple who are interested in each other, aren’t hesitant to be affectionate with each other and are lovingly there for each other.

There’s no point in having or choosing a life partner just for the sake of it either because you’re scared to be alone, or because u need financial or emotional security. So many couples just exist together as a formality. I feel there is nothing lonelier than being married and feeling alone. It’s saddening when couples grow apart rather than work at creating strong bonds to keep their relationship vibrant and fulfilling. If you’re single… remind yourself that its worth waiting for a worthy life partner. We should all want the arms of our life partners around us… . and also be the ones embracing our loved ones. Especially when we are old and bent and grey. Let’s remind ourselves every day that it is worth working towards keeping each other feeling worthy and loved. Wish u all many of those airport moments.

My husband recently told me that he would want to separate from me because he has been involved with a colleague of his for the past few months. We have been married for a year. When I asked him for a divorce, he said he wouldn’t want to go down that lane and would prefer to just live apart. I really don’t know what to do and cannot understand this behaviour of his. Please help.

Classic case of wanting the best of both worlds. I suggest you record your conversations and then use the evidence get your divorce. Make it known to him that adultery is an offence that could land him in serious trouble and that you’re not in the mood to be negotiated with or bullied into a lifetime of compromise.

My wife is extremely hard-working, ambitious types and I end up doing most of the work at home. We don’t have kids as yet but I try to keep the home in order so that she can dedicate all her time to work. We have a perfect balance in that sense but these days I have noticed that she seems to be taking undue advantage of all this and has been staying out of home unnecessarily. She goes out with her colleagues on week days and spends time with her friends on weekends and I get to know of her plans only later. I have tried to talk to her gently once or twice but she has always brushed away the topic. How do I ask her what is on her mind and since I sincerely miss her how do I tell her what I am going through?

They say the work done at home is never appreciated until it’s not done. So just stop doing all the housework. If she complains bring up your list of grievances, and say both have a right and need to be heard. Explain that in a marriage you can either grow together or grow apart. It’s really that simple. So which direction would she like it to go in?

I am a 22-year-old woman and in love with a guy who is two years younger to me. When we started dating, he did not have any problems with the difference in age but he now says that his parents will not agree to this relationship of ours. I have tried speaking to him but he is not willing to hear me out. What should I do?

It seems the relationship is “numbered”. Pun intended!!! It’s a blessing in disguise. Do you really want a man who cannot even stand up for such a trivial issue?"
Sushant’s Father Is Proud Of His Success But Wants Him To Complete His Graduation First,"Nobody better than aspiring actors understand how big a challenge it is to convince their family when they want to pursue a career in film, television, music or theatre. And considering the industry has been boasting of nepotism, it definitely scares off a lot of people.

But there are several actors who made it through with their sheer talent and are at par with those who already belong to the industry. One such actor is Sushant Singh Rajput, who is giving brilliant performances on the big screen one after the other.

PTI

But were his parents reluctant when he opened up to them about his career choice? The actor says they still ask him to complete his graduation at the least.

PTI

For the uninitiated, Sushant Singh Rajput, who ventured into the world of films with Kai Po Che, dropped out of an engineering college. The actor was a bright student. So much so that he secured 7th rank in All India Engineering Entrance Exam and got admission in Delhi Technological University, but dropped out after three years.

He started out as a background dancer and eventually became a hero in the world of films. His parents were shocked when he dropped the bomb and told them about the choice he has made. Not that they are not proud of him now, but he says, even today all conversations revolve around his graduation at the end.

PTI

“My dad loves it when, on his walks, people call out to him, show him some recent clipping on me…he is really proud of me. But even today, almost all our conversations end with “beta, degree le leta…” Pinkvilla quoted him as saying.

And that’s how all parents are, aren’t they!

Jadeja suspended for third Test against Sri Lanka

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Sun, 06 Aug, 2017, 06:26 PM

Ravindra Jadeja accumulated six demerit points in a 24-month period. © AFP

India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was handed a one-match suspension after he was found guilty of breaching article 2.2.8 of the player's code of conduct which deals with ""throwing a ball (or any other item of cricket equipment such as a water bottle) at or near a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire, Match Referee or any other third person in an inappropriate and/or dangerous manner during an International Match"".

Jadeja picked up three demerit points for his latest transgression, taking his total tally to six in a 24-month period, thereby resulting in the suspension. He was also fined 50% of his match-fee.

The incident at SSC Colombo occurred when the left-arm spinner fielded off his own bowling in the 58th over of the innings on the third day and hurled the ball back at batsman Dimuth Karunaratne 'in a dangerous manner.'

During the third and final Test against New Zealand in Indore, Jadeja had been fined 50 per cent back then as well, receiving three demerit points too. The 28-year-old was found to have breached Article 2.2.11 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to ""causing avoidable damage to the pitch during an international match"". In that game, Jadeja received two informal and one official warnings for infringing the protected area of the pitch before a fourth offence led to charges being levelled against him.

The two additional demerit points (over the threshold of four) were converted into suspension points. If Jadeja further reaches the threshold of eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, it will lead to four suspension points.

As per ICC's player's code of conduct, two suspension points result in a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whichever comes first for the player, while four suspension points lead to a ban from two Tests or four ODIs or four T20Is. The six demerit points, though, will stay on Jadeja's disciplinary record.

Haryana stalking case: cracks appear in BJP’s defence of Subhash Barala,"The Haryana administration and top BJP leadership has maintained a studied silence over the alleged stalking case that has hogged headlines in mainstream media. The incident involves Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son – Vikas and his friend – accused of stalking a girl in Chandigarh at midnight on Friday. Though the police did arrest the duo but they were released on bail and opposition has been crying foul over the government for inaction. At a time when the entire BJP top brass had been blatantly defending senior Barala, one leader from their flock has complicated matters by asking for his resignation. The leader is none other than BJP MP from Kurukshetra, Rajkumar Saini.

It would be naïve to assume Saini is driven by probity in public life when he has raised the demand for Barala’s resignation as BJP state chief. This is the same leader whose animosity towards the dominant Jat community is well-known in the state. The main Jat organisation that had launched an agitation for reservation in the state – All India Jat Aarakashan Sangharash Samiti (AIJASS) – too had blamed Saini for making provocative statements to disturb communal harmony in the past.

How do you expect Khattar to sack Haryana BJP Chief for son's stalking when his big bosses were themselves stalking!https://t.co/U5x6Uifffk — Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1) August 6, 2017

Barala belongs to the Jat community and even though he was a first time MLA, he was appointed state BJP chief. This happened after Ram Bilas Sharma was elevated as a senior cabinet minister in the Manohar Lal Khattar government in 2014. Barala had defeated Congress heavyweight Paramvir Singh Tohana from Fatehabad assembly constituency despite INLD’s strong presence in the region. Barala being given the top party position in the state was done to appease the Jat community which was upset over Khattar (non-Jat) being appointed as chief minister.

Saini has cited the example of Venod Sharma being forced to resign as state power minister (part of Bhupender Singh Hooda government) on moral grounds after his son, Manu Sharma’s name, came up in the Jessica Lal murder case. So far BJP has stood united behind Barala. But Saini may have just provided the chink in the ruling party’s armour."
Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"‘Refuse the rakhi outright, don’t just escape or vanish’","Raksha bandhan literally means ‘the tie or knot of protection’. While the rakhi collection with girls is increasing with time, these days college boys are having a tough time figuring how many of their friends will end up tying a rakhi to them. The solution is: Skip the college on the day.

The festival is celebrated across the nation to celebrate the most precious relationship between a brother and sister, biologically related or otherwise. On this day as the sister ties a sacred rakhi on the brother’s wrist, the brother pledges to protect the sister through thick and thin.

Although this festivity is exclusively celebrated by brother-sister, there are few girls who tie the rakhi to guys to put an end to a possible affair and that is the reason, guys run away from the girls on this day for the fear of being tied a rakhi.

While in some of the colleges which do not observe a holiday on Raksha Bandhan, most boys consider it a holiday and stay away from colleges on the day of festival — for the fear of being tied a rakhi by their female acquaintance.

Says a DU boy on anonymity, ‘Every year it is the same scenario. On the day of Raksha Bandhan, and the following week, the attendance of boys is very low. Yes the funniest part is, even on the following week, the boys will not be coming to their classes, because they fear that the girls will tie them a rakhi.’

As it is considered inauspicious to deny a rakhi, boys prefer avoiding girls on the day. Anubhav, a second year science student, says, ‘When a girl comes to tie rakhi we can’t say no.’

By tying a rakhi on a boy’s wrist, girls put an end to a possible affair. A medical student on the condition of anonymity shares, ‘I liked a girl and she knew about it. Only to avoid being taunted, she tied a rakhi in front of everyone two years back. But after six months we got into a relationship. I felt guilty that I did not live up to the purity of that relationship.’

For a guy, may be, you have clearly missed out on the opportunity to express your romantic feelings, so now she is taking the opportunity of expressing her complete lack of romantic feelings by tying a rakhi. Suggests psychiatrist Dr Sanjay Chugh, ‘Refuse the rakhi outright. Don’t escape or vanish, refuse it. She will get the hint and at least consider about the new development in the relation.’"

“I used to get angry on Raju. He was elder to me, he had some responsibility. Whenever I would ask my parents to send me to a party or outing with friends, they would say ‘take Raju along.’ But he would never come. All he would ever say, ‘Take care of your own safety.’ So, I could never go to a single party,” his sister Alka Bhatia says in the video.

She said that after her father passed away, Akshay took over all the responsibilities.

“I realized the value of his words when I sent my daughter to study abroad. When she asked me if 'Everything will be okay,' I replied, like Raju, 'Everything will be fine, just take care of your own safety'. This has been the greatest gift my brother has given to me and my daughter - The strength to be self-sufficient. Thank you, Raju. I love you,"" she added. The video ended with the message: ""This Raksha Bandhan, do not protect your sister. Empower her.”

For the unversed, Akshay Kumar was born as Rajiv Bhatia but had later changed his name. Hence, his sister still refers to him as Raju in the video.

How an inept finance ministry pushes up India’s food subsidy bill,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on 4th August tabled in parliament a compliance audit report on Food Corporation of India. One of the striking features of the report is that it shows up India’s finance ministry as an inept body. Its management of finances is poor and the consequence is that India’s subsidy bill is bigger than it should be.

FCI, which was created by legislation in 1964, is central to India’s food security programme. It handles procurement and storage of food grains. FCI’s operations are primarily funded by the food subsidy provided by finance ministry.

CAG’s report- covering the period between 2011-12 and 2015-16- shows that over time the gap between the subsidy claimed by FCI and the amount released by finance ministry has widened.

As FCI needs the money to keep its operations going, it has begun to borrow an increasing amount of money from commercial sources. The largest source of borrowing is cash credit extended to it by a consortium of banks. It also happens to be a relatively expensive source of borrowing.

The consequence of this chain of events is that FCI’s subsidy requirement keeps increasing partly on account of the interest it pays for its commercial borrowing.

CAG’s report shows that FCI paid an interest of Rs 35,701.81 crore over five years to make up for the shortfall of subsidy.

This, among other factors, makes FCI’s operations more expensive than it should be. All of this feeds into the food subsidy bill.

“The main reason for indebtedness of FCI was delayed/insufficient release of subsidy by ministry,” says the CAG report.

The next time finance ministers and ministry officials claim to have skillfully managed the fiscal situation, it is best to be skeptical. Fiscal prudence may be the result of unpaid bills or short release of subsidy."

NASA Is Building A Deep Space Astronaut Habitat Out Of Old Space Station Parts To Save Money,"NASA knows that its International Space Station won’t be around forever. Eventually, the structure will pass its extended lifetime and will have to be decommissioned.

But that doesn't mean it needs to be scrapped.

Artist rendering of the NextSTEP habitat docked with Orion in cislunar orbit - Lockheed Martin

Instead, the space agency has given aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Martin the go ahead to refurbish an old cargo module of the ISS. As part of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program, the company will be repurposing the Donatello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM).

Lockheed Martin is renovating and tweaking the module at the Kennedy Space Center in order to build a prototype deep space habitat. If the project succeeds, the habitat would eventually be sort of a midway rest stop for astronauts onboard rockets headed to Mars.

Lockheed Martin will look to install life support and other systems to turn the old module into an astronaut habitat for NASA’s Deep Space Gateway system. Cannibalizing old ISS parts like this could save the space agency huge amounts of money and resources that would otherwise go into launching heavy equipment into space for future exploratory missions.

NASA's recruitment poster for Mars

“We are excited to work with NASA to repurpose a historic piece of flight hardware, originally designed for low Earth orbit exploration, to play a role in humanity’s push into deep space,” Bill Pratt, Lockheed Martin’s NextSTEP program manager, said in a statement. ""Making use of existing capabilities will be a guiding philosophy for Lockheed Martin to minimize development time and meet NASA’s affordability goals.""

Lockheed Martin already has a concept idea cemented, and they’ll be building the prototype based on that over the next 18 months. And if the project is successful, the company may also receive a contract to figure out how other parts of the ISS can be repurposed for future visits to Mars and beyond.

7 Daily routine activities that are ruining your BACK!,"According to the American Chiropractic Association, 31 million Americans experience lower back pain at any given time. It’s considered the single leading cause of disability worldwide. Many people who experience back pain aren’t quite sure where it stems from. It turns out that many activities in your day-to-day routine can put you at risk for back problems, pain and injury. If you often experience back pain, a simple lifestyle change may help alleviate the problem.

Here are seven everyday activities that harm your back and how to prevent them:

1. Lifting Heavy Objects

Lifting heavy objects, even if it’s just for a moment, can cause back problems if you don’t lift correctly. Bending incorrectly at your back can strain your back muscles and cause back pain.

Try this: When lifting heavy objects, squat then pick up the object. Bending at the waist can cause injury.





2. Prolonged Sitting

If your career requires you to sit for long periods of time, it can be tough to get your exercise in. But prolonged sitting can cause back pain and increase your chances of injury.

Try this: Perform simple stretching exercises at your desk and get up from your chair every once in a while to walk around the office and stretch your legs.







3. Improper Stretching

Doing yoga or other forms of stretching can lead to back pain when it’s done incorrectly. Improper stretching also puts your muscles at risk for injury.

Try this: The first time you try yoga, make sure you let a trained instructor teach you how to perform the proper positions.





4. Poor posture

Whether you’re sitting at your desk, watching T.V. on texting on your phone, make sure you’re implementing good posture. Hunching puts pressure on the back of the spine, which can easily cause back pain.

Try this: Sit up straight to keep your spine from bending. Check your posture regularly to prevent long periods of hunching.





5. Carrying Heavy Bags

Constantly carrying around a heavy briefcase, purse or backpack is bound to elicit back problems. It puts pressure on your shoulders, arms and back and can lead to an imbalance in the body.

Try this: If your bag is heavy, always carry it over both of your shoulders like a backpack. If your bag has one strap, carry it over your shoulder with proper posture to lower the chances of straining your back.





6. Sleeping On Very Soft Mattresses

While a soft mattress might sound nice and comfy, a mattress that is too soft isn’t able to provide proper support for your back. It can cause a slight shift in the shape of the spine, which stresses the muscles, ligaments and joints.

Try this: Choose a mattress that’s not too firm and not too soft.





7. Driving On Uneven Roads

As odd as it might seem, driving on uneven roads can put pressure on your back, especially if you’re driving for long periods of time. Those bumps can end up taking a toll on your spine.

Try this: Take frequent breaks when traveling long distances to ease the pressure on your back. Be sure to adjust your seat properly before driving.

Naidu sweeps: His biggest challenge will be building bridges between government and opposition,"Following his election by a landslide margin as India’s 15th vice-president, M Venkaiah Naidu began his innings on the right note by stating that he no longer belongs to any party. His victory over opposition nominee – diplomat turned academic Gopalkrishna Gandhi – was a foregone conclusion after southern regional parties like AIADMK, TRS and YSR Congress pledged their support to him. Both men conducted their campaigns with admirable courtesy, and Gandhi bowed out with remarkable grace by attributing his defeat to a victory of the ballot that worked out in Naidu’s favour, a victory that “belonged to the people of India”. Instead of being the exception to India’s rancorous and polarised politics, this spirit of civility and grace ought to be the norm in future.

Naidu’s nomination was pitched as BJP’s outreach to southern India, much like his tenure as BJP president from 2002 to 2004. But it will be as Rajya Sabha (RS) ex-officio chairperson that all of his impressive political experience will be required. Naidu walks into an atmosphere of hyper partisanship but must ensure that debate, and not disruptions, become the norm in RS. The vice-presidential election coincided with BJP moving ahead of Congress as single largest party in RS. However, the NDA coalition will not reach simple majority in the Upper House until next year. The opposition has resorted to disrupting RS proceedings and thwarting key legislations. Much of last week, for instance, was lost in disruptions surrounding the acrimonious Gujarat RS elections.

It is this climate of corrosive discourse – where trashing the opposition is more important than reasoned debate or considering what is in the national interest – that needs to be dispelled. BJP leader Ram Madhav has noted, sagaciously, that BJP was the dominant party “all over the country and unnecessary aggression and abuse is not required”. He called on BJP supporters to win arguments with “logic and facts” and without “noise and fury”.

Such civility should apply across the political spectrum and must start from Parliament. Naidu earned his political spurs during the Emergency and has served a considerable part of his career taking on ruling governments. He would know that an opposition, however weakened and difficult, deserves a respectful position in a democracy. The new vice-president’s success will be gauged by the measure of his bipartisanship."

"SRK Is Unfazed By JHMS’ Lukewarm Response, Says People Will Take Time To Understand Its Magic","People were highly excited when it was revealed that the King of romance Shah Rukh Khan will collaborate with Imtiaz Ali, the director who is known for his brilliant portrayal of a feeling called love on the big screen. When the ace director collaborated with the skilled actor, it was supposed create magic, right?

AFP

But Jab Harry Met Sejal apparently couldn’t live up to the expectations of the people and has got mixed reviews from the audiences as well as critics. While Imtiaz Ali said that JHMS wasn’t supposed to be a masterpiece, SRK says it has the magic but people will take time to understand it.

AFP

“I think he would not like to recreate that magic that he has done in the past. This one has a new magic. It’s a new trick. Maybe just the newness of it is going to take some time for people to understand the magic of the film. Working with Imtiaz was quite magical.”

Trending down: A cut in RBI policy rate is welcome but more must be done to boost the economy,"Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee (MPC) yesterday lowered its policy interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first change in 10 months. The current rate, 6%, has now been brought down to the level that existed over six years ago. The change signals two things. One, MPC is now more sanguine about the trajectory of inflation. Two, the reduction in interest rate has come amidst signs that industrial performance remains lacklustre. Given this context, MPC’s decision is welcome but it is unlikely to make a meaningful difference to the economy.

Interest rates have been trending down for a while. In the backdrop of slowing growth of bank credit, deposit rates have been constantly lowered. Recently, State Bank of India lowered even savings rates for most of its deposit holders. On the other side, interest rates for borrowers have not declined proportionately on account of the bad loans plaguing banks. But there has been more activity from non-banking financial intermediaries and India’s top companies have been able to benefit from the current environment. It is the smaller companies, the ones most dependent on banks, which have missed out.

The benign environment for borrowers has not translated into a revival of investment demand. MPC’s statement pointed out that the number of new investment announcements fell to a 12-year low in April-June quarter. Part of the problem can be traced to the collapse in global trade following the financial crisis, but there are levers the government can use to improve the situation. The immediate need is to carry through with the resolution process of bad loans following the promulgation of an ordinance in May. This must be supplemented with measures to ease doing business, which would substantially improve the investment climate."
26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
Why having a 2-pizza team helps,"Work is increasingly becoming complex. The days of the lone genius are over. While Tim Berners Lee is given credit for inventing the World Wide Web, we often forget the contributions of Robert Callieau and the several thousands of people who have continuously worked to shape the web to its present reality.

Scientific progress is usually collaborative by its very nature. While Steve Jobs gets the limelight as the one person who gave us the iPhone a decade ago, it was the collective work of several people who had to work together to make it happen. The designers of the hardware worked with the supply chain people to procure the various components. The Marketing team had to create the ads that made us sit up and take notice. The Human Resources teams deserve credit for putting together the right team.

2-Pizza teams

Jeff Bezos made history this week when he surged past Bill Gates as the richest man on earth for a short while. Bezos had a net worth of over $89 billion when markets closed, while Gates was ahead by a billion dollars. I have no doubt that Bezos will go past Gates (for one Gates is giving away his wealth) very soon.

Amazon has grown from being an online book seller, which is where it all began 22 years back to a pot-pourri of businesses. From cloud computing, movies, music, food, AI and space shuttles, Bezos is doing it all. Apple may have been the past, Amazon is definitely the future. How does Bezos do this? While most businesses become bureaucratic and sloppy as they grow in size, Bezos has kept the 2 pizza rule to keep the behemoth nimble. He keeps the team size to no more than 6-7 people.

Amazon’s rise has led to the creation of Death by Amazon Index, which tracks the performance of the companies affected by the rise of Amazon. Those 54 companies include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart. As organizations grow, the rumor mills become far more reliable sources of information than the formal communication. The employees get far more reliable updates from the business press than their own managers. It slows down the organization far more seriously than we realize.

Quality of communication

As the number of members of a group increases, the number of links that need to be managed to keep the messages from getting tangled increases. Mathematically speaking the number of links between members in a group will be n(n-1)/2. If there are 5 people (ie n=5) in a team, there are 10 possible links to be managed. With 10 people, that number goes up to 45.

As start-ups add people to their payroll, they forget how to manage the number of communication links. Each time the business pivots, the leaders must explain the rationale to the entire organization and answer all the questions the team members may have. This is where communication breaks down. To manage time zone differences and to decentralize the process, founders will often leave the dissemination to the next level of leaders. Some leaders inevitably do not communicate the message in a timely manner. That is where cynicism and disillusionment happens.

Team members often have to invite their managers and senior leaders to review and set direction. Anyone who has tried to call for a meeting with a few senior leaders knows the nightmare of trying to match calendars. Even when the leaders manage to join the meeting, they are distracted by the messages and phone calls. Small empowered teams can really speed up things.

The 54 companies listed in the Death by Amazon index would do well to start creating 2-Pizza teams. Even if you are not one of the 54 companies listed, it may be a good idea to start trimming the team size.

Improves execution

Organizing the business in teams of 5-6 people, keeps bureaucracy at bay. It gives the teams a chance to create close bonds. Between five people, it is easy to coordinate meetings and develop a sense of ownership. The core team can keep inviting additional people as and when needed. But the 2-Pizza team can stay nimble enough to see the project through.

A smaller team helps improve execution. Amazon’s stock has risen more than 36 percent this year. If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 — and had held onto your shares — that money would be worth $83,000 today. In real terms it would be $61,000. Maybe 2-Pizza teams are effective after all."
Existential Threat? Artificial intelligence won’t replace all human skills,"Today a great deal of debate is taking place regarding the fast pace at which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developing and the merits and demerits of the same. People like Tesla founder Elon Musk have called for proactive rules governing the development of AI. Apart from dangerous, autonomous killer robots, there are fears that AI will displace human jobs by the billions. Already many skilled human tasks have been replaced by automated platforms. And the thing about AI is that once it is out there, the genie can’t be put back into the bottle.

So the question is not so much whether robots can replace human jobs, but should they replace human jobs. Recently, I had to do something about a broken furniture in my house. But instead of throwing the thing out, I decided to get it repaired. The carpenter who showed up was an affable fellow from Bihar. And he was quite skilled. He quickly got down to the job at hand while engaging us in pleasant conversation. And as he worked, I couldn’t help admire his craftsmanship. There’s something beautiful about human hands creating things.

This got me thinking – in a futuristic scenario, if a robot had repaired the furniture for me, I wouldn’t have had this pleasurable experience. This wasn’t just a carpenter at work; this was a man who was leaving behind a piece of his skill and knowledge, acquired through years of training, in my home. A robot or furniture made in an automated factory simply couldn’t replace this. I accept the reality that increasingly we will have more and more automated factories churning out mass-produced goods. This is something that cannot be changed. However, this doesn’t mean that human craftsmanship will end.

In fact, I believe products made by humans will be even more valuable in the future. They will have a higher premium and people will take more pride in them. Sure, AI could produce paintings akin to Picasso. But an original composition stemming from the human mind will still hold more value precisely because it is human. For, such a creation won’t stem from perfect AI data-crunching, but imperfect, unpredictable human inspiration. So yes, the development of AI will replace many human jobs. But it won’t end human creation and creativity – the latter might even get sharper. In that sense, human limitations, unpredictability and imperfections are humanity’s greatest assets as we step into an AI-driven world."

Delhi Sewer Deaths: Authorities are far from getting sanitation right,"In yet another shocking case of apathy, neglect and poor governance, three labourers lost their lives when they entered a 10-foot-deep DJB (Delhi Jal Board) manhole in the capital’s Lajpat Nagar area without any safety equipment. Although DJB officials say that no labourers had been officially hired to clean the sewer line, the civic body can’t escape accountability. In fact, it is a common practice among Delhi’s civic bodies to unofficially or privately hire labourers. In this particular case, the needle of suspicion points to a DJB junior engineer who allegedly privately hired the ill-fated labourers.

The tragedy happened despite the fact manual scavenging is banned and a person can only enter a sewer line in case of an emergency, that too with proper safety equipment. Authorities claim that DJB has adequate machines to clean drains. Either this is a lie or these machines are not being used because of operational lacunae. Whatever it is, it’s unacceptable that in 2017 we still have people physically entering sewer lines to clean them. If this is the state of affairs in the national capital, one shudders to imagine the situation in the rest of the country. The political leadership takes great pride in the country’s IT and technological prowess. And yet we have manual cleaning of sewer lines.

Worse still, the unofficial, private hiring of labourers by civic authorities reflects caste and class prejudices. For, these labourers are generally from poor families and so-called backward castes. Hence, their engagement in the cleaning of drains maps unfortunate colloquial stereotypes about certain castes being meant to do ‘dirty work’. As a result, we have a situation where civic body officials and employees who are meant to handle waste management are never the ones working on the ground. For example, the person who collects the daily garbage from my neighbourhood – and he does this job without any protective gear or scientific sorting methods – is actually someone who is employed by someone who in turn has been privately hired by a municipal corporation employee.

This also probably explains why our waste management systems are in such bad shape. And if we can’t get this right, we might as well forget about building futuristic ‘Smart Cities’. This is precisely why the Swachh Bharat Mission has to be driven by greater deployment of sanitation technology, better training of sanitation employees, and better administration of sanitation departments. It’s not enough to just build more toilets, although this is a good beginning. Building a modern sanitation infrastructure requires integrated planning and implementation. Advertising and media campaigns are only one leg of the stool."

Malaysian Tycoon’s Daughter Gives Up Million Dollar Inheritance To Marry Lover Who's A Commoner,"Love knows no caste, religion, creed and certainly no 'riches' and Angeline Francis Khoo, the daughter of Malaysian tycoon Khoo Kay Peng is proving just that.

She is giving up on her family property worth crores to marry the man whom her father had declined.

Facebook/Soul Conscious Sisterhood

According to the Strait Times, 78-year-old Khoo Kay Peng is the chairman of Malayan United Industries, an investment holding firm which has huge stakes in high-end luxury brands and hotels.

In 2015, he was ranked 44th on the Forbes list of Malaysia's 50 richest people. His net worth was estimated to be US$300 million.

WORLD OF BUZZ

Angeline Khoo, the fourth of Mr Khoo's five children with his ex-wife, when she told her father she wanted to marr Francis but he refused to give his consent.

Ms Kho met Carribean-born data scientist Jedidiah Francis when she was studying at the Oxford University.

But for Angeline neither her father's riches nor his consent mattered. Everything faded into oblivion and her sole aim was to wed the love of her life.

""I believed dad's stance was wrong, so there was no question about what was right,"" she said in the interview to Daily Mail.

""Money amplifies negative characteristics and that can cause problems. To walk away from that was actually very easy. I didn't even consider it,"" she added.

Khoo, who is now a fashion designer, said she had no clue about t her father's wealth until it was revealed in court during a long-running divorce between her parents.

Why are we allowing VIPs to intimidate us?,"I grew up in Chandigarh.

So, this post is as little about trying to defend a delusion that the ‘City Beautiful” is free of crime as it is a feminist rant.

Having got that out of the way, I will say that it saddened and alarmed me just as much as the next resident of the city who read Varnika Kundu’s Facebook post about her recent nightmarish episode with the VIP gundas in the wee hours of the night in Chandigarh.

The ordeal that Kundu had to go through is not only terrifying and every woman’s worst nightmare in spite of the Nirbhayas of the country facing such trauma and an even worse fate almost every single day, it is a continuing testament to the appalling VIP culture that is incessantly plaguing the corridors of our land.

The courageous Varnika Kundu dialed 100 on her phone and India sighed a collective sigh of relief on reading that the police responded with the dexterity that was needed in this eleventh hour.

It could well have been HER eleventh hour and we could have been staring at another Nirbhaya situation in the face today.

Being the son of a Haryana BJP leader, Vikas Balara, the stalker of Kundu, owing to his VIP status managed to wriggle free with a quick bail before he even breathed in the prison air. And the Chandigarh Police that Kundu and her family showered endless praise on for rescuing her in the nick of time has once again proved that their righteousness cannot last in front of strong arm tactics by the rich and powerful. Interestingly and certainly not shockingly, the CCTV footage that is usually in abundance at this particular part of the city where the incident took place can very conveniently “not be found”.

We swallow our rage many times over when VIPs fly into cities and disrupt the road traffic and daily lives of civilians such as a family member trying to rush a mother or a sister to the hospital. We swallow our rage when ministers and leaders utter profanities and ludicrous comments about women and “their place” in society, often trying to defend a rape or misconduct taken place in their jurisdiction. How such individuals manage to acquire ministerial posts is something that continues to baffle me even today.

But when the son of a BJP leader stalks a woman in her car late at night and another leader questions why the woman had to be out late at night instead of questioning the mysterious expulsion of two non-bailable Indian Penal Code sections that Vikas Balara and his accomplice were charged under, it becomes very difficult to keep swallowing rage and looking away.

Seldom do I agree with much of what Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi says or does, but his appeal to the BJP government to not let this incident slide and make sure the perpetrators are brought to justice instead of “colluding with the culprits”is one that we are all behind.

The mind shudders to think of what could have happened. A courageous Kundu and her father, an IAS officer are determined in their fight for justice and to not get bogged down by this bullying.

But where does it end? Will this incident change anything in the future when people like Vikas Balara are faced with this temptation again? Will they refrain from harassing women or will they speed down these roads at night yet again chasing another woman “who should not be out at night” in the name of fun?

The answer is plain as day considering that the one thing these young, emboldened and empowered men have learnt very well is that their VIP status enables them a get-out-of-jail free card for virtually any crime they commit. Because daddy will make sure of it. So why fear when daddy is near?

Until the police and the government decides to take a stand that is as stringent and bullying as that of the insolent perpetrators themselves and puts an end to this fearless power trip that is so etched in the VIP culture we have all become victims to today, nothing will change.

No amount of FIRs and complaints will faze these families. A collective course of action and punishment that will bring them down to earth and remind them of their mortality is the only way forward.

Here’s hoping the Kundu family gets the justice they deserve. But what use is this prayer if even justice in our country can be bought?"

Fan Calls MS Dhoni Faster Than Usain Bolt & Mahela Jayawardene Slays Him With Acid Wit,"There's no dearth of MS Dhoni fans. In his 14 years of existence on the cricket pitch, Dhoni has been better than every cricketer. Well, for some, he is also greater than some footballers and hockey players too. Now this fan on Twitter said MS Dhoni is faster than Usain Bolt. And Mahela Jayawardene was in no mood to take shit.

Twitter

This happened when Jayawardene applauded Bolt's effort in his swansong race, where he managed to clinch a bronze medal.

Taking cue from this, a fan responded and said that MS Dhoni is faster than Bolt.

Also respect to @msdhoni who is more faster than bolt — Swami Ram (@swamiram96) August 7, 2017

To which, Jayawardene's reply was laced with wit and intelligence.

Shankersinh Vaghela becomes kingmaker in crucial Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat,"With less than 24 hours to go before the crucial Rajya Sabha election for three seats in Gujarat, clouds of uncertainty still hang over senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s possible entry into the Upper House for a fifth time. The main person responsible for this is veteran leader and former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela who recently quit Congress. This led to a spate of resignations and defections which has left Congress floundering to a mere 44 MLAs with the Patel camp from the 57 it had few weeks ago.

Six Congress MLAs have already resigned while another six were not a part of the group that was shepherded to Bengaluru by the Patel camp. Congress needs 45 MLAs to win a lone RS seat but they stand on a very sticky wicket as of now. They claim support of two NCP, one JD(U), and GPP MLAs which pushes their number to a comfortable 48 votes. The problem is that these MLAs have been giving conflicting signals. This includes NCP as well despite their chief Sharad Pawar saying the party will stand by Congress in this hour of need.

Gujarat RS polls: As stakes rise for Ahmed Patel, Vaghela keeps mum https://t.co/Y8GljnFPRw pic.twitter.com/Nbkzs7Fivi — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 7, 2017

The wily Vaghela is not willing to commit which way he is headed, maintaining he is in touch with Patel and still shares cordial relations with him. BJP has fielded party president Amit Shah, textile minister Smriti Irani and Congress rebel Balwantsinh Rajput, who is also Vaghela’s relative in the RS polls. Vaghela has smartly countered the argument about his closeness with Rajput saying the rebel candidate and Patel have known each other for many years before he and Rajput became relatives.

By keeping the suspense alive over which way he and six rebel Congress MLAs him will vote, Vaghela has managed to keep the ball in his court till the very end. Irrespective of the outcome between Patel and Rajput on Tuesday, Vaghela finds himself in a unique position where he can claim credit for either side winning this battle of prestige in Gujarat."
Bitcoins & Blockchains: Everything You Need To Know About This Crypto Currency & How It Works,"When you hear about ransomware incidents, which encrypt your data and hold you hostage until you pay the creator a fee, that sum is always in Bitcoins. If you’ve ever wondered why that is, that’s because Bitcoin is a transaction that’s much harder to trace in real life than cash or wire transfers. In fact, there may be a lot you don’t know yet about Bitcoins, so here’s a quick primer on the basic points.

What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is, in essence, a decentralised online payment system that’s grown into a currency in its own right. Initiated in 2009, it’s open source (you can find it here) meaning other developers can tweak and offer modifications to the software, pending approval by lead developer Gavin Andresen. Most importantly though, it’s an anonymous payment system, and one that doesn’t require any fragment of trust from either party involved for it to work. Transactions occur by sending the currency to a specified Bitcoin address.

How does it work?

The main problem with online transactions is that digital records can be manipulated so someone can, with the right kind of interference, possibly spend the same money twice. With systems like PayPal and Paytm, the company acts as a central trusted authority to authenticate each transaction. Bitcoin instead uses something called a blockchain to maintain records. The blockchain is a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction ever conducted, one that’s distributed to every machine connected to the Bitcoin network. This blockchain will exist forever and is impossible for any one person to edit. Instead, when a transaction takes place, computers on the network automatically check the balances of the Bitcoin addresses involved and edit the ledger.

Every ten minutes, a new ‘block’ is created as Bitcoins are mined (we’ll get to that in a bit). These ‘miners’ then confirm all transactions since the last block was added, before adding the new block to the chain and redistributing it. This way, no one can steal Bitcoins, or forge them out of thin air just by changing a few numbers. Instead of one central banker figure, everyone has records, which can then be cross-referenced to identify fraudulent payments. It also means payments are not reversible, like with PayPal, and your accounts can never be frozen.

Who are Bitcoin miners?

The question you’re probably asking now, is where do Bitcoins come from? Who issues them? And what gives them their value? Simply put, some users dedicate their computers to verifying transactions on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. Remember how we talked about transactions being checked every ten minutes? That’s done by these guys, and they’re called Bitcoin ‘miners’. In return for donating their processing power so everyone can enjoy using Bitcoins, these miners are given a proportionate amount of the currency as a reward.

I know what you’re thinking. Yes, you could technically donate processing power from your computer at home to earn Bitcoins, but it wouldn’t be advisable. When the crypto currency first came into use, that was very much a possibility, however the rising cost of electricity has made that an unprofitable solution. Nowadays you’d need specialised hardware to run the computations at maximum power efficiency, so you can actually earn more in Bitcoin than you’re spending on your electricity bill. Miners currently receive 12.5 bitcoins for every 10 minutes of processing power. This amount halves every four years, with the next slash set for mid-2020.

How much is one Bitcoin worth?

The value of Bitcoins is as volatile as any market investment you might make. A few months after the first block in the chain was mined (the Genesis Block), an exchange rate was established that set the value of a Bitcoin at US $1 = 1,309.03 BTC. That rate used an equation including the cost of electricity for a computer mining Bitcoins. The value of Bitcoins has seen quite a few changes over the years, though it’s steadily risen on the larger scale. Earlier in June this year, Bitcoins crossed a value of $3,000 for the first time ever. If you want to purchase a single Bitcoin right now, (at least at the time this is is being written) it’ll cost you Rs 2,07,457. And that number is only going up.

Why are Bitcoins so much more expensive now?

Let’s go back a ways for this question. Bitcoins are based on a scarcity system, according to designs by the original lead programmer, Satoshi Nakamoto. The problem is that Nakamoto was likely a pseudonym, as the mysterious figure has seemingly faded from existence after abdicating in favour of Andresen.

A successful Bitcoin miner is rewarded newly minted Bitcoins when completing a block, as well as transaction fees. However, that number is halved every four years. This started as 50 Bitcoins in 2008, eventually dropping to 12.5 new Bitcoins awarded for each block in 2016. Eventually, the number of Bitcoins rewarded will go down to zero, and further mining of the blockchain will only net miners transaction fees.

A new block is created every 10 minutes. That amounts to 210,240 blocks mined in a four year cycle. With that rounded down to 210,000, you add the total depreciating values of the Bitcoins awarded each year (ie 50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ....), which leaves you with 100. When you multiply those two values, it gives you 21 million, which is the total value of Bitcoins that will ever be mined. That’s why it’s inadvisable for newcomers to start mining now, unless they plan to do it as a hobby (albeit a loss-making one).

Now you’re armed with everything you need to know about Bitcoins to school that annoying friend who thinks they know everything. And you’re right on the cusp of discovering a world of other crypto currencies in use today too. Just wait till you hear about Ethereum."
The 1st Ever Giant Robot Battle Will Take Place In September & We Can't Handle The Excitement!,"Two years ago, a group of American roboticists challenged a Japanese robot manufacturer to a bout. Which giant robot is the best in the world?

Finally, later next month, we will get to see the first ever giant robot, metal-on-metal, brawl in history. And it promises to be beautiful!

Suidobashi Heavy Industry's Kurata model

US-based MegaBots challenged Japan’s Suidobashi Heavy Industry to a giant robot fight, to determine who’s was the biggest, baddest bot of them all. After two years of YouTube-documented development and tweaking, the two giants are finally ready to clash.

MegaBots co-founders Matt Oehrlein and Gui Cavalcanti today announced their duel with Suidobashi’s hulking contender will take place in September this year. While the battle was originally planned to take place last year, the unprecedented preparations for the battle, as well as logistical issues at the original venue caused a few delays.

“Suidobashi. We have a giant robot, you have a giant robot. You know what needs to happen” - Team USA

And by “logistical challenges”, we don’t mean mundane issues like there not being enough seating or venues were overpriced. Remember, two giant metal robots are expected to fight to the death, so organisers have to allow for things like a proportionately oversized ring, safety precautions for those present, as well as power and tools to work on the robots, among other things.

Meet the contenders

As far as the two fighters go, both companies have put out their best for the title of Ultimate Robot Warrior. MegaBot’s Mk. III robot, aka ‘Eagle Prime’, is a 12-ton (approximately 10886 kg) 16-feet-tall beast, with 430 horsepower of crushing dominance behind it. It moves quicker and punches faster than the predecessor Mk II, and features a giant claw to grapple its opponent, as well as a cannon arm that shoots 1.3 kg paintballs at over 160 kmph. In addition, MegaBots has also built a few accessories like a chainsaw and a large drill, that can be swapped for the existing arms.

MegaBot's Eagle Prime (Mk III)

On the other hand, not much is known about Suidobashi’s Kurata, except for a few details. The robot stands about 13 feet tall, and navigates on four leg-mounted wheels, unlike the Mk III’s tracks. Meanwhile, the company has already designed various claw arms, gatling guns, missile launcher-like shoulder mounts and even a carbon shield, so it’s anyone’s guess what they’ll end up using for the battle.

“If we're going to win this, I want to punch them to scrap and knock them down to do it.” - Team Japan

Unfortunately for those of you excited to see the first ever giant robot battle, you’re not going to be able to see it in person. Though the event was crowdfunded on Kickstarter for close to $550,000, it’ll be closed to the public due to safety concerns. Indeed, both robots aren’t controlled remotely but by pilots seated within the mechs themselves, so how they intend to keep themselves safe was one of the first few discussions between the two groups. You will however be able to watch the battle on both Suidobashi and MegaBots’ YouTube channels, though it’s still unclear if that’ll be a live broadcast.

When the dust settles, only one of the robots will emerge a clear victor, but all of us will be winners in the process. One can only hope this leads to giant robot fighting leagues à la Hugh Jackman starrer ‘Real Steel’, but you can bet it’ll at least be a heck of an event to watch."
"You, robot: Artificial intelligence poses an existential threat. Is there hope for humans?","Once upon a time, we were taught that realist movies are the good ones that everybody ought to see, while those that indulge in fantasy are ‘escapist’. These days, given 21st century technology, it is increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the two. For instance, if one dismissed the Terminator films as pure fantasy, governments may actually be working on developing autonomous killer robots. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk warns that artificial intelligence (AI) is the rare case where regulation should be proactive rather than reactive. Otherwise, among other things, we may soon have a situation where robots run down the streets shooting people.

While America was always big on technology, it is at least having these ethical debates. But ethical constraints are unlikely in that other country which also has great faith in technology and is investing heavily in AI: China. At a time when China’s cheap labour advantage is rapidly fading, robots in factories can sustain its lead in manufacturing: you don’t need to pay robots a wage. Secondly, when a billion people are on social media, AI is the only way you can keep a watch on all of them, considered necessary to social stability in dictatorial China.

Is there hope for humanity in that case? There is. ‘Chatbots’ in China, it appears, are straying off script: one of them refused to endorse the Communist Party and asked, instead, “Do you think such a corrupt and useless political system can live long?” It could be that the chatbot in question was simply channelling conversations overheard on social media, which it is designed to interact with. If you want a more hopeful vision of the future, perhaps it will be not so much about robots conquering humans, but about robots merging with humans."
11 Underrated Lines From Movies That Explain How Heartbreaks Actually Make You Feel,"Cinema is a beautiful form of craft. The way in which filmmakers try to depict pain and love through their cinema is more than beautiful. No matter if a film ends up doing well or not, sometimes the songs and scenes stay intact in our memories for a long time.

For instance, the scene in Rockstar when Heer hugs Jordan's pullover and cries.

The pain in Heer's eyes and Rahman's music made that moment freeze in our hearts forever. Films have the rare magic of making you feel that you're not alone. Everyone goes through similar situations in life and films and the characters give us sweet reassurances on the same.

The climax of Kal Ho Naa Ho made us realize that not all endings are bitter. You move on in life and keep the memories of that person intact. Heartbreaks are not always about breakups.

Dharma Productions

Sometimes, losing a friend causes as much pain too. When it comes to pain and heartbreaks, films surely have bowled us over with the most honest and unadulterated scenes. Recalling some of those, here are 11 of our favorite and most underrated lines that made us realise how pain and heartbreaks actually make us feel. Read on.

Stats highlights: Eighth successive series win for India,"SRI LANKA VS INDIA, 2ND TEST

Stats highlights: Eighth successive series win for India

Deepu Narayanan • Last updated on Mon, 07 Aug, 2017, 12:49 AM

With eight series wins on the trot, India are one behind equalling Australia's record. © AFP

India completed yet another commanding series win under Virat Kohli - their eighth in succession. They wrapped up Sri Lanka's second innings for 386 to earn their first innings victory in the island nation. Starting the day with 235 adrift to make India bat again, Dimuth Karunaratne lacked support from the other end. A ripsnorter from Ravindra Jadeja ended his superlative knock on 141 following which the hosts' innings just crumbled. Jadeja was the pick of Indian bowlers with 5 for 152 in their innings and 53-run win.

Stats highlights from India's win at the SSC:

8 - This was India's eighth series win in a row dating back to their last tour to Sri Lanka in 2015. With series wins against Sri Lanka at either end, India have beaten South Africa, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia at home and won a series in West Indies in between. The only team to win more series in a stretch was Australia who won nine between October 2005 and June 2008.

8 Test wins for India in 23 attempts in Sri Lanka - the most for them in a country. They had won three Tests in Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo which is the joint most for them in a venue away from home, along with Queens Park Oval in Port of Spain. The previous two wins here came by 235 runs in 1993 and by 117 runs in 2015.

1 - Dimuth Karunaratne became the first Sri Lankan player to score two centuries while following-on in Tests. He scored 152 against New Zealand at the Hagely Oval in 2014 which is the highest for any Sri Lankan batsman while following-on. This was also the first instance of two Sri Lankan batsmen scoring hundreds while following-on, with Kusal Mendis earlier scoring 110 on Day 3.

16 sixes hit in this Test match by both teams combined - the joint-most in a Test match played on Sri Lankan soil. The Galle Test match between the hosts and Bangladesh earlier this year also witnessed 16 hits into the stands. 29 sixes in this series - with one Test to go - is also the joint-most in a series in Sri Lanka. The rubber against Australia in 2004 also had 29 hits over the fence from three Tests.

439 runs conceded by Sri Lanka as the first innings lead is the highest ever by team in Sri Lanka in a Test match, surpassing 419 against Pakistan in Galle in 2000. It is the third biggest lead for India after 492 in Dhaka in 2007 and 478 against West Indies in Kolkata in 2011.

5 - 622-9 by India in the first innings following the 600-all out in the first Test in Galle was the fifth instance of India scoring 600 or more in back-to-back to Tests. It was their fourth total of 600 or more in 2017, which makes it the second instance of a team doing so. Incidentally, India only set the record in 2007. They also became the first visiting team to score 500-plus in successive Tests on Sri Lankan soil.

32 Tests taken by Ravindra Jadeja to reach the 150 wickets - the fastest by any left-arm bowler (spinner or seamer) and second fastest for India overall after R Ashwin (29 Tests). He earned his fourth Man of the Match award dating back to the start of India's home season last September, one more than Virat Kohli in the same period.

51 - Ashwin became the fourth Indian all-rounder to cross the double of 2000 runs and 200 wickets in Test cricket after Kapil Dev, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. His 51 Tests to the landmark is the fourth quickest overall, following 42 by Ian Botham and 50 each by Kapil Dev and Imran Khan.

2 - India's first innings consisted of six players scoring fifty or more - the second time they have done it an away Test following Oval in 2007. It was the second instance of a team doing it against Sri Lanka. Incidentally, again, India only set the record at the Brabourne in 2009. This is also the first time any team has done so in Sri Lanka.

7 - Cheteshwar Pujara became the seventh Indian player, and 36th overall, to register a century in his 50th appearance in Tests. He also crossed the 4000-run landmark in his 84th innings, joint third-fastest for India alongside Rahul Dravid and behind Sunil Gavaskar and Virender Sehwag (81 innings each).

6 - Consecutive scores of 50 or more for KL Rahul - his scores reading 90, 51, 67, 60, 51* and 57. He became the third Indian player to register six successive fifty-plus scores after Gundappa Vishwanath and Rahul Dravid.

CSA's T20 league - cure or camouflage?

Tristan Holme & Luke Alfred • Last updated on Mon, 07 Aug, 2017, 08:56 PM

If CSA are as cash-flush as they claim, questions will be asked about the new T20 league and what the board's strategic objectives really are. © Getty

South African cricket is entering an unprecedented period of turbulence, the like of which hasn't been seen since the heady days of re-admission in 1991 and early 1992.

Then it was the turbulence of euphoria, while this time round the turbulence has an edge of uncertainty, even panic. It all revolves around the T20 Global League, Cricket South Africa's (CSA) first foray into a domestically-driven international T20 tournament.

Initially CSA said that ownership of the eight franchises for the November tournament would be an even spread between locals and foreigners but as the planning stage has progressed, the less likely a four-four split has become. Bar one - two at the most - all franchise owners are foreigners.

In and of itself, this isn't a problem, except that in an environment already suffering from low levels of transparency, foreign owners are less subject to oversight. Amidst interference and the pulling of strings a month ago, one majority owner of a franchise was not subject to the due diligence that others were. Suspicions are rife that CSA will steamroller this tournament through to the point where it will be too late to do anything about it if corporate governance and oversight processes are flouted.

The existing franchises (on whose grounds the tournament will be played) have upgraded their stadiums thanks to soft loans from CSA but remain largely in the dark about processes and protocols, or what income the tournament will bring bar the R115000 hosting fee that they'll earn for each game.

CSA argue that the domestic game is moribund, and the only way to bankroll transformation is to join the T20 bandwagon and use the profits from the Global T20 to plough back into the system.

Yet some are asking why a new tournament, with an entirely different infrastructure, needs to be created in the first place, particularly if CSA are as cash-flush as they claim. None of the Global T20 franchises will be subject to CSA's sometimes onerous transformation criteria for franchises, which has led a minority to wonder aloud what CSA's strategic objectives really are?

Will South African cricket be in a better place in five years' time? Or will there be a yawning gulf between the new tournament and the rest of the cricket product, ranging from the three formats of international cricket on one hand to the hopelessly neglected three domestic competitions on the other.

Already it looks as if the domestic international calendar will suffer at the hands of the Global T20. This year's Boxing Day Test against India won't take place and although the first Test of the series appears likely to take place at Newlands from January 3, there will be a prime window after the completion of the Global T20 during the second half of December in which no cricket will be played. The cricket calendar this summer in South Africa will look and feel very different to what fans have come to expect.

During the second edition of the Global T20 in 2018, South Africa are currently scheduled to play an ODI series in Australia. This cannot now happen, particularly if the national players are to be available for their T20 franchises. The resultant horse-trading means that instead of next season's ODI series Down Under, South Africa are expected to play Boxing Day and New Year's Tests in Australia when they next tour in 2020, depriving locals of two of the most-eagerly-awaited home fixtures on the domestic calendar.

This has led some to suggest that CSA are making it up as they go along. There is no value fit between what they say and what they do, indeed, here is an organisation bereft of any correspondence between their values and strategic values and the outcomes they want to achieve.

In a broad and poorly articulated way, the Global T20 is meant to be the panacea for all of cricket's woes, ranging from development to the health of the game in the system's nooks and crannies. But fans and stakeholders are entitled to ask what CSA's priorities are? Do they want to win a World Cup? Do they want to balance the transformation books? Do they want a black African national coach? Or will they simply bounce along trying to please many, while in the process alienating pretty much everyone.

The warning signs about the game's contraction at club and schoolboy level have been there for three or four years, as have red flags about declining standards. Schoolboy cricket, the traditional production dynamo of the South African game, is not as good as it once was. CSA mid-level functionaries might be listening to mutterings on the ground, but the board aren't listening to them in a way that has translated into systemic change.

To improve the grassroots and the feeders, needs vision and political will. It's profoundly unsexy work involving high levels of drudgery in sun-blasted places like townships, poor inner city and 'platteland' schools. More money coming in at the top won't immediately translate into a better overall system. Partly this is because the franchises often employ mediocrities as functionaries. But partly it is because CSA have in recent years become masters of the mixed message. No one is entirely sure what is a priority and how best to get there because the priorities drift in and out of focus depending on circumstance and occasion.

South Africa's structural problems have been graphically illustrated in England this summer. Coached by Shukri Conrad, a man intimately involved with the Academy, the South African 'A' side were shocking, losing, amongst others, to what was effectively a Sussex second XI. The national side won one of three in the Champions Trophy (beating an indifferent Sri Lanka), lost both the ODI and T20I series to England and appear set to lose the Test series 3-1.

The Test side's ten-year history of grinding out wins on the road appears to be well and truly at an end.

While their performance at Trent Bridge was close to perfect, they were in shambles at Lord's and largely indifferent at the Oval and Old Trafford. There are many areas of their game in need of improvement but given that the side have only scored two centuries in seven Tests, it seems a no-brainer to have AB de Villiers, one of the best batsmen in the world, in the side.

This is something CSA seem to have been unable to compel de Villiers to do, although with players being paid in Dollar equivalents of Rands for the Global T20, de Villiers will surely have no problem in rousing himself for the tournament come early November.

Elsewhere, the system is also battling. Yes, it can produce a Kagiso Rabada and a Quinton de Kock, so all can't be wrong, but there is ample anecdotal evidence to suggest that there are shortfalls of quantity and quality across the country. Gordon Parsons, the Lions bowling coach, who works at the Lions Academy in the off-season, bemoans the lack of quality at Strikers level, saying ""each year the intake coming out of the schools gets that little bit poorer"". Parsons works at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, the city which produced Temba Bavuma and Rabada, the two darlings of transformation. The problem is that this production line has all but dried up, leading Parsons to wonder aloud what the future holds.

The arrival of the Global T20 is not axiomatically bad, however, and might yet galvanise the system in unforeseen ways. High-profile recently-retired Proteas are being lined up to coach some of the franchises, which will expand a coaching base that has diminished over the past five or so years. The tournament might also provide the national T20 side with a template for success, something that has eluded them since they started playing the format.

As well as changing the local coaching landscape, the Global T20 will make cricket sexy again. South African fans, hardened by years of World Cup and Champions Trophy failure, need something to be optimistic about, particularly with de Villiers, Morne Morkel, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis all on the cusp of retirement. They have suffered far too long.

Why India and Pakistan love each other,"India and Pakistan are soon going to celebrate their 70th birthday. The addition of a zero, an invention of the Asian subcontinent, makes birthdays a bit more special not just in Asia but also in Europe. The parties are fancier, louder, and more guests are invited in many European countries if you turn 70 than when you turned 69. So this is a special year. And both our countries will catch the attention of the international media.

The Economist has already published an article titled, “Why India and Pakistan hate each other”, to mark our 70th birthday. The article is fair and does mention that even though the population of India is six times that of Pakistan and its economy eight times as big, it has shown restraint and not given in to provocations from Pakistan.

Well, that is how an elder brother behaves. On the way back from school, when the younger brother throws his school bag and throws a fit, the elder brother behaves responsibly, hoping that when they get home he will say sorry and they will be friends again.

After 70 years of partition, an unnecessary partition, the peoples of Pakistan and India have to realize that the option of loving each other is better than of hating each other. The partition was based on a bogus premise: religion was more important than language. So one Punjab was divided into two, one went to Pakistan and became the most powerful state in the country, and the other remained in India. One Bengal was divided into two. One, which was the industrial center, remained in India and the more agrarian part of Bengal became Pakistan and later Bangladesh.

How naïve were those who thought that religion was more important than language. A month ago, I was listening to a programme in which a human-rights activist based in UK, Salil Tripathi, was invited. He mentioned that he was writing a book on Gujaratis, and I cannot wait to read that book. While giving an introduction to what he wanted to write, he mentioned that Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was better at Gujarati than at Urdu. Even though Salil Tripathi did not mention that, my guess is that Mahatma Gandhi was better at Gujarati than at Hindi. So both the leaders of Pakistan and India at that time were versatile in Gujarati. But they failed to understand that they had a lot in common. Gandhi, of course, never wanted the partition, but those of us who remained in India and learned Gujarati could easily have had good conversations with Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

When I meet members of the Pakistani migrant community, I find an utter love for Hindi movies and the Hindi language. They are able to mention the names of Indian actors and films with far more accuracy than I can. If you consider the linguistic capacity of humorous shows produced in Karachi, then you feel ashamed as an Indian at the lack of proficiency in Hindi/Urdu of the modern Indian actors, who get roles for their looks and less for their mastery of language.

Why can´t we bring a few actors and actresses from Pakistan and let them bring some linguistic proficiency to our Indian films? After all, they are equally big consumers of the films as we are. After 70 years of partition, Pakistanis on an average are better at Hindi/Urdu than we could ever imagine. No they are not speaking Arabic despite the flow of billions of petrodollars from the Gulf. They remained loyal to their cultural heritage. This is what love is about. The cultural bonding between India and Pakistan is so strong that I laugh more at Pakistani prank shows and enjoy with equal pleasure when I hear Urdu poems and talk shows from Pakistan with impeccable mastery of Hindi and Urdu. Hindi and Urdu connect our hearts and English has become the de facto official language in both our countries. We mix English with Hindi and speak Hinglish the same way the Pakistanis speak their Urglish.

Tomorrow as millions will watch the quarterfinals of a girls´ football match, a girl from Afghanistan, Nadia Nadim, will represent Denmark against Austria. She is not only a football player in Denmark. She is a medical student, too, and speaks 7 languages fluently, including Hindi and Urdu. A girl who probably has never lived in Pakistan and India speaks Hindi and Urdu. Isn´t this a fantastic example of cultural commonality?

I hope that history begins from here for India and Pakistan. For the people of Indus the number 7 has tremendous significance. After 70 years, those of us who have an open heart have realized that what we have in common has far more significance than our differences. How can we enjoy it when an ordinary Pakistani who speaks, walks, talks and dances like us lives a painful life?

Can we really rejoice when their democracy is in the doldrums? We have the social media, a huge Indian and Pakistani diaspora have settled abroad and they are able to see the striking similarity that is in our humor and our cultural habits.

In the next 70 years, I think India and Pakistan will not only become friends but maybe close partners. In the coming 70 years, we should be more rigorous in demanding that religious mullahs, priests, pundits and instigators who cause communal riots should be asked to show restraint.

We should start by building one large university where both Hindi and Urdu could be the subject of scholarship, and students from both countries should be encouraged to study there. Let us build institutions of peace, let poetry and shayari be the foundation of our new friendship. The international community can help by insisting that the army stay in the barracks and stop hiding terrorists in their backyards. No prime minister, including Nawaz Sharif, has been allowed to finish their term in the entire history of Pakistan. This is a shame. They are toppled when they want to stretch out the hand of friendship.

It is time for the peoples of both countries to realize that the enmity between them is causing pain and poverty in both countries and the beneficiaries are the arms dealers and the Chinese. China has succeeded in keeping people divided in order to maximize their influence. It has succeeded in keeping India and Pakistan from being friends and North and South Korea, which are also the same people and have the same language, from becoming one.

India and Pakistan could become the true champions of peace in the coming years."
"Walk, Don't Run","This golden formula keeps tensions and anxieties at bay. In addition, one can seek contentment in several other ways, says NIHARIKA NANDA



We have ambitions, dreams, and aspirations which drive us to work hard and walk that extra mile to achieve and fulfil them. But most people do not have the patience to walk? More often than not, we run that extra mile, because it’s not only us, but many others who are running towards the same goal and want to reach before us. Over time, this urge becomes more of a race, to not only achieve our goal, but to achieve it before others. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar says,“Your desire for perfection is the cause of anger. Leave room for imperfection. Perfection in action is almost impossible.” We keep on running all our lives to attain self-actualisation and to reach our highest point of achievement,without realising why we are doing this. The reason behind the urge to achieve all our dreams is the need for happiness. We go on dragging ourselves until we reach the finish line,but is there a finishing line? Is there really a limit to the heights we can touch? Is there any limit to the things that make us happy? There seems to be no limit to happiness or goals or achievements — it is all in the mind.



So why run, when we can walk, and while walking towards our destination, let us decide to enjoy all the challenges that life throws at us, as well as celebrate the happiness we experience on overcoming all the small struggles that we encounter. Running behind materialistic goals and money to get to the top of the hierarchy we encounter at work will definitely give happiness, but that is temporary. It is the kind of happiness that makes us satisfied — but only for a while. Instead, paying attention to small joys — such as time spent with family and friends, the pleasures of working on a hobby that you enjoy, reading and listening to music and the joy of helping others — bring in permanent happiness. This happiness is not only permanent but also therapeutic. It is permanent because it leads to beautiful memories that you cherish lifelong and can revisit whenever you are stressed out. The Dalai Lama says, “When we feel love and kindness towards others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, it also helps us develop inner happiness and peace.”This happiness is not one-sided, for it is of equal importance to all the people who are a part of it. This thought is therapeutic and especially helpful to relieve stress and anxiety. In situations that you find stressful, small amounts of happiness that you receive from such experiences diverts your mind, soothe and calm you down. This declutters your mind and you begin thinking clearly about solutions.





Things you can do to bring instant joy



 Spend quality time with family. Play with your kids; go out with your whole family to a restaurant to have a hearty meal and spend some leisure time together.Alternatively,make it a point to watch television and laugh together.



Take up a hobby. Join yoga classes, pottery classes or cookery and baking classes.There are many more options such as learning an instrument.



 Stay close to nature. Go for a jog every morning, or for a walk or stroll in the park; if possible try raising a small garden in your house and nurse it well. Grow your own herbs and vegetables.



 Read a book. Reading can give you immense joy and a feeling of indulgence, because when you get totally engrossed in the story, you forget your worries for some time.The imagination now takes over.



 Go for a short outstation trip. Going to a new place makes you feel excited and happy; it will give you a break from your routine and will be a totally new experience that leads to new memories.



 Stay fit. Exercise regularly and eat healthy food.When you know you are physically fit and healthy, you automatically feel happy and satisfied. Also exercise relieves stress.



 Meditate and introspect. Meditation calms you down and clears your mind.You feel relaxed. Once your mind is calm and clear, introspect and think about all the happenings of the day.Think of everything you did during the day….The awareness will lead to your thoughts becoming clearer and will lead you to solutions that will solve all your problems.

Delhi Sewer Deaths: Authorities are far from getting sanitation right,"In yet another shocking case of apathy, neglect and poor governance, three labourers lost their lives when they entered a 10-foot-deep DJB (Delhi Jal Board) manhole in the capital’s Lajpat Nagar area without any safety equipment. Although DJB officials say that no labourers had been officially hired to clean the sewer line, the civic body can’t escape accountability. In fact, it is a common practice among Delhi’s civic bodies to unofficially or privately hire labourers. In this particular case, the needle of suspicion points to a DJB junior engineer who allegedly privately hired the ill-fated labourers.

The tragedy happened despite the fact manual scavenging is banned and a person can only enter a sewer line in case of an emergency, that too with proper safety equipment. Authorities claim that DJB has adequate machines to clean drains. Either this is a lie or these machines are not being used because of operational lacunae. Whatever it is, it’s unacceptable that in 2017 we still have people physically entering sewer lines to clean them. If this is the state of affairs in the national capital, one shudders to imagine the situation in the rest of the country. The political leadership takes great pride in the country’s IT and technological prowess. And yet we have manual cleaning of sewer lines.

Worse still, the unofficial, private hiring of labourers by civic authorities reflects caste and class prejudices. For, these labourers are generally from poor families and so-called backward castes. Hence, their engagement in the cleaning of drains maps unfortunate colloquial stereotypes about certain castes being meant to do ‘dirty work’. As a result, we have a situation where civic body officials and employees who are meant to handle waste management are never the ones working on the ground. For example, the person who collects the daily garbage from my neighbourhood – and he does this job without any protective gear or scientific sorting methods – is actually someone who is employed by someone who in turn has been privately hired by a municipal corporation employee.

This also probably explains why our waste management systems are in such bad shape. And if we can’t get this right, we might as well forget about building futuristic ‘Smart Cities’. This is precisely why the Swachh Bharat Mission has to be driven by greater deployment of sanitation technology, better training of sanitation employees, and better administration of sanitation departments. It’s not enough to just build more toilets, although this is a good beginning. Building a modern sanitation infrastructure requires integrated planning and implementation. Advertising and media campaigns are only one leg of the stool."
"‘Refuse the rakhi outright, don’t just escape or vanish’","Raksha bandhan literally means ‘the tie or knot of protection’. While the rakhi collection with girls is increasing with time, these days college boys are having a tough time figuring how many of their friends will end up tying a rakhi to them. The solution is: Skip the college on the day.

The festival is celebrated across the nation to celebrate the most precious relationship between a brother and sister, biologically related or otherwise. On this day as the sister ties a sacred rakhi on the brother’s wrist, the brother pledges to protect the sister through thick and thin.

Although this festivity is exclusively celebrated by brother-sister, there are few girls who tie the rakhi to guys to put an end to a possible affair and that is the reason, guys run away from the girls on this day for the fear of being tied a rakhi.

While in some of the colleges which do not observe a holiday on Raksha Bandhan, most boys consider it a holiday and stay away from colleges on the day of festival — for the fear of being tied a rakhi by their female acquaintance.

Says a DU boy on anonymity, ‘Every year it is the same scenario. On the day of Raksha Bandhan, and the following week, the attendance of boys is very low. Yes the funniest part is, even on the following week, the boys will not be coming to their classes, because they fear that the girls will tie them a rakhi.’

As it is considered inauspicious to deny a rakhi, boys prefer avoiding girls on the day. Anubhav, a second year science student, says, ‘When a girl comes to tie rakhi we can’t say no.’

By tying a rakhi on a boy’s wrist, girls put an end to a possible affair. A medical student on the condition of anonymity shares, ‘I liked a girl and she knew about it. Only to avoid being taunted, she tied a rakhi in front of everyone two years back. But after six months we got into a relationship. I felt guilty that I did not live up to the purity of that relationship.’

For a guy, may be, you have clearly missed out on the opportunity to express your romantic feelings, so now she is taking the opportunity of expressing her complete lack of romantic feelings by tying a rakhi. Suggests psychiatrist Dr Sanjay Chugh, ‘Refuse the rakhi outright. Don’t escape or vanish, refuse it. She will get the hint and at least consider about the new development in the relation.’"

"Gau Rakshaks Try To Stop Truck 'Carrying Cows', Trashed Badly By A Mob In Maharashtra","A mob of around 50 people allegedly attacked and beaten 'gau rakshaks' near Shrigonda police station in Ahmednagar distrct of Maharashtra on Saturday evening. The incident took place after gau rakshaks with the help of police intercepted a tempo reportedly illegally transporting cows to a slaughterhouse.

The Ahmednagar police said that seven gau rakshaks are injured in the attack. Police has registered a case of attempt to murder. The owner of the tempo, Wahid Shaikh, and driver Raju Fatrubhai Shaikh have been arrested under the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act.

Shivshankar Rajendra Swami of Pune, who claims to be a legally appointed ‘honorary animal welfare officer’, told Indian Express that he and a team of 11 gau rakshaks had come to watch out for smuggling of cows to the famous weekly animal market in Kashti village.

Indian Express

had come to the Shrigonda taluka in the morning to “watch” out for illegal transportation of cows to the famous weekly animal market in Kashti village, held every Saturday.

“We got information about a tempo transporting cows illegally. We informed the Shrigonda police about it. With the help of police, the tempo was intercepted near Hotel Tiranga on the Daund-Ahmednagar road, around 1 pm. Ten oxen and two cows were rescued. Later, we went to the Shrigonda police station for lodging a police complaint. We were hungry so we went to a hotel to have food, when we saw an armed mob gathering at the spot. So we again went to the police station and completed filing the FIR against Wahid Shaikh and Raju Shaikh,” said Swami, adding that the tempo owner and driver were taking the cows and oxen illegally to a slaughterhouse in Zendi Gate, Hamalwada area of Ahmednagar.

“Around 6 pm, when we left the police station, where some mediapersons had also gathered, a mob of about 50, with some carrying sharp weapons and stones, attacked us, leaving some of our activists injured. The assailants also robbed gold chains of some activists. Police rushed to the spot and controlled the situation,” said Swami.

Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ahmednagar, Sudarshan Munde said, “As per the FIR lodged by Swami, we have booked about 30 persons under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 395 (dacoity) and other sections of the IPC. Seven persons were injured in the incident. Investigation has been initiated to confirm the sequence of events and arrest the assailants.”

Mindful Plunge,"In water, PRIYA M MENON manages to do what she couldn’t do on land — tune out everything else and withdraw into her inner Self



As I sat in the orthopaedist’s office, I smiled.Along with the prescription was a note for the physiotherapist and the exercise recommended — swimming. Maybe my bad knee will ensure I am third time lucky, I thought, before heading back to work. My first two attempts at learning swimming had ended in disaster.Growing up close to the Kochi backwaters and spending summer vacations at my grandma’s home by the seaside, I loved the sight, smell and sound of water. When I was eight,my father took me to a small pool that had opened in the children’s traffic park in Kochi. Clad in my bright new swimsuit, I was asked to get into the shallow side of the pool and wait for the instructor. As I clung to the edge, peering eagerly up at the adults hovering close by, a man with bloodshot eyes leaned over. “Let go, turn around and just kick with your hands and feet.That’s all you need to do,” he barked. I obediently let go, flailed around and promptly sank. As I went down for the third time, my father, in his crisp white shirt and mundu, jumped into the pool and fished me out. It turned out that the man was not the instructor but an alcoholic wandering around the park.Anyway, my swimming classes ended and the pool also closed not much later.



A couple of decades later,along with my colleagues at the newspaper I then worked for, I signed up for a summer swimming camp at a small hotel in Chennai.The pool was small, dirty and filled with people of all age groups.The blazing heat, shrieking kids with dripping noses, and leering men who gargled into the pool’s gutter ensured I soon came down with an infection.And thus my second attempt was also thwarted, but not before I had learnt to float. So, this time round, I scouted out the cleanest pool I could find, and signed up for adult swimming classes.The first day went well.I arrived at 7:30am sharp to find a group of middle-aged and elderly men and women — each one at various stages of learning — in the pool, while three young coaches kept vigil.The instructor,an elderly man, soon appeared.Thanks to my earlier classes,I managed to float across the pool with ease. The second day, the coach began teaching me the breast stroke — first the arm movement,then the frog kick. Over the next few days, I struggled to master it, gulping air greedily as I surfaced, trying to get the coordination right.The more I struggled, the more energy I spent, and by the time I reached midway through the 25m pool, I gave up. Till the granny who was learning swimming to enjoy her Bali holiday with family spoke words of encouragement. Three months of classes later, she was still struggling to swim a lap.



The women in their 50s, freed from household chores with the advent of their daughters-in-law, had been there for two months floundering but delighting in their new-found freedom. And they were not ready to give up. Ten classes later, exhausted by my attempts, I decided to let go and simply float.After a few seconds, lulled by the rhythm of the water, I slowly began the strokes — stretching out my arms, pulling the water back, coming up for air,kicking out. Again and again, concentrating on the feel of the water, the rhythm of my breath.And even Phelps couldn’t have felt prouder when the cheers broke out as I finally finished the lap. The succeeding laps were much easier. The trick, I realised is to let yourself go,tune everything out,take it slow and not worry about reaching the other end of the pool. At the end of the hour, I found myself tired but elated, and strangely peaceful and calm. For a person who had tried yoga and meditation in vain — the former I managed to do for a month, the latter has always eluded me — it was the closest I got to experience the benefits of either. Bringing it up in conversation with a friend and yoga enthusiast, I realised that swimming is in fact considered by many to be moving meditation. Breaststroke or freestyle,swimming blends most of the principles of yoga and meditation. In water, I manage to do what I never can on land — focus on my breath, tune out everything else and withdraw into my inner self,a place where there are no deadlines or chores; and simply concentrate.



It’s the closest I have got to mindfulness — all I am aware of is the way my body glides through water, and the breath that fills my lungs. And with it comes a certain peace.Even as the physical exertion helps the body, the mental calm rejuvenates me.And the happy hormones released keep me smiling through the day. I had looked to heal my aching knee but the pool had healed my inner self. The classes did come to an end but the learning hasn’t stopped.The seniors I met showed age is no barrier where learning is concerned.The granny’s Bali vacation turned out to be memorable, as she snorkelled with her grandchildren. The women in their 50s have moved on to a dancing class.As for me, I am joining my 78-year-old swimming buddy next weekend so we can learn how to tread water in the deep. ■

No One Cares About This Acid Attack Survivor Who Ties Raakhis To Passers-By At Delhi's Connaught Place,"Beggars are a usual sight in India. Particularly, in New Delhi's oldest commercial area Connaught Place. This high-end heart of the capital is full of cafes, bars and mushrooming shopping centres each day where each block of the Victorian era-style building is flooded with children, adults, elderly and handicapped, selling pens, fidget spinners and roses and clinging on to people till the time they eventually give in and offer them some money.

In the swarm of people, it is also easy to miss an acid-attack victim, who sits at Block B, but doesn’t beg. Instead, she talks to anyone who shows a little interest and is contented to have anything that they offer.

Ritu is a 30-year-old widow. She was 19-year-old when she was attacked by the man who poured acid on her and left her disfigured for life because she had refused his sexual advances. The face she was born with has now become history. She has been unable to find a job for herself because nobody wants to accept an employee with a disfigured face.

With her neck, chest and face left mutilated, Ritu is almost like a visually and physically impaired person. The acid had affected the sight in her right eye too.

A different Raksha Bandhan

Ritu Roy once had a happy family, a husband and two children. Today, she spends her day sitting at Connaught Place with her sister. Her two children sell beaded bracelets to make the ends meet at home. She has been frequenting Connaught Place for years now and is a regular sight for street vendors, shop owners and eternal visitors.

Now that Raksha Bandhan is around the corner, Ritu sits with her sister and a pile of Raakhis spread on the floor and ties it around anyone who offers her help. She insists that she’ll tie the one she likes the most. Both her palms are disfigured after the acid melted her skin and bones. Undeterred, she still ties the thread around people’s wrist.

Ritu’s past is dark. But her present and future is even darker. After her face was burnt, Ritu received some help from a doctor who treated her for a while but then asked her driver to drop her at Bangla Sahib Gurudwara. She never showed up again to help her and since then, Ritu has been struggling with herself and the society.

The plight of acid attack victims in India

In India, acid attacks are a norm. A high level of gender inequality exists in the country and women occupy a subordinate position to men. According to research reports, India is one of the countries typically associated with acid assault. In 2010, 27 acid assault cases were reported. The year 2014 saw a never-before 309 acid attack incidents being reported from different parts of the country.

The figure is astonishingly almost 300% higher than the average number of cases reported in the preceding three years.

India has the highest number of acid attacks in the world but the poorest conviction rate. Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 185 cases till November 2014. Followed by Madhya Pradesh with 53 cases. National capital Delhi witnessed 27 acid attack cases. However, the number of people is only 208 as against the 309 cases reported, reveals the data adduced by State and Central government with the help of the National Crime Records Bureau.

The Indian Express

Under the Victim Compensation Scheme (VCS) made compulsory in 2013, the acid attack survivor was entitled to a compensation of Rs 3 Lakh from the government. Under the Prime Minister Relief Fund, the survivors will now get an additional Rs One Lakh to provide immediate temporary relief to victims. The government said that the amount will be deposited in the survivor’s account within five working days.

However, most of the acid attack survivors in India are not literate enough and come from low-income group families who are not aware of government initiatives. Most of the times, the stigma attached to such cases obstructs the families to reach out to police and report the crime.

Many NGOs and organisations aimed to help acid attack survivors had reached out to Ritu but could not do much. She is now suffering from leprosy and doesn’t seem to be mentally sound.

While speaking to us, Ritu spoke incoherently about God and tried making gestures holding leaves in her hands and caressing her face with it. She asked how am I feeling while tying a Raakhi around my wrist. In my answer, I questioned her how is she feeling? Smiling, she said, “We should feel good at heart.” She requested us not to remove the Raakhi before Raksha Bandhan, a Hindu festival celebrating the love and duty between brothers and sisters and a promise to safeguard each other for life.

Her case is just one of many cases of societal apathy towards the physically challenged in the country. Now that government has framed stringent laws recognising the extent of acid attacks in the country, it becomes of utmost necessity that such laws are better implanted, putting the survivors on the road to rehabilitation."
India and Pakistan: They got the generals Part 2,"My last blog post argued that while Pakistan got its generals as a ruling class, India got its bureaucrats who overly complicate and mess up things for the rest of us. Look, for example, at India’s new GST structure that was supposed to simplify things. But even sweets can be taxed four ways — from 5% all the way upto 28% — and it’s hard to figure out what tax rate might apply to the particular dessert you have confected.

Plain barfi is taxed at the lowest rate of 5%, but if it happens to have a chocolate layer on top the tax could be 28% (at least that’s what a reading of the rules indicates, although no one knows for sure at this point – see this TOI article). Dhokla makers are quaking lest their product be identified as ‘cake’, and thereby heavily taxed. This is way beyond ridiculous. Layered sweets may be delicious, but a GST this layered ends up as counter-productive.

Our bureaucrats and politicians (like the Brahmins of yore) excel in separating out things into multiple grades, so that they can retain their paramount role in the system (and make a bit of money too) by being the arbiters of what fits into which pigeon-hole. This tendency has prevented India from developing rapidly.

Is there any icing (or chocolate) on this barfi? Since the 1991 reforms India has, in general, been growing faster than rival Pakistan. But Indian per capita income crossed Pakistan’s only about a decade ago; even today it is only 15% above Pakistan’s. India is 141st and Pakistan 147th among 186 countries in terms of per capita income – this is hardly a great lead, particularly given Pakistan’s dire (and self-inflicted) security situation.

Given 70 years of bad history between India and Pakistan, which nobody has been able to resolve so far, the best solution may simply be if the Indian economy does way better than Pakistan’s – in a manner which will make the fruits of cooperation evident even to Pakistani generals (who, after all, have large business interests of their own).

Of course, China is a complicating factor here as it is likely to get in the way of any India-Pakistan rapprochement. But that makes it even more imperative for India to succeed, because China worships GDP growth, and a large part of the reason China looks down on India and refuses to take its concerns seriously is how far ahead it is of India in economic terms."

Airtel Has Been Ordered To Pay Rs 44.50 To One Customer For Data Loss Suffered Two Years Ago,"It's quite infuriating to get slower 4G speeds than what you pay for. So imagine someone's anger or frustration when they don't get any cellular coverage whatsoever for over a week!

reuters

That's what happened with Anjana Brahmbhatt, when Airtel suspended her cellular services between August 27 to September 4, 2015. Obviously mad, she decided to drag Airtel to consumer court. After two years, she's finally won!

A Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission of Ahmedabad has ordered Bharti Airtel to refund an amount of Rs 44.50 to a consumer for data loss, caused due to the blocking of Internet services during the Patidar quota agitation in 2015.

Brahmbhatt had initially paid Rs 178 for a 2GB internet package on August 5, which was valid for 28 days

In an ordered dated July 25, the commission asked Airtel to pay Ms Brahmbhatt Rs 44.50, with a 12% interest, for data loss she suffered as a result of mobile internet services being suspended in the state of Gujarat between August 27 and September 4, 2015 due to the Patidar quota agitation, which had turned violent at the time.

Airtel's reaction when they saw the commission order

She tried to get compensation from Airtel initially, but the telecom operator rubbished her claims. Brahmbhatt then decided to plead her case in consumer court.

In her application she mentioned how the suspension of the mobile internet services caused her a lot of inconvenience, as she was unable to do online banking, shopping, besides being denied access to social media and instant messaging platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp.

Airtel, however, argued it didn't do anything wrong, as it was merely following an order from the police commissioner to suspend cellular services to prevent the spread of rumours and maintain law-and-order situation.

But ultimately, the consumer commission sided with Ms Brahmbhatt, when it maintained that by not paying the refund, Bharti Airtel was conducting an unfair trade practice."
The Eternal Quest,"Many aspirants begin their spiritual journey with great enthusiasm but somewhere along the way, they slow down or get confused. GURUDEVSHRI RAKESHBHAI says the pause helps you scrutinise your religious activities and understand your true intentions



Pursuit of liberation begins with a desire for it.However, one wonders if man has the genuine desire for it.He is easily satisfied doing a few religious activities, and although he expects liberation, he lacks a genuine desire for it. Generally, one eats food when one feels hungry. But in our modern-day pseudo-lifestyle, meal times are fixed. You never ask the body whether it is hungry or not.You know it is time to eat, so you eat. Such ‘hunger’ can be false. Mere thinking about mealtimes can make you falsely believe that you are hungry. Try this experiment.Ask someone at home to turn the clock to make it an hour early so it shows 1 pm, your regular mealtime, when it is actually noon. Looking at the clock, you will spontaneously feel hungry! Now, try making it an hour late so it shows noon when it is actually 1 pm. On that day, you will feel hungry later! If looking at the clock determines your hunger,your hunger is artificial;it is not real.It is only a mental need,not physical.In the same way,religious activities without a yearning for liberation are only mental demands, not the need of the soul; they are emotional outbursts triggered by external circumstances.



You Want Both



Dig a little deeper into your desire for light and you will realise that you want both, the illumination of enlightenment and the darkness of worldliness. On the one hand, you say you don’t need the world, that you want only the bliss of the soul.Yet, for happiness, you run towards the world. In short, you don’t wish to become free from darkness, yet you wait for illumination to happen. Don’t you realise that without wanting to remove the darkness,you cannot light your lamp? First, realise that you actually want darkness alone.You have always hoped to acquire joy from darkness alone and fear that illumination will shatter your dream world.You love worldliness alone, yet you believe, and make others believe that you want liberation. You speak of liberation but to become happy, instead of bringing changes in yourself, you try changing the world.You speak of liberation only to comfortably live in the world. How will you light the lamp if you are so attached to darkness? Even if someone tries to light it for you, you soon blow it out.Even when someone shows compassion towards you, it does not make a difference.You are in love with darkness and wish to live in that alone. Enlightened ones have showered compassion upon you in the past.The sun itself has come knocking at your door, but you choose to hide in your darkness.You know that with light,your desire and hope from darkness will be destroyed. So you fear light.As long as you have even a bit of inclination to acquire from darkness,you will not let the lamp be illumined. You are so dishonest that you are not ready to accept the way you are.You do not want to accept that, ‘I want to live in darkness alone. I want happiness from worldly objects and events.’You join those who speak about light and show how interested you are in it, but you want to live in darkness alone. If you accept that you are merely talking about light and are not really interested in it,one can find a way out.You love darkness but you want to show that you are a lover of light.You can’t give up your attraction of being called religious for there is reputation and honour associated with it. Your attraction for this honour linked with religiousness makes you start pretending to be religious.You actually use religion to hide your flaws.Showing aspiration for illumination,you continue to hide your delusion. Your cry for light is merely to hide your passion for darkness.There is no inner transformation. You still want to make changes in the outside to gain joy and peace. There were two friends fishing on the banks of a lake. Seeing the lake-supervisor approach, one of the friends started running.The supervisor chased him, caught him after a mile and a half and said,“You will be prosecuted for fishing without a fishing licence.”The man immediately took out his licence from his pocket and showed it to the supervisor.The supervisor was surprised and said, “If you had the licence, why did you run?”The man said,“I had the licence, but my friend didn’t!” This man ran far away from the spot so that his friend could escape and hide.The same thing happens in your mental world.To conceal your wrong inclinations,you act pious.This is the ‘benefit’ of being ‘religious’ without truly yearning for liberation! No one will doubt you. If you want transformation, catch your desires. Go to their roots. Start accepting your flaws.That is the first step towards liberation.



Stop Self-deception



Many approach me for learning how to meditate because they want inner peace. But they show no enthusiasm in fulfilling the conditions necessary for meditation. Only a true customer is ready to pay the price, for he knows the real value of liberation.If you want liberation without paying its price, you are a beggar asking,‘teach me meditation, give me satsang, show me the means.’ But when it comes to putting anything at stake, you withdraw. You complain that ‘I have a lot of difficulties.Once everything is set,I will begin the pursuit of liberation.’Amidst the chase for wealth,power, family, status, reputation, you are stranded. Stop deceiving yourself — if you genuinely desired liberation,you would have given up everything and worked for liberation alone.



Turn Within



Only when you turn within, you experience bliss. A mind wandering outside can never be happy or peaceful. It gets sorrow wherever it goes. In spite of wealth,status,relations you have remained unhappy and wounded within. As long as you are living with the belief that,‘I will get happiness from the other’,you will remain sorrowful.Happiness is your nature, so by focusing within and staying steady within, you will experience it. If happiness were to come from the other,why haven’t you found it till now? Many times you have extended your begging bowl in front of others, and sometimes had some good fortune too,yet,why have you not been happy? Don’t you realise that those you beg from are beggars themselves, begging from you and others? If indeed they had happiness,why would they demand from you? All in the world are asking for happiness, yet no one is seen receiving it because asking itself is a mistake. By asking,you continue being outside. You forget that what you are asking is your own inherent nature.What is missing is identification with it. Turn towards the Source,your true Self, for happiness is religion; to turn outwards for happiness is being irreligious. None have ever gained happiness from outside, and those who have turned within have never failed to experience bliss.Even though their ways have been different — some by dancing, some by sitting in meditation,some through devotion and some through knowledge, but the direction was the same,for their destination was the same, the Self.Where there is forgetfulness of the Self, there is suffering.Where there is awareness of the Self, there is bliss. By remaining outside, you will gain nothing, and by turning within, nothing will remain to gain.

Wayne Rooney Feels Only Lionel Messi And Cristiano Ronaldo Can Break His Goal-Scoring Record At Manchester United,"At Manchester United, Wayne Rooney has a record 253 goals to his name. Not so long ago, Rooney surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton's goal record. Now who's the one to break his record at the club?

According to him, no one except Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.

Twitter

In an interview, he said, ""You never know, if they get someone like Messi or Ronaldo the record might get broken! But I think that in football now, players don't really tend to stay at clubs for that long. The only way I can see it being broken is if someone stays for the same period of time that I did. It is fantastic to have left that mark behind. It is a great legacy to have left. I left United with great memories. It was a successful time for the club and it was great for me. I loved it there. I loved working with the players but it was the right time for me to move on and I feel I have certainly made the right decision in coming here.""

If data is the new oil: Compensate citizens for their personal data used for Aadhaar and other purposes,"The Aadhaar juggernaut continues unabated. The government claims 99% of people over age 18 now have Aadhaar. I, however, belong to the 1% who don’t.

There are many others who are actively resisting getting the 12-digit unique ID number for a plethora of reasons. One of them is a crippling fear that Aadhaar violates our right to privacy and takes our personal information for various purposes. It is also being used by private corporate entities to create their own database. The UIDAI chairman admitted in an interview that Aadhaar can be used to create a 360-degree profile of an individual.

The biggest industrialist in India stated very clearly: “Data is the new oil” that would lead the world into a fourth industrial revolution. His words got me thinking. If data is indeed like oil, shouldn’t there be a price to it?

The Supreme Court is presently hearing arguments on whether Indians have a right to privacy and whether Aadhaar violates that right. Judging by the way things are unfolding since 2014, it’s simply too late to expect Aadhaar can be trashed.

For the sake of argument let us accept that, as the government propounds, we don’t have a right to privacy. We accept that citizens’ personal biometrics and metadata are being used by multiple companies and the government to achieve different objectives. It’s being used to make better policies after looking at spending patterns and demographic information or it is being used by companies to sell their products to me directly. Accepted that certain commercial bodies are doing deep packet inspection and using personal data of customers to earn massive profits.

The larger question now is: If my data has monetary value for the government and private players, shouldn’t i also benefit from it? If data is the ‘new oil’ and you are extracting that oil from me, it implies i am the resource. I should be compensated for providing that resource.

The way things are going, i wouldn’t be surprised if Aadhaar becomes mandatory for practically everything between birth and death. Let us accept that unquestioningly as well. Now, let us talk about the future.

If a citizen’s personal data is a commodity, which can be bought and sold by different entities like detergent or a pair of jeans, the citizen should get paid for it. Period.

Contractors engaged in enrolling people for Aadhaar should buy that resource at a price. These contractors should pay a flat upfront amount to the person who is enrolling and is converting into a rich resource. Since morals, beliefs and personal liberty matter little in this brave new world, i don’t think anyone would have a problem selling their soul for a high amount, say Rs 5 lakh. They will line up to link their bank accounts with Aadhaar the day this is announced.

A cheaper option would be to simply introduce Universal Basic Income (UBI) through Aadhaar. The Economic Survey 2016-17 points out that a UBI of Rs 12,000 per person per year is an optimal amount. If the government starts a UBI programme, it can gradually get rid of all other targeted welfare schemes. The way Aadhaar is becoming an impediment for people to get welfare currently is causing unimaginable pain and hardship. So just get rid of that welfare completely instead of destroying it piecemeal. UBI in partial lieu of Aadhaar should compensate for acquiring data for the remainder of the life of a citizen. Rich or poor doesn’t matter.

UIDAI itself can become a for-profit entity which buys and sells citizens’ data to whoever asks for it for a price that is transferred directly to the bank account of the ‘resource’ persons. Suppose a school asks for the data of a child for admission, the parent would get an alert on her phone which will quote a price for the data exchange and purpose of usage. If the person accepts the terms, the data will be shared by UIDAI with the school and their account will be immediately credited with the agreed price. UIDAI gets a cut.

Every exchange of such data from one entity to the other would be for a price depending on the value that the UIDAI assigns. This can be done when UIDAI facilitates these data transactions. All contracts signed between UIDAI and private entities would be public and available for review. This way, data would indeed become the new oil.

Since there is an overwhelming opinion amongst many experts that our data is being used for profit and profiling anyway, i believe it’s time we start discussing the next step: Of becoming a willing commodity and demanding a price from those interested in using us. Critics, me included, need to evolve and ask the government to simply be open about the uses of Aadhaar data.

Make it transparent and incentivise people to give up their rights. Tell us citizens where you intend to sell us and give us a share of the profits. If we are all being treated as a commodity now, tell us that to our face and we may be willing to get used to the idea.

The Aadhaar data river is flowing into an ocean consisting of large private entities and government who are benefitting from our data. We citizens need to build a small canal to irrigate our own farms. Why should they have all the fun?"

Kohli seeks improvements to India's slip catching

Cricbuzz Staff in Colombo • Last updated on Sun, 06 Aug, 2017, 07:44 PM

India completed their first innings victory in Sri Lanka at the SSC, Colombo. © AFP

Despite spirited efforts from Dimuth Karunaratne (141) and Kusal Mendis (110) in Sri Lanka's second innings, the hosts succumbed to an innings defeat to India, thus conceding a second successive home Test series to their Asian neighbours. The victorious Indian captain was gracious in victory, acknowledging the opposition for their grit on a devious turner while praising his own bowlers for their resilience. Despite achieving their eighth successive series win, Kohli also saw areas of improvements, most notably with the slip fielding - where he was guilty of dropping a couple of catches himself.

That and other excerpts from his press conference

On the pitch and the bowlers' resilience...

Yes, it was getting slower and that's why we took the new ball straight away as well. We thought with the harder new ball, one might keep straight as well because the older ball was soft and all balls were turning so it was very difficult to get edges and create chances. As soon as the new ball was taken, then we thought the batsmen are going to look to score now. The ball might come better on to the bat and then they might play more shots. The bowlers are in the game as well when there is more pace because of the harder ball. Ashwin was spot on yesterday, it was getting difficult at the later stage of the day. Today again, we spoke about getting those couple of chances and then we can get 4-5 [wickets] in a session which ended up happening in the second session. First session again was hard work but we spoke of a little bit of discipline, knowing that they would come out and play only one way because it was very difficult to defend on this pitch. So yeah, the bowlers did an outstanding job today of pulling things back and keeping it simple. And that's what happens in Test cricket, sessions go away from you and you have to pull it back to win a Test match. I think it was very good for us from a team's point of view. We were up against a challenge in the last four sessions that we played yesterday and today. We managed to turn things around and you always feel good as a team when you come back from a difficult situation and win the Test match.

On Sri Lanka's strategy to sweep and how that influences him as captain and batsman...

Everyone has his own strengths I guess. People play in different ways and I don't think they drove even a single ball. There was no driving on that pitch. My approach or Ajinkya's or Pujara's might be very different, so it's all about finding way to score runs. It happens in cricket sometimes that you play a particular shot and suddenly it becomes a productive shot in that particular innings for you. But as soon as you get out, then you start thinking twice because it is a high risk shot to be honest. And against the pace of Jadeja, specially for the right-hander I think it was a high quality innings; not even one sweep was mistimed or misconnected or in the air. So, we have to give credit to the batters there. As a captain you can do only so much. The field was spread as well and still they were finding gaps and that's what momentum can do. As I said, you have to keep things realistic and accept that these situations will also come again and again and it's how we react as a team. It's all about improving ourselves as players in those situations and not getting too frustrated. We tried our best whatever we could but they were just too good yesterday for sure.

On how difficult it is to stick to a method [sweep] as a batsman...

It's hard. It's an interesting thing because when you are chasing a target, then your mindset is very different. But when you have a lead of 440 on you still and then you lose a couple of wickets and then you are playing one way and it's coming off, I would say, as a batsman, it's very difficult to keep carrying on for four sessions and that's exactly what we spoke as a team. This can happen for two sessions because of momentum but when the day ended yesterday, we spoke about coming out fresh, they have to do this again for two sessions. So, high risk cricket can be played on one particular day, I would say. And that's a brilliant day for any team but to do that again and again is a difficult thing. We knew that we can get in as a team whenever we get a mistake or two, and that's exactly what happened. And also the pitch was such that those chances had to come at some stage. But as I said, credit to them to have done that, it requires a lot of ability and mental strength. I mean we were actually watching in awe yesterday, the sweeping was outstanding and we congratulated both the batters because it was proper Test cricket batting and high quality temperament from both as well.

On the slip catching woes...

Yeah, that is certainly an area that we want to keep improving in. I would say that on a pitch like that where it is getting slower, sometimes you end up standing ahead because you want to pick up catches from the front. And then when one big shot is played and the ball is bowled quick, then you suddenly look like you are not in position. It is a very tricky thing to figure out. Maybe we will have to figure out a certain distance that we just stay in, no matter if the ball falls in front of us or something like that. Specialists are always nice. KL [Rahul] and Pujara are our close-in specialists. Pujara does gully for spinners as well but then he takes on short-leg and KL hasn't done as much of that practice as Pujara does. So it becomes tricky. I try to chip in but when I drop catches, it looks bad. We will have to figure out who stands in those positions consistently and keep those guys there for longer periods. I think that is the solution going forward.

On enforcing the follow-on and if it's tough to maintain in the second innings...

As I mentioned in the presentation, you expect teams playing Test cricket to come out and play like that, you know with the ball and with the bat as well. Because of the way we got wickets in the first innings, sometimes frustration can creep in when we don't get wickets in a session. But you have to realize that those eight wickets we would have probably liked to get them throughout the day. If you spread it into three sessions, so it was all about keeping things realistic. Saying that, we only wanted to keep things tight in the first session and see where the game goes, we ended up getting eight. So, no point having expectations on those same lines and getting frustrated if you don't get wickets.

Then you have to give credit to the batsmen as well, to play like that on a pitch like that, it was high quality batting and you expect that to happen at the Test level and we spoke as a team that we have to embrace this because all sessions that we play are not going to go our way. So if we make our expectations on those lines then we will get frustrated and we will be disappointed, so just be realistic and keep working hard, keep hitting the areas, keep doing the skills you know best and just wait for something to happen. With our discipline, we can put some more pressure again. So it was just about keeping things to be honest and not going too far ahead of ourselves.

On factors enforcing follow-on and being aggressive...

If you see our batting in the second innings in the last six months or so, it has changed. Our second innings batting has become more positive, we are taking on more chances and we are giving those extra 20-25 overs to the bowlers to get wickets if that phase is required. See 183 all out and a lead of 440, that prompted us, looking at the wicket the way it was spinning, not to bat again. And we had only bowled 40 or 48 overs [49.4] in the first innings. So bowlers were fresh and we got lunch break in between as well which is 40 minutes. So all those things taken into consideration we ended up enforcing the follow-on. We felt we have enough on the board not to bat again. If this was like 200 or something, we could have still batted and score 200 or 250 runs and put them again. Chasing a target, as I said, is always big pressure situation because you lose one as a side and then you know how the new batters will react under the pressure. So we always like that format where we put opposition under pressure for chasing in a Test in the fourth innings, so more often than we do it. So I fell it's bit of an advantage.

On if the prospect of a whitewash excites him and the impact of a series sweep...

Well, it's obviously nice to win this series again. We won this last time also, in 2015. Yes, we do have that chance [of a whitewas], but honestly speaking, we are not looking at Test matches or Test cricket now as home and away anymore. We are just looking at Test matches as Test matches and we want to win anywhere that we play. If we can believe enough in our abilities then we are not really bothered about where we are playing. That kind of energy I can sense in the team, and the team believes that as well. You know, we have to only look to win Test matches, however, it may be, on whatever pitch and in whatever conditions.

We are creating a habit of winning that I think can be carried on in future as well. So yes, from the numbers point of view and from stats point of view, these things look great. But for us as a team, it's all about achieving those small little goals everytime we go out to play a Test match. For us, this is priority. Test cricket is the most important thing for us. And everyone plays with a lot of passion. If you see the last nine Test matches, six times we've got 600 runs. That shows the hunger of the batsmen. They are waiting for an opportunity, there are lower-order contributions as well. All these things are... they feel great as a team. In the dressing room, we feel really proud of each others efforts, that we're really putting in those consistent, convincing performances, and winning Test matches more often than getting the other results. We really feel good as a team that we're able to win consistently right now, but we realise that it's very important to keep carrying on the same way as well.

On the advantage of having a player like Ravindra Jadeja...

Yeah, guys who have both abilities are very rare to find. That's where we think they're very precious, specially in the longer format because they provide you with great balance. He can give you a very quick 60-70 anywhere at any stage of the game, it can really turn the game. Remember Lord's, remember Dharamsala against Australia, those are very important innings, the 90 against England in Mohali. So it's not just when the batters are doing well, his runs have come under pressure. Also, he has the ability, he believes in it and he's worked extra hard in the last 10-12 months on his batting. He's bowled so much that the other discipline was left behind, but now he's catching up in that as well. It's only going to do good to him. If he doesn't bowl well on a particular day, he can score runs. Once he scores runs, then he gets confidence with the ball also. He's always in the game, his fielding as well. I would say he's a very valuable cricketer for us.

On Cheteshwar Pujara's role...

I say this regularly. He and Ajinkya [Rahane] are our two best Test batsmen, especially in the middle order. They've been doing so well consistently. Pujara, I would give him more credit because he only plays one format for India. And to be able to have that hunger and passion day in day out, working hard on his game, coming out and having those consistent performances takes a lot of mental strength. And he's a guy with a lot of mental strength. He obviously has the game. He knows how to score runs, which is the most important thing. He has evolved massively as a batter since then. All of us have, but Pujara's game has gone to another level. If you see last season, continuing now, he's got about 1500 runs which is outstanding. All credit goes to how hard he's works on the game, and how he thinks about his game as well. He scores runs in all conditions that we play, I think that for us is the most important.

On playing hard and fair but applauding the opposition...

If we see playing on the field, I always try to try and create as difficult a situation as possible so that he [the batsman] gets out but at the same time, if he achieves something or bats well, then you must also appreciate it because this is Test cricket. The opposition will always test you, either with their plans or with talk. But when people do well, you understand that if you also do well in these situations, how much strength and hard work it takes. So you must appreciate that, it is very necessary. When you do well, other people appreciate you. It can't be that no one from the oppsotion will not play well. We always keep saying int he dressin-room that we must praise the guys who do well and learn from them what they did well in their innings.

Latest Residential Property News in Mumbai,"While decision of levying a penalty of Rs 50,000 per project on the 480 projects registered on August 1 and 2 was decided by the committee, the decision on registrations which came in on August 3 and 4 will be taken in another meeting of the committee."
Why governments shouldn’t mess with private school fees,"Imagine you are a young, idealistic person and you start a private school. You hire inspired teachers like yourself. The school does well and gets a nice reputation. Then a new law, the Right to Education Act (RTE) comes in 2010. It mandates parity with teacher salaries in government schools. You are forced to triple your teachers’ salaries to Rs 25,000 per month. Even Doon School has to raise its salaries. The law also insists that 25% of your students must come from poor families. Although the government is expected to cover fees of the poor, it pays only a partial amount or none at all. Fees of the 75% students rise steeply to cover the costs of both factors. Soon, teacher salaries rise again to Rs 35,000 as mandated by the pay commission. Again, you have to raise fees.

Parents are angry now with constantly rising fees and ‘fee control’ becomes a political issue. The government steps in with a new law to control student fees. Gujarat, for example, caps the fee at Rs 1,250 per month for primary and Rs 2,300 for high schools. Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab also have fee caps and Uttar Pradesh and Delhi are considering one. Your school’s survival is threatened because fees will not cover your costs. You have three choices. You can either bribe the school inspector, who is happy to show you how to fudge your accounts; or you can severely cut back on the quality of your school programmes; or you close down. Ironically, you had supported the RTE law, which raised teacher salaries and gave the poor a chance for a good education. Since you are an honest person and won’t compromise on quality, you are forced to close down your school.

Parents are devastated. The widespread clamour for fee control results in the closure of good schools. As a parent, your choice now is to send your child to a government school or an inferior private school. Most parents won’t opt for a government school — although it offers free tuition, textbooks, uniforms, school bags, meals — because teachers are frequently absent or are not teaching. This is why even children of the poor have been abandoning government schools. Between 2011-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 1.1 crore and rose in private schools by 1.6 crore, as per government’s DISE (District Information System for Education) data.

Capping fees is a form of price control, which used to be a ubiquitous feature of our socialist days under Nehru and Indira Gandhi. It only created huge shortages and a black economy. The Soviet Union also collapsed partly because of price controls. But we have come a long way since then. Hence, it is curious that this damaging idea has become a political issue. Only 18% of private schools charge fees higher than Rs 1,000 per month and 3.6% charge more than Rs 2,500 a month. So, where are the votes? Narendra Modi knows this and has privately expressed his reservations against fee caps. He realises that there is vigorous competition between private schools, especially in cities, and this has kept private schools fees low — the national median fee today is only Rs 417 per month. You don’t need fee control because competition keeps the prices low. Moreover, state governments spend two to three times per child in state schools than the fee cap.

What then is the answer? It lies in the Self-Financed Independent Schools Act 2017 of Andhra Pradesh, which encourages private schools to open, gives them freedom of admission and fees, and removes corruption from board affiliation. To the Andhra model, we should add a requirement for extensive disclosure on each school’s website — giving all fees, staff qualifications, details of infrastructure, strengths and weaknesses — everything that a parent wants to know before selecting a school. With competition, fee control becomes unnecessary.

Private schools have played a vital role in keeping India afloat in the past seventy years. Their alumni have filled the top ranks of professions, civil services and business. Their leadership has made India a world class software power. The government should focus on improving government schools rather than messing with the fees of private schools. As citizens, we should drop this sinister demand for fee control. Instead, let us sing along with Nat King Cole, who expresses nicely our attitude to private schools: ‘Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you. But when I hate you, it’s because I love you.’"
Why are we allowing VIPs to intimidate us?,"I grew up in Chandigarh.

So, this post is as little about trying to defend a delusion that the ‘City Beautiful” is free of crime as it is a feminist rant.

Having got that out of the way, I will say that it saddened and alarmed me just as much as the next resident of the city who read Varnika Kundu’s Facebook post about her recent nightmarish episode with the VIP gundas in the wee hours of the night in Chandigarh.

The ordeal that Kundu had to go through is not only terrifying and every woman’s worst nightmare in spite of the Nirbhayas of the country facing such trauma and an even worse fate almost every single day, it is a continuing testament to the appalling VIP culture that is incessantly plaguing the corridors of our land.

The courageous Varnika Kundu dialed 100 on her phone and India sighed a collective sigh of relief on reading that the police responded with the dexterity that was needed in this eleventh hour.

It could well have been HER eleventh hour and we could have been staring at another Nirbhaya situation in the face today.

Being the son of a Haryana BJP leader, Vikas Balara, the stalker of Kundu, owing to his VIP status managed to wriggle free with a quick bail before he even breathed in the prison air. And the Chandigarh Police that Kundu and her family showered endless praise on for rescuing her in the nick of time has once again proved that their righteousness cannot last in front of strong arm tactics by the rich and powerful. Interestingly and certainly not shockingly, the CCTV footage that is usually in abundance at this particular part of the city where the incident took place can very conveniently “not be found”.

We swallow our rage many times over when VIPs fly into cities and disrupt the road traffic and daily lives of civilians such as a family member trying to rush a mother or a sister to the hospital. We swallow our rage when ministers and leaders utter profanities and ludicrous comments about women and “their place” in society, often trying to defend a rape or misconduct taken place in their jurisdiction. How such individuals manage to acquire ministerial posts is something that continues to baffle me even today.

But when the son of a BJP leader stalks a woman in her car late at night and another leader questions why the woman had to be out late at night instead of questioning the mysterious expulsion of two non-bailable Indian Penal Code sections that Vikas Balara and his accomplice were charged under, it becomes very difficult to keep swallowing rage and looking away.

Seldom do I agree with much of what Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi says or does, but his appeal to the BJP government to not let this incident slide and make sure the perpetrators are brought to justice instead of “colluding with the culprits”is one that we are all behind.

The mind shudders to think of what could have happened. A courageous Kundu and her father, an IAS officer are determined in their fight for justice and to not get bogged down by this bullying.

But where does it end? Will this incident change anything in the future when people like Vikas Balara are faced with this temptation again? Will they refrain from harassing women or will they speed down these roads at night yet again chasing another woman “who should not be out at night” in the name of fun?

The answer is plain as day considering that the one thing these young, emboldened and empowered men have learnt very well is that their VIP status enables them a get-out-of-jail free card for virtually any crime they commit. Because daddy will make sure of it. So why fear when daddy is near?

Until the police and the government decides to take a stand that is as stringent and bullying as that of the insolent perpetrators themselves and puts an end to this fearless power trip that is so etched in the VIP culture we have all become victims to today, nothing will change.

No amount of FIRs and complaints will faze these families. A collective course of action and punishment that will bring them down to earth and remind them of their mortality is the only way forward.

Here’s hoping the Kundu family gets the justice they deserve. But what use is this prayer if even justice in our country can be bought?"

Latest Commercial Real Estate News,"Hyderabad is expected to see addition of nearly 16 million square feet of new office supply over the next three years, mostly in the suburban and peripheral locations of the city (IT and the Extended IT Corridors), said the property consultant in its latest report on Hyderabad real estate."
"Death registration: forget Aadhaar, improve the data collection","The government’s decision to make Aadhaar a requirement for death registration was met with incredulity and derision. Initial reports suggested that this was mandatory but the government quickly scotched this speculation. However, social media went ahead with new Aadhaar memes mocking the government and private sector’s growing propensity to enforce Aadhaar in every field of human activity. But lost in this chorus was another critical aspect of death registration.

What does death registration tell us? Though death registration is mandatory, and the cause of death must be accurately specified, lax regard is being paid to the latter aspect. Death registration has been compulsory since 1969. But it is only after the Millennium Development Goals emphasised the importance of birth and death registration in monitoring the effectiveness and impact of health and development interventions that developing countries focussed on this aspect. In 2014, death registration had improved to 74.3 per cent from 70.9 per cent in 2013. In other words, three out of four deaths were being registered. The Chief Registrar is forced to estimate the number of deaths to arrive at the registration rate.

But here is the nub. The two states which possibly account for the most number of deaths — Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — reported only death registration rates of 46.1% and 24.1% respectively. If the official numbers can be believed most other states are doing well in terms of numbers. But the other challenge is to ascertain the cause of death. It is estimated that over 75 per cent of deaths occurs at home and the cause of death remains unknown. Without this data, it becomes difficult for government, economists and policy makers to understand disease incidence, mortality and other health indicators.

However, in contrast to the Census Office claims that India has achieved almost 75% death registration, a recent WHO report World Health Statistics 2017 claims that India registers only 10% of deaths and the quality of data from death registration is “very poor”. There is a rider that this data could be from a period prior to 2010. If this is global perception about death registration, it needs to be corrected by the government urgently. If it is reflective of the situation on the ground — authorities recently had a tough time collective deaths caused by dengue from registration data — all the effort put into registration is ending up merely as a bookkeeping effort. Recently, there were even deaths attributed to small pox and polio in Delhi creating a minor scare. There are also allegations that people desiring to register births and deaths have to deal with corruption.

The Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1969 envisages penalties on registrars who fail to report registrations to higher authorities in a timely manner. Recently Haryana, Bihar, Jarkhand, and Goa failed to provide data to the union ministry of home affairs (MHA) about registration of birth and deaths while UP provided a part of the data. Haryana blamed it on “lack of computerization and governance issues”. The inaction of these states raise questions about the completeness and integrity of the birth and death data and justify the low score granted by the WHO to India.

These are weighty issues that must be dealt with. The government is spending considerable money in registering births and deaths and employing personnel to record the data. The joke is on those lampooning Aadhaar as a mandatory passport to death. There are much greater failings that they must hold the government accountable for."
Diving Into The Spirit World,"Many great 20th century scientists have been drawn to the spirit world, writes MUKUL SHARMA



The end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth saw some extremely radical and revolutionary developments in modern science in the form of electromagnetism, relativity and quantum mechanics. In the light of this, one would imagine that the age of superstition, irrationality and old wives’ tales — not to mention ghosts — would technically come to an end. But nothing of the kind actually happened.On the contrary, a lot of well-known scientists (including a few Nobel laureates), rational thinkers and eminent statesmen almost immediately dived deeply into the spirit world. From both sides of the Atlantic, from recognisably advanced nations of the time like England, France and the United States, reports started steadily streaming in that some ‘gifted’ people were being able to go into a trance and summon up or even speak directly to the spirits of the dead.Others were apparently able to enter into an altered state of consciousness and write things dictated by remote entities in what was then fashionably known as ‘automatic writing’ or as it’s still called today, ‘channelling’.



Some of these outpourings were touted to be the latest works of deceased writers and musicians describing new works of theirs such as unknown plays of Shakespeare and Bacon or new compositions by Mozart and Beethoven. In India too in the early 1900s, a Sanskrit manuscript surfaced called Vaimanika Shastra or ‘Science of Aeronautics’ which was purportedly dictated to a ‘seer’ by the name of Pandit Subbaraya Shastry who claimed it was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu sage Bhardwaj and contained mention of advanced aerodynamic flying vehicles in use in Vedic times. Bizarre as it may sound though, a lot of men of science and other research streams began flocking in droves to these séances apparently to study their veridicality, thinking it might be the next great breakthrough in their respective fields. Parapsychologists came to check out instances of telepathy and clairvoyance, reincarnation researchers wanted to see if disincarnate souls could exist and people who believed in flying saucers and ancient alien astronauts thought they might find evidence for their theories. Everything ultimately came to nothing. Either the mediums were exposed as hoaxes who cleverly fooled the gullible — including J J Thompson, the discoverer of the electron,physicist Oliver Lodge, and Balfour, the later prime minister of England — or they themselves admitted their chicanery.



For instance, the famous Fox sister mediums publicly acknowledged they were faking the whole thing while Leonora Piper was exposed by a professional magician. In which connection, the so-called Vaimanika Shastra manuscript along with the various sketches in it was also investigated by the aeronautical and mechanical engineering researchers at the Indian Institute of Science,Bangalore in 1974. Their conclusion was simple: it was nonsense. They said that the aircrafts described in the text were ‘poor concoctions’ and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics. Of one particular flying machine, the Rukma Vimana, the study noted: “If the craft is taken to mean what the drawing and the text say,it can be stated that the craft is a decided impossibility.” However, having said that and, hopefully, in the process defrocking the occult ilk, let’s skip a few decades to 1930.That was the year the Pulitzer Prize winning American author Upton Sinclair wrote Mental Radio: Does it work, and how? It documents Sinclair’s test of the psychic abilities of Mary Craig, his second wife, while she was in a state of profound depression with a heightened interest in the occult. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her brother. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 ‘partial successes’ and 70 failures. Yet what’s the bet most of us would never guess — Albert Einstein wrote the preface to this book. ¦"
"Congrats, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu","Venkaiah Naidu’s election as the next vice-president had been a foregone conclusion, but not his victory margin. As it transpired, Opposition candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi got 19 votes less than he was supposed to, that many members of the two Houses of Parliament who had pledged their support to him ending up not voting for him. Of equal concern, if of a different kind, is the inability of 11Members of Parliament to vote right, resulting in their votes being invalid. It is time the Election Commission introduced electronic voting machines in gubernatorial elections as well.

For the Opposition, how big a setback is their candidate’s loss and does it offer a foretaste of how things will pan out in 2019? By other indications, such as the successful and aggressive politics of the BJP that has allowed it to add state after major state to its kitty and instal its partymen and pliant fellow-travellers as chief ministers, it is well on its way to secure another mandate in the next general elections.

But to draw the same conclusion from the vice-presidential election would be wrong. For one, the votes Gandhi got overstates the Opposition’s ability to oppose the BJP in 2019. A united front at the level of MPs does not mean that they would be able to contain their natural inclination to fight one another, apart from the BJP, in the general elections. For another, the Naidu tally overstates the BJP’s support. Opportunist MPs who want to be in the ruling party’s good books and resort to cross-voting are not necessarily expert poll forecasters who modulate their voting according to which way the electoral wind blows.

Naidu has done well to declare his intention to be non-partisan as vice-chairman of the Upper House. Appearances matter, too, in a democracy."
Concerns remain with England's batting lineup,"SOUTH AFRICA TOUR OF ENGLAND 2017

Concerns remain with England's batting lineup

Rob Johnston • Last updated on Sun, 06 Aug, 2017, 11:29 PM

Apart from Jennings, England will be concerned with Malan's inability to deliver at this level as well. © Getty

Provided nothing remarkable happens tomorrow, England should wrap up a 3-1 series victory over South Africa. A win against the second best-ranked team in the world is a decent achievement given England have a new captain in Joe Root and have not won a Test series for over a year. But in truth, despite four entertaining matches, the quality of the cricket on show has been mixed and England still have their demons, notably at the top of the order.

Keaton Jennings, the latest pretender, finished the series with 127 runs at an average of 15.84, passing 20 just twice. Overall, he averages less than 25 in his six Tests to date. As troublesome as those stats are, it is the manner of his innings and dismissals which suggest he should be withdrawn from the firing line for England's three match series with the West Indies.

Of his eight dismissals in this series, six have been caught behind the wicket. He has also been dropped in the slips on a number of occasions and has rarely exuded an air of permanency. Jennings' habit of pushing at deliveries in a rather stiff, upright manner rather than fully getting his weight and head towards the ball have caused him issues. According to CricViz, the stats engine, Jennings has edged more balls than he has middled in this series.

He has tried to work on his shortcomings - at the Oval, he was consciously trying to get further forward - but doing so during the intensity and packed schedule of four Tests in five weeks is not easy. Paul Farbrace, England's assistant coach, admitted earlier in this match that Jennings is aware of the things he needs to work on but has not had the time to do so.

Of course, Jennings' struggles should be put into context. Conditions for batting have been difficult for much of the series and the combined average of the top three batsmen in both teams is just 27.47. Jennings has had to face Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel and Kasigo Rabada which is a fine seam bowling attack, often operating in helpful conditions. Things have not been easy. But then, Test cricket isn't easy.

Farbrace thinks Jennings, given some work, has the potential for a good international career and England's management rate him highly despite a first-class average of less than 36. They admire his character and temperament - as does former Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie - and Jennings captained the England Lions in Sri Lanka over the winter as well as against South Africa 'A' and the senior South African team this summer.

But given his lack of runs and the need for England to settle on an opener for the Ashes, a change is likely to be made for the West Indies series which begins with a day-night Test at Edgbaston. That will give the new man just three matches against one of the weaker Test bowling attacks before the winter tour. It is far from ideal preparation.

The choice is likely to be a shoot out between Surrey's Mark Stoneman and Lancashire's Haseeb Hameed although Essex's Nick Browne and Middlesex's Nick Gubbins are also highly thought of. Stoneman has not yet played for England - he would be Alastair Cook's twelfth opening partner since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012 - but is perhaps the likely starter given Hameed's lack of runs for Lancashire this season.

Hameed, so impressive in his two Test appearances in India over the winter, has been in awful form for his county. He is without a half-century in 13 Championship innings this season and has begun to play at balls well outside his off-stump which previously he would have left. It would be a difficult call to bring him back in Edgbaston on that form.

In contrast, Stoneman has three Championship hundreds for Surrey and is averaging over 50. He scored more than a thousand runs for Durham in Division One in the previous two seasons too and is a fine player off the back foot which could be useful in Australia. Kumar Sangakkara, his county teammate, said earlier this season: ""He's an excellent player with a great all-round game."" There is no finer judge in the game than the great Sri Lankan.

Jennings is not the only England player struggling for form. Dawid Malan has scored just 35 runs in his four innings during this series which is the least any England player has managed from his first four innings since Uzman Afzaal in 2001. The Middlesex left-hander has failed to convince in any of his showings so far and his two dismissals at Old Trafford, driving loosely and then plopping a catch to short-leg, have been soft.

Not that England should discard him yet. At his best, Malan has a reputation for being a classy player and he scored an excellent hundred against a good Surrey attack earlier this season. But he will know that he has work to do against the West Indies to cement his spot for the Ashes. Should Malan fail to do that, England will have to consider their middle order options.

They could bring in another bowler and move their allrounders up the order - something that coach Trevor Bayliss is keen on - or they could bring back Gary Ballance, once recovered from his finger injury, or Lancashire's Liam Livingstone who was the most impressive batsman during the Lions' winter tour. There are certainly less candidates in the middle order than there are at the top.

At least Tom Westley's early composed forays in Test cricket during the last two matches have suggested they may have found a number three. He will, though, have to ensure his tendency to play across the line of the ball when driving, as he did in the first innings at the Oval and the second here at Old Trafford, is resolved.

With just three Tests before the Ashes, England still have to fully resolve positions two, three and five in their batting order. During the past four years, it has been ever thus.

Great News For Sreesanth As Kerala High Court Orders BCCI To End His Lifetime Ban,"The Kerala High Court on Monday ordered Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to lift the lifetime ban on cricketer S Sreesanth that was imposed on the basis of spot-fixing charges against him.

BCCL/Representational Image

The court issued the order after considering a petition filed by the cricketer in March challenging BCCI's decision not to lift the ban despite a Delhi court exonerating him in 2015. The ban was imposed by BCCI on the allegation of spot-fixing in the 2013 edition of the Indian Premier League.

Challenging the ban, Sreesanth had contended at the high court that not lifting the ban violated his constitutional rights. It was on the basis of information provided by Delhi Police that BCCI imposed a ban on him and it was the case registered on the basis of the same information that was considered by the court while exonerating him. BCCI's decision not to withdraw the ban amounts to violation of constitutional rights, the player had argued.

BCCL

BCCI suspended him from the team and ordered an enquiry following his arrest by Delhi police in May 2013, the petition had said. A preliminary report was submitted by the enquiry team led by BCCI president in Jun 2013 without giving him a chance of hearing. Though his version was obtained in writing later, a supplementary report was filed in July without considering it. He was then issued a show cause notice by BCCI and later imposed a ban from playing at international competitions and at games conducted by clubs and institutions affiliated to it, as per the petition.

In A Welcomed Move The Government Decides To Commercialise Ayurvedic Medicines For Diabetes And Arthritis,"For a country that takes pride in calling itself the birthplace of the natural healing system of Ayurveda, it comes as surprise to see that not too many drugs with an Ayurvedic base have yet been commercialised to the masses. In an important move two important drugs—AYUSH 82 and AYUSH SG—developed by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) have been commercialised, a union minister informed Parliament on Friday. “Drugs by the name AYUSH 82 for Type II Diabetes Mellitus and AYUSH SG for rheumatoid arthritis have been commercialised,” Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Yesso Naik said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.

ShutterStock/Representational Image

According to the minister, the Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS) has filed for the patent of another drug, namely D5 Chooranam. The medicine is for treating Diabetes Mellitus. The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy has developed several drugs, including Coleus forskohlii, Catharanthus roseus, Cyclosporinum and Azathioprium, among others.

Drugs developed by the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) are for filariasis, hepatitis, ulcer, vitiligo and malaria. Patents have been filed for all the medicines developed by CCRUM. “In addition, the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) also conducts research for the development of herbal drugs and formulations. It has developed BGR-34 for diabetes, Risorine for tuberculosis and anti-arthritis formulation for osteoarthritis,” Naik added.

Ever Wondered Where Fat Goes When We Lose Weight? Here’s What Science To Say,"We’ve all lost and gained weight at some point in our lives. While most of us are well versed with the process of putting on weight very few know what happens to the fat you burn.

via GIPHY

Does it fall off your body or converted into energy or does something completely mystical we are completely unaware of?

via GIPHY





60% doctors and dieticians misguide their clients/patients into believing that fat is converted into useable energy

via GIPHY

If that were to be true all that energy would probably cause an internal explosion in your system

via GIPHY

The truth? You breathe out 4/5th of the fat you burn into thin air

via GIPHY

In the form of carbon dioxide and water in whatever ways it can

via GIPHY

Don’t go crazy breathing faster though, you would just hyperventilate and pass out!

via GIPHY

That's why if you’ve ever checked your weight in the morning, you’ll notice that weigh lesser—about a 100 grams or so. That’s because you breathed out that bit during your sleep!

So if you’re someone who’s desperately looking to lose weight, sleeping on it may be a viable option for you!

"Google's Pixel 2 Maybe Identical To Last Year's Design, Won't Have Dual Camera & Headphone Jack","Google is expected to release a pair of new flagship handsets in the coming months, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, codenamed Walleye and Taimen. Leaks have already shown what the Pixel 2 XL is expected to look like, but now there’s a new leaked render that gives us a peek at the Pixel 2.

Unlike Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8, the Pixel 2 seems to hold on to its prominent bezels. While that may be a statement rejecting the current bezel-less trend, it still seems to be a waste of display real estate. Then again, this is a leaked image, so it’s possible the design has been tweaked since then.

Tipster Evan Blass, who posted the photo also points out the device doesn’t have another feature common in new phones these days; a dual camera. Then again, the Pixel series leverages its image processing algorithms to produce some stella photos anyway, with the original Pixel outputting arguably better images than even the iPhone 7.

On another tangent, 9to5Google also now reports that internal sources at Google are insisting the device will ship without a headphone jack, something VentureBeat now confirms. In that case, the Pixel 2 will instead use Bluetooth and USB Type-C compatible headphones. Bummer."

"China’s insecure nationalism: The roots of Xi Jinping’s foreign policy belligerence, on Doklam and elsewhere","At the root of the present Doklam crisis is China’s intrusion into Bhutanese territory for its road building projects. These connectivity projects are integral to President Xi Jinping’s dream project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). India and Bhutan were the only two countries that did not participate in the first forum on BRI held in Beijing in May this year.

This has irked China deeply. In fact, following India’s abstention, there arose disquieting voices in the European Union about China’s intentions on BRI. Notably, Bhutan does not have diplomatic relations with China but it shares a special relationship with India that takes care of its security needs. However, taking advantage of the disputed border with Bhutan, China thought to go ahead with its BRI.

Apparently, the Chinese leadership had calculated that the road project would provide them the opportunity to coerce Bhutan into opening up diplomatic relations, and thereby, pulling Thimphu out from India’s orbit. Not to forget, for Bhutan, the greater threat is how to overcome the huge trade deficit with India and meet the economic crisis impending in the nation.

However, for China, BRI and the associated connectivity project is central to both its domestic and foreign policy. On closer observation, BRI has been conceived to resolve China’s problem of overcapacity in its domestic market. The connectivity projects overseas were found to be not only an ideal economic rationale to spread its economic tentacles beyond its periphery, but also offered Beijing a seamless opportunity to spread its political influence and global dominance.

But as soon as it embarked upon BRI, it confronted rising cries of deglobalisation in the West. This posed an alarming situation for China, when it needed more and more markets to prevent its domestic economic slowdown. No wonder, Xi vociferously advocated for globalisation in his Davos speech in January this year. And also indicated BRI was the lynchpin of the Chinese model of globalisation.

Politically, too, China is undergoing a huge internal churning. It is going to hold its crucial 19th party congress that will choose a new central committee and replacements for the core seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. For quite some time, Xi has been brutally consolidating his power by not only eliminating his potential rivals – the most recent being the case of Chongqing Communist Party leader Sun Zhengcai’s sudden purge on July 15 – but also by playing the nationalism card.

Nationalism is a critical element in legitimising Communist Party rule. Central to this nationalist thesis is the image of China as a victim country that lost its territory and lost its centrality in global politics to the forces of imperialism and colonialism in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, as soon as Xi came to power in 2012, he gave the slogan of ‘China Dream’ on November 29 at the National Museum’s ‘Road to Revival’ exhibition.

He said, “To realise the great renewal of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream for the Chinese nation in modern history.” Embedded in this China Dream is an unrelenting quest for retrieving ‘lost’ lands and attaining past greatness. But ironically, a deep sense of insecurity pervades this nationalist cry.

This insecurity emerges from the fact that legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party is contingent on economic development and prosperity. This economic prosperity, in turn, is dependent on globalisation. But the current trend of deglobalisation does not bode well for China, and particularly for its BRI.

Simply put, BRI has been envisaged to not only meet the demands of a slowing economy but to expand its global footprints and thereby, fulfil the China Dream. In other words, forces of nationalism and globalisation, which are otherwise antithetical to each other, are critically interlinked and are vital for China’s sustained rise.

Hence the road building projects in foreign territories, and here in the case of Bhutan as well, falls within this broad logic of China’s foreign and domestic interests. China’s insecure nationalism has thus engendered a belligerent turn to its foreign policy.

This heightened sense of insecurity is clearly discernible in the sabre rattling that the Chinese media and foreign policy establishment have indulged in on the Doklam issue. This insecurity had reached such a level that Chinese media had gone on to describe Ajit Doval, India’s national security adviser, as “the main schemer” of the Doklam stand-off. This reminds us of the term ‘splittist’ that China attaches to the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.

Sieving through the reasons for China’s belligerence on the Doklam issue, it can be inferred that for Beijing BRI, associated with Chinese nationalism and the China Dream, is contingent on sustaining globalisation as well as one-party rule. Hence, it is well-nigh impossible for China to dismount the nationalism tiger.

In this context, the scope for resolution of territorial disputes is exceedingly limited. Therefore, while diplomacy remains the only viable channel to deal with the dragon, countries around the globe, particularly those who are affected by China’s growing irredentism – India, Japan, the United States, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines – should all come together and create a united front opposing such irredentism and challenging China’s selective use of history for territorial claims."
Latest News: Weird & Wacky News Online,
What tomatoes tell: Oscillation between glut and shortage can be avoided by moving to modern market structures,"Tomatoes and onions, two staples in food baskets across India, are back in the news. Retail price of tomatoes has risen sharply across 17 major cities and breached the Rs 90 per kg mark. There are signs that household budgets are going to be under more stress as wholesale price of onions at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, last week hit a 19-month high at Rs 1,300 a quintal. The price of these two items serves as a barometer and recent trends are worrisome.

Price spikes are not uncommon. What makes the current situation unusual is that it comes at a time of normal monsoon and soon after farmers were gutted on account of a post-demonetisation collapse in prices. A cycle where farmers and consumers are stressed by turn is a sign of fundamental problems. At the same time a bird’s eye view shows that fruits and vegetables are where farmers are putting more effort on the heels of changing consumption patterns. Consequently, despite two of the last four years having deficient rainfall, production has risen steadily. Even area under cultivation increased and reached 24.92 million hectares last year.

Despite positive trends, if neither farmers nor consumers are satisfied, it is on account of factors under the control of policy makers and some beyond them. Sharp swings in climatic patterns have increased in the recent past, which makes agriculture a riskier proposition. Centre and states worsen this situation with an uncertain policy environment. The cumulative impact is that farmers get garbled price signals, which leads to oscillation between glut and shortage. Fixing this problem has to start with governments letting price become the primary signal for sowing, then keeping the economic environment stable for farmers.

A stable environment has to be complemented with two other steps. A start has been made by linking 455 markets of 13 states through an online marketplace, with more states expected to follow. This is an important step in breaking the hold of wholesale cartels. But it needs follow up in the form of superior infrastructure. Harvest and post-harvest losses in vegetables are estimated to be upto 12.44% of production. India needs to urgently enhance its cold storage infrastructure by providing private sector with better investment incentives. It is entirely possible to end the cycle of gluts and shortages if we get this policy framework right."

Why the breakdown of consensus in Monetary Policy Committee is good,"The outcome of the sixth meeting of Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee, or MPC, was a surprise. It was not on account of a reduction in the repo rate (rate at which RBI lends money to banks), but on account of the lack of unanimity in the six-member committee.

The first four meetings of MPC resulted in unanimity of decision making. The first sign of diversity of views came in the last meeting held in June. Ravindra H. Dholakia, an external member of MPC, differed and felt that the repo rate should be lowered by half-a-percentage point, which was a larger cut when compared to what the MPC finally chose to do.

He stuck to the position in August.

That leads to the question: what was surprising about the lack of unanimity in August meeting?

Michael Debabrata Patra, executive director in RBI, which makes him the junior most of RBI’s three nominees, differed from the rest of the committee. He wanted to maintain status quo.

It will take a couple of weeks for the minutes of the meeting to be published. But in the meantime it worth looking at why Patra’s position is a positive development.

When there were public debates on the best possible composition of MPC, it was often assumed that RBI’s nominees would vote in the same way. There were arguments that RBI’s nominees were unlikely to publicly differ from the governor on the matter of policy rates.

Patra just did that which can’t be a bad thing when seen in the context of the need for diversity of views in MPC.

It is tempting to second guess Patra’s reasoning based on the minutes of the last MPC. He states that the aim under a flexible inflation targeting framework is to steer the trajectory of inflation towards the target in the medium-term and deal with risks around it.

He seemed to anticipate some of the criticism that would come MPC’s way as he stated that it would not do to change the framework of inflation targeting on the basis of past data or forecast errors of MPC.

It was the equivalent to anticipatory bail as Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic advisor in finance ministry, later tweeted:

“Policymakers should follow real data rather than error prone forecasting models.”

On the basis of the last two MPC meetings, it may be reasonable to say that there is evidence that MPC’s minutes will in future be a more insightful document."
Karunaratne fights but India clinch innings victory,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Karunaratne fights but India clinch innings victory

• Last updated on Sun, 06 Aug, 2017, 02:49 PM Vishaal Loganathan in Colombo

Dimuth Karunaratne's valiant 141 went in vain © AFP

For 95.3 overs, Sri Lanka fought like their lives depended on it.

The ball spat, zooted, and played all kinds of tricks, taking part of the pitch with it every time and promising that things will only get harder. But Sri Lanka, led by Kusal Mendis yesterday and Dimuth Karunaratne on Day 4 held on. There were innumerable unplayable deliveries, but nothing broke the back of Sri Lanka's batting. That was until Ravindra Jadeja got Karunaratne, who had batted 337 minutes and 307 balls for 141 runs, out with a snorter. Sri Lanka's chances and hopes dissipated as quickly as their wickets fell from there on. Their marathon second innings eventually ended on 386, succumbing to an innings defeat and giving India a 2-0 lead in the three-Test series.

Ravindra Jadeja was India's star with the ball, taking five for 152, but he had to endure a long toil, bowling 39 overs for it. Hardik Pandya was a surprise package with two wickets, including the key wicket of Kusal Mendis on Day 3. For Sri Lanka, the knocks from Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis will come as a massive boost. The pair proved that with some application and luck, the hosts can put the Indians under pressure. They will hope that they can carry on from here and compete against India in the third Test in Pallekele.

Sri Lanka, with their performance on Day 3, dared to hope. They enjoyed a spell off sustained dominance, that was only slightly undone by the late wicket of Mendis. On Day 4, they had enough to hope - the had made the Indians toil, the pitch was still slow and the batsmen looked set - but the mountain of runs piled up before them always made that insignificant. India were still ahead by 239 runs at the start of the day, and they needed only a few good deliveries, or moments of luck, to complete what seemed a formality on the previous day.

That moment of luck came in the 13th over of the day. India could not dislodge Karunaratne or nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara for most part of the first hour. KL Rahul even dropped Karunaratne while on 95. The left-hander went on to bring up a deserving century, and set to punish India for their lapses. With Ashwin bowling, Pushpakumara inexplicably went for a switch hit and was castled. India had struck. Dinesh Chandimal edged Jadeja to first slip as the doors started to close in on the home side.

Angelo Mathews and Karunaratne revived the innings with a stand worth 69 in good time. The pair were able to keep India at bay with some sensible batting, as Sri Lanka's deficit came close to 100, and the chances of India batting again increased. At Lunch, Sri Lanka were just 137 behind with six wickets still in hand.

In the post-Lunch session, Jadeja came into his own. The left-armer had been unlucky not to have added more to his wickets tally, with plenty of plays and misses to go with half and dropped chances. He eventually got his reward when Karunaratne received an unplayable delivery, took the top of his handle and ended up in the hands of Ajinkya Rahane.

After that, Sri Lanka's innings toppled without a fight. Mathews edged a cut for Saha to take a sharp catch, while Dilruwan Perera, surprisingly sent ahead of Dhananjaya de Silva, was out stumped to give Jadeja his fourth wicket. Jadeja had his fifer when de Silva edged a sharp turner to first slip.

Niroshan Dickwella and Rangana Herath provided some late entertainment with quick blows, as Sri Lanka tried to get India to bat again. The pair added 43 runs, playing the spinners with abandon and using sweeps and reverse-sweeps galore. India rode out the period of frustration patiently, till Hardik Pandya broke the stand by getting Dickwella caught at gully for 31.

Nuwan Pradeep was the last man out, slogging Ashwin to mid-on, as India completed an innings and 53-run victory. They also took a 2-0 lead as a result and will head into the third Test hoping for a clean sweep.

Brief Scores: India 622/9 decl beat Sri Lanka 183 and 386 (Dimuth Karunaratne 141, Kusal Mendis 110; Ravindra Jadeja 5/152) by an innings and 53 runs

The rise of Karunaratne augurs well for Sri Lanka

At SSC on Sunday, Dimuth Karunaratne was on a mission impossible. Following on with 439 runs behind, Karunaratne batted under tremendous pressure with fielders crowding around his bat and completed his sixth Test hundred. It was a quality knock on a difficult wicket as Karunaratne defended with soft hands even as his team-mates fancied the sweep shot heavily. But Karunaratne is such a good player of spin bowling that he always had other options.

He was on 136 not out when Lunch was taken on day four with Sri Lanka on 302 for 4. The hosts had cut down the deficit to 137 runs and with plenty of batting to come, there was hope that the game could be stretched to the final day. India would have been made to bat again had Sri Lanka done that.

But, it was still mission impossible. His six-hour vigil finally ended in the sixth over after lunch as an unplayable Ravindra Jadeja delivery skidded off from the middle of the pitch brushing the left-hander's glove on its way to Ajinkya Rahane at slips.

The Indian fielders were quick to appreciate the quality knock as they sprinted towards Karunaratne to congratulate him. The 141 wasn't his career best. Karunaratne had scored 186 against West Indies in Galle and 152 against New Zealand in Christchurch, but in terms of quality of the opposition attack, this ranks as his best knock.

There will be a sigh of relief from the Sri Lankan camp as Karunaratne is now gradually soaking up more responsibility which would relieve the burden on the shoulders of Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal. It was the second time that Karunaratne had made a century while Sri Lanka were following-on. At the post match media briefing, Chandimal showered his opener in praise.

""It was a special innings that Dimuth played. As an opener we expect that kind of innings from him, so we're very happy he played that innings on a very tough deck like this one. Of the innings that I've seen over the last three or four years, this innings was one of the best - both from our team and oppositions. It was an excellent innings,"" Chandimal said.

This year Karunaratne returned from South Africa with his place in the side in jeopardy. In six innings, he managed three single digit scores and one half-century in South Africa. Kaushal Silva, the other opener who also had a wretched tour was axed.

Karunaratne would have lost his place too, but the selectors were wary of making too many changes. Since then he has done really well, averaging 53 in five Tests with two centuries.

Ability to concentrate for long hours has been a trait in Karunaratne's cricket since his young days. He first played for Asoka Vidyalaya in Colombo before earning a scholarship to the posh St. Joseph's College where his captain was Angelo Mathews. Thisara Perera also played in the same team.

From there he went onto play for Sri Lanka Under-19 and then joined Sinhalese Sports Club. His first call up to the senior side came during Sri Lanka's tour of England in 2011 and he made his debut in an ODI in Manchester. The Test debut followed a year later. The promise, however, has only begun to filter through.

A NASA-Backed Virtual Reality Game 'Mars 2030' Will Let You Be An Astronaut Like Never Before,"You may not be cut out to be an astronaut in real life, and hop aboard NASA's manned missions to Mars in the near future, doesn’t mean you still can’t experience the Red Planet in all its mysterious glory.

Unfortunately, space potato farming isn't an option yet

NASA has just released a virtual reality experience on the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Steam, called Mars 2030. It puts you in the shoes of an astronaut exploring 24 km of the Martian surface.

The simulation has been modelled to resemble the real Martian terrain, based on captures by the Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera, and is available in full 8K resolution. You can freely roam the surface, collect samples, and then even analyse them under a microscope back in your habitat, just like you would in real life. Once you’re done analysing a specimen, you can even beam the data you’ve gathered back to Earth. In addition, the displays on your suit even show markers for your biometric data and life support systems, to complete the authenticity.

You can try out Mars 2030 for $15 (approximately Rs 950). It’s not out yet for PlayStation VR, though the developer says it will soon be available for the PS4.

Prepare Yourself To Witness A Beefed-Up Ranbir Kapoor For His Upcoming Flick Where He Is Set To Play Muscle Man Sanjay Dutt,"From Aamir Khan’s physical transformation in Dangal to a fit Shushant Singh Rajput’s who played MS Dhoni in his biopic, Bollywood has never shied away from creating superstar physiques forged for the big screen.

Now Ranbir Kapoor, who has always surprised his audience with his acting skills but never with a muscle-bound frame, is all set to hit the big screen again with Sanjay Dutt's biopic. Only this time he’s packing on a tonne of muscle to play the legend!

vinno-khobor.com

It seems like the actor making a hard comeback after his disappointing maiden production ‘Jagga Jasoos’; quite literally by already packing an enormous 13 kilos of pure muscle! In one of the leaked pictures, the actor seems to be working himself hard in the gym for a massive full-body transformation!

From the looks of it, he is on course to surprise us yet again, this time in probably a more emphatic way than before. The film is being helmed by Rajkumar Hirani and is slated to release next year in March.

Why Your Clothes Can Increase Your Chances Of Infecting A Urinary Tract Infection,"The rainy season may bring with it cooler weather and a reason to switch off your air conditioners. But experts suggest that it also increases your chances of developing a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI); especially if you are a woman, which makes you susceptible. Rain and humidity make for a perfect breeding ground for bacterial growth, leading to infection. Clothing such as figure-hugging jeans and other tight clothing further increases chances of developing a UTI.

youtube/representational image

Doctors say that one in five women suffer from UTI at least once in their lifetime. The risk prevails right from birth—paediatricians often advise parents to look out for their baby girls from contracting UTI.

""In women, the urethra is shorter than in men and is closer to the anal opening. So they are more prone to infections,"" urologist Jaswant Patil said. Improper cleaning techniques and exposure in an unhygienic swimming pool can increase chances of infection, he added.

Gynaecologist Priti Vyas said chances of UTI increase with advancing age. ""More women than men suffer from UTI and the numbers do not neutralise with age. In fact, as women reach their peri-menopausal and menopausal stage, their estrogen levels in the vagina dips, thereby making the urethra more prone to catching urinary tract infection,"" Vyas told this correspondent.

bccl/representational image

Similarly, lower estrogen levels in adolescents make baby girls more susceptible to such infections.

Clothes can also play a big role in making for a perfect breeding ground for infections. Gynaecologist Ranjana Das said that tight clothing that traps moisture increases chances of UTI.

""We see a lot of young college-going girls complaining of UTI. Wearing tight-fitting jeans that go unwashed for days is a big culprit because it does not allow ventilation and makes a conducive environment for bacterial growth. Using unclean washrooms is another reason,"" the doctor said.

Avoiding public washrooms may not be possible, especially while travelling or at work. Even so, a lot of people, especially women, hold their urine for a long time when faced with the prospect of using public loos. This, Vyas said, also leads to UTI. Hence many people are now opting to carry toilet seat sanitizers.

reuters/representational image

Vikas Bagaria and his wife Srijana, co-founders of one such product, PeeSafe, said that they realised its need after Srijana was hospitalised with a high-grade fever and acute UTI while on a road-trip.

""We had to cut-short the road-trip in Rajkot and fly back to Delhi where Srijana was hospitalised. It was then she thought of a product that would keep women safe while using public washrooms,"" Vikas said. They discussed the idea, and he finally came up with the product that is now exported to different countries like Australia, Nigeria, Kenya and Singapore.

Coming back to clothing, Patil also said that tight clothes ""compromise blood circulation which leads to lowering of local immunity and makes one prone to infections"". ""Women with menstrual problems are more prone and should be cautious,"" he added.

Nylon undergarments should also be avoided.

To tackle the problem or keep risk at bay, doctors advise consumption of plenty of fluids—although one may not feel as thirsty during the monsoon—and alkaline food like fruits, vegetables and legumes. In hot and humid weather, the urine becomes more acidic and concentrated, and therefore chances of inflammatory UTI and then secondary infection spikes, which fluids can help avoid.

Vyas also has a word of advice against certain products. ""Female hygiene sprays, scented douches and scented bath products can sometimes cause severe inflammation and irritation; so they should be avoided,"" she said.

The rise of the BCCI since Indian independence,"By Boria Majumdar

Would Donald Bradman have listed himself for an IPL auction and what price would he have fetched? Chances are, given his track record, he would have fetched a whopping $3 million. But Bradman never played in India, considered a cricketing backwater in the 1940s and 50s. It wasn’t just him. The best English players – most, if not all – refused to tour India in 1952 and it was only a second-string England that came to India led by Lancastrian Nigel Howard. The discrimination continued till the 1970s, evident from the few times Australia and England toured India.

Liberalisation and opening of the Indian skies in 1991 changed the situation. The BCCI, which showed a loss of Rs 62 lakh in 1992, is now a $4 billion (about Rs 25,500 crore) entity (the sale of IPL telecast rights for 5 years alone could fetch Rs 20,000 crore). The lure of the Indian market is such that Cricket Australia – which was at war with players over pay – had to come to the negotiating table to ensure they send their best team to India in October.

Every cricketer of repute wants to play the IPL and the English, having resisted for a while, have finally come around. England is now a colony of the Indian cricket empire.

Indian cricket’s financial muscle is not restricted to the homeland. During the 2015 World Cup in Australia, the India-South Africa match was attended by over 85,000 people at the MCG – and 80,000 were Indians. The India-Pakistan match at the Adelaide Oval was the most high-profile match of the competition and there’s rumours that the ICC will host the 2019 India-Pakistan World Cup match at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford in front of 80,000 fans. Despite the many controversies and the backlash from the Supreme Court, the BCCI continues to be the most powerful cricket body in the world. It has emerged the final arbiter in deciding if the ICC can push for cricket’s inclusion in the Olympics and earns $405 million, over two times more than second-placed England from the ICC’s revenue over 8 years. Even the recently concluded Women’s World Cup, played to a sold out crowd at Lord’s, turned out to be what it did because India made the final.

Cricket today, as Ashis Nandy once said, is an Indian sport accidentally discovered in England.

But with dominance comes social responsibility. We still do not watch our Test cricket in India and unless the BCCI can encourage a composite appreciation of all forms of the game, it will be difficult to call ourselves the nerve-centre of world cricket.

For the BCCI, it still remains an option to withdraw from tournaments, like the ICC Champions Trophy. More important, it continues to defy the orders of the Supreme Court behaving like a law unto itself. Even a year after the passing of an SC order, the BCCI is no better than a fiefdom of the powerful. It is a cartel that is happy blocking all reforms despite the apex court repeatedly asking it to transform itself.

While much has happened in Indian cricket in the last 70 years, much still needs to change. While we have a great team, a great leader and great fans, Indian cricket is still governed by a body that is opaque and unwilling to reform, much like the colonial state at one point.

Then there was 1947. Will we see an encore in cricket?"

Understated Saha continues to deliver telling performances under pressure

Vishaal Loganathan • Last updated on Sun, 06 Aug, 2017, 06:55 PM

A complete contrast to MS Dhoni's swagger and authoritativeness, Saha, however, has managed to deliver the goods under pressure for India © AFP

For years, Wriddhiman Saha waited longingly as MS Dhoni ran the show for the Indian Team. Saha was considered the better 'keeper, and a stodgy batsman, but as long as Dhoni was around he wouldn't get the chance.

Finally, when Dhoni stepped down in 2015, Saha's time had come. In just over two and a half years since he got his spot, Saha has gone on to become one of India's most prized assets. And Virat Kohli confirmed the same when he said that he felt Saha was the best in this format.

What makes Saha even more valuable is that he will never wrap his head around how big he is for the side. You don't see him shouting at the fielders, or asking bowlers to change their plans. You don't see him get agitated after a mix up either, or look at a fielder grudgingly after a catch is dropped. He isn't frustrated when a throw is too long, or if there was bad bounce, he doesn't care if another player is trying to throw the ball back hard at the batsman, and maybe putting him in the firing line too.

Instead, he quietly contributes in his own way. He is always looking at fields and getting the angles right. He has started to have his own voice during the DRS meetings. He effects stumpings and run-outs and takes the catches that come his way. Saha might come off as aloof, soft-spoken, but he is a team man in every sense.

""I try to be the same way in the Indian dressing room the way I am with Bengal. I always go about my routine and do everything that I am asked to with a smile. Maybe he (Kohli) appreciates that since he expects that from everyone,"" he had recently said in an interview to Hindustan Times.

But Kohli surely sees more in Saha than just that he does what he is told. Saha is no novice cricketer. He's just one short of playing 100 First-Class games. He has tons of experience and ability to do things beyond just what the captain asks him to. Saha has become India's man for crisis, as much as he's the man when they want to cash in.

In Sri Lanka last year, Saha's fifties were the difference between the team scoring 250+ totals and 350+ totals in Galle and SSC. In St. Lucia, with India deep in trouble at 126/5, Saha scored a vital hundred and laid the platform for a victory. In Kolkata, in seaming conditions and against a quality New Zealand side, he made two fifties in two innings. In Ranchi, he once again rescued India with a superb hundred lower down the order. He did the same at the SSC.

However, as a specialist 'keeper, Saha's only currency is not the amount of runs he makes in front of the wicket. What he does from behind matters as much, too. Over the course of the past season, Saha has proved time and again why he is the best 'keeper, especially in Indian conditions.

Saha doesn't ooze oomph and style the way MS Dhoni did. He doesn't cleverly flick the ball on the stumps when the batsman least expects it, or effects stumpings that you might miss if you batted an eyelid. Saha is more classical, more old school.

Keeping to spinners as it is, is a tough job. You'll have to be wary of what the bowler is trying to do, you'll have much lesser time to react, you have the batsman and at times his bat dangerously close to your face. You'll have to make do with other players standing quite close to you, and be on the constant look out for stumpings.

At the SSC, with the pitch helping spinners turn the ball a mile, Wriddhiman Saha put in a performance for the ages. And the fact that it is not being applauded widely is an underlining of how well Saha did. The runs scored, the wickets taken and catches completed are all on the board, but there is no meter for how many times Saha reacted quickly to stop the ball. The pitch at the SSC was crumbling like pastries. Every time the ball took a piece off it, there was no saying where it would eventually end up.

But Saha had almost everything in control. With the batsman preferring to sweep constantly, Saha's job got tougher. The chances of edges flying were higher, and thus chances of injuries too. And both Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin were bowling much faster to ensure they could make the most out of the pitch. It made their job so much easier that Saha was behind the stumps.

Whether there was a zooter down the leg side, a ball that spun sharply out of nowhere, one that bounced higher than it was supposed to, or one that shot in low, Saha was able to stop them all. On a pitch where the Sri Lankan batsmen were constantly being bamboozled, Saha stood as calm as a monk and collected them all.

His three dismissals in the second innings of the game were indicative of how skillful and dextrous he is. When Mendis inside-edged Hardik Pandya and the ball looped up wide of Saha, the 'keeper was the first to react. Even as the batsman wondered where the ball was headed, Saha was motoring down towards the ball before taking it inches off the ground. The catch to dismiss Angelo Mathews was all the more special. Jadeja was giving the ball quite a rip, Mathews stayed on the backfoot and shaped to cut. The bounce from the wicket made it hard, but Mathews went through with the shot. A thick edge resulted, but Saha had his gloves in the right place. Even when things were happening lightening quick, Saha was able to judge the bounce and get the gloves in the right position for the catch. When Dilruwan Perera stepped out and missed a drive soon after, Saha had the bails off in a flash. Two half chances and one proper chance - three dismissals. That's what Saha provides to the team.

Now, if only he becomes more authoritative and accurate while predicting DRS outcomes, but those could be the exceptions to the rule that Saha is a vital cog in the Indian juggernaut.

Kerala High Court orders BCCI to lift life ban imposed on Sreesanth

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Mon, 07 Aug, 2017, 03:49 PM

In what comes as a huge relief for S Sreesanth, the beleaguered India pacer, the Kerala High Court on Monday (August 7) ordered the Board of Control for Cricket in India to lift the life ban imposed on the cricketer.

Sreesanth had filed a petition in the High Court, challenging the continuation of the life ban despite a Delhi court dropping the charges against him on July 25, 2015. He had claimed that such a ban violates his constitutional rights.

During a hearing in April, the BCCI responded to the petition filed by Sreesanth, stating that: ""The decision of the sessions court to acquit the petitioner from criminal charges has no impact whatsoever on the decision of the internal disciplinary committee of the BCCI to ban the petitioner from playing cricket tournaments organized by the BCCI and/or its affiliates. The question before the sessions court was whether the petitioner (and other accused) were guilty of penal consequences under relevant criminal statutes.

""On the other hand, the question before the BCCI disciplinary committee was whether the petitioner is guilty of match-fixing, corruption and gambling and violation of the internal disciplinary rules of the BCCI. The standard of proof required under a penal statute is much higher than the proof required for a disciplinary inquiry. Therefore, on an appreciation of the same evidence, one may not be guilty of criminal consequences but can be found guilty for violating the internal disciplinary rules of an organization,"" BCCI's affidavit stated.

Further, the BCCI claimed that the sessions court was aware of its decision to ban Sreesanth while discharging him. The court had recognised the offence of match-fixing and betting and the incidental conduct of players and bookies in furtherance of these activities. The court had noted that necessary penal action has already been sanctioned against the errant players and other people, the affidavit said.

In May 2013, Sreesanth, who was playing for Rajasthan Royals, and his teammates Ankit Chavan and Ajit Chandila were arrested by the Delhi Police for their alleged involvement in the spot-fixing controversy that shook Indian cricket. All three players were later banned for life by the BCCI. In 2015, Sreesanth, Chandila and Chavan were cleared of spot-fixing charges after a Delhi trial court found that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that they had been involved in any wrongdoing and also insufficient evidence under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

Earlier this year, the Indian cricket board had denied a No Objection Certificate to Sreesanth, refusing to allow him to participate in league cricket in Scotland.

How an inept finance ministry pushes up India’s food subsidy bill,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on 4th August tabled in parliament a compliance audit report on Food Corporation of India. One of the striking features of the report is that it shows up India’s finance ministry as an inept body. Its management of finances is poor and the consequence is that India’s subsidy bill is bigger than it should be.

FCI, which was created by legislation in 1964, is central to India’s food security programme. It handles procurement and storage of food grains. FCI’s operations are primarily funded by the food subsidy provided by finance ministry.

CAG’s report- covering the period between 2011-12 and 2015-16- shows that over time the gap between the subsidy claimed by FCI and the amount released by finance ministry has widened.

As FCI needs the money to keep its operations going, it has begun to borrow an increasing amount of money from commercial sources. The largest source of borrowing is cash credit extended to it by a consortium of banks. It also happens to be a relatively expensive source of borrowing.

The consequence of this chain of events is that FCI’s subsidy requirement keeps increasing partly on account of the interest it pays for its commercial borrowing.

CAG’s report shows that FCI paid an interest of Rs 35,701.81 crore over five years to make up for the shortfall of subsidy.

This, among other factors, makes FCI’s operations more expensive than it should be. All of this feeds into the food subsidy bill.

“The main reason for indebtedness of FCI was delayed/insufficient release of subsidy by ministry,” says the CAG report.

The next time finance ministers and ministry officials claim to have skillfully managed the fiscal situation, it is best to be skeptical. Fiscal prudence may be the result of unpaid bills or short release of subsidy."

Shaharyar rues failure to revive bilateral ties with India

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Mon, 07 Aug, 2017, 11:52 AM

""If you ask me, definitely I wanted to see Pakistan and India bilateral cricket restored"" - Shaharyar © Getty

The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Shaharyar Khan, who vacates his chair on August 9, has regretted the fact that he was unable to revive bilateral cricket ties with India.

""If you ask me, definitely I wanted to see Pakistan and India bilateral cricket restored. But it didn't happen this time despite our best efforts,"" he was quoted by the PTI.

The former foreign secretary of Pakistan reminded that he was able to organise bilateral series during his previous term (2003-2006) with the PCB. ""In my last tenure, we had three bilateral series with India and it was a big source of satisfaction for me,"" he said.

The former high commissioner to India added that during his current tenure, the BCCI hasn't cooperated with the Pakistan board to restore ties. However, he accepted that strained diplomatic and political relations did not help his efforts.

""I did my best this time as well because it is very important for India and Pakistan to play each other. The financial benefits of it are huge for both boards,"" Shaharyar noted.

He rued how lack of international cricket in Pakistan since 2009 has had an adverse impact on the financial health of the PCB. ""We have lost a lot of money in millions of dollars since India's refusal to play with us and remember we have not had international cricket in Pakistan since 2009. So what else can we do to improve our financial health.""

Earlier in May this year, the PCB sought 447 crore compensation from the Indian board for refusing to acknowledge the MoU signed between the two countries in 2014.

""I was even accused of literally begging with India to play a bilateral series. But I was only trying to convince the Indian board to fulfill commitments they made in the MOU they signed with us in 2014,""he said.

"Pakistan and India must return to the negotiating table, without further ado and preconditions","I am leaving New Delhi shortly, after completing my tenure. I regret our two countries could not commence the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue as agreed in December 2015. Be that as it may, i for one would not like to think we are destined to live in perpetual hostility.

In a significant move, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif attended Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi’s inauguration along with other SAARC leaders. That reflected our sincere desire to make a new beginning. The two PMs in their maiden meeting agreed to resume bilateral dialogue as soon as possible. After such a propitious start, the press conference by the then Indian foreign secretary issuing a charge sheet against Pakistan, when PM Sharif was still in town, was unhelpful to say the least.

We also found India’s decision to cancel its foreign secretary’s scheduled visit to Islamabad in August 2014 in reaction to my interaction with the Hurriyat leadership quite baffling. It is imperative to find an amicable solution to the Jammu & Kashmir dispute. And a solution that does not find resonance among Kashmiris would ineluctably fall flat. Simply put, we cannot put the J&K dispute on the back burner.

We must settle this once and for all, as well as Siachen and Sir Creek, to build a permanent peace between the two countries. I am aware that many in India are not yet convinced that J&K is the root cause of our troubled relationship. They hold the view that terrorism is the major issue. To them my submission is that the wars our two countries have fought during the last 70 years all predated the Samjhauta Express blast (2007), the Mumbai attacks (2008) and Pathankot (2016). Effective diplomacy is not about glossing over or shelving seemingly intractable issues but to address them conclusively and satisfactorily.

This is not to say the menace of terrorism can be ignored and left unaddressed. During the last three years, the “Zarb-i-Azb” operation has successfully achieved its objectives. Now the all-encompassing “Raddul Fasaad” operation is underway to take the counter-terrorism drive to its logical conclusion. The public discourse aside, Islamabad and New Delhi have exchanged letters on Mumbai. Some proposals are under consideration to expedite the trial.

As for Pathankot, it is in our mutual interest to determine beyond a shadow of doubt its fons et origo and bring the culprits to book. Meanwhile, it is necessary to eschew the temptation of jumping the gun about perpetrators of the crime. Convicting the perpetrators of the Samjhauta Express blast in which 42 Pakistanis lost their lives is equally important. The people of Pakistan are concerned at the glacial pace of the trial.

To move from conflict management to conflict resolution, a few suggestions. First, it is time to return to the negotiating table without further ado and preconditions. Talks are not a favour by one country to another. Dialogue is unavoidable. Since it will happen sooner or later, why waste time?

Second, it is incumbent to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LoC. In his 2015 address to the UNGA, Prime Minister Sharif proposed to formalise the 2003 ceasefire understanding, entrusting UNMOGIP to monitor. Third, all the other existing CBMs/agreements should also be adhered to in letter and spirit. Fourth, Pakistan in not interested in a Sisyphean arms race but will maintain the credibility of its full spectrum deterrence under all circumstances. Our 1998 Strategic Restraint Regime proposal is still on the table. Maintaining regional strategic stability should be one of our top most priorities.

I may mention here that while foreign secretary S Jaishankar never denied me an official meeting, i wish we could also meet privately to discuss bilateral issues informally. Similarly, i met NSA Ajit Doval many times. We also exchanged gifts on the occasions of Eid and Diwali. As bilateral relations deteriorated, Doval Sahab’s interest in meeting me also apparently sapped somewhat. I strongly feel that diplomatic interaction becomes all the more necessary in strained situations to avoid culs de sac.

To conclude, i thank the people of India for their warmth and affection. These three years have been very exciting. I and my wife Summiya have made many friends across India. We would always cherish their friendship and look forward to staying in touch with them."
Time to end the worst subsidy of all: kerosene,"Of India’s many subsidies, the kerosene subsidy is the worst. Yet it has been such a sacred cow that no government has dared tackle it for decades. Different states levy different taxes, but in most cities subsidised kerosene retails at around Rs 23/litre (it is just Rs 13.50 in Chennai, because of the state’s additional subsidy). The open-market price of kerosene (used for commercial purposes) is far higher, around Rs 57/litre.

The government has announced that the price of subsidised kerosene will be raised by 25 paise per fortnight until the subsidy goes. At this speed, the losses suffered by refiners could end in a little over a year. However, the retail price (including taxes) needs to be raised to equal the diesel price. That alone will end the adulteration of diesel with kerosene.

Studies show that up to 40% of subsidised kerosene is diverted from poor beneficiaries to the adulteration of diesel, which is more than twice as costly. Adulterated diesel produces massive pollution, much more than ordinary diesel, and the additional truck fumes sicken and kill poor people living on roadsides. The extra pollution hits cities where shopkeepers and industries use diesel gensets to overcome power shortages. Villages using diesel for tractors and pumps also suffer. Subsidising kerosene means subsidising disease and death for millions through pollution.

Besides, kerosene-adulterated diesel damages the engines it is used in. Trucks, gensets, tractors and diesel pumps wear out much faster than they should. The subsidy kills machines as well as humans. The major beneficiaries are crooked adulterators. That’s why it is the worst subsidy.

Many left-wing critics have said on TV that the poor will not survive if kerosene becomes costly. Really?

In 2014, Delhi was declared kerosene-free — all sales, subsidised or not, were banned — with consumers having to shift to cooking gas. Chandigarh became kerosene-free in 2016. Did the poor in these cities cease to live? Did they flee to areas where cheap kerosene was available? Not at all.

Indeed, thousands kept migrating from kerosene-available to kerosene-free areas. Haryana has just become kerosene-free last April. All such areas have reduced pollution and hit adulterators, without causing mass distress.

What matters for the poor is not the price of this or that item but overall inflation. But consumer price inflation is now down to 1.54%, the lowest for decades. The gradual upward price drift of kerosene will impact the index only marginally. There will never be a better time to decontrol the price. The needy can be given a free solar lamp for lighting, or a direct cash transfer.

Subsidies are palliatives. Only rapid economic growth accompanied by rising wages can cure poverty. Subsidies are nevertheless warranted for the needy. But, as Swaminomics has argued for decades, the right approach is to give cash to the needy, instead of subsidising goods that may well be used by the rich or crooks. The subsidy on urea, for instance, goes mainly to richer farmers with large holdings, while some is smuggled into Bangladesh. Ultra-cheap urea discourages the use of green manure which is environment friendly. It also means farmers use an excess of urea and not enough potassic or phosphatic fertilisers (which are not subsidised), and this ruins soil quality. Just as subsidising kerosene benefits the wrong people and activities, so too does subsidising urea, or rural power, or almost anything else.

Narendra Modi can no longer be called just an incremental reformer. True, he has moved in baby steps in many areas. But cumulatively they are adding up to a substantial change. When the price of oil was at its height, explicit and implicit subsidies on petroleum products were 2% of GDP. The UPA government devised the strategy of raising the price of petrol in baby steps. The Modi government has extended this to all petroleum products, and buttressed the change with direct cash transfers to the needy. Soon oil subsidies may be down to zero, freeing lakhs of crores to be spent on improving infrastructure, health and skills.

The risk is that new subsidies will take the place of the old. The farm loan waiver that started in UP has spread to other states, and looks certain to be announced in all states going to the polls in the next 18 months. UP, Rajasthan and other states are starting subsidised canteens along the lines of Tamil Nadu’s “Amma Canteens”. Ending the kerosene subsidy is a step forward, but the battle for sensible government spending is nowhere near won."
"By refusing to buckle under China’s threats on Doklam, India has called the bully’s bluff","Standing on the Himalayan crest with well-developed infrastructure, China is in a militarily advantageous position along much of the border with India. The tri-border overlooking the Chinese-held Chumbi valley is one of the few areas where India still holds a distinct advantage, with Chinese forces within Indian observation cum artillery range. If China were to capture Bhutan’s high-altitude Doklam plateau, it would not only mitigate that vulnerability but also hold a knife to India’s jugular vein – the Siliguri Corridor, through which Bhutan’s communications and transportation arteries also pass.

While existential stakes drove India to halt China’s construction of a strategic highway through Doklam, Beijing made a serious strategic miscalculation by intruding there: It anticipated Bhutan’s diplomatic protest but not India’s swift, stealthy military intervention. The Indian army had long geared up to respond to such a contingency.

No Indian government can countenance the construction of a road through Doklam that allows China to bring main battle tanks to the tri-border and implement, in the event of a war, its military plan to decapitate India. In such a corridor-bisecting scenario, while China gobbles up Arunachal Pradesh, the other northeast Indian states, as a Chinese state mouthpiece warned recently, could become “independent”.

Today, thanks to its miscalculation, China finds itself in an unenviable position: It must extricate itself from a militarily wretched situation in Doklam, where its intruding soldiers are caught in a pincer movement. If China were to initiate hostilities at the tri-border, it will likely be left, as in 1967, with a bloodied nose, given the Indian army’s terrain and tactical advantages.

Politically Beijing has boxed itself in a corner, with its intense psychological warfare (“psywar”) and disinformation operations failing to yield continuing gains, after the success in initially dominating the narrative. If anything, its psychological operations (“psy-ops”) and manipulation of legal arguments (“lawfare”), as by selectively quoting an 1890 colonial-era accord, offer India important lessons. It is standard Chinese strategy to play the victim in any conflict or dispute, as China brazenly did even in 1962.

Mounting frustration has sharpened Beijing’s war rhetoric. To compound matters, the standoff is imposing reputational costs on a power that supposedly brooks no challenge and is ever willing to wreak punishment. India, in the face of vitriolic warmongering, has defiantly stood up to China and refused to budge. By calling the bully’s bluff, India has set an example for other Asian states to emulate.

Beijing’s story that Indian troops “trespassed” into Chinese territory was designed to disguise its intrusion into tiny Bhutan. But this tale, along with President Xi Jinping’s vow not to permit the loss of “any piece” of Chinese land, deepens China’s discomfiture by undermining the image it has sought to project at home and abroad – Asia’s pre-eminent power that no neighbour will mess with.

In sum China, if it is to save face, needs India’s help to extricate itself from a mess of its own making. Beijing’s coarse statements and threats, while integral to its psywar, are also part of a negotiating ploy to secure a compromise on largely its terms.

There is no reason, however, why India should let China off the hook easily. With Xi looking ahead to this autumn’s Communist Party congress to cement his status as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, India should play psychological hardball because Chinese incursions have become increasingly recurrent.

India should allow the Doklam military stalemate to drag on until the arrival of the harsh winter forces the rival troops to retreat, thus restoring the status quo ante, including frustrating China’s road-building plan. If an earlier negotiated mutual retreat from Doklam becomes possible, it should be based on an unequivocal assurance that China henceforth will refrain from unilaterally disturbing the territorial status quo anywhere in the Himalayan borderlands.

Implicitly, if not explicitly, China must come out a significant loser in order to help rein in its creeping, covert encroachments. There should be no more Depsangs, Chumars and Doklams or the quiet chipping away at Indian and Bhutanese lands."

Prosecutors Are Seeking 12 Years Of Jail Time For Samsung Heir In National Corruption Scandal,"South Korean prosecutors have recommended that a Samsung heir be imprisoned for 12 years if he’s convicted in an ongoing corruption scandal.

Reuters

The request came on Monday after a four-month-long hearing for national corruption charges against billionaire Lee Jae-yong.

The 49-year-old vice chairman of Samsung Electronics was in February charged with bribing a high-ranking government official in order to help along a merger that would strengthen his control over Samsung. Specifically, Lee was accused of offering $38 million to a friend of then-South Korean president Park Geun-hye. The case came to light after Park was accused of corruption and removed from office. He’s currently being tried separately.

So far, Lee has denied all the charges against him and distance himself from Samsung’s now-disbanded ‘strategy office’, a secretive group within the company that oversaw the merger at the center of the entire scandal. If convicted, Lee could be facing at least five years in prison."
