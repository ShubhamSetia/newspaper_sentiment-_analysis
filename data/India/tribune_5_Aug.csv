Amritsar, August 4

The Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) has won the legal battle for its chunk of land opposite Red Cross Bhawan at Ranjit Avenue. The AIT fought a long legal battle to get back its land worth Rs 200 crore.

According to information, the AIT had notified the Ranjit Avenue Scheme on January 21, 1972, and had acquired the land in August 1973. Around 9,500 square-yard chunk of land was under the ownership of Brahm Boota Akhara, a religious sect. The AIT gave Rs 2.05 crore to the akahara as compensation for the acquisition of land. But the AIT failed to get the possession of the land as the akhara had given the land on lease for 99 years to five different persons. They declined to give up their possession of the land. The tenants have tried to get a stay order from the court.

The case has gone through several phases. The lease-holders further signed the power of attorney to a private firm. The firm reportedly managed to get a Change of Land Use (CLU) certificate with the involvement of AIT officials. A major controversy erupted when the private firm managed to get the CLU.

However, the local court gave the verdict in the favour of the AIT, but the Trust did not take any action against any of the officials or employees for their involvement in forgery.

The land is located on a prime area of the city and the land mafia was keen to grab the chunk. The private firm had passed the plan for the construction of a Mall by submitting invalid registered papers and the CLU.

Meanwhile, AIT officials are happy after getting the possession of the land worth Rs 200 crore. Sandip Singh, law officer of the AIT, stated that a long battle had been fought to get the land, so everyone had been celebrating the moment."
Politically incorrect,"MOVIE REVIEW - INDU SARKAR

Nonika Singh

Sorry to disappoint you readers, but Indu Sarkar isn’t about the enigmatic former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, who was loved and despised in equal measure. The title (Indu we all know was her nickname and Sarkar needs no qualifier) might have misled you in believing so.

But the film in the eye of controversy for some time, zeroes down on her most inglorious phase; the draconian and dreaded Emergency.

Expectedly, the narrative takes sides and does seem politically motivated as well. However, Indira’s presence is confined to the margins, just a scene or two - that too sans dialogues. Instead, it’s her son who gets ample footage. By the way, neither of them is referred to by actual names. However, the resemblance to real characters is telling and uncanny. And Bhandarkar has left no stones unturned to demonise Sanjay Gandhi - sorry, beg your pardon, chief as he is alluded to throughout the film.

His body language, dialogues or the mean act and references to his five-point programme including nasbandi … all are meant to paint him as the big bad boy of mommy dear, who, of course, is not Indu Sarkar.

So who is the titular character? Well, a fictitious woman coined by Bhandarkar who has gone on record to say the film is 70 per cent fiction and only 30 per cent fact. And it’s this marriage of reality with imagination that is rather problematic. Who can deny that a film on Emergency should be made?

Emergency is without a doubt a period that even Congress can’t be proud of. But by mixing facts with fiction, by trying to humanise the story of an orphan girl, Indu, caught in the vortex of political repression and then turning it into a thriller of sorts, the film neither remains truly political nor a riveting, heart-tugging, human drama.

Besides, to compare the fight against Emergency to the second freedom movement is stretching the yarn a bit too far. The use of National Song, Vande Mataram, as the anthem of the so-called peaceful revolutionaries too is rather distressing, if not in bad taste. All through the film you can’t shirk off the nagging doubt and realisation that Bhandarkar would gave gained in stature had he made the film during the Congress regime.

Today, his attempt seems like a government-pleaser stunt. In the film there is one key dialogue; Emergency main ya police ki chalti hai ya yes man ki. The same dialogue can be turned against the director.

Indeed, it’s tragic that 70 years after Independence, films on political subjects, that too not biting enough, are made in accordance with who is ruling at that point. And that is a bigger tragedy than the film itself, which despite sepia tones and occasional period touches (Bobby is running in theatres), also succumbs to the typical Bollywood plot.

However, one person that emerges tall is Kirti Kulhari. As the stammering poet-turned-rebel, she engages you with her dilemmas, more so in the first part. To a large extent her screen spouse, Actor Tota Roy Chowdhury, playing her ambitious husband, a government servant willing to play along with the powers that be, gets the nuances of his character right. Neil Nitin Mukesh as the near despicable chief spurning and mocking his loyalists too adds menace to his part. Only if Bhandarkar, who has been losing his touch lately, found his métier. From the man who gave us incisive Page 3 and fairly credible Fashion, we expected and deserved better."
Sushma Swaraj in Parliament,"Sushma Swaraj in Parliament

The occasional Foreign Minister?

Also in this section

Electing next Vice-President

In her four decades of politics, few have stolen the thunder from Sushma Swaraj. A master of inflection and prosody, the External Affairs Minister was again acclaimed for her speech in Parliament on the tenets of India's foreign policy under the Modi government. But the fact that the Opposition moved two privilege motions against her strengthens the impression that she is not top of her game. Appearing frail after a life-threatening illness that she courageously overcame, Swaraj's rarely went into the heart of the topic: how is India faring in its ties with strategic partners. She denied Russia was aligning with Pakistan because a line in its joint statement with India had condemned Pak-based terror; India's riposte to Trump on climate change proved it was not a junior ally of the US; and, the most facile of them all, talks and terror cannot go together. It is ironical that one of the privilege motions was on the political part of her speech. The Opposition may be making much of a factual error in this respect. But she was being disingenuous by alleging that Nehru sought personal glory at the Bandung Conference, the foundation stone for NAM. For, just two years earlier, Swaraj had omitted Nehru while praising India's role in Bandung as part of the Modi government's policy to erase Nehru's footprints on Indian foreign policy milestones. Was this turnaround coupled with an attack on the Opposition for getting briefed by Chinese diplomats and the unadulterated praise of the PM, her attempt to build bridges with the all-powerful PMO? The Opposition was being unfair when it cited her absence on the PM's overseas tours as evidence she was out of the government's foreign policy implementation loop. These former UPA ministers, better than most, should know Foreign Ministers usually do not accompany PMs on overseas tours. But the Opposition missed pointing out an obvious sign that the Modi government is an extremely closed run affair: she is absent on ground-preparing visits for the PM's visit. Swaraj was at her assuaging best on the sensitive Sino-Indian border dispute. Hers is a voice that should be heard more often."

"Cong, AAP, INSO stage protests","LAST DAY OF BJP PRESIDENT AMIT SHAH’S THREE-DAY VISIT TO ROHTAK

Tribune News Service

Rohtak, August 4

The last day of BJP president Amit Shah’s visit was marked by demonstrations staged by members of the Congress, AAP and INLD’s student wing INSO over different issues. The protesters were detained after they clashed with police personnel. Rohtak SP Pankaj Nain told The Tribune that Congress and INSO workers were released after preventive action while a case was being registered against 20 AAP members. Around noon, Congress workers held a meeting at Mansarovar Park and started marching in a procession, carrying black flags. Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar, who led the procession, told reporters that they were going to meet the Chief Minister to demand the release of cattle rights activist Sant Gopaldas, who was arrested near Shah’s camping site yesterday. He alleged that an undeclared emergency had been imposed in Rohtak during the BJP president’s three-day stay here. As the procession reached near Ashoka office complex, the Congress workers were stopped by the police who had put up barricades there. The protesters raised slogans and tried to push back the barricades, which was resisted by the policemen. The protesting Congressmen were then taken away by the police in two buses and released later in the day. INSO members were also detained after they tried to gate-crash into Tagore Auditorium on the MDU campus to register their protest against some remarks made by Shah about late Ch Devi Lal. AAP members, including women, reached Shah’s camping site, Tilyar tourist complex. They were carrying placards bearing questions they wanted to put to Shah. They also raised slogans and showed black flags to Shah’s cavalcade, said AAP’s Haryana unit president Naveen Jaihind. The police detained the protesters. Another group of AAP workers staged a demonstration and raised slogans ‘Amit Shah, go back’."
Draped in past & present,"Designers Shyamal & Bhumika, who debuted at FDCI’s India Couture Week, share their creative canvas

Swati Rai

When couture took over the ramp in the Capital recently, one label had to leave a mark. This season was Shyamal & Bhumika’s first at FDCI’s India Couture Week. A drift from the usual cheer at the event, they brought in muted colours. Champagne gold, ruby red, emerald green, coral blue and crimson swayed the ramp. Moving away from traditional flavour, their designs were contemporary this time. And well, it turned a glamorous affair.

The Gujarat-based couple established the brand in 2003. Across the years, it has come to know for their designs that seek inspiration in the rich Indian heritage and history. The two use precious crafts and techniques of the country to create couture collections relevant to modern-day sensibilities.

Bhumika’s passion for textiles and fashion led her to study fashion design at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) whereas Shyamal researched fashion in Milan and London. This disparate design training and fashion exposure honed their design sensibility. “It gave me a completely different perspective and helped add an international view point of fashion to our work. It led to the birth of what we call our global line, which is designed by keeping in mind the current global influences, trends and a very modern aesthetic,” says Shyamal.

Architectural grandeurs of their ancestral homes to personal travels and tales that they grew up listening to, all find expression in their mood boards, sketches and, finally, the ramp. Their sartorial map remains faithful to its vision of ‘India to the World’, their tagline. They use fashion as a medium to connect global audiences through the rich and glorious crafts and artisan techniques of India.

But there is a question that bothers us again and again: Is it not a disadvantage to live away from the fashion hubs of India? Shaymal says that from marketing and networking point of view, it might not be a good idea to stay in Gujarat. However, he feels this distance gives them as “an opportunity to be away from commercial pressures and influences and work in peace.”

“Also, when you are away, your roots and influences are different and your collections look unique. However, we do have a store in Mumbai and retail points in Delhi. So, we are very accessible to everyone. The constraint of not being in the fashion capital helped us adopt social media early on and led us to being one of the most followed south Asian designers on Facebook,” he smiles.

The Princess’ Soiree, the collection showcased at ICW, is an extension of the common thread binding their collections form the past — that of a grand and royal, yet contemporary lexicon. With this, they carry forward their earlier collections like The Royal Procession, Shaahi Baug, etc.

The Princess’s Soiree centres around a well-heeled and well-travelled woman of the present with roots in the past. The story is about her travels from India to Europe and back and her various inspirations en route. The new collection draws from the ancestral stories of their family from the late 1800s. But, it also features European details, Victorian inspirations and Baroque decorations amalgamated with rich Indian heritage. So, what you see on the ramp are floor sweeping gowns, sheer tulle capes, ruffled blouses, supple frills, belted waists, kalidaar jackets and lehengas. Fluid beadwork, dripping gold embroidery in floral setting and luscious gold thread work is immaculately incorporated. The cascading ruffles sprinkled with glitter, twirling tulle skirts and magnanimous gowns with winding floral thread work transcend you to a fantasy like ambience.

Amidst all this experimentation, one mulls if at a time when plus size fashion and ageless fashion is taking over sartorial discussions, do they see their collection breaking stereotypes… Shyamal and Bhumika say, “Style is more important than just blindly aping fashion trends.” No wonder then that their team is trained to customise couture for a global clientele with very specific requests and multiple size specifications, suiting different age groups as well as altering the outfit to meet different religious customs.

The designers also intend taking the crafts of India to a global clientele. “We have been successful in doing it over the internet and the next step would naturally be a network of international retail points to cater to this global following,” says Bhumika. In the near future, they swear to breaking away from the conventional and inch towards pastels such as forest green or English green, shades of red, intricate handwork and a subtle play of sheer. Take the hint."

"The Tribune, Personal finance news","Vikas Khemani

The GST Bill underwent a long gestation period, having been first initiated in 2000 by the Vajpayee government. In 2006, the then Finance Minister P. Chidambram announced in his Budget speech that the target date for implementation of the GST Bill would be April 1, 2010, and formed an empowered committee of State Finance Ministers to design the roadmap. However, it was not until May 2015 that the Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha. The Bill was eventually passed by the Rajya Sabha on August 3, 2016, after ratification by the states, received assent from President Pranab Mukherjee on September 8, 2016.

Finally on July 1, 2017 the GST Bill formally came into effect.

Eliminates tax redundancies

The major highlight of the Bill is that it eliminates tax redundancies; a manufacturer pays tax only to the extent of his value addition, not on the whole cost of the good sold, as the raw material supplier would have already paid tax on his goods. Similar tax incidence is applicable on all stages of the supply chain, each paying tax on the extent of value added by them.

In effect, GST eliminates unaccounted for goods in all stages of the value chain. Now this begs a question, why is there so much of hue and cry surrounding the GST and its implementation?

A big positive

Largely the fears are around the uncertainty surrounding how things will work with new procedures and compliances and the impact it would have on sales. All these apprehensions are short-term in nature, over the longer term it is structurally a big positive.

Teething issues

To my mind the fears that consumption will get adversely impacted are inaccurate. Having said that, yes there will be some short-term teething issues as we align to the new framework, and there would be specific impact to certain sectors. Some segments will get impacted for a shorter period of time and probably some industries would change from the longer term viewpoint, but that is the idea behind this reform.

Balanced tax slabs

The other fear that people have is that the new tax regime might end up becoming inflationary. In this regard, I feel the government has been cognisant of this while framing the multiple tax slabs, which have evolved after numerous iterations and criticisms; and are very balanced. However, there will be things which will be cheaper and those which will get dearer; but on an aggregate basis I don’t expect a widespread inflationary impact, especially in lieu of the fact that the government has signalled its seriousness in enforcing the anti-profiteering clause, if the need arises.

Efficient, better market place

I would like to take you down memory lane when we migrated from the outcry system to online trading and when we moved from physical settlement to dematerialisation settlement. There were a lot of worries around job losses, cost increase, volumes going down. In hindsight, the results are evident. These shifts have created a much larger, efficient and better market place. Certainly, there were impediments at first, and things were uneasy till we got used to it, and eventually it led to structurally smoother, safer and more efficient systems.

Transparency

From the customer point of view, GST ushers in a lot of transparency, and also brings down the aggregate price of goods and services. This is primarily because of the cascading impact of taxes and tax redundancies, whereby the end consumer bears the burden of the incremental taxes. Secondly, in the earlier scenario, the states had varying taxes and tax rates, under the One Nation, One Tax regime, the tax uniformity gives companies the freedom for setting warehouses and optimising transport costs, the ultimate beneficiary of which is the common man. Lastly, the GST is estimated to increase the GSP by 100-150 bps in the longer run, higher growth, implies more job opportunities and the common man shall stand to benefit from the same.

Remarkable achievement

As India gets into the process of implementing its largest taxation reform since Independence, of subsuming hundreds of different tax rates of thousands of goods and services across all its states and Union Territories into just five tax rates, one must acknowledge this remarkable achievement, against the backdrop of such a vast socio-economic and political disparity across a federal polity such as India. It is said change is inevitable, but progress is optional and GST implementation is a confluence of both.

Twenty students of Government Model School, Mani Majra, were rushed to hospital after suffering from ""common side effects"" of the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine. A majority of the children complained of rashes, fever and stomach ache while some complained of vomiting and nausea. According to officials of the UT Heath Department, 19,706 children were vaccinated in over 70 schools in the city. The students were vaccinated in the afternoon following which many complained of stomach ache, some developed rashes while others were down with fever. Official sources said 16 students were admitted to the Civil Hospital in Mani Majra while three were rushed to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. However, all children were sent back home after treatment. Anxious parents complained that the Health Department should have issued an advisory regarding the possible side effects of the MR vaccine. Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director, Health Services, UT, said there was no need to panic as side effects such as fever and rashes could occur in some cases following the vaccination. “Three children were rushed to the GMSH, Sector 16. I do not have the details of the children admitted to the Mani Majra hospital. However, all students were discharged in the evening,” said Dr Kashyap. He said the vaccine was of high quality and had been approved by the WHO. Subhash, whose daughter studies in Class IV at Government Model School, Mani Majra, said, “My daughter was administered the vaccine in the afternoon. After sometime, she complained of fever and suffocation. Soon, some more students showed similar symptoms. Without wasting time, I, along with the school staff, took the ailing children to hospital. Soon, more children with similar problems arrived at the hospital.” Suraj Kumar, father of another student who was taken ill, said there was chaos inside the hospital. Two students were accommodated on a bed. However, by evening, all children were fine.”'Injection spot' reactions (pain, redness, swelling or a lump), fever, rash, headache, dizziness, joint or muscle pain, nausea and vomiting.UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had inaugurated the measles-rubella campaign on Thursday. Badnore highlighted the importance of the vaccine in the elimination of measles and control of rubella. He appealed to all children to take this vaccine and pass this message to their friends and neighbours as well. As many as 3.10 lakh children in the city will be covered under the MR vaccination drive. Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director, Health Services, UT, said all children from nine months to 15 years of age would be vaccinated."
The right over unfinished work,"Playwright Edward Albee instructed his friends to destroy his unfinished manuscripts. Could the law step in to save them for posterity?

Michael Paulson

Edward Albee died last year. But the renowned playwright is making one last request from the great beyond. Albee wants two of his friends to destroy any incomplete manuscripts he left behind. The instruction — included in a will Albee filed on Long Island, New York, where he lived and died — is unusual but not unprecedented. There is a term in the legal world for such instructions — dead hand control — and, although compliance has varied and enforceability is debatable, they have been attempted by artists from Franz Kafka to Beastie Boy Adam Yauch. For now, the impact of Albee’s will is a mystery. The executors — an accountant, Arnold Toren, and a designer, William Katz, both longtime friends of the playwright — declined through a spokesman to answer questions. They would not discuss whether any papers had already been destroyed. But the executors have been carrying out other aspects of Albee’s will. This autumn, at the request of the estate, Sotheby’s will auction off more than 100 artworks collected by Albee; the proceeds, estimated at more than $9m, will benefit his namesake foundation. (The playwright, who was gay, never married and had no children or close relatives. His foundation, which maintains a residence for artists in Montauk, New York, is the primary beneficiary of his estate.) The executors have made clear they plan to honour Albee’s desires, even when they might be controversial. In May, for example, they refused to allow a tiny Oregon theatre to cast a black actor as a blond character in a production of Albee’s most famous play, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, citing the playwright’s intentions as expressed during his lifetime. Now at stake, at a minimum, are the latest drafts of Albee’s final known project, Laying an Egg, about a middle-aged woman struggling to become pregnant. (One plot element concerned her father’s will.) The play was twice scheduled for production at Signature Theatre, an off-Broadway nonprofit in New York, and twice withdrawn by Albee, who said it wasn’t ready. Even if the executors destroy Albee’s draft, other copies may exist — a Broadway producer, Elizabeth Ireland McCann, said she had at least a partial version of the script — but it is not clear whether Albee had done work on the project that only he had seen. It is also unclear whether Albee left any other incomplete manuscripts behind or whether the language in the will could be interpreted to apply to early drafts of his published plays. “Am I disappointed? Yes, because every tiny bit of everything that a writer has written provides insight into that writer’s creative process,” says David A Crespy, president of the Edward Albee Society and a professor of playwriting at the University of Missouri. “But am I surprised? No. He maintained very strict control over the materials that were available to the public.” Albee is best known for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a penetrating 1962 drama that was adapted into a film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. He won the Pulitzer Prize three times — in 1967 for A Delicate Balance, in 1975 for Seascape and in 1994 for Three Tall Women — and the Tony Award twice, in 1963 for Virginia Woolf and in 2002 for The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? He also won a Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2005. His work is frequently staged; a revival of Three Tall Women, starring Glenda Jackson and Laurie Metcalf, is to open on Broadway next year. The playwright died in September at the age of 88. His will, which he signed in 2012, was filed in Suffolk County Surrogate’s Court; the provision in question says, in part: “If at the time of my death I shall leave any incomplete manuscripts I hereby direct my executors to destroy such manuscripts.” Until the manuscripts are destroyed, the will says, the executors should “treat the materials herein directed to be destroyed as strictly confidential and to ensure that such materials are not copied, made available for scholarly or critical review or made public in any way”. Some artists back Albee’s right to decide the posthumous disposition of his writings. “For writers, drafts of unfinished work can be quite sensitive,” says Doug Wright, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright (I Am My Own Wife) who is president of the Dramatists Guild of America. “These drafts are not public property; they belong to the author, and the author has the right to determine their fate.” And James Bundy, dean of the Yale School of Drama, says: “Edward’s choice strikes me as entirely in keeping with his own exacting standards.”— The Independent"

Two women, including a daughter-in-law of a retired Home Guards official, was held guilty in an attempt-to-murder and robbery case. The quantum of sentence has been scheduled to be pronounced on Saturday. It was on July 13, 2016, when a 60-year-old man was found with his neck slit at his CHB flat in Sector 63. Later, the police arrested two women for the crime. The women were identified as Amandeep Kaur, alias Mano, and Fatima Bano.

Afterwards, the accused fled the spot. The victim was found lying in a pool of blood by his wife Kamlesh, who reached the spot around 5 pm. Kamlesh raised the alarm and called her neighbours who informed the police."
A poet of pain,"Everything about Shiv Kumar Batalvi is enchanting. His poetry of love, life and pain remains timeless

Karan Mujoo

When one thinks of Sector 22 in Chandigarh, one thinks of Kiran Cinema, rehri market, street vendors, and the paucity of parking space. But there is more to this sector than meets the eye. There is a row of booths, dominated by opticians, which hide a story in plain sight. A story which needs to be told. My fascination with these booths, and one booth in particular, started, strangely enough, on YouTube. During one of my YouTube binges, I chanced upon the interview of a handsome, young man. Curious, I clicked on the thumbnail. This man, it turned out, was none other than Shiv Kumar Batalvi. I had heard of him, of course. But for some reason, I had dismissed him as another one of the ancient, boring poets who were obsessed with rhyme schemes and metres. This seven-minute surreal interview proved how wrong my assumption was. Everything about Shiv Kumar Batalvi was enchanting. The way his crystal clear voice rose and dipped. The way he swayed his hands while making a point. The way he threw his head back in angst and sang laments to the skies. I was transfixed. I wanted to know more about him. Over the next few days, I scoured blogs, read books, liked Facebook pages dedicated to him. I heard Jagjit Singh and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Sahib sing his poems. I even sent his son a friend request. During this intense period of research, I realised one thing. Shiv Kumar Batalvi was unlike any poet I had ever read. His verse throbbed with the pain of love. His words flowed strong and smooth like the waters of Beas. He was pure feeling. A conduit through which poetry flowed from the Gods to us. His analogies were remarkable. In “Maye ni maye main shikra yaar banaya”, he compared his beloved to a hawk. Which other poet would show such audacity and freshness of thought? In one of the blogs, it was mentioned that Shiv Kumar Batalvi was a regular visitor at ‘Preetam Kanwal Singh Watch Company’ in Sector 22. He used to sit at the shop, have a drink, recite his poems, and when tired, he’d sleep on a bench. I decided to see if the shop had survived the vagaries of time.

***

I squinted and tried to read the boards. Sandwiched between Arora Optical Co and Khalsa Confectioners, in tiny lettering, was written — ‘Pritam and Co’. I peered inside the shop and saw two Sikh gentlemen manning the counter. I entered the shop and addressed one of them. “Sat Sri Akal ji,” I said. “Sat Sri Akal,” one of them replied. “I am doing research on Shiv Kumar Batalvi. I’ve heard he used to come here?” “Yes, he used to. Bilkul.” I wasn’t prepared for this answer. I fumbled for my next question. “Did you ever meet him in person?” I asked. ‘Meet him in person? Assi unna di ulti bhi chakki hoyi hai!’ one of them replied. They said that their father Preetam Singh Kanwal, a writer, was friends with him. The brothers also told me that Batalvi used to get his drinks from a wine shop nearby. The wine shop, too, like Batalvi Saheb, had disappeared with time. I was unsure what to ask next. Seizing this opportunity, the gentleman behind the counter left for lunch. His brother, whose name was Saranjit Singh, waved me in. “All these people who say they were great friends with Batalvi Saheb, they are all lying. He wouldn’t let anyone come near him. Nobody could match his talent.” “What else do you remember about him?” I asked. “He was so handsome. Always well-dressed. Wearing his pathani sandals. I have seen how those college girls were after him,” Saranjit said. “He even got us a Parker pen from England when we were kids. He was very close to our family.” The clocks around us seemed to tick in unison. Saranjit, now quiet, it seemed, was travelling back in time. His expression saddened. “The last time we saw him, his hair was cropped close to his head. He looked severely ill. All that drinking had finally got to him. While leaving he told my father, “Pappa ji, je jeonda reha te pher aavanga, nahi taan Sat Sri Akal.” A few months later Shiv Kumar Batalvi died. He was only 36. I sat there in silence, and looked at the bench where Shiv Kumar Batalvi used to sleep. Everything around me was so ordinary. Yet, not so long ago, this space had been inhabited by one of the most extraordinary poets in the world. I left the shop and lingered in the market for a bit. I wondered if people roaming with their families were aware of the history of these shops. Their apathy hurt me a little, but then I realised that Batalvi was touching more hearts than ever before. With songs like “Ik kudi” and “Ajj din chadeya” his words were reaching far and wide. As if on cue, I remembered these immortal lines of his and a smile broke out on my face: “Gaman dee raat lami ae Ke mere geet lamen nen Na bherhi raat mukdi ae Na mere geet mukde nen” Your songs, Batalvi Saheb, are going to outlast these gloomy nights. Of this, you can be sure."
Today is Earth Overshoot Day: Humanity has used up resources for 2017,"Paris, August 2

Today, August 2, is Earth Overshoot Day. The day humanity exhausts its allowance of planetary resources such as water, soil, and clean air for all of 2017, as per environmental groups.

Earth Overshoot Day has arrived on August 2 this year, a day earlier than in 2016, according to environmental groups WWF and Global Footprint Network.

It means humanity will be living on ""credit"" for the rest of the year.

""By August 2, 2017, we will have used more from Nature than our planet can renew in the whole year,"" the groups had said in an earlier statement.

“This means that in seven months, we emitted more carbon that the oceans and forests can absorb in a year, we caught more fish, felled more trees, harvested more, and consumed more water than the Earth was able to produce in the same period.”

The equivalent of 1.7 planets would be required to produce enough to meet humanity's needs at current consumption rates.

Calculated since 1986, the grim milestone has arrived earlier each year.

In 1993, it fell on October 21, in 2003 on September 22, and in 2015 on August 13.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and gas make up 60 per cent of mankind's ecological ""footprint"" on the planet, said the groups.

There was some good news. While coming earlier every year, the advance of Earth Overshoot Day has slowed down, said the statement.

Individuals can contribute to stopping, and eventually reversing, the trend by eating less meat, burning less fuel, and cut back on food waste, said the report. — AFP"
How to defeat the idea of traffic management,"GOOD MOTORING

H. Kishie Singh

It has been repeated, ad nauseam, in this column that what we need is an expert on traffic. Judging by the so-called improvement of Chandigarh roads, it is abundantly clear that no one in the Chandigarh Administration and the Chandigarh Police have the foggiest notion of this term. I suspect we have a babu who may not even have a driving licence, but is making decisions on traffic management in the city. For the benefit for the city drivers and the powers that be, let us define the term ‘traffic management’. Well, traffic management means free and easy flow of traffic in controlled and safe conditions. Having explained that, I am obliged to ask, why are there two speed breakers at the entrance to Raj Bhawan? Traffic on this road, Vigyan Path, flows uninterrupted. Not being happy with such a scenario, two speed breakers have been built on this road. Surely, the Governor’s driver and escort vehicle have the brains to stop as they exit, look left and right, and then enter the main road. This happens occasionally. In any case, there are always half-a-dozen policemen on duty to control traffic and give His Excellency the right of way. Now, these speed breakers are an impediment, 24x7, in the free flow of traffic. They serve no practical purpose. It is also an accepted fact that speed breakers can cause accidents. Then there is the brilliant move of diverting weekend traffic through Sector 5. The diversion was necessary because Sarovar Path is closed at the Vigyan Path roundabout. The traffic is obliged to turn left to get to Sukhna Lake. The Police also did a left turn and, like water takes the path of least resistance, the Police did the same. They came to the Sector 5 entrance and diverted traffic to turn right. They did not solve a problem, they created one. A crossroad complete with barriers, creating a dangerous situation and making life hell for the residents of Sector 5. All the holiday makers now drive through the heart of Sector 5 to the Lake. It would have been much easier to take the traffic another 100 meters to Himalaya Marg, a wide sector dividing road. However, a hundred metres was a road too far! The latest disaster in traffic management thrust on Chandigarhian’s is at the junction of Chandi Path and Madhya Marg. Driving along Madhya Marg, you will come to a roundabout. Under the traffic lights there is a sign ‘No Left Turn’! Somebody please tell me what to do? Another point: If you are driving north on Chandi Path, just as you approach Madhya Marg, there is a slip road. The purpose of a slip road is to allow traffic to slip from the main road to prevent congestion. And guess what? There could be a red light at the end of the slip road to prevent you from entering Madhya Marg! This defeats the whole purpose of the slip road. Traffic now backs up on two roads. Nothing could be more counter- productive than blocking a slip road exit. The slip road is not very long. The length can accommodate two, may be three cars. The rear end of the fourth car could jut out on to Chandi Path, creating another problem.

Happy Motoring!"
Be on course to make a difference,"FIELD IN FOCUS: ENVIRONMENTAL CAREERS

Usha Albuquerque

With the US and President Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, a gigantic chunk of the Antarctic peninsula breaking off, and global warming causing heat waves, droughts and floods across the world, there is discernable concern about the future of our existence. Over the past fifty years we have learnt with dismay that much of the development we need for human progress, mainly in industry and agriculture, takes a major toll of nature and the environment. Climate change, acid deposition and hazardous waste disposal has forced the world to take a closer look at how we interact with our environment. This requires the creation of a large pool of professionals who possess the skill-set to limit the damage of industrialisation and development on the world’s endangered and increasingly fragile environment and to invent newer technologies that are less of a burden on natural resources and therefore, more sustainable in the long run. This has spurred the demand for scientists, researchers, engineers and policy makers and others with a firm grounding in theoretical and practical aspects of environmental studies and who understand the issues at hand and can help manage them. So, if you want to make a difference to the world we live in, you can also join the growing number of professionals committed to 'sustainable development'. Environmental problems are so complex and far reaching that many different careers related to the environment encompass the wide range of inter-disciplinary career fields.

These include :

Environment Science

An environmental scientist’s job is to utilise the knowledge of various principles and concepts of science, in order to protect and preserve environment. Environmental scientists conduct research studies in order to develop theories or methods of abating and controlling the sources of environmental pollution. Most of these disciplines require a background in science. While there are very few undergraduate courses in environment sciences, those interested in the scientific research aspect of work in this field can take up Environmental Science as an MSc. programme after a bachelor’s degree in any discipline of science. Most environment scientists work with NGOs, government and private organisations and international agencies.

Environmental Research

Environment-related research includes fields such as ecology, zoology, botany, fisheries, forestry, and wildlife management. It may involve testing the effects of chemicals or pollutants on organisms in a laboratory, or in the field studying the ecology of plants and animals. An Environmental researcher requires a post-graduate degree in environmental science, biology, zoology, botany, life sciences, or related fields. There is scope for employment in academic institutions, government agencies, non-government organisations, or industries handling environment related products.

Environment / Resource Management

The study of how people interact with the environment and its influence on the environment requires not only an understanding of science and technology, but also economics and even sociology. Currently, most companies have set up environmental monitoring cells (EMCs) to conduct assessments on a number of fronts, ranging from town, water, sound, displacement of people to damage done by blasting, construction etc, and so require a team of qualified environment scientists, and social scientists, to safeguard their interests and promote business activities. Government and environment management organisations also require policy makers and administrators to handle the various aspects of protection and conservation. There are a number of courses in environment management including MA/ MSc in Environmental Studies, Natural Resources Management and Public Policy and sustainable development.

Environment engineers

Environment engineers study waste management of hazardous substances in order to analyse the risk, the treatment and the methods of containing such hazards. They also handle solid waste management, treatment and disposal of effluents, radiation protection and draft out regulations so as to prevent the occurrence of mishaps. Municipal water supply systems and industrial wastewater treatment systems are both designed by environmental engineers. They are also in charge of conducting research on proposed projects for the benefit of the environment, analyzing scientific data, and performing quality control checks. Today it is mandatory for all developmental projects to have an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management plan (EMP) conducted by environment engineers before implementation. Many institutes in India offer graduate and post-graduate courses in environmental engineering. Most environment engineers work with Central and State Government pollution control boards, municipality corporations, water supply boards, public sector industries and with firms that provide professional, scientific, and technical services. International firms related to environmental projects are also recruiting environment engineers offering lucrative pay packages.

Environmental Journalism & advocacy

Much of the work in the management of environment issues involves creating awareness of the hazards of environmental pollution and the developing strategies for conservation and implementation. Whether it is researching on water, air pollution, livelihood and industry related issues, or reporting on the environment, or disseminating information through film or print, the field of the environment requires skills in writing, speaking, research, analysis, teaching, training, negotiating and persuading. This is best handled by those adept at communication and involves environmental journalism, or corporate communications. There are no specialised courses for environmental journalism, but those studying mass communication, journalism, public relations or corporate communications can specialize in this field. Apart from mainstream media such as newspapers and TV, environmental journalists can work for public relations or science communication, as well as with NGOs and international organizations working in the field of awareness and environmental protection.

Environmental Law

Environmental law deals with legislation concerned with protecting the environment and preventing degradation of natural resources. Environmental law also covers conservation of wildlife, protection of national parks and sanctuaries, and prohibiting or regulating damaging activities, assigning liability for environmental harms and providing adequate incentives for benign environmental activities. Environmental lawyers are employed in governmental agencies and non-governmental organisations. Industrial establishments also require environmental lawyers to help them deal with legal and governmental procedures related to the environment. There are LLM and PG diploma courses in Environmental law.

"The Tribune, Haryana state news","GURGAON: He may have not heard of Rakhi, but the women and girls of a remote Muslim-dominated village ""symbolically"" named by an NGO after US President Donald Trump will send him 1001 sacred threads on the Hindu festival that celebrates the brother-sister bond.

Gurgaon, August 5

He may have not heard of Rakhi, but the women and girls of a remote Muslim-dominated village ""symbolically"" named by an NGO after US President Donald Trump will send him 1001 sacred threads on the Hindu festival that celebrates the brother-sister bond.

The gesture by the residents of Marora village in the backward Mewat region represents the ""wish of the people that ties are further strengthened between India and the US"", says the NGO, which has adopted the village.

The village had come into limelight after Sulabh International Social Service Organisation (SISSO) chief Bindeshwar Pathak had announced to name it 'Trump's village'.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

The district administration had later said the move to rename the village was ""illegal"", forcing the organisation members to remove boards mentioning the new name.

They said signage boards and banners carrying the new name of the village and image of Trump had been removed by the organisation.

The village, with a population of 1,800 people, lies under Punhana Tehshil, some 60 km from Gurgaon.

""The NGO has been conducting many welfare programmes for women and girls in the village,"" Monica Jain, vice president of the NGO, said.

""These students have made 1001 rakhis with photos of Donald Trump and 501 rakhis for Narendra Modi. Women and girls of the village consider them their elder brothers,"" she said.

The consignment of rakhis was sent yesterday through cargo so that it reached the US president on Raksha Bandhan on August 7. The villagers are also sending invitations to the two leaders to visit the village.

Widows of the village have also expressed a desire to meet Modi on Raksha Bandhan at his residence in the national capital and tie rakhis.

""I have made 150 rakhis within three days for Trump bhaiyaa. I also written in a letter to be sent to the White House that the girls of your village want you to visit it with PM Modi,"" said 15-year-old Rekha Rani, a resident of the village.

Sulabh had recently constructed 95 toilets in Marora to implement Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship program to make every village in the country open defecation free.

The village has 140 houses and only 45 of them were equipped with toilet facility. Sulabh constructed the remaining 95 toilets, Jain said. —PTI"
Ebola can persist in survivor’s semen 2 years after infection,"Washington, August 3

The deadly Ebola virus can persist in the semen of survivors for more than two years after the onset of infection, a study has found. Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the US also detected Ebola virus RNA in the semen of men who had previously had a negative test of their semen in some cases. These findings led the team to suggest revision of the 2016 World Health Organisation guidelines relating to the sexual transmission of Ebola. The guidelines call for men who survive Ebola virus disease (EVD) to undertake measures such as abstinence and the use of condoms for at least 12 months after the onset of EVD or until their semen has tested negative for Ebola virus RNA twice. Of the 149 men who provided samples, 13 tested positive for Ebola virus RNA. Of these 13 men, 11 had positive results even two years after the onset of Ebola infection. “Our finding of long-term persistence and intermittent detection of viral RNA in semen suggests we need to change how we think about Ebola as it is no longer only an acute illness, but also one with potential long-term effects,” said William A Fischer, an assistant professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It is becoming clear that in some survivors, evidence of the virus can linger in the male genital tract for long periods of time with important potential implications for transmission,” said Fischer, co-author of the study published in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases. He noted that while there has been documented sexual transmission of Ebola earlier after acute infection, it is not known whether the presence of RNA serves as a correlate for infectious virus and if transmission this far out is possible. The study team also reports that the men whose samples tested positive for Ebola virus RNA were more likely to be older than those with a negative result. Those who had Ebola virus RNA detected in their semen also complained of vision problems at a higher rate than male survivors without evidence of Ebola virus RNA in their semen. The researchers recommend future studies investigate the source of viral persistence and whether the detection of viral RNA signifies the presence of infectious virus. PTI"

The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Boot village in Punjab’s Kapurthala is notorious for drug peddling. Many police raids and a record number of FIRs have failed to deter villagers

You can’t miss very large kothis painted white, as you enter Boot, a village in Kapurthala, also known as the ‘village of drug addicts’. The largish houses have taken over chunks of panchayat land. “This is just the beginning of this village’s notoriety,” says a vegetable seller.

The village recorded 47 FIRs under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, the maximum from a single village, in 2014, across the state. In police records, 375 cases have been filed between March 15, 2017, and July 25, and 472 accused have been arrested.

These figures tell a story of a village of more than 4,000 people; where every house has at least one or two young boys lodged in jail under charges of drug peddling. The village has seen over 70 deaths in the last 3-4 years, mostly youngsters in the age group of 23-27.

Soon after he was re-appointed Punjab Congress president, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh publicly swore that if voted to power, he would wipe out the drug menace from the state in four weeks. The Chief Minister formed a Special Task Force (STF). But four weeks have meant little.

“There was a 10-day police crackdown. Drug peddlers were caught, FIRs registered, and a strict watch was kept on outsiders entering the village and those leaving,” says an elderly villager (name withheld on request). “For those 10 days, all big dealers fled the village,” says the villager. “Earlier 1 gm chitta (heroin) would cost Rs 1,400 and now it is available for Rs 4,000,” says the villager.

Boot villagers sold illicit liquor before they took to selling chitta about four years back. Today hardly any house is left that does not deal in chitta. “A small-timer who sells 1 gm-10 gm earns anything between Rs 25,000-40,000 a day. Would villagers want to do any other business,” asks a youngster who promised to share everything about the village on the condition of anonymity.

“I don’t want to get into trouble. A few days back, our villagers attacked and tore the uniform of two head constables. Our community is very fearless. We are not scared of police or parcha... we can buy off policemen anytime.”

A walk through this village presents nothing unusual. But you don’t see many young boys. “Some are in jail, many have died and others are either trading chitta or using syringes,” says a youngster. He shows a place where empty syringes are lying scattered near village farmlands.

“The drug problem can be wiped out if the police decide to do so. But they are busy catching only the small drug peddlers,” says the youngster, ensuring the conversation is not taped. “If you stand here alone for more than 20 minutes, chances are someone might approach you for a deal. Clients from all across Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi and Mumbai come to Boot for the best chitta,” he says laughing, requesting us to leave.

A former sarpanch from Dogranwala, Veer Singh, blames the police for the rising drug problem in Boot. “If the police file an FIR against two genuine drug dealers, then it includes 10 more innocents. Those ‘dealers’ who are caught in the morning are seen roaming freely in the evening.”

Kapurthala SSP Sandeep Kumar says he is surprised that the villagers blame the police. But he admits that Boot villagers are not easy to deal with.

“I never send one or two policemen there. A team goes for the raid. There have been incidents when villagers have attacked policemen. And as far as taking bribe is concerned, we shift the policeman from that village on the slightest of doubt.” An inspector and an ASI were dismissed for their involvement in drugs. They were arrested by the Special Task Force.

The nearest Amritsar border is 80 km from Kapurthala from where heroin is said to be smuggled in the village. High quality chitta is also smuggled to Delhi.

Villagers, and even the police, say that big dealers from outside Boot sell the drug in the village. “You may find each house keeping at least 250 gm of chitta. And each house has modern facilities. The law enforcement agencies must find out how these people have made this kind of money,” says Dogranwala former sarpanch, Veer Singh.

Boot village has a school and a college nearby. Bholath MLA Sukhpal Khaira, the new leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, says drugs would not vanish overnight. “The drug menace is a result of unemployment and failure of agriculture in Punjab,” says Khaira."

Chandigarh, August 4

Twenty students of Government Model School, Mani Majra, were rushed to hospital after suffering from ""common side effects"" of the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine.

A majority of the children complained of rashes, fever and stomach ache while some complained of vomiting and nausea.

According to officials of the UT Heath Department, 19,706 children were vaccinated in over 70 schools in the city. The students were vaccinated in the afternoon following which many complained of stomach ache, some developed rashes while others were down with fever.

Official sources said 16 students were admitted to the Civil Hospital in Mani Majra while three were rushed to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16.

However, all children were sent back home after treatment. Anxious parents complained that the Health Department should have issued an advisory regarding the possible side effects of the MR vaccine. Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director, Health Services, UT, said there was no need to panic as side effects such as fever and rashes could occur in some cases following the vaccination. “Three children were rushed to the GMSH, Sector 16. I do not have the details of the children admitted to the Mani Majra hospital. However, all students were discharged in the evening,” said Dr Kashyap. He said the vaccine was of high quality and had been approved by the WHO.

Subhash, whose daughter studies in Class IV at Government Model School, Mani Majra, said, “My daughter was administered the vaccine in the afternoon. After sometime, she complained of fever and suffocation. Soon, some more students showed similar symptoms. Without wasting time, I, along with the school staff, took the ailing children to hospital. Soon, more children with similar problems arrived at the hospital.”

Suraj Kumar, father of another student who was taken ill, said there was chaos inside the hospital. Two students were accommodated on a bed. However, by evening, all children were fine.”

Common side effects

'Injection spot' reactions (pain, redness, swelling or a lump), fever, rash, headache, dizziness, joint or muscle pain, nausea and vomiting.

Badnore opened drive

UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had inaugurated the measles-rubella campaign on Thursday. Badnore highlighted the importance of the vaccine in the elimination of measles and control of rubella. He appealed to all children to take this vaccine and pass this message to their friends and neighbours as well. As many as 3.10 lakh children in the city will be covered under the MR vaccination drive. Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director, Health Services, UT, said all children from nine months to 15 years of age would be vaccinated."

Chandigarh, August 4

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat is focusing on infrastructure development in hill regions of the state, said Nainital MLA Sanjeev Arya while speaking with The Tribune here today. Arya, son of Transport Minister Yashpal Arya, said the government was making efforts to improve connectivity of the state with other parts of the country through road and train networks. The government was also working on the ambitious Char Dham all-weather road project announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. Such type of roads would boost tourism in the state, said 39-year-old Arya. The Prime Minister had laid the foundation stone of the all-weather Rs 11,700-crore road project to connect Char Dham, in Dehradun on December 27. On the migration issue, he said the government was committed to increasing employment opportunities in hill areas, he added. On the demand of starting direct Volvo bus service between Chandigarh and Haldwani via Haridwar, he would take up the issue brought to his notice by various social organization of Uttarakhand based in Chandigarh with the state government. Social activist Surender Halsi said at present the Uttarakhand TransportCorporation is running five Volvo buses between Chandigarh and Uttarakhand and only one is for Haldwani that too via Dehradun. Chandigarh residents were demanding a Volvo bus service between Chandigarh and Haldwani via Haridwar, he added.The government is working on the ambitious Char Dham all-weather road project announced by PM Narendra Modi last year.

Welfare schemes not to be spectacle anymore,"Samaan Lateef

Tribune News Service

Srinagar, August 4

Welfare schemes will no longer be seen as charity with the Jammu and Kashmir Government banning politicians from assembling beneficiaries for exhibition. The Jammu and Kashmir Government has asked its officials to ensure that no public function is organised during the distribution of benefits, described as “empowerment with dignity”. “The department will henceforth have to dispense aid or benefits to beneficiaries subtly in a routine manner without making a spectacle of it,” read a circular issued by the Secretary, Social Welfare Department, Sajad Ahmad Khan. The Social Welfare Department adopted the “mission to deliver with dignity”, asking its officials to stop the concept of charity and embrace the social security concept of empowerment with dignity. While extending welfare schemes to beneficiaries, which had been used by politicians in the past for votes, Khan directed government functionaries to ensure that no public function was organised and no minister, legislator or any other VIP was involved in the distribution of benefits. After the death of Burhan Wani in July last year, governance had come to a standstill due to widespread protests across the Valley. To show its public presence, the state government had then assembled beneficiaries of welfare schemes like Indira Awas Yojna and Swachh Bharat Mission at several places in Kashmir to distribute cheques in violation of rules. While the world had been looking towards concepts of empowerment and rights, Khan said empowerment in Jammu and Kashmir was saddled with concepts of charity. “Empowerment is a right which the government owes to its people. The government in general and the Social Welfare Department in particular will have to abandon the charity concept,” read the circular. He said the government had to work for the establishment of rights regime for children, women and all other sections of society which looked up to the government for empowerment and protection of rights."
Home Rule for Portuguese India.,"LAHORE, SUNDAY, AUGUST 5, 1917

A BOMBAY paper announces that the Lisbon Government have published a decree granting Home Rule or administrative autonomy to the Portuguese India. The Indian Deputy in the Portuguese Parliament has wired to the effect that the new concession affords fullest liberty to the people in controlling local administration. This decree has been overdue these two years, as autonomy was promised on the 15th August 1914. But the present reform sets free the people of Portuguese India, both Hindus, and Christians, to govern their province as they wish, subject to control from Lisbon in certain matters. The publication of the full details of the Home Rule scheme would interest other parts of India, where the people are better prepared for autonomous powers."
The Tribune: Life+Style,"Ever wondered about the life of vendors, who are often scorned at various traffic light-points in tricity? Meet a few of them…

Manpriya Singh

Just as the red light begins the countdown starting from 120 seconds, a little boy approaches with heart-shaped balloons. Roll up the car windows, get busy with your smart phone or wait for the lights to go green. After all, it’s a disturbing sight. Either scoot or shoo them away. “Sab hamain bhagate hain, police waale ya phir gaadi wale,” 18- year-old Bagarah, who originally hails from Rajasthan hates the rootless existence. It’s been a couple of years of selling various knick-knacks at different light points ;from Sector 35 lights to Phase 7 lights Mohali.

Like he said, “Sab hamain bhagate rehte hain.” So what is he selling these days? “Main balloons bechta hoon,’ he points to a pump and to unaired balloons lying in a packet. “Abhi phulaye nahin hai.” Err…How does he know they are balloons and not gubaare? “Aapke jaise log kehtein hain, Oh Balloons toh hamain pata hai inko balloons kehte hain.”

Is it disguised begging?

Just refer to it as disguised begging and pat comes the reply. “Bheekh maangne se toh acha hai,” declares Shankar Prasad, who sells all seasonal things from Santa caps to Tri-colour at the Mani Majra traffic lights. Currently he is trying to sell car shades.

But wouldn’t it be better if they instead tried finding a job indoors instead of selling in the middle of road on a crazy hot afternoon.

“Gulaami ya naukri karne se toh acha hai,” retorts 20 something Sami Akhtar, who hails from Bihar has been selling all car-related accessories at various traffic lights in the city since 2012. So how many does he end up selling in a day? “500 -700 kama hi lete hain.” For two to three hours spent at traffic lights, it might appear as a decent enough sum; perhaps lucrative too! However, it’s not easy finding what things will click with buyers. Sami goes all the way to Delhi, to Azadpur market, to procure things that he feels will sell like hot cakes to customers stopping at traffic lights.

Toys anyone?

It isn’t easy getting them to talk, let alone come forth with details. Or answers to questions that have often intrigued all of us while stopping at the lights. The promise of a sale is not sure to act as an ice-breaker. “Yeh na ho ke police waale aake bhagade,” 24- year-old Kabir is justified in his apprehensions. After all by selling coconut slices at Sector 29 light point, he supports as many as 10 people back home. It’s been two to three years and he makes about 500 rupees on a good day!

Lakshmi is quite an ironic name for a teenage girl who admits to not making enough by selling balloons at light points. But who buys these balloons — girls or children? “Ladkiyan zyaada leti hain,” she smiles, hinting towards those accompanied by boyfriends. Little wonder, by selling just about 20 ballons a day, there is not enough for even two square meals. Then what they do? Joining her is Pooja, who also hails from Rajasthan. “Then we pluck whatever berries and fruits we can get from trees,” she points to a jamun tree above. As for their outfits, “These also we got from Rajasthan.”

Sister, please buy it

Perhaps, one of the first things that comes to your mind when you find a ten or 11-year-old selling tissue paper boxes at Sector 35 lights is…err…why isn’t he in school? While that’s quite an obvious story of all the children being forced into child labour in India, we move on to something less abstract…when is his birthday? “Hamara birthday nahin hota,” reluctantly shares Sanjay, who hails from Rajasthan, on being promised at least one sale. Well, where do the boxes come from? “We get them from Ram Darbar.” Ok so how many does he manage selling?

“Today is my first day…I came a month ago from Rajasthan. And I haven’t sold any since morning and it is afternoon.” Wouldn’t some smart marketing lines help? “Main kehta hun, didi le lo.” He adds, “I have been told that I should try and sell these to girls especially the younger ones.” The little one has got his target audience in place. It’s time to leave him with the next round of lights. Life, lights or traffic…they just go on.

The script of love and lyrics,"Urdu, the language of Mir, Ghalib, Faiz and Firaq has a rich literary tradition, which must not be allowed to wither away

Kuldip Dhiman

When poet Jaleel Manakpuri was being felicitated by an organiser who was not familiar with the nuances of Urdu, a friend sitting next to the poet said, “Jaleel sahab, aaj aap zaleel hone wale hain.” (Jaleel sahib, today you are going to be humiliated). This is because a slight difference in pronunciation can change the meaning completely in Urdu. Jaleel means ‘glorious’, and if pronounced zaleel, it means ‘to be humiliated’. Urdu, along with its twin sister Hindi, has been a language of the masses for more than 700 years. Both grew out of what is called khari boli, the general language of communication in northern India. While Urdu is normally written in the Persian script, and has more Persian, Turkish and Arabic words, Hindi is written in the Devanagari and inclines more towards Sanskrit. These are virtually indistinguishable to the outsider. The name ‘Urdu’ has its origins in the Turkish word ordu which means ‘army camp’, and over the centuries, it has produced great literature, especially poetry. A single sher (couplet) of Urdu can help you express what cannot be said in a thousand words. However, with the rise of English as the lingua franca, and with an unfair association of Urdu with religion, this beautiful language seems to be losing favour with the masses. Many Urdu aficionados have begun to feel that the language is slowly dying, while experts in the field hold that Urdu is doing much better than before. Rekhta, an organisation devoted to the promotion of Urdu language and literature, recently held a mushaira (poetic gathering) at the Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh. If numbers are any indication, it was heartening to see that the hall was jam-packed with young and old, with many of them standing outside the theatre hall to listen to the poets. The same is true of wherever mushairas are held. Litterateurs from Punjab such as Saadat Hasan Manto, Sahir Ludhianvi, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Gulzar and hundreds of others have made tremendous contribution to popularise Urdu. Its popularity notwithstanding, Urdu certainly remains in the shadow of English. Dr Kumud Bansal, Chairperson, Haryana Urdu Akademi, Panchkula, observes, “Not just Urdu, all Indian languages are suffering. Children are not being taught their mother tongue anymore. Most parents want their children to learn only English. This is because of the slave mentality we have. This is the reason we need Urdu academies. Have you heard of an English academy?” We move over to Malerkotla, a town rich in Urdu culture. Talking about the current health of Urdu, Dr Rubina Shabnam, Secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, says: “Urdu is the language that emerged in the undivided Punjab. In his book, Punjab Mein Urdu, Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani, the great linguistic and researcher, has shown through research based on historical evidence that the greater Punjab was the birthplace of Urdu. So Urdu is rooted in this region.” However, not all scholars agree with Shirani. Talking about the academy and its aims, Dr Shabnam says, “We started in 2014, and we have a budget of only Rs 50,000 per annum. Even with this meagre sum, we have managed to hold stage programmes but have not been able to publish anything. Now, the government has given us a one-time sum of Rs 3 crore. With this, we hope to realise the aims of the academy. Recently, I met Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister, and he said he would give us a hundred crore rupees. If we got this amount, we would be able to encourage Urdu writers, and poets. Presently, we are starting free Urdu learning centres in six cities of Sunam, Bathinda, Ropar, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Patiala.” Regarding the popularity of Urdu, Prof Mahmood Alam, former professor at Government College, ex-secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, and writer of a poetry collection Shikast-e-Khwab, says: “If you ask me about the current status of Urdu, I would say it is far better than before. Two decades ago, Urdu was not being taught in as many schools as it is being taught now, and there were not as many students as we have now. During my time, there used to be four teachers, and we had about four or five students who wanted to learn Urdu. Now you have 30 students, but unfortunately only one teacher. Many wish to learn Urdu but they get discouraged because it does not offer employment opportunities.” Rubbishing language politics, Professor Alam observes, “People say that there is friction between Hindi and Urdu. They say languages create conflict between different people, but this is not so. Languages bring people together. If Hindi and Punjabi speakers learn Urdu, their Hindi and Punjabi pronunciation will improve, and vice versa.” One has to learn the finer points of this language in order to speak it well. As Dagh Dehalvi puts it: “Nahin khel ai Dagh yaron se kah do; Ki ati hai Urdu zaban ate ate” (O! Dagh, tell friends that learning Urdu is not a child’s play; It takes its own time to be mastered). Amarnath Wadehra, a diehard Urdu protagonist, remembers the days of his youth when Urdu poets were a rage in Lahore, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and the rest of Punjab. “There used to be regular mushairas that went on all night, and people came in hordes to listen to their favourite poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi, Firaq Gorakhpuri and many other stalwarts. Urdu poets did a lot to fan the flames of the freedom moment, and bring about a social change. Many freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for the country singing ‘Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mei hai’. The younger generation should learn English for getting jobs, but they must also learn Urdu to enrich their personality.” Born in 1937, Pakpattan, Pakistan, Dr HK Lall has been teaching Urdu for the past four decades. “Urdu is in my blood. My father taught it to my brother and me.” Even at 81, he continues to teach the language untiringly. “Khidmat-e-Urdu karunga umr bhar; Yeh meri puja, mera imaan hai.” (I will serve Urdu all my life; It is my worship, it is my conscience).

Disappearing readers

Propagators notwithstanding, the fact is that the circulation of Urdu newspapers and magazines is going down by the day. In 2001, the total number of Urdu newspapers in the country was 2,906, but many have been forced to go online or have closed shop because of falling circulation. In a telephonic conversation, Sham Dass Khanna, news editor, Hind Samachar, the number one Urdu daily in Punjab, said, “The situation is alarming. From 1,20,000 copies per day until the 1990s, our circulation has come down to 37,000 copies per day. Our readers are disappearing because Urdu does not promise career options.”

Measures needed

In order to improve the condition of Urdu, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Nadeem, who conducts certificate and diploma courses in Urdu and Persian at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib, says: “We plan to start special classes for students who are doing post-graduation and doctorate in Punjabi because there is a close relationship between Punjabi and Urdu. The knowledge of Urdu is important even for religious studies because the poetry of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Gobind Singh is replete with Persian words and phrases.” Urdu is the language of Punjabi culture because it was born in Punjab, observes Dr Nadeem. “It is essential to learn Urdu, because once you learn how to read and write it, doors open to eight languages because they all used the same script. These languages are: Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kashmiri, Pashtu, Dogri, Sindhi, and also Punjabi because in Pakistan, it is written in the Persian script. If you examine Punjabi and Urdu, you will notice that there are so many similarities. For example, chhabeel comes from the Arabic word sabeel; ardas comes from arz-e-dash.” Dr Mohammad Ayyub Khan, programme in-charge, Haryana Urdu Akademi, points out the practical problems in the propagation of Urdu: “There is an acute shortage of teachers. At Panjab University, Punjabi University, Guru Nanak Dev University, and Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, they have appointed only one Urdu teacher, and this one teacher runs the entire department. How can they do justice to their jobs? In MA classes, we have eight subjects, so we need at least four Urdu teachers. It is not that there are no posts, but I fail to understand why these are not being filled up. It is not that the government is not giving funds to promote the language; the funds are not being properly utilised.” Muhammad Rafique, lecturer, political science at Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), Malerkotla, says: “A team from Delhi came here to study the status of Urdu in this tehsil, and they gave a good report about it. They said, in other states, about 1,200 Urdu teachers have been appointed but their output is very poor. We have only 45 teachers, but their output is tremendous.” Sahibzada Ajmal Khan Sherwani, a poet belonging to the royal family, suggests that if we want people to learn Urdu, we must produce excellent literature, films, TV serials and plays in Urdu. We see that the rise or downfall of a language is directly linked to the rise or downfall of its literature. “Urdu is very popular, and one of the reasons is the extensive use of Urdu in the film industry. Another reason for its popularity is various TV channels that telecast Urdu programmes, serials, seminars, and mushairas. In addition to this, the government must open more institutes and encourage students to learn it in schools and colleges so that great writers and poets are produced.” Speaking of Urdu, he wrote a verse: “Hoon main Urdu, hai dilon mei mera maskan dekho; Kaun kehta hai ki meri koi jagir nahin” (I am Urdu, and my abode is in the hearts of people, Who says that I have no legacy?). The legacy of Zauk, Sauda, Momin, Iqbal, Hali, Faraz and others is alive indeed in the hearts of the masses."

Chandigarh, August 4

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the inter-cadre deputation of Jagdale Nilambari Vijay from the Punjab cadre to the AGMUT cadre as the UT SSP for a period of three years. The appointment was approved on August 2. A 2008-batch Punjab-cadre IPS officer, Jagdale Nilambari Vijay will soon join as the first woman SSP of Chandigarh. The post of SSP in the city has been lying vacant for eight months after Sukhchain Singh Gill, a 2003-batch IPS officer, was repatriated to Punjab in December last year. UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had, in May, recommended the name of Nilambari Vijay for the post to the Union Home Ministry. Her name was part of a panel of three officers received from the Punjab Government. The two other officers on the list were S Bhoopati, a 2007-batch IPS officer, and Naveen Singla, a 2009-batch officer. At present, Eish Singhal, a 2010 AGMUT-cadre IPS officer, is officiating as the UT SSP. Nilambari spent considerable time in Ludhiana. She also served as the SSP, Ropar."
SGPC gives relief to four Pilibhit torture victims,"PROMISE FULFILLED AFTER TWO DECADES

Amritsar, August 4

It took the SGPC more than two decades to fulfil its promise of compensating Sikh victims, who were tortured in Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit jail in early 1990s. In all, four victims, who were left partially disabled, received cheques for Rs 50,000 each today. They were Trilok Singh, Manjit Singh, Gurnam Singh Johal and Pargat Singh. The SGPC would on Monday give Rs 1 lakh each to five families of Karaj Singh, Sarvjit Singh, Tarsem Singh, Sukhdev Singh and Bachhittar Singh, who lost their lives then, officials said. On the intervening night of November 8-9, 1994, 28 Sikhs were tortured in Pilibhit jail. Of them, seven were killed. All 28 were all booked under the TADA, but the police could not substantiate their claim. Then SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra had announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the deceased and Rs 50,000 each to the injured. But Rs 11,000 was given to the families of the deceased and Rs 5,000 to the injured. With the assistance from the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), the victims are still fighting a legal battle. The next date of hearing is on August 16 at the Allahabad High Court. Trilok Singh, who lives in Amritsar’s Rasoolpur village, said affidavits from three families of the deceased were submitted with the Allahabad HC. His brother Heera Singh is a truck driver. Trilok said his elder brother Sarvjit Singh (then in his early 30s) was beaten to death by the Pilibhit jail staff. “I was left permanently disabled. Sarvjit was cremated under pressure from the UP Government then. He had left behind two sons and two daughters. The UP Government had given a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to the family,” he said. Tej Kaur (80) had lost her son Bacchittar during the police torture. She lives in Bhagwanpura village near Amritsar. There’s no one to look after her. Another family is of Tarsem. His son Gurminder Singh (24) is a labourer at Chhina village in Amritsar district. As for Karaj Singh, he was unmarried. His younger brother Kuldeep Singh has submitted a claim on his brother’s behalf."

Jalandhar, August 4

The Municipal Corporation (MC) has started fogging as a preventive measure for dengue and chikungunya in city areas. It was started on August 1 and will continue for coming months.

The corporation will cover the whole city in the next two weeks. It has 11 vehicle-mounted fogging machines in addition to newly purchased 30 small shouder-mounted machines which can easily be taken to small and congested areas of the city.

The old city has small streets where old vehicle-mounted machines can’t move. The newly purchased small fogging machines can now easily access the areas. The Health Department had started meetings with all municipal corporations for preparation for the seasonal diseases in the month of April.

On the directions of the Commissioner of the civic body, Dr Basant Garg, the health and sanitation department had started anti-larva drive two months ago.

For this exercise, the mapping was done for the last two years to see the number of cases in a particular area in a ward. The anti-larva activity has been completed in more than 25 wards which will be completed during the first week of September.

More than 200 people were challaned where larva was found and also residents were made aware of dengue and chikugunya. The maximum cases were from wards 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, Basti areas, industrial areas, PAP and some parts of the periphery of the city. The chief sanitary inspectors and sanitary inspectors are looking after the whole drive."
Coping with corruption,"BOOK REVIEW: WHY SCAMS ARE HERE TO STAY BY N. RAM.

Nirmal Sandhu

On July 12, Brazil’s former President Lula da Silva was sentenced to 10 years in prison for taking an apartment worth $6,90,000 from a private firm in exchange for oil refinery contracts. In Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on trial in the supreme court after a JIT (joint investigation team) probe into the revelations in the Panama Papers. For a country that ranks 79 in the 176-nation corruption perception index of Transparency International, India has seen fewer such high-profile convictions. Unlike Pakistan, we seem to have consigned the Panama Papers to the dustbin. Amitabh Bachchan and top businessmen were on the Panama list. Leave aside corrupt politicians, in India even loan defaulters get away due to political blessings, turning banks sick with NPAs. The RBI and the government refuse to name and shame them. The well-governed developed nations apart, compared to developing countries, India lags in fighting graft. Barring a Lalu Prasad here or a Chautala there, the arm of the law rarely reaches the powerful politicians. They reach an understanding not to touch one another. The latest instance comes from Punjab — of Badals and the Captain. It is amazing how politicians can make people believe that they will fight corruption and deliver what they promise. Occasional noises about scams notwithstanding, no political leader or party is really interested in eradicating corruption. Elections are hugely expensive. Corporate funding makes tycoons extract their pound of flesh. Companies that earlier funded the Congress now line up behind the BJP. That may explain why Haryana’s land sharks remain untouched. Credit goes to the BJP’s marketing skills and media management for building a perception of Modi fighting black money. The innocent need to be told that despite the pain they suffered in the belief that demonetisation would target the rich, the government has not put anyone in jail, terror funding has not stopped, fake currency has resurfaced and black money is back in circulation. The next time any Modi backer talks of the benefits of demonetisation or a surgical strike on corruption and black money, just ask: who has he sent to jail? Investigations and court cases drag on until a favourable regime bails out the proven graft-taker. The CBI raids on the Lalu Prasad family are more for drawing political mileage because a conviction is difficult since the alleged corrupt deeds happened 14 years ago. The law of limitations bars trial after a certain period. The Robert Vadra land controversy was raked up for elections only. Now the Bofors file is being reopened. Without harming anyone, the BJP has used its reported anti-graft fight to put its political opponents on the defensive. Much of the book is about academic aspects of corruption — like the history, definition and theory of scams — and a detailed study of the Bofors case and Tamil Nadu’s “scientific corruption”. N. Ram concurs with a BJP minister’s assessment that “when it came to corruption, Tamil Nadu ranked ‘Number One’ in India.” Going by the extent and foolproof scientific method of corruption in Tamil Nadu, politicians in Punjab are way behind. Navjot Singh Sidhu wrongly lauded Tamil Nadu’s liquor business to highlight Punjab’s poor liquor revenue under the Badals. Our Ph.D in politics has followed Jayalalithaa in securing political and economic gains from freebies. Welfare politics is the latest idea of money-making. Jayalalithaa managed the system in a way that no one else, perhaps, has ever done. Compared with their counterparts in Tamil Nadu, Punjab politicians make just pocket money from mining, liquor, cable or transport businesses. The difference is Tamil Nadu’s economic growth was faster and few minded their star leaders taking away a large slice of the cake; the delivery of welfare schemes was efficient. There are known systemic loopholes and weaknesses in the legal process that politicians exploit to defeat investigations, genuine or motivated, against them. There are some sensible and workable ways listed in the book to minimise, if not eliminate, corruption. But it is futile to expect the political class to change the system that suits it or outlaw something that works wonderfully to its advantage. As the title of the book by N. Ram, a veteran journalist and former Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu, says matter-of-factly, corruption is here to stay."

Fight mode,"Sylvester Stallone to move forward with lawsuit against Warner Bros

Sylvester Stallone is one up against Warner Bros in the lawsuit over profits from the 1993 science-fiction film Demolition Man. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge rejected the studio's bid to throw out breach of contract and fraud claims. The actor is also being permitted to bring a potentially big claim that Warner's accounting practices are likely to deceive the public. Through his loan-out company Rogue Marble, Stallone filed his lawsuit in April. After being challenged, the studio sent Stallone a check for 2.82 million USD, but the actor wasn't satisfied. What makes Stallone's case provocative besides an A-list actor suing the same studio that distributed 2015's ‘Creed,' which earned Stallone an Oscar nomination, is a claim of unfair business practices. —ANI"

"Muscles, not brain, may be behind sleep disorders","Houston, August 5

The answer to combat sleep disorders may not be in the brain, say scientists who have found that a protein present in the muscles can lessen the effects of sleep loss.

Researchers from University of Texas Southwestern in the US demonstrated how a circadian clock protein in the muscle - BMAL1 - regulates the length and manner of sleep in mice.

The surprising revelation challenges the widely accepted notion that the brain controls all aspects of sleep, they said.

The team found that while the protein's presence or absence in the brain had little effect on sleep recovery, mice with higher levels of BMAL1 in their muscles recovered from sleep deprivation more quickly.

Removing BMAL1 from the muscle severely disrupted normal sleep, leading to an increased need for sleep, deeper sleep, and a reduced ability to recover, researchers said.

""These studies show that factors in muscles can signal to the brain to influence sleep. If similar pathways exist in people, this would provide new drug targets for the treatment of sleep disorders,” said Joseph S Takahashi, Chairman of Neuroscience at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

""This finding is completely unexpected and changes the ways we think sleep is controlled,"" Takahashi added.

The study was published in the journal eLife. —PTI"

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"

Annoyed over accumulation of rainwater in Sirki Bazaar, demand meeting with MC Commissioner

Bathinda, August 4

High drama prevailed at the office of the Municipal Corporation Bathinda this afternoon when residents and traders of Sirki Bazaar staged a protest outside the MCB building.

Annoyed over rainwater still accumulated in Sirki Bazaar, the protesters locked the MCB officials and workers inside the building for almost an hour and a half.

Senior deputy mayor Tarsem Goyal, deputy mayor Gurinderpal Kaur Mangat and several councillors were also locked inside the building.

Seeing the main gate locked and a crowd of protesters outside, residents who had come to the MCB office to get their work done returned.

The officers then informed MCB Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal about the protest, who in turn directed the senior officials to intervene and pacify the protesters.

Not the ones to bow down easily, the protesters remained adamant on meeting the Commissioner to discuss their demands.

After persuading, the protesters relented and unlocked the gate but only after they were promised that the Commissioner would hold a meeting with them to find a solution to the problem of waterlogging.

The protesters threatened that in case the promise was not fulfilled, they would intensify their stir.

Leading the protesters, Congress leader Harjinder Singh Sidhu alleged that the MCB officials were indulging in corrupt practices.

“The MCB has become an epitome of corruption in the city. The MCB officials are least concerned about the issues that the city residents are facing. They are more inclined towards planning projects through which they can mint money,” he said.

The protesters alleged that every year the MCB claims that it is prepared to tackle waterlogging during the monsoon season but even five minutes of heavy rain is enough to deflate them.

“For the past five decades, we have been facing the problem of waterlogging, which is increasing with every passing year as the population of the city is increasing. The city area is expanding, in turn putting extreme pressure on the sewerage system,” said protesters.

They added that monsoon meant problems and loss of business since the customers didn’t come to Sirki Bazaar during these days."

SRK rocks

It’s a beautiful film, with a lovely story. What I love the most about the film is SRK—he’s my favourite actor. It’s a film worth watching. — Karuna Handa, student

Too mushy

I am not much of a romantic but my girlfriend, who pulled me to this film, is. So, I didn’t like the film very much. It’s good for time pass, or a one-time watch. — Angad Singh, student

Gurgaon

Based on true event the story of Gurgaon revolves around kidnapping of Preeto which family has come to know from midnight call. Directed by Shanker Raman, and written by Vipin Bhati and Shanker Raman, Gurgaon is a brooding crime thriller in which a kidnapping exposes the avarice, sibling jealousy, and murderous past that plague a property mogul’s clan.

Meet M Venkaiah Naidu — India's 'political' Vice-President,"Vibha Sharma

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 5

In Muppavarapu Venkaiah Naidu, India has as its 15th Vice-President a hardcore politician, someone who has been in the public life for more than four decades — or what he describes as a “people’s person”. With Naidu’s election, the BJP now holds all three top constitutional positions of the country — the President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister. Naidu comes with rich political experience. He has not just been in charge of key portfolios in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet but has also headed the organisation he refers to as his “maa” (mother) as its President-the key charge that Amit Shah, the BJP’s new-age “Chanakya” holds today. According to Naidu’s close associates, he brought dynamism and synergy in the ministries he held and it would not be “out of place to expect action and change oriented Naidu to aim at similar improvement in the functioning of the Rajya Sabha as its Chairperson”. Naidu’s appointment to the protocol-wise second top Constitutional position of the country is expected to augment the saffron party’s political endeavour down south. His moorings in Chavatapalem, a remote village in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, are supposed to achieve that for the BJP. Alongside his outreach and “friendships” among various political parties is also expected to help in effective functioning of the Rajya Sabha where the party-led NDA is in a minority.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Naidu’s election comes at a time when the BJP has emerged as the number one party in the Rajya Sabha but the numbers continue to be stacked against it in favour of the Congress-led Opposition. Naidu has promised to “follow and strengthen the Constitutional practices and Parliamentary democratic system” but with him in the Chair, the BJP hopes to achieve more from the Upper House than it had been able to in the past three years since it came to power. The Vice-Presidential job is a Constitutional office and the substantive part the role is as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. This is the second time that the Rajya Sabha will have an RSS- BJP man (10 years there was Bhairon Singh Shekhawat tenure) in the Chair. This apart, that the 68-year-old was no mood to end his political journey so early in life is now a stated fact. “Never am I going to participate in vice-president election even if anyone compels me"". “Happiness for me is to meet people, be among them and serve them. I cannot stay away from people by taking up any ceremonial position,” Naidu had said amid speculations about his nominations from the post. His journey with the BJP did not end just with a resignation from all party and Cabinet positions but with the pain of leaving his “mother”. “Now I do not belong to any party,” Naidu said after filing nomination papers that many also perceived as the end of the political road for an intensely political man. As he and his family prepare to move to 6 Maulana Azad, the Vice-President’s House, the add-on assignment of the Rajya Sabha chairman will nonetheless keep him connected with the active politics he so loves. “I wanted to see Modi come back to power in 2019 after which I wanted to resign from active politics. But destiny has other plans for me,” said Naidu, also known for his penchant for slogans and rhyming sentences. Earlier, while stating that there was no chance of him contesting the Vice-Presidential election, he quipped he neither wants to become the ""rashtrapati"" (president) nor the ""uparashtrapati"" (vice-president) and was happy being Usha's ""pati"" (spouse). Usha is his wife."

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."

Beats buffalo meat

During the April-June period, basmati contributed 29% (Rs 8,168 crore) to the country’s agricultural and processed food product exports value-wise, followed by buffalo meat (19.33% or Rs 5,473 crore)

Basmati emerged as the top exporting agri item in the Indian commodity basket, surpassing buffalo meat, in the first quarter of the current fiscal. Reasons: An increased buying from Iran and higher per unit realisation. During the April-June period, basmati contributed 29% to the country’s agricultural and processed food product exports value-wise, followed by buffalo meat (19.33%). According to Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority data, basmati exports for the Q1 stood at 12.56 lakh tonnes compared to 11.86 lakh tonnes during the corresponding period of the last year. Though it witnessed a 6% rise volume-wise, thanks to better realisation, the value-wise growth was 32%. The total value of the exports stood at Rs 8,168 crore during the period compared to Rs 6,196 crore during the previous period. As against per tonne realisation of around $787 during the previous year, basmati has commanded an average price of $1,009 per tonne in the Q1 this year. “An increased demand from Iran has pushed up export volume of Basmati. The increase in value was because of better realisation,” said Gurnam Arora, Joint Managing Director, Kohinoor Foods."

Court orders officials to visit area after learning about its poor condition, seeks report

Chandigarh, August 4

Masol village in Mohali district is about 20 km away from Chandigarh, but when it comes to amenities, the hamlet appears to be ages away. Indication to this effect came during the hearing of a petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. As a case involving the issue of empowering women came up for resumed hearing, senior advocate Reeta Kohli, appointed amicus curiae or the friend of the court, told the Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri that even roads, good schools and other amenities were not available for residents of the village. Taking a stern view, Justice Bahri directed a visit to the village by the authorities concerned before the submission of a detailed report. Justice Bahri, in fact, directed “all officers present in court will visit the village”. Masol had hit the headlines a year ago after excavations by the Archeaological Survey of India had revealed large-size fossils of animals and even human beings. Apart from Indian archaeologists, a team of French scientists too had reportedly carried out an excavation and research in the village. Indications are that the fossils are 2.5 million years old. The development took place soon after Justice Ritu Bahri initiated suo motu proceedings for preventing women from ending their lives and benefiting them at pre-crime stage. The High Court had earlier finalised three villages in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh for the implementation of the scheme for turning them into model hamlets to empower women. Justice Bahri had asserted that the villages could be taken as a sample for implementing MGNREGA scheme, whereby women could be employed for the purpose of creating infrastructure for hygienic kitchen, besides beautification and cleaning of the villages. NGOs could also be associated for helping in the installation of solar lights and bio-gas plants in the villages. The students from architecture colleges too could be associated for giving suggestions to beautify the areas. Justice Bahri had also recommended an increase in plantation by associating village panchayats and other villagers to overcome environmental threats. “Suggestions could be given as to how women living in the villages could be motivated to produce healthy food, handicrafts, etc. which could be sold in cities with the help of social media and other means. “College students could be motivated to share their books, toys, clothes, etc. with children of the villages to increase happiness and peace among women and children of weaker sections,” Justice Bahri had added."

Credit analyst plays the role of a major decision maker of customer credit; he deals with computer programmes to maintain the history of customer credit and keeps financial records up-to-date. Without the recommendation of a credit analyst the banks, insurers and company won't be able to extend the loan for business, home, cars and occasionally employee's payrolls as well.He works with banks and other lenders to determine the ability of businesses to repay loans and other debts. Commercial credit analysts are usually employed by government authorised agencies, banks and commercial lenders.

These subjects are necessary to function as a credit analyst as they aid in risk assessment.

Hear out party workers twice a week: BJP chief,"Tribune News Service

Rohtak, August 4

BJP president Amit Shah has directed all Haryana Cabinet ministers to remain present in their respective offices in Chandigarh 10 a.m. onwards on every Tuesday and Wednesday to hear out party workers. Shah said this while addressing office-bearers of various cells of the BJP on the final day of his three-day visit here today. Chief Minister Manohar Lal was also present. “The ministers should also take their lunch in their offices on both these days to spare maximum time for the workers,” Shah said. Besides, the ministers have been directed to visit their districts once a month to listen to and redress the grievances of workers and also get their feedback. Shah remarked that earlier certain families and castes ruled the roost in the state and jobs were given to the youth on the basis of castes whereas the meritorious ones felt cheated and disappointed. In a veiled attack on former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, he said a leader was in jail for committing irregularities in providing government jobs. “Nobody can complain today that he or she gave a bribe for employment as jobs are being given to the eligible youth purely on merit. This notable change in the system has resulted in renewed confidence of the youth in the government,” Shah said."

Ethical or otherwise?,"The recent spate of layoffs in the IT sector have lead to a debate over the fairness of these decisions. Are IT companies justified in dumping employees almost unceremoniously?

Geetu Vaid

Layoffs by IT companies, big as well as small, over the past few months has assumed alarming proportions now. Though initially disregarded even by NAASCOM as a routine exercise by the IT companies, something which was not supposed to have an effect on the hiring as well as job scenario in the IT sector, the lay off trickle has transformed into a heavy downpour which is difficult to be swept under the carpet any longer. Recent data figures show significant reduction in the workforce in the major IT companies in the quarter ending in June, 2017. The country’s largest job creator and $154 billion sector is suddenly an uncertain ground for its workforce. Besides stringent visa norms for US and Brexit, the key factor behind layoffs is rapid automation and failure to keep up with the changing technology by the work force. Several traditional job roles have suddenly become redundant and companies are looking for people with niche skills rather than a broad-based portfolio. In such a scenario many of the mid-level executives have been handed over the pink slips with “low performance” being the reason given for discontinuing their services, while the hiring of freshers has also been curtailed heavily. With india’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, suddenly becoming the hub of protests by those affected by the retrenchment move, the debate over the ethical and legal aspects of these layoffs is raging. “There has always been a churn in every IT Company, on a year-on-year basis, either at the annual Performance Appraisal cycles or when projects are not very good and employees, too, had a limited view of loyalty for such employment. The deficit between hires Vs exits was a common phenomenon and is now being highlighted only when the industry is experiencing difficulties”, says Subramanyam, CEO of Ascent HR. He, however, maintains that whole blame should not be transferred to the employer as the IT employees have been changing jobs for better prospects till now. According to Subramanya Sirish Tamvada, Dean, IFIM Law College, “As long as the companies follow the law, retrenchment is not illegal however, it may be unethical. There are people who are dependent on these jobs, they have financial commitments such as repayment of loans; health care expenses of old parents or daughter or sister marriage at home”. “ The case of RIF or reduction in force as the industry refers to it can not be termed legal given the framework in India today. But this is an industry that thrives on opportunity than structured planning and hence using the word unreasonable for this act of the industry appears harsh”, maintains Subramanyam.Any employee qualifying as workmen can raise an industrial dispute and contest the action of the employer in asking someone to go or essentially retrench. According to Tamvada the employees can take legal recourse in case there is non-compliance on the part of the employers. “If the company has not followed the due process of law, then that company will be held liable and strict action should be taken against them”, he says. “The labour laws in India are quite stringent and well structured to handle any act of oppression of workmen. The question comes only when an person is a senior employee designated possibly as Director or Vice President is asked to go and whether the person can invoke the right of a workman under the law? The answer would be largely No, and he may need to seek recourse within the terms of the Contract of employment or Service”, explains Subramanyam. “Laying off hundreds and thousands of people in one go is shocking and definitely unethical and it does not build confidence in our system and particularly in the IT sector”, adds Tamvada.

Point of Law

The workman has been given one month’s notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired or the workman has been paid lieu of such notice, wages for such period of the notice

The workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days’ average pay for every completed year of continuous service or any part thereof in excess of six months; and

Notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appropriate government or such authority as may be specified by the appropriate Government by notification in the official gazette.

Popular misconception is that industrial laws in the country do not apply to IT and ITES companies. In HR Adyanthaya v. Sandoz (India) Ltd., the Supreme Court in 1994 decided that the definition of workman includes ‘a person to be workman under the industrial disputes act must be employed to do the work of any of the categories viz, manual, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory. However, people in managerial positions are exempted.

The law relating to retrenchment is provided under Section 2 (oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (ID Act). Retrenchment means termination of service of an employee by an employer for any reason other than as a punishment due to disciplinary action. This does not include — voluntary retirement, superannuation, non-renewal of contract, termination on the ground of continued ill health. There are certain conditions to be met before retrenchment of workforce. Section 25F of the ID Act provides that: Any workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service of not less than one year under an employer shall b retrenched by that employer until:"
Appearances can’t be deceptive,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

Can manufacturers mislead consumers about the quantity of a product by using oversized containers? I am referring here to a face cream that I bought last month. Even though it was expensive, I looked at the big packet and thought that the cream within would last me at least two months. However, once I started using the cream, I realised that the bottle had a false bottom and the quantity of cream in it was much less than the impression given by the bottle and the cardboard box over it. I really feel cheated. Manufacturers cannot use oversized containers that give an exaggerated impression of the quantity within. Doing so would not only violate the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, but would also constitute an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act. In fact, such oversized packages interfere with consumers’ judgment of the price of a product by misleading them about the quantity within. They also distort competition and affect price comparison of different brands by consumers at the time of purchase. Therefore, the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules specifically prohibit such deceptive practice. Rule 23 defines a deceptive package as “a package which is so designed as to deliberately give to the consumer, an exaggerated or misleading impression as to the quantity of the commodity contained therein…” The rule, however, permits such exaggerated packaging in exceptional cases: “Where bigger dimensions of the package can be justified on the ground that such dimensions are necessary for giving protection to the commodity contained in such package or for meeting the requirements of the machine used for filling such package.” Even this exception now needs to be re-examined in the light of the advances in the packaging industry. Rule 23 also gives the enforcement agency — the department of legal metrology — the authority to order re-packing of such commodities and on the manufacturer’s failure to do so, seize the goods and take appropriate punitive action in accordance with the law. Under the Consumer Protection Act too, such exaggerated packaging is prohibited as it constitutes an unfair trade practice. The Act defines an unfair trade practice as a “ trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice including any of the following practices, namely: (1) the practice of making any statement, whether orally or in writing or by visible representation which (i) falsely represents that the goods are of a particular standard, quality, quantity, grade, composition, style or model….” I must point out that the poor display of net quantity information on the packaging is also aiding those manufacturers, who resort to such exaggerated packages and this has to change. Under the Packaged Commodities Rules, the manufacturer has to specify the net quantity of the product on the package and there are specifications in the rules on how it has to be done. Yet, you find manufacturers violating the rules with impunity. Some packages have the information at the bottom, yet others, at the top and some others on the sides. And there is no clear demarcation of the information, as required.First and foremost, complain to the department of legal metrology. In a number of cases, manufacturers get away with such deceptive packaging because consumers do not complain. Ask them to let you know the action taken against the manufacturer for violation of the law. Secondly, you should write to the manufacturer expressing your anger at the deceptive practice adopted. You can get other consumers too to sign on it so that it will have a better impact. Generally, consumers in India do not complain or express their displeasure over such unfair trade practices. This needs to change. As such deceptive packaging also constitutes unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, you can also file a complaint before the consumer court. The courts are taking serious note of such issues these days and awarding punitive damages."
"Shinde rules out change in HPCC chief, CM","Directs Chief Minister, Sukhwinder to sit together, discuss and resolve issues

Tribune News Service

Shimla, August 4

Hints at action against Mankotia

Shinde said show cause notice will be issued to leaders like Vijai Singh Mankotia who have criticized the Chief Minister.

Shinde feigned ignorance about a letter signed by six legislators demanding change of CM.

""Neither do I have any knowledge about any such letter not has the AICC provided it to me,"" he said.

While directing Virbhadra Singh and Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu to sink their differences and work unitedly, AICC General Secretary Sushil Kumar Shinde today made it amply clear that there will be no change either in the state Congress president or the Chief Minister. While admitting that there has been lack of coordination between the government and the party organization, Shinde said he had directed the Chief Minister and HPCC chief to sit together frequently so that all issues can be discussed and resolved. “There are bound to be differences but unlike the BJP, we Congressmen might fight but during the elections we all get united to take on the BJP,” said Shinde addressing a press conference here today. Flanked by Sukhu on one side and Virbhadra on the other, Shinde left nobody in any doubt that he would not tolerate indiscipline. “The party will go to the Assembly polls under collective leadership and it is after the results that we will decide whom to elect the leader,” said Shinde in reply to a query whether Congress will project a chief ministerial candidate before the polls. Shinde said he had sought report from the respective District Congress Committees (DCC) and the government about the most suitable candidate that the Congress could field and accordingly a decision would be taken. “We are in no hurry to declare the candidate but after getting feedback from all sources and also by travelling through the state, we will finalise the names,” said Shinde. Reminiscing his 1993 stint when he was in-charge of Himachal Congress, he said there were sharp differences between party stalwarts like Virbhadra Singh, Sukh Ram and Vidya Stokes, but they joined hands to fight the BJP. “At times the enthused youth get carried away and we can understand but I have made it very clear that in future this kind of indiscipline (sloganeering) will not be tolerated and strict action will be taken,” he said when asked about the sloganeering against HPCC president on his arrival outside Peterhoff. Shinde said he and AICC secretary in-charge Ranjeet Ranjan, MP had taken feedback from all the DCC chiefs, front organisations and party cells. “We are here to gear up the party cadres and sort out any mess or differences that could harm the party in the run up to the polls,” he said. When asked if the party will enforce the one family- one ticket principle in the Assembly polls in Himachal, Shinde said the decision in this regard varies from state to state and this would be decided at the appropriate time. He added that he would regularly visit all parts of the state and interact with party leaders and workers and gear them up for the polls."
Traffic crawls as landslides hit Chandigarh-Shimla NH,"Ambika Sharma

Traffic movement on the Chandigarh-Shimla highway was majorly affected after 3 am today following landslides near Jabli, Sanwara and Koti on the stretch between Parwanoo and Dharampur. The landslides were triggered by incessant rains as strata and trees from the hills--excavated for four-laning work--gave way in the absence of adequate retaining walls. A major landslide was visible near Datiyar where a JCB machine was buried in the muck flowing down the hill.Solan Superintendent of Police (SP) Mohit Chawla said one-way traffic was restored around 4:30 am and it took another five hours to make it two-way. Around 60 police personnel, including two DSPs, four SHOs, an Additional SP and three PCR vans, were rushed to the spot to ensure speedier clearance of roads, he said. “An urgent meeting of National Highways Authority of India officials and GR Infra Limited (the firm executing the road project) has been convened tomorrow to assess the situation and to step up preparedness for such exigencies,” he said. With rain continuing throughout the day, the police had a tough time in ensuring smooth vehicular movement despite traffic being diverted through Bhojnagar-Kumarhatti and Jangeshu-Kasauli routes. As a few policemen were available to man traffic at Grakhal and Kumarhatti junction, long queues of vehicles piled up on the highway. The chaos is learnt to have aggravated as the construction firm failed to respond promptly to clear the debris. A police official said the firm had been directed to place sufficient staff at vulnerable points. A few commuters said the highway had become highly landslide-prone due to massive cutting of fragile hills and low retaining and breast walls, which were incapable of holding the strata. Raising a question mark over the quality of work, a government official said the walls were a mere 1.5 m to 3 m high compared to those measuring up to 15 m in height on the Chandigarh-Parwanoo four-lane stretch. Meanwhile, rail traffic on the Kalka-Shimla stretch also remained suspended due to landslides at three places between Koti and Sanwara."
"Centre to introduce Classes 5, 8 board exam soon: Javadekar","Yash Goyal

Our Correspondent

Jaipur, August 5

Union Human Resources Development Minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said that the Centre had decided to introduce the Class 5 and 8 board examinations soon. The cabinet which met recently decided to restart the Classes 5 and 8 board examinations in school, and 24 states had consented to start it soon, he said while giving the keynote address at the Festival of Education here. Those who failed the exam would retake it in May and those unable to pass again would be detained, Javadekar said, stressing on quality education and the move to check school dropout rate because of no exams till Class 8. Comparing the literacy rate of 18 per cent after Independence with the 80 per cent at present, he claimed that India would be fully literate in the next five years. Twenty world-class universities would be set up in the coming years, Javadekar said. The Centre is making a new education policy based on five main points of accessibility, equity, quality, accountability and affordability, he added. Informing the foreign delegates from the UAE and the UK, the Minister said the Class 10 board exam had already been introduced, and a bill cleared in Parliament to give autonomy to IIMs."
"Vijender beats China's Zulpikar; wins WBO Asia Pacific, Oriental titles","Mumbai, August 5

The legend of Vijender Singh continued to grow as the Indian boxing star outslugged his Chinese opponent Zulpikar Maimaitiali in a close bout to annex the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title here on Saturday night.

It was double delight for the fans as Vijender also snatched the WBO Oriental Super Middleweight title from the Chinese, who is nine years younger to him.

It was the 32-year-old Beijing Olympic bronze medallist’s ninth successive win in his professional career.

In front of a partisan crowd, Vijender gave an exhibition of his class during the slugfest, and his oodles of experience came in handy during 10 intense rounds.

While Vijender had commented that 'Chinese products don't last long' but Zulpikar managed to squeeze every ounce of his opponent's energy.

""I didn't expect him to fight so well and last the distance,"" Vijender said after the bout.

Using his height and greater reach to good effect, Vijender most of the time had the better of exchanges with his straight ones and hooks landing flush on Zulpikar, whose blows didn't have the desired effect.

The Chinese southpaw had his guard up most of the times and with a crouched stance, was relying mostly on the uppercuts.

However, he was guilty of trying to hit Vijender below the belt with as many as five low blows for which he was promptly warned by the referee.

The only round when Zulpikar looked a bit assertive was the third one when he tried to chase the Indian, who again showed his fleet-footedness to evade his punches on more than one occasions.

A frustrated Zulpikar, in fact, pushed Vijender to the ground, a favour that the Indian duly returned in the very next round.

Zulpikar got the real taste of Vijender of yore, when he landed a straight right followed by a left uppercut flush on his face as the crowd roared in approval.

However, the younger legs of Zulpikar did help him towards the fag end of the bout as the Indian looked tired.

Zulpikar took the chance to attack but Vijender's tight defence, despite jaded legs, helped him.

In the final round, Zulpikar landed an uppercut which left the Indian ace with a bloodied nose, but he did manage to hold his own in the end.

The bonhomie between the opponents was there to be seen as Zulpikar hugged Vijender and made him wear his cap. — PTI"
Secret to true love: Dating a friend,"There’s a famous moment in When Harry Met Sally, when Billy Crystal’s character explains the age old riddle of male and female friendships. “Men and women can never be friends,” he tells Meg Ryan, “because the sex part always gets in the way.” And he’s right, sort of. Spoiler alert, Harry meets Sally, Harry befriends Sally and the two fall madly in love. It’s a narrative we’ve seen played out time and time again, spanning the Dukes of Shakespeare to the Hugh Grants of Richard Curtis. So why is it that the friends-to-lovers paradigm bears such perennial relevance? And does it work IRL? It’s been scientifically proven that the longer you’ve known somebody, the more attractive you’ll find them, researchers at the University of Texas found. They asked students to rate each other at the beginning of the semester, and again at the end. Naturally, these rates increased hugely over time, explaining how — in numerical terms — a “six” can easily become a “nine” in a matter of weeks. In other words, when it comes to long-term attraction, aesthetics has very little to do with it. A further study asked 167 couples how long they’d known one another before becoming romantically involved and whether they were friends first. They found that, on average, the couples had known each other four months before dating. Plus, 40 per cent of them were friends beforehand. You never feel more comfortable than when you’re with your friends, right? They often know you better than your fmaily. So, why is it that platonic familiarity so frequently leads to romance? “The purity of a friendship allows you to see one’s character before it’s blurred by sexual intentions and wanting to ‘get’ something physical out of it,” dating expert Matthew Hussey said.

Magic in the mountains,"Towering above the Swiss town of Davos is Schatzalp, which has been immortalised in Thomas Mann’s novel

Ananya Bahl

On a sunny summer day, Davos — the highest town in the Alps — glitters with joie de vivre. The town, located in the north-eastern part of the canton of Graubünden, is a premier ski resort that’s no less a star in the warmer months. The sun gleams for more than 12 hours a day, lighting up the Rhaetian Alps. Standing tall among these mountains is Schatzalp. A four-minute funicular ride from Davos’ main street takes you up 300m to this “magic mountain” — a moniker it earned because of German author and Nobel laureate, Thomas Mann’s eponymous — and extremely influential — 1924 novel. It tells the story of a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, and how its residents and their respective situations and personalities represent a microcosm of pre-World War I Europe. Fans and readers believe this sanatorium to be the luxurious Schatzalp, designed in art nouveau style by Zurich architects Otto Pfleghard and Max Haefeli. It was opened in 1900. Willem Jan Holsboer, its founder, was surveying several areas before he stumbled upon this piece of land. At that point, he felt a surge of positivity at this location but couldn’t attribute it to any one thing. Years later, when the Bovis-Biometer was invented by scientist Alfred Bovis, they could logically attribute this positive energy to the fact that whatever lies above 6,500 Bovis-units, emanates an optimistic vibe. Some areas on the Schatzalp measure a whopping 26,000 Bovis-units! In the early 1950s, the sanatorium was converted into Hotel Schatzalp, which is what we see today. The original interiors — of the dining room and lobby in particular — have been preserved. The founders drew inspiration from the English Arts and Crafts Movement, employing architecture from the region. Closeby is the Alpinium — a botanical garden that thrives with about 5,000 types of alpine plants that aren’t restricted to just the Swiss Alps: some of these have been brought from the Himalayas, Pyrenees, New Zealand Alps and even Drakensberg in South Africa! Guided alpine botanical tours are organised every Wednesday afternoon from June to November. The elusive edelweiss can be found here, along with peonies, larkspurs, snowdrops, phloxes, and Lenten roses, along with an extensive kitchen herb garden. Those with a spirit for adventure may choose to hike up to Schatzalp, instead of taking the funicular: the landscape lends itself to gorgeous trekking and hiking trails. It is also a fun spot for summer tobogganing — 500m of complete exhilaration and adrenaline rush for all ages! The Schatzalp Panoramic Restaurant is a relaxing place to cool off after the action and exploration. Their fondue, coupled with the scenic mountain vistas, is a match made in heaven! More than anything, what grips the visitors here is an almost-tangible aura of romance. One can imagine Hans Castorp, the young protagonist of The Magic Mountain, still walking on the hotel’s grounds or the elegant Madame Chauchat relaxing on one of its balconies even today!"
Mendis-Karunaratne fight back to take Lanka to 209/2,"Colombo, August 5

The resilient Sri Lankan pair of Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis displayed their best batting performance to keep India at bay after a first innings debacle guiding the hosts to 209 for 2 here on the third day of the second Test. After being bowled out for a paltry 183 in the first innings losing as many as as eight wickets in a single session, No 3 Mendis (110 off 135 balls) and opener Karunaratne (92 batting, 200 balls) added 191 as the visitors could get only two wickets in the next two sessions. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd

While Sri Lanka still need 230 runs to avoid innings defeat with two days left, the pitch losing a bit of bite and the effort by the top-order, should help the home team make a match out of it.

Spin twins Ravichandran Ashwin (0/79 in 24 overs) and Ravindra Jadeja (0/76 in 16 overs) looked a pale shadow of their original self, which saw them account for bulk of the Sri Lankan wickets in the first innings. India's all-rounder Hardik Pandya's (1/12 in 5 overs) came in handy as he induced an inside edge of Mendis with Wriddhiman Saha taking a smart catch down leg-side. With the pitch losing a bit of pace, the two Indian spinners couldn't make much of an impact after Ashwin's 26th five-wicket haul in the first innings and Jadeja's milestone 150th wicket. Credit to the Lankan pair, who had a plan against the spinners, especially Mendis, who used the sweep shot to good effect. They were ready to use their feet, coming to the pitch of the deliveries, smothering the spin. While Mendis attacked, it suited Karunaratne's gameplan very well as he held anchor at one end. Sri Lanka didn't look to defend as they scored at a healthy rate of nearly 3.5 runs per over. Mendis got to his third Test century off 120 balls. He hit 17 boundaries in all while Karunaratne's patience knock had 12 fours. Kohli did rotate his bowlers but the pacers were only used in short spells. Kohli and co desperation was evident as they wasted a review during the last hour of play against Karunaratne off Jadeja. The ball didn't take any edge, instead it brushed the thigh pad. Their partnership was the second highest for the second wicket for Sri Lanka against India after 576 runs put on by Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama in 1997. Earlier, Sri Lanka came out with a lot of positive intent as they reached 118 for 1 at tea after being asked to follow- on. Post lunch, Lanka began their second innings after being asked to follow-on. Kohli again opened with spin from one end, handing Umesh Yadav (1-29) and Ashwin the new ball. Yadav bowled opener Upul Tharanga (2) in the third over as India made a quick start in their bid to win this Test. But Karunaratne and Mendis stood firm to defy the Indian bowling. Key to their stand was seeing out Ashwin's initial spell as Mohammed Shami was soon introduced into the attack along with Jadeja. The two batsmen left the ball well and played some brilliant strokes to keep the runs ticking along as Lanka's 50 came up in the 12th over. India missed one chance when Shikhar Dhawan dropped a sitter at mid-on off Ashwin in the eighth over when the centurion was batting one one. Thereafter, there were no slip-ups as he duo brought up their 50-partnership in 79 balls. Later their 100-partnership came up in 113 balls as Lanka crossed 100 in the 24th over. Mendis also survived a caught behind appeal off Jadeja via DRS as the ball touched the thigh pad and was never even close to the edge. Karunaratne scored his 13th Test half-century off 83 balls, while Mendis scored his 5th Test half-century off 53 balls as they countered the Indian bowling for once. Earlier, in reply to India's mammoth 622/9 declared, Sri Lanka collapsed to 183 all out at lunch conceding their highest-ever first innings' lead in Test cricket – 439 runs, more than 419 runs against Pakistan at Galle in 2000. Ashwin (5/69) picked up his 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Starting from overnight 50/2, it was surprising to see Ashwin not handed the ball straight away. Instead, Umesh Yadav (1-12) and Ravindra Jadeja (2-84) started proceedings, getting instant results. Dinesh Chandimal (10) was the first to go, in the fifth over of the day, caught at square leg off Jadeja. In the very next over, Yadav had Kusal Mendis (24) caught at mid-on, striking a double body blow to Sri Lanka's hopes of defiance on this day. It brought Angelo Mathews (26) and Niroshan Dickwella (51) to the crease, and the duo decided to attack the Indian bowling, particularly the spinners. Together, they hit 7 fours and 3 sixes against Jadeja and Ashwin who had been introduced into the attack. They put on 53 runs for the 5th wicket taking Lanka past 100 in the 33rd over. However there weren't any more partnerships of note as they were all-out for 183 in little under 50 overs. — PTI"
Source of human heartbeat revealed in 3D,"London

Scientists have revealed the source of human heartbeat in unprecedented detail, an advance that may help surgeons repair hearts without damaging precious tissue.

Researchers, including those from University of Manchester in the UK, developed a way of producing three-dimensional (3D) data to show the cardiac conduction system - the special cells that enable our hearts to beat.

The 3D data makes it much easier to understand the complex relationships between the cardiac conduction system and the rest of the heart,"" said Jonathan Jarvis from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.

Soaking post-mortem samples in a solution of iodine means soft tissue such as the heart can absorb X-rays and become visible, researchers said.

With modern X ray scanners, scientists can make detailed 3D images. In the best images, they can even see the boundaries between single heart cells, and detect in which direction they are arranged.

Within the heart, there is a special network called the cardiac conduction system that generates and distributes a wave of electrical activity stimulating the heart muscle to contract, researchers said.

This system makes sure that the various parts of the heart contract regularly and in a coordinated way, a bit like a team of rowers in a boat race.

If the system is damaged, and one part of the heart contracts out of time with the rest, then the heart does not pump so efficiently, they said.

The new data gives a much more accurate framework than previously available for computer models of the heartbeat and should improve the ability to make sense of troublesome heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation that affects 1.4 million people in the UK, researchers said.

The data reveals exactly where the cardiac conduction system is in a normal heart. For example, it shows just how close it runs to the aortic valve.

""We also use the data to make 3D printed models that are really useful in our discussions with heart doctors, other researchers and patients with heart problems,"" Jarvis said.

New strategies to repair or replace the aortic valve must therefore make sure that they do not damage or compress this precious tissue, researchers said.

""In future work we will be able to see where the cardiac conduction system runs in hearts that have not formed properly. This will help the surgeons who repair such hearts to design operations that have the least risk of damaging the cardiac conduction system,"" Jarvis said.

The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports. PTI"

Earlier, in reply to India's mammoth 622/9 declared, Sri Lanka collapsed to 183 all out at lunch conceding their highest-ever first innings' lead in Test cricket – 439 runs, more than 419 runs against Pakistan at Galle in 2000.

Ashwin (5/69) picked up his 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket.

Starting from overnight 50/2, it was surprising to see Ashwin not handed the ball straight away. Instead, Umesh Yadav (1-12) and Ravindra Jadeja (2-84) started proceedings, getting instant results.

Dinesh Chandimal (10) was the first to go, in the fifth over of the day, caught at square leg off Jadeja. In the very next over, Yadav had Kusal Mendis (24) caught at mid-on, striking a double body blow to Sri Lanka's hopes of defiance on this day.

It brought Angelo Mathews (26) and Niroshan Dickwella (51) to the crease, and the duo decided to attack the Indian bowling, particularly the spinners. Together, they hit 7 fours and 3 sixes against Jadeja and Ashwin who had been introduced into the attack. They put on 53 runs for the 5th wicket taking Lanka past 100 in the 33rd over. However there weren't any more partnerships of note as they were all-out for 183 in little under 50 overs. — PTI"
Just another dazzler,"MOVIE REVIEW - VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS

Johnson Thomas

The comic book ‘Valerian et Laureline’ created by Pierre Christin and drawn by Jean-Claude Mezieres( all of 21 volumes from 1967 to 2010), gets a cinematic lifeline in Luc Besson’s ‘Valerian and The City of a Thousand Planets.’ This one is obviously one of many more to come and it’s a dazzler no doubt.

Set in the 28th century, year 2550, way beyond anything imagined so far, in a sort of going beyond Star Wars effort, Besson pulls out all the stops to showcase a vigorously vibrant and colourful world of ideas that unfortunately don’t go any further than the pages it once enhanced.

The minister of defense(Herbie Hancock) commissions two special operatives Valerian(Dane DeHaan) and Laureline(Cara Delevingne), for a intergalactic intelligence mission to save Alpha- a multi-cultural, multi racial metropolis invaded by a dark force that threatens to destroy the peaceful city and the entire universe in the bargain. It’s always the same load of crap in different forms I guess.

This is Besson’s show-piece effort and he is obviously in show-off mode trying to outdo every great sci-fi filmmaker history has known. And in tech-smarts with millions of dollars at his command, he certainly makes his mark. It’s the narrative impetuosity that puts paid to any deeper affect though.

The movie experience is not all that satisfying. For one, the lead cast, 20 something lean and skilled, brown and blonde haired duo, don’t even look remotely like the more mature black haired he-man and luscious red head duo depicted in the comic book.

Also, the narrative goes all over the place trying to outdo every sci-fi actioner seen before – so what you get is largely a mish-mash of genre types. It is appealing nevertheless, for its exquisitely enticing CGI and motion capture incandescence. There’s beauty in the visuals but the impact is immediate, not long lasting.

This overly ornate sci-fi attempt does manage to create some interest with its entertaining dialogues and the sparkling chemistry between its leads. The romance between them in fact has more lasting power than the hi-tech glitz on show here. The special effects overshadow every other aspect of the film including story, plot and performances.

Rihanna gets an eye-popping cameo that lasts much longer than necessary and there are amiable characters galore that catch the eye but fail to stay memorable. In fact most of the talent on show here have little to do other than mark their presence in a possible franchise overture. At 137 minutes, it’s also a little too long in the tooth to be consistently sufferable.

The tech hi-jinks may herald Besson as the next big thing on the sci-fi horizon but the lack of soul in the presentation of it is terribly belittling. This is a classic case of arrested evolution...what a pity!"

Ludhiana August 4

The Special Task Unit (STU) claimed to have busted a gang of snatchers today and recovered 27 mobile phones from them.

The gang confessed to having committed over 50 snatchings in the city in the recent past.

The accused have been identified as Samir Khan (22), a resident of Muslim Colony in Focal Point and Jatinder Kumar alias Longa (25), a resident of Sherpur Khurd.

STU Ludhiana Chief Prem Singh in a press conference said a tip-off was received that two youths, who had formed a gang of snatchers, were roaming in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar area to commit snatching. Accordingly, the STU team laid a trap and arrested them.

On the disclosures of the accused, 27 mobile phones were recovered from them, Singh said, adding that the accused had mainly been targeting migrant labourers near railway tracks and other migrant-populated areas. “After snatching mobiles from migrant labourers, they used to sell it to migrant labourers at cheap price, Prem Singh said.

Apart from targeting labourers in railway areas, they committed several snatchings in Focal Point, Jamalpur, Shimlapuri and Sahnewal areas.

On August 2, the STU had also busted a gang of snatchers and recovered 31 mobile phones from them.

Committed robberies to buy drugs

The STU chief said the accused were childhood friends. Jatinder entered the crime world before his aide Samir. Jatinder was already facing two cases of drugs and theft. ""They are childhood friends and reportedly studied together in school. Now, they formed a gang to loot migrant labourers. They are also drug addicts and resort to such crimes to satisfy their hunger for drugs,"" Singh said."
How to survive a divorce with your finance intact,"Chitra Iyer

Emotional side effects

In India, unlike the West, a pre-nuptial agreement (what to do in case the couple must part ways in the future) isn’t laid out. Today, divorce rates are soaring, leading to a lot of emotional and financial upheaval in both the man and woman’s lives. Decisions taken during this time can cause detrimental effects on an individual’s future.Early stages of divorce require both individuals to deal with anger, betrayal, loss, shock, confusion, panic — all in varied combinations. It almost seems like a roller coaster that’s on a continuous loop. However, the ride does stop. The post-divorce period is when emotions begin to stabilise and when one must have control over varied aspects such as financial, social and legal. Life after divorce does change but accepting and even embracing the change is what will aid in redesigning your life.

Financial side effects

Income earned by the husband and wife must be separated.

Mandatory expenses like that of running the household must be listed.

Decisions need to be made about whether to buy a new house or live in a rented one.

Determine how much you would be comfortable saving against your earnings.

List out all investments; real estate, stocks, mutual funds, life insurance policies, PPF, money in the bank, etc.

List out all the assets bought together (cars, white goods, jewellery, etc.)

Also list out all liabilities you have committed to.

Figure out the legal fees payable for the divorce.

Share of children’s education

Setting aside money for tax saving under Section 80C

Health corpus

Contributing towards buying/renting a house

Retirement goal

Saving to buy a car

Going on an annual holiday

Setting up trusts to distribute income to children, should the parents wish so.

In the Indian setup, on an average, the man is the bread winner and the main decision-maker when it comes to financial matters. Once a couple files for divorce, they must stay apart for a period of a year till the divorce is granted. This is the time when cash flows and net worth statements must be drawn up.If both partners are working professionals and have children, they need to arrive at their share of the child welfare expenses. If the woman isn’t working, monthly alimony or a one-time payment needs to be decided upon. A lot of times, the woman is unaware of how to best make use of the alimony to restart her life. The main reason behind this is the lack of financial literacy. The collective goals of the family need to now be relooked at as individual goals and money thus needs to be saved for each goal such as:A good inancial planner is necessary to help you build your personal goals. He/she would help in managing the cash flow and directing investments towards your personal goals, getting adequate risk covers in place, providing for contingencies and health-related expenses, etc. The purpose is to connect with someone who will be able to simplify the entire financial conversation and who will solely think of your well-being as you look to regain financial stability.

Divorce checklist

Here are the steps you must take once the divorce is finalised. A copy of your certified divorce decree: Make extra copies and store them in a safe location. Changing and updating the surname is also important if you had acquired the title of your spouse post marriage. This is a legal procedure and must cover all documents such as PAN card, Passport, driver’s licence as also banks and insurance companies. Closure of joint accounts: Mostly people undertake this step in the early stages of the divorce procedure itself. But in case this step has been looked over, one must deactivate all joint accounts. Draft a financial plan: Financial planning is very important, especially if one is a single parent, with the liability of raising a child. When and for what the money will be needed must be planned to facilitate a smooth transition in future? Hire a career counsellor: Getting back to professional life, especially after a long break, can be a daunting task. Women must then assess their core strengths and network across their social groups to be gainfully employed. Getting professionally qualified is also advantageous. Hire a counsellor for yourself, children: In Indian society, marriage is considered to be a sacred institution and its breaking down, sacrilegious. At such a time, having someone to talk to, judgment free can be very beneficial.

"Partial lunar eclipse on Aug 7 night, to be visible from India","Kolkata, August 5

A partial lunar eclipse will take place on August 7 night and will be visible from across the country.

""Starting from 10.52 pm, the full moon will enter the Earth's shadow in space and create a spectacular celestial phenomenon, which is commonly known as partial lunar eclipse.

This will be the first properly visible lunar eclipse this year,"" Debiprosad Duari, Director Research and Academic, M P Birla Planetarium, said on Saturday.

""On February 11 this year there was a penumbral eclipse of the moon. It was an event where the moon passed not through the direct shadow of the earth but through its periphery and thus it could not be discernible by most of the population,"" he said.

The partial lunar eclipse this time would be visible from the whole of Asia and Australia and most parts of Europe and Africa, Duari said adding: ""People in North and South America will be not be able to see it because it will be daytime there”.

The lunar eclipse will start at around 10.52 pm on the night of August 7 and will continue till 00.48 am IST.

""The greatest eclipse, that is when the Moon will be covered to the maximum extent will be around 11.50 pm. The magnitude of the eclipse, which means the fraction of the lunar diameter, will be eclipsed at the greatest eclipse moment at around 0.25. The eclipse will last about an hour and 55 minutes,"" he said. ""The total eclipse will be visible at all places in India.”

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, are aligned perfectly. The Sun's rays fall on the Earth and the Moon enters the patch of where the Earth’s shadow falls.

A lunar eclipse necessarily takes place at full moon.

The shadow is composed of two cone-shaped parts, one nested inside the other. The outer shadow or penumbra is a zone where Earth shadow is partial and blocks some, but not all of, the Sun's rays.

In contrast, the inner shadow or umbra is a region where Earth blocks all direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. When a part of the Moon passes through the umbra, a partial lunar eclipse is seen.

The next lunar eclipse will occur on January 31, 2018. It will be a total eclipse visible from all parts of the Indian sub-continent, Duari said.

""Lunar eclipses are completely safe to view with the naked eye. No special filters are required to protect your eyes like those used for solar eclipses. One does not need a telescope to watch the eclipse, although a good pair of binoculars will enhance the experience,"" he said.

""The sky permitting, since it is the rainy season and the sky remains overcast most of the time, it will be an wonderful opportunity to experience this celestial event and to take photographs if possible,"" he added. PTI"
Tennis brat who makes music now,"BOOK REVIEW: BUT SERIOUSLY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY JOHN MCENROE.

Subhash Rajta

What would a John McEnroe autobiography be like if it doesn’t talk about his tempestuous playing days, his on-court tantrums and yelling, and his razor-sharp comments and observations about his contemporaries? Well, one wouldn’t be too sure, right? The problem is, the quintessential bad boy of tennis has already done all that — and aced it — in his first book, You Cannot Be Serious. So his second book, But Seriously, is essentially about his life post his playing days, his attempts at finding feet in the world of television, music and art dealers. McEnroe is clearly in love with this glitzy, glamorous and intoxicating world and its famous inhabitants. The artistes, McEnroe says, expose themselves to criticism and embarrassment just like sportspersons and that’s one significant reason why he loves them. No wonder, then, he drops names like Rolling Stones, The Pretenders, Zeppelin, Paul McCartney and those of many famous actors and art collectors liberally throughout the book. In fact, at one stage, he admits, in a lighter vein, that he had done a fair bit of name-dropping but “it was too late to stop doing it now”. Even though he’s now in a completely different territory — doing TV shows, playing music with rock stars and hanging out with who’s who of the show world — he retains his honesty, candour and the typical irreverence for authority, largely minus the tantrums yelling. And that’s what primarily holds the interest of the reader, much more than the idiosyncrasies of the rich and famous. The best part is that he’s as candid and critical about his own shortcomings and failures as he’s of others. He’s quick to own up when he feels he has been an absolute jerk — and by his own admission, and his wife’s, he had been one on many occasions. Also, he has no qualms in sharing the emotions that other people are generally cagey about. For instance, after making a generous donation to the Jimmy Carter Foundation, he’s quite unapologetic about expecting some appreciation for his generosity in the form of an invite from the foundation. On another occasion, he opens up about having an uneasy feeling about his father — he feels his father would be more of a hindrance than help because of his advancing age if he travelled with him. And when he slams the English for their excessive deference to their Royals while recalling an old incident, it becomes clear that age has failed to tamper his irreverent attitude. At another point, he reveals that his wife and daughter didn’t want him to meet Donald Trump for they felt he was a “misogynist and blowhard, among other things — it could hurt your reputation.” Trump wasn’t the US President then. But now that he is, McEnroe could have easily cut it out from the book. He did not. Readers get to see McEnroe’s sensitive and mature side when he talks about his family, parenting and coaching. He makes time and effort to understand his six children, and knows what kind of pressure a famous surname puts on them. His youngest daughter, in a small essay, reveals how being a McEnroe keeps her from enjoying small joys like playing tennis without feeling the burden of expectations. Although, being her father’s daughter, she readily accepts that the benefits of being a McEnroe outnumber the drawbacks. Despite his seamless blending into the show world, McEnroe is still at his best when he talks about tennis and the issues related to it. One would have loved a little more of his insights and opinions on the golden generation of the sport that bloomed literally in front of his eyes. From his commentary box, he has seen Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and, to some extent, Andy Murray, lift the sport by several notches. He talks about the Big Four in bits and pieces, leaving you wanting for more. But then, even an entire book would fail to do justice to the talent and contribution of these gentlemen to the sport of tennis. Maybe, McEnroe could attempt it in his next!"
"Daumier and the truth, rough and biting","ART & SOUL

BN Goswamy

Satire. noun

The use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticise people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.— The Oxford English DictionaryTo me, Art’s subject is the human clay And landscape but a background to a torso; All Cezanne’s apples I would give away For one small Goya or a Daumier.— W.H. Auden In the steadily shrinking, in our land almost desiccated, field of political humour — whether satire, cartoon, caricature, or lampoon — if there is one name that comes instantly to mind, floating above all others, it is that of Honore Daumier: born at Marseilles, 1808, died 1879; a man who lived for significant periods of his life at the edge of destitution but left behind ‘the legacy of the greatest number of visual images created by any artist from antiquity to the end of the 19th century’, as an admirer wrote, putting the figure at some ‘4000 works of graphics, 300 paintings, 800 drawings, and 1000 woodcuts and sculptures’. It is not the numbers alone, however, that put him a substantive cut above countless others: it is the quality of work that he produced, zealously, relentlessly, without let, throughout his troubled life. Daumier lived in difficult — some would call them interesting — times. Even as he was growing up learning how to draw and paint while earning a meagre living as a delivery boy, France was preparing for an upheaval: the Revolution of 1830 that put finally to end the rule of the Bourbon dynasty, and brought Louis Philippe — a ‘Citizen’ — to power as King. But nothing went smoothly in the land, for in the 18 years that he ruled before he was overthrown, the new king’s regime was marked by a muzzling of the press, a refusal to introduce electoral reforms, and — the worst sin of all — political corruption. This was fertile ground for honest writers and journalists and artists to grow in, and many of them came often into the open, opposing the monarchy and its hangers-on, one of the most prominent names emerging from the group being that of Charles Philipon, “the breath of whose nostrils was opposition”, and who ran two satirical publications, La Caricature and Le Charivari, to which Daumier began to contribute on a regular basis. In fact, as Henry James wrote, “Daumier became more and more the political spirit of the Charivari, or at least the political pencil, for Philipon.” As time moved, this ‘pencil’, “played over public life, over the sovereign, the ministers, the deputies, the peers, the judiciary, the men and the measures, the reputations and scandals of the moment …” All too predictably, both Philipon and Daumier ran afoul of the powers that be who slapped heavy fines upon them, filed endless cases against them in the courts, and on occasions threw them into jail. But the visual and verbal onslaught of publisher and painter went on unabated. Comment never lost its bite, image never its sharpness. The result? In Daumier’s caricatures, one can feel the breath of the times, sense the stink of corrupt repression. As he worked, every foible, every chicanery, each hint of arrogance that he saw in the people, or the types, around himself was grist to his artistic mill. No one was spared as he made fun, sometimes biting, caustic fun, now of the ilk that he knew from close — painters, actors, mountebanks, and the like, now of politicians and venal officials and those masquerading as art critics. Consider his lithograph of a painter seen almost running, applying last minute brush strokes to a painting carried by a worker on his back in front, trying to finish the work in time for submitting to a jury; or his paintings of actors going through paroxysms of false emotion while performing in melodramatic pieces on the stage. But it was for lawyers — so-called ‘Officers of the Law’ — that he reserved his true disdain. Having been at the receiving end of their arrogance and their pretensions in his own life, he showed that he really did not care for these people. He was a bit tolerant of judges, being content often with showing them dozing in their seats, or wearing world-weary expressions. But lawyers were his pet aversions, for he saw them as “men paid to simulate emotion and pious devotion to justice, but actually smug and insensitive”, “rushing up and down the corridors, their black gowns flapping, forever busy and exuding a sense of their own importance”. While he was all this – caricaturist and satirist – one needs to remember that Daumier was also a great humanist, endowed with warm feelings, especially for the under-privileged. He might have made fun of himself sometimes, when, for instance, he said once that “I care more about my tobacco pipe than about fame and honour,” but he was a serious man and truly a very gifted painter. Paul Valery, the great French poet, once wrote that if Daumier was compared sometimes to Michelangelo and Rembrandt, it was just. For, in this triumvirate, he saw Michelangelo as the theologian of mankind, Rembrandt the philosopher, and Daumier the moralist."
"Spinners strike, with bat & ball","Ashwin, Jadeja hit half-centurties to help India post 622/9; then reduce hosts to 50/2

Colombo, August 4

India amassed 622/9 before declaring their first innings and then returned to remove both the Sri Lankan openers to tighten their grip on the second Test here today. For the second successive time in the three-match series, India won the toss, elected to bat and amassed 600 or more in their first innings before unleashing their bowlers on the hosts. Like in their comprehensive defeat in the series opener at Galle, Sri Lanka made a feeble reply to finish Day 2 on 50/2 at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground. Skipper Dinesh Chandimal was batting on eight at stumps with the hosts needing a special knock from him, while Kusal Mendis was on 16. For India, Ravichandran Ashwin hit a half-century and returned to dismiss both the openers to cap a particularly satisfying day. Unable to call on lone frontline paceman Nuwan Pradeep, who's down with a hamstring injury, Sri Lanka faced an unenviable task when India resumed on 344/3 with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, partners in a double-century stand, looking to heap more misery on them.

Good start

Dimuth Karunaratne and the debutant Malinda Pushpakumara claimed their maiden Test wickets in the morning session to bring some relief for them. Karunaratne hit Pujara's back thigh in the second over of the day but the leg-before appeal was turned down. Sri Lanka used the review to overturn the decision. Pujara batted for three hours and 20 minutes, hitting 11 boundaries and a six in his 133. Rahane was stumped off Pushpakumara after making 132, which included 14 boundaries. There was no respite, however, for the hosts as the lower half of the Indian line-up feasted on a jaded Sri Lankan attack. Ashwin hit a fluent 54, Wriddhiman Saha struck a patient 67 and Ravindra Jadeja smacked three sixes in his unbeaten 70 off 85 balls before India declared their innings. Six Indian batsmen notched up 50-plus scores, while three Sri Lankan bowlers bled 147 or more as the tourists maintained their iron grip on the contest.

Ashwin strikes

Sri Lanka got off to a nightmarish start, losing opener Upul Tharanga in the second over of their innings. The batsman hit an innocuous Ashwin delivery right into KL Rahul's body at short leg to depart for a duck. Opening partner Karunaratne made 25 before edging Ashwin to slip to compound Sri Lanka's crisis. — Reuters

One of my best innings against spinners

Wasn’t worried

Wicket tough to bat

This was one of my best innings against spinners. My focus was to dominate. Going in to bat, I knew a little bit how the wicket was behaving, how much bounce it had and whether it suited my game or not. Pujara and I hardly played a maiden over. So we put the pressure back on them... we were good with our footwork, and that helped us score runs both on the front foot and the back foot.It was an important hundred but I was confident. Even though I hadn't got one in the last 9-10 Tests, I was confident about myself. I knew that if I got in, I will get a big one. It was all about being positive throughoutThe wicket is very slow and dry, bounce is quite variable. Some balls are bouncing, and a few balls are keeping low. It's not easy for batsmen to play on this wicket"

Solan, August 5

Traffic movement on the Chandigarh-Shimla highway was majorly affected after 3 am today following landslides near Jabli, Sanwara and Koti on the stretch between Parwanoo and Dharampur.

The landslides were triggered by incessant rains as strata and trees from the hills--excavated for four-laning work--gave way in the absence of adequate retaining walls. A major landslide was visible near Datiyar where a JCB machine was buried in the muck flowing down the hill.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Solan Superintendent of Police (SP) Mohit Chawla said one-way traffic was restored around 4:30 am and it took another five hours to make it two-way. Around 60 police personnel, including two DSPs, four SHOs, an Additional SP and three PCR vans, were rushed to the spot to ensure speedier clearance of roads, he said.

“An urgent meeting of National Highways Authority of India officials and GR Infra Limited (the firm executing the road project) has been convened tomorrow to assess the situation and to step up preparedness for such exigencies,” he said.

With rain continuing throughout the day, the police had a tough time in ensuring smooth vehicular movement despite traffic being diverted through Bhojnagar-Kumarhatti and Jangeshu-Kasauli routes. As a few policemen were available to man traffic at Grakhal and Kumarhatti junction, long queues of vehicles piled up on the highway.

The chaos is learnt to have aggravated as the construction firm failed to respond promptly to clear the debris. A police official said the firm had been directed to place sufficient staff at vulnerable points.

A few commuters said the highway had become highly landslide-prone due to massive cutting of fragile hills and low retaining and breast walls, which were incapable of holding the strata.

Raising a question mark over the quality of work, a government official said the walls were a mere 1.5 m to 3 m high compared to those measuring up to 15 m in height on the Chandigarh-Parwanoo four-lane stretch.

Meanwhile, rail traffic on the Kalka-Shimla stretch also remained suspended due to landslides at three places between Koti and Sanwara."
Permanent posts remain vacant in local colleges,"Govt continues to hire lecturers on contractual basis

Vikas Sharma

Jammu, August 4

The big claims of the state government of speeding up the recruitment of lecturers to fill the permanent posts lying vacant in government degree colleges have fallen flat. Sources said despite the recruitment of permanent faculty in different subjects being done by the government in the past, the institutions continued to rely on academic arrangement. They said the process of engagement of candidates on an academic arrangement basis in government degree colleges of Jammu division had been completed a few days back. There are 47 government degree colleges in Jammu division, including 13 in Jammu, seven in Kathua, six in Rajouri, four each in Udhampur and Doda, three each in Poonch, Reasi, Kishtwar and Ramban districts and one in Samba district. As many as 643 aspirants were engaged on an academic arrangement basis in different colleges across Jammu for 38 subjects. Last year, the candidates were engaged for 37 subjects but with the inclusion of Kashmiri language, the number of subjects is 38 now. The other subjects include Arabic, biotechnology, botany, business administration, chemistry, commerce, computer applications, Dogri, psychology, Punjabi, political science, physical education, physics, Sanskrit, sociology, statistics, sericulture, Urdu, zoology, etc. The sources said a selection committee was constituted by the Higher Education Department to prepare a single merit list of candidates to be engaged on an academic arrangement basis for 2017-18. The committee comprises of Nodal Principal, Jammu division colleges, Principal, Government SPMR College of Commerce and Principal, Government College of Education, Jammu. “The state government is leaving no stone unturned to introduce Kashmiri language in the government degree colleges of Jammu division and for that, the posts of lecturers have also been advertised. But when it comes to filling the vacant posts in general subjects which are lying vacant for many years, there is no serious effort,” the sources said. “How many aspirants in Jammu colleges are interested to opt for Kashmiri language? The other posts for 37 subjects on which the candidates are being engaged by government degree colleges on academic arrangement should be filled on a permanent basis to avoid inconvenience to students,” the sources added.""Yes, the process of engagement of 643 candidates on academic arrangement basis is over. The need for engaging more candidates arises only if the candidates which were engaged earlier are unable to join the colleges they were allotted."" —""The state government is leaving no stone unturned to introduce Kashmiri language in the government degree colleges of Jammu division and for that, the posts of lecturers have also been advertised.

A confident Vijender has dubbed his Chinese opponent as inexperienced. “This is India versus China, I don't need anything and I am excited. I know the whole of India is with me,” Vijender said at the weigh-in today. The Indian said his strategy would depend on how his opponent approaches the bout. “ I don't consider him an experienced boxer. He is young and strong but we are ready for him,” Singh said. There will be seven other bouts tomorrow, including the debut professional fights of former Olympians Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar. — PTI"
"Ignored for Arjuna, Chanu cries foul","Sabi Hussain

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 4

Has the Khel Ratna and Arjuna Awards selection committee erred by not recommending weightlifter Khumukcham Sanjita Chanu, who won a gold medal in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, for the Arjuna Award? It appears so as Manipur's Chanu had more points than many athletes who have been recommended for the prestigious award this year. Chanu has accumulated 45 points over the last four years, thanks to her CWG gold, two Commonwealth Championships gold medals and a bronze at the Asian Championships. She is also a five-time national champion. She was the only weightlifter in contention for the award but her credentials, including the CWG gold, were ignored. For the record, Chanu is the only Glasgow CWG gold medallist who hasn't been considered for the Arjuna Award by successive selection committees. All other Glasgow gold winners — 14, to be precise — have been given the award. Sukhen Dey, another weightlifter who won gold at Glasgow, isn't eligible to apply since he was had been caught and sanctioned for a doping offence. “I would say it's a conspiracy against me. Some people don't want me to get the Arjuna Award. Except me, all Glasgow gold medallists have got the award,” said Chanu. “This time I had more points than many others but still I wasn't considered. Even wrestler Satyawart Kadian got the committee's nod for his Glasgow silver but the committee didn't find a gold medallist worth recommending. “Since the Glasgow CWG, I have been tested for doping 15 times and I have always come out clean. I am part of the national camp as well. I have never skipped important championships. So, why I haven't been considered?” asked a miffed Chanu. The Indian Weightlifting Federation has lodged a complaint with the Ministry in this regard."
Lead with winning combos,"Choosing the right mix of subjects in your bachelor’s of arts course is the key to a successful career

Gauri Chhabra

An increasing number of students have been gravitating towards Humanities stream and a bachelor in arts degree over the past few years. The competititon for “hot” subject combinations for UG courses is very fierce, especially in Delhi University colleges and even in other cities like Chandigarh. BA is no more considered to be an easy option and career-oriented students take extreme care in choosing the subject combinations that will keep them relevant in the job market later on. However, once the students choose to go this route, they face confusion about the subject combinations they need to choose from. Here are some winning subject options that would hold you in good stead and cover maximum surface area for choosing career options:

Psychology- Sociology-Economics

Jain University, Bangalore

AIMS Institute, Bangalore

The Oxford College of Arts, Bangalore

Christ University, Bangalore

St. Xavier's College- Autonomous, Mumbai

A BA with this combinations will open doors in economic, social, and fields of psychology. Sociology and economics as social sciences are closely related. While economics deals with the production, consumption and distribution of wealth, sociology allows us to study these aspects in relation to the societal structures.

Job prospects

This is one of the best combinations that provides an opportunity to specialise in any one of the three main subjects. Most graduates with a bachelor’s degree in psychology who don’t go on to further study find work in fields such as business administration, sales or education. You can also find work in the community and social services sector as counselors, mental health workers and psychiatric aides, or in criminal justice/forensic psychology as correctional and police officers, parole and probation officers, and interviewers for various criminal justice agencies. NGOs and International organizations are also seeking who have studied psychology. You may also find work as sociology research assistants, but most of you wind up in other fields, such as social services, administration, management, or sales and marketing. An undergraduate degree in sociology might also qualify college graduates to work as case managers, child care workers or homeless/housing workers or move into education administration or teaching,. Studying economics will equip you with a strong grasp of economic principles which will help to make more informed decision and get into the government sector, banks, accountancy, insurance companies, regulatory bodies etc.

Sociology-Political Science- Economics

BBK DAV College for Women, Amritsar

Christ University, Bangalore

St. Joseph's College, Bangalore

Elphistone College, Mumbai

This subject combination actually prepares you to become a generalist that the civil services exam requires. The other interesting fields such as journalism and mass-communication, law, management, NGOs, education, film making etc are open for further exploration. Students also get empowered enough to set up their own start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures.

Job prospects

Sociology offers several enticing career options due to the different specialisations that one can choose from. Research institutes, the criminal justice system, public health and welfare organisations, private businesses, law firms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions, advertising firms, survey and polling organizations are only some of the example where people from this background are required. There are options of working in other sectors with area specialists to help function. Being a sociologist asks for a lot of patience along with dedication to the work. Employers will look for people with good communication and research skills along with the capacity for detailed observation. After completing bachelor’s/master’s program in political science, several opportunities are available in both government and private sectors. Politics, public administration, law, and marketing fields are always in need of good political scientists. Political scientists can even opt for campaign management, polling and electoral politics, and university and college teaching. The career prospects in political science have widened enough in the voluntary organisations and NGOs. The international voluntary organisations, like UNO, have huge scope for proficient political scientists across the world. Besides, they can join media houses as political journalists and political researchers/analysts. Economics is perhaps the only Arts course that requires the student to be ‘swift’ in maths. While most economists have advanced degrees (in most cases a PhD), there are many lucrative career opportunities for those choosing economics at the undergraduate level. Data analysis, banking and finance, and market analysis are some avenues open to aspirants. Some even go on to becoming stock brokers.

Journalism-Psychology and Elective English

This combination is beneficial to provide a firm foundation for the students to either go directly get into media or go in for higher studies.

You can work in news and media companies or take up teaching in government and private schools both on private and regular basis. HR, health associated professions, hospitals etc. offer an exciting and amazing career path for students of psychology.

Pertaining to journalism and English, some of the options include writing for national, regional and local newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations and online publications and companies involved in public relation, corporate communications, content writing and marketing. You can pursue post-graduation and expand it with further studies.

The journalism course aims at moulding the student for a career in both print and broadcasting and in allied fields like advertising, film, and PR. The course introKristu Jayanti College, Bangalore"

""Coming from an agricultural background, I never imagined I would be here. Agriculture has no proper voice in Indian polity,"" India's vice president-elect told PTI.

""I am very humbled. I am also thankful to the Prime Minister and all party leaders for their support. I will seek to utilise the vice-presidential institution to strengthen the hands of the president and secondly uphold the dignity of the Upper House,"" he added.

Naidu will be the 13th person to hold the second highest constitutional post. By virtue of being the vice-president, Naidu will also preside over the Rajya Sabha as the Chairman.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah met Naidu to congratulate him.

""I am confident @MVenkaiahNaidu will serve the nation as a diligent & dedicated Vice President, committed to the goal of nation building,"" Modi tweeted.

Naidu will be visiting Tirupati tomorrow to offer prayers.

In the 2007 VP poll, Ansari had polled 456 votes, Najma Heptullah 222 votes and Rashid Masood 75 votes.

In the 2012 polls, Ansari had bagged 490 and NDA nominee Jaswant Singh 238 votes.

With today's election, those holding the three top positions in the country -- the president, the vice-president and the prime minister --come from the BJP.

Last month, Ramnath Kovind became the first BJP leader to win the presidential poll defeating opposition's Meira Kumar.

Naidu will be the second BJP leader to become vice-president after Bhairon Singh Shekhawat (2002-2007).

A two-term BJP president, Naidu was also elected to the Rajya Sabha three times from Karnataka. He represented Rajasthan in the Upper House of Parliament before he was nominated to the vice-president's post by the NDA.

Once an L K Advani protege, Naidu vigorously backed Modi for the prime minister's post before the 2014 elections.

He was minister for information and broadcasting and housing and urban affairs in the Modi government and earlier held the Parliamentary Affairs portfolio. — PTI"

Sarkar was till recently national director for high growth markets at the Toronto-based multi-national KPMG.

Sarkar is part of a 13-member group tasked with helping the Canada navigate the renegotiation of NAFTA, the Canadian government said in a statement.

From 2009 to 2013, Sarkar was president and CEO of the Canada-India Business Council. He was also the founding advisory board committee co-chairman and senior fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs.

The statement said the government hopes Sarkar will be able to seize on opportunities to attract investment from the US to Canada.

The Canadian government is beefing up its team in the US as it prepares a full court press to defend Canada's interests in the looming renegotiation of the NAFTA, CTV News reported.

Talks on changing the NAFTA agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico are scheduled to begin on August 16.

According to Global Affairs Canada, the advisory council will bring ""expertise and strategic advice"" to the Canadian side of the discussion.

Appointment of Sarkar in this high-profile position is amongst a series of appointments of Indo-Canadians made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

They include four Indo-Canadian federal ministers: Bardish Chagger as the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and House Leader, Navdeep Bains as the Minister for Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Harjit Singh Sajjan as the Minister for National Defence and Amarjeet Sohi as the Minister for Infrastructure and Communities. — PTI"
Common anti-allergy drugs may treat deadly blood clots: study,"London, August 3

Common anti-allergy medicines could prove to be an effective treatment for potentially fatal blood clots in the legs, a study has claimed. The research by the University of Birmingham in the UK could lead to new treatments that prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that develops within a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg, and causes swelling, aching and difficulty walking. It can be caused by prolonged periods of immobility, such as after surgery or during a long flight. If the clot becomes dislodged it can travel to the lungs and block a blood vessel. This is known as a pulmonary embolism (PE). An estimated 30 per cent of PEs cause sudden death. The team discovered that mice genetically depleted of mast cells, a type of immune cells, are protected from developing DVT. The current treatments for DVT include anti-clotting drugs such as heparin and warfarin. These drugs are relatively effective but put patients at increased risk of bleeding. This is because they affect haemostasis, the body’s natural response to blood vessel injury and bleeding. In the study, published in the journal Circulation Research, the researchers turned off the gene that is responsible for producing mast cells. The research found that the mice which were deficient in mast cells were protected from DVT. They also found that mast-cell deficient mice had normal haemostasis, tackling the bleeding side-effects possible with treatments such as warfarin. Researchers now hope to validate the findings in humans, by testing samples of blood from people with and without DVT. If positive, mast cell inhibitors, which are already approved for treatment of some allergic diseases such as asthma, could quickly move into human clinical trials. “These findings offer new hope for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis without a risk of bleeding,” said Alex Brill, from the University of Birmingham in the UK. “If further human studies support our findings in mice, drugs to block mast cell production could be used in the future alongside lower doses of anticoagulants such as warfarin, significantly reducing bleeding risk,” said Brill. This is particularly exciting because this is a group of drugs which already exists, and some forms are approved for the treatment of allergies such as hay fever and asthma, meaning that this discovery could help people with DVT sooner rather than later.

Remembering “Himachal Nirmata” Dr YS Parmar on his 111th birth anniversary, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh today said he was a great visionary and dynamic leader who dedicated his life for the development of hill people. Virbhadra paid floral tributes to Dr Parmar on his birth anniversary on the historic Ridge and later in a simple function in the Vidhan Sabha. The Chief Minister was accompanied by Congress party affairs in-charge Sushil Kumar Shinde, ministers, chief parliamentary secretaries and legislators, both of ruling and opposition and senior officials. The Chief Minister said it was because of the struggle led by Dr Parmar that the hill state got a separate entity, size and status to lay a solid foundation for its development. He added that the statehood had set the pace for speedy development to fulfil the dreams of Dr Parmar who wanted to see the hill people to have their own identity. “It was the result of his vision and forceful advocacy that Himachal finally attained statehood in 1971,” said Virbhadra. The issue raised by Dr Parmar pertaining to statehood was taken lightly by some but his dreams had been accomplished. He further said the people would remain indebted to him for his tireless efforts for getting separate political identity for Himachal. Speaker, BBL Butail said Dr Parmar had a lot of knowledge. He was a great litterateur and always evinced keen interest in reading and writing."
GST: Freelancers exporting software to take a hit,"Vijay C Roy

New norms

Under the GST law, if any person is supplying any goods or services outside the country, then GST registration becomes mandatory

If a freelancer is earning even a single rupee from outside the state, then he is liable for GST registration in India and also shall not be liable to claim the basic exemption limit of Rs 20 lakh

The freelancers who are exporting services outside India will not only have to register with GST but also has to file three returns every month

The GST Act, mandating every person engaged in exporting services to comply with the GST law, is likely to hit individuals and freelancers, especially software professionals, across the country. Under the GST law, if any person is supplying any goods or services outside the country, then GST registration becomes mandatory. For example, if a freelancer is earning even a single rupee from outside the state, then he is liable for GST registration in India and also shall not be liable to claim the basic exemption limit of Rs 20 lakh. The freelancers who are exporting services outside India will not only have to register with GST but also has to file three returns every month. Prior to GST implementation, there were no such regulations. Industry lamented that this ambiguity may lead to restricting exports of services to significant level from the present levels. There appears to be serious dichotomy between intention and wordings of GST as far as export of services is concerned. They rue that the increase in indirect taxation will inflate the cost of the service. “The move by the Centre will increase overhead expenses as well as administrative work. We are freelancers with a team of two and it will be very difficult to comply with new norms with limited earnings,” said Manmeet Sirohi (name changed), a Mohali-based freelancer who works for different companies based in the US, the UK and European countries. Echoing similar sentiments, Anuj Aggarwal, managing director, Altruist Technologies (P) Ltd., said, “There are millions of freelancers in India who export software to different countries. This will incur increase in overhead expenses as they have to hire accountant also and their working capital will be blocked as first they have to pay tax and later on it will be refunded. My suggestion is there should be some threshold limit for registration.” According to Mastan Singh Chambyal, a CA, and vice-chairman, Chandigarh branch of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), as per the GST Act, every person exporting goods or services will have to comply with the GST law and they will levied a tax called IGST Tax. “There is no minimum exemption limit. Even the freelancers are also covered and have to get themselves registered. Under the GST, exports have been categorised as zero-rated supply and under the new regime, taxes paid on input as well as output supplies are refundable,” he added."
The Tribune: World news,"WASHINGTON: The US has submitted its formal communication to the UN indicating it will withdraw from the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement as soon as possible, the State Department has said.

Washington, August 5

The US has submitted its formal communication to the UN indicating it will withdraw from the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement as soon as possible, the State Department has said.

The communication is in line with the decision announced by President Donald Trump recently, which was one of his key electoral promises.

But according to the terms of the pact, the US can’t fully withdraw until November 4, 2020, which would be a day after the next presidential election is held in the US. This means the next US president could still rejoin the agreement.

The Paris climate deal aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2°C since the start of the industrial age.

The State Department said that the US submitted a communication to the UN, in its capacity as a depositary for the Paris agreement, regarding the US intent to withdraw from it as soon as it is eligible to do so.

As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging with the agreement if the US can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers, it said in a statement.

The US supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security, it said.

“We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in many nationally determined contributions,” the state department said.

However, the US will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP-23) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect US interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration, it said.

“Such participation will include ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris agreement,” it added. PTI"
Senate confirms 3 Indian-Americans to key US govt positions,"Washington, August 4

The Senate has unanimously confirmed three Indian-Americans to key government positions, including one as the Trump administration’s czar on intellectual property--an area of sharp differences between the US and India. The Senate confirmed Neil Chatterjee as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Vishal Amin as Intellectual Property (IP) Enforcement Coordinator in the Trump administration. Krishna Urs was confirmed as the US ambassador to Peru. A career foreign service officer since 1986, Urs--after Nikki Haley--is the second Indian-American to have been selected for an ambassadorial position by the administration.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Haley, a two-term former governor of South Carolina, is the US ambassador to the United Nations and holds a cabinet-level position in the administration. She is the first Indian-American to do so in any US presidential administration. As the new IP Czar, Amin would be responsible for enforcement of intellectual property, an area of sharp differences between India and the United States. The US on Friday retained India on its priority watch list this year for “lack of improvement” in the intellectual property (IP) framework. In April, the US retained India on its priority watch list for “lack of improvement” in the IP framework. However, India had termed the report as a unilateral move by the US. Amin is currently the senior counsel on the House Judiciary Committee. “Vishal Amin has been a valued member of my staff and will continue to be a tireless advocate on behalf of America’s innovators and creators,” said Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He has previously served in the administration of President George W Bush as associate director for Domestic Policy, and at the Department of Commerce as special assistant and associate director for policy in the Office of the Secretary, the White House said. Chatterjee, currently the energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, over the years has played an integral role in the passage of major energy, highway, and farm legislations. “Chatterjee has an extensive knowledge of the many important federal issues facing our industry and customers,” said Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President Tom Kuhn. Prior to serving McConnell, he worked as a principal in Government Relations for National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. Urs is currently charge d’affaires of the US Embassy in Madrid, Spain, where he was also the deputy chief of mission. Urs has specialised in economic issues and developed extensive policy experience in the Andean region of South America. He has served at seven United States embassies as well in senior leadership positions in Washington DC."
"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","LONDON: Scientists have revealed the source of human heartbeat in unprecedented detail, an advance that may help surgeons repair hearts without damaging precious tissue.

London

Scientists have revealed the source of human heartbeat in unprecedented detail, an advance that may help surgeons repair hearts without damaging precious tissue.

Researchers, including those from University of Manchester in the UK, developed a way of producing three-dimensional (3D) data to show the cardiac conduction system - the special cells that enable our hearts to beat.

The 3D data makes it much easier to understand the complex relationships between the cardiac conduction system and the rest of the heart,"" said Jonathan Jarvis from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.

Soaking post-mortem samples in a solution of iodine means soft tissue such as the heart can absorb X-rays and become visible, researchers said.

With modern X ray scanners, scientists can make detailed 3D images. In the best images, they can even see the boundaries between single heart cells, and detect in which direction they are arranged.

Within the heart, there is a special network called the cardiac conduction system that generates and distributes a wave of electrical activity stimulating the heart muscle to contract, researchers said.

This system makes sure that the various parts of the heart contract regularly and in a coordinated way, a bit like a team of rowers in a boat race.

If the system is damaged, and one part of the heart contracts out of time with the rest, then the heart does not pump so efficiently, they said.

The new data gives a much more accurate framework than previously available for computer models of the heartbeat and should improve the ability to make sense of troublesome heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation that affects 1.4 million people in the UK, researchers said.

The data reveals exactly where the cardiac conduction system is in a normal heart. For example, it shows just how close it runs to the aortic valve.

""We also use the data to make 3D printed models that are really useful in our discussions with heart doctors, other researchers and patients with heart problems,"" Jarvis said.

New strategies to repair or replace the aortic valve must therefore make sure that they do not damage or compress this precious tissue, researchers said.

""In future work we will be able to see where the cardiac conduction system runs in hearts that have not formed properly. This will help the surgeons who repair such hearts to design operations that have the least risk of damaging the cardiac conduction system,"" Jarvis said.

The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports. PTI"
Game of addiction,"Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

Nonika Singh

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."

The youths later threw stones and the clashes continued for nearly an hour. The police fired teargas shells to disperse the protesters, eyewitness said.

The Jammu and Kashmir Government allowed congregational prayers at the Jamia mosque in old Srinagar for the first time after six weeks. Moderate Hurriyat faction chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was not allowed to visit the mosque as he continued to remain under house arrest. Mirwaiz addressed the gathering over phone and termed the Kashmiri “struggle” as “indigenous”. “Nobody will be allowed the hamper with the indigenous nature of the struggle,” he said. He lashed out at Indian television channels for “defaming” the separatist leadership. “These channels are indulging in propaganda,” he said. There was no restriction in the old city on Friday — the first time since June 23 — and people were seen heading to Jamia mosque to offer prayers. The government had been imposing restrictions on Fridays after security wing DSP Mohammed Ayub Pandith (57) was beaten to death in Nowhatta on the night of June 22.

"Brilliant Farah maintains domination with epic 10,000m win","London, August 5

Mo Farah launched the World Athletics Championships in scintillating fashion on Friday with another consummate 10,000 metres triumph that further embellished his claim to being the greatest distance racer in the sport’s history.

With 55,000 of his home fans roaring their support at the London Stadium, the 34-year-old Briton sprinted away with his 10th consecutive gold medal in a global track final, a dazzling sequence that ranks among the greatest feats in sport.

Farah survived being clipped twice from behind in the final lap, nearly tripping over and being forced to take a step off the track, and he ended with cuts and bruises to his “bad legs” that needed treatment.

Yet still he was able to unleash one more trademark burst down the home straight to speed away from Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei and Kenya’s Paul Tanui.

The Briton clocked 26 minutes 49.51 seconds, the world’s fastest time in 2017, in what proved perhaps the hardest-earned of all his magnificent triumphs as he protected his six-year unbeaten streak in major championships.

Silver medallist Cheptegei, just 20, clocked a lifetime best 26:49.94, chasing Farah all the way to the line, and Tanui 26:50.60.

Yet, five years to the very night when he won the 25-lap title at his home Olympics on “Super Saturday” in the same London Stadium, Farah had still not lost that invincible aura, clocking a searing 55.63 seconds for the last lap in spite of his stumbles.

It was the perfect way for him to begin his final championship as a track runner before he turns his attentions to the roads as a marathon man.

“What a way to end my career in London. It’s special,” Farah said, after hugging his children on the track.

“It was one of the toughest races of my life. With one lap to go I nearly get tripped, twice, that was hard. But I just had to be mentally stronger and think I didn’t work this hard for nothing.” After an epic test in which the powerful Kenyan and Ugandan athletes combined with mid-race bursts to test Farah’s resolve more fiercely than ever before, the Briton had to show remarkable composure on the final lap.

Twice as he led straight after the bell while still closely pursued by four hunters, Farah was clipped. The first time, his heel was caught by Tanui and on the second bend, the same Kenyan brushed his arm, sending Farah off balance so that he took one step into the infield.

Back straight

Yet despite momentarily losing his rhythm, the champion regrouped to take control on the back straight and he scorched off the final bend to forge clear and take his third successive world 10,000m title by a couple of metres.

It was the fastest he had run in any of his five global 10,000m victories by more than 11 seconds.

Still, though, he has only done half the job with the 5,000 metres to come next week and the prospect of completing a fifth straight 5,000/10,000 distance double in global championships.

Whether the battering he took will affect his hopes remains to be seen but the race certainly took a toll, as he reckoned the second incident involving Tanui with about 300 metres left had hurt him.

“I’ve got such long strides that I got caught and at that point I was just trying to stand up and think ‘I can’t go down, I can’t go down’,” he said.

Home triumph

The 16th edition of the Championships could not have been set up more ideally for Britain to celebrate a home triumph in the first medal event and Farah, as ever, did not disappoint his legion of fans.

After he crossed the line, he swore that the noise in the stadium matched the incredible din of his 2012 tours de force when he won the 10,000m and 5,000m here.

Down the years, his main opponents from Kenya have tried in vain to upset Farah’s equilibrium, sometimes working in teams and varying their pace and tactics but the master racer always has an answer in the sprint denouement.

A couple of blistering 61-second laps were thrown in to try to shake him but Farah’s composure never wavered as he moved up the field to join the leaders and gestured to the crowd to turn up the volume.

“I just wanted to play with the guys’ heads,” he said.

He will have the chance to play with their heads on the track one more time in the 5,000 metres, the heats of which are on Wednesday.

“I did actually hurt my leg but I’m going to see the doctor now and take care of it - a few stitches, maybe,” Farah said with a smile which suggested he is not about to have his incredible sequence ended in his final championship track race. Reuters"

Ludhiana August 4

The Special Task Unit (STU) claimed to have busted a gang of snatchers today and recovered 27 mobile phones from them.

The gang confessed to having committed over 50 snatchings in the city in the recent past.

The accused have been identified as Samir Khan (22), a resident of Muslim Colony in Focal Point and Jatinder Kumar alias Longa (25), a resident of Sherpur Khurd.

STU Ludhiana Chief Prem Singh in a press conference said a tip-off was received that two youths, who had formed a gang of snatchers, were roaming in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar area to commit snatching. Accordingly, the STU team laid a trap and arrested them.

On the disclosures of the accused, 27 mobile phones were recovered from them, Singh said, adding that the accused had mainly been targeting migrant labourers near railway tracks and other migrant-populated areas. “After snatching mobiles from migrant labourers, they used to sell it to migrant labourers at cheap price, Prem Singh said.

Apart from targeting labourers in railway areas, they committed several snatchings in Focal Point, Jamalpur, Shimlapuri and Sahnewal areas.

On August 2, the STU had also busted a gang of snatchers and recovered 31 mobile phones from them.

Committed robberies to buy drugs

The STU chief said the accused were childhood friends. Jatinder entered the crime world before his aide Samir. Jatinder was already facing two cases of drugs and theft. ""They are childhood friends and reportedly studied together in school. Now, they formed a gang to loot migrant labourers. They are also drug addicts and resort to such crimes to satisfy their hunger for drugs,"" Singh said."
Power shocker for consumers,"Bills set to shoot up 20-30%, courtesy FPPCA charges

Chandigarh, August 4

The next bills of electricity are set to give a shock to the consumers as the UT Electricity Department has once again levied the fuel and power purchase cost adjustment (FPPCA) charges. The Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) has authorised the Electricity Department to compute the fuel and power procurement cost variations on a quarterly basis and charge it from the consumers. Sources said the department had levied the FPPCA charges on the electricity consumed during the last quarter (April to June). The FPCCA charges would be reflected in the bills to be dispatched from August 1 to August 31. While the JERC has rejected the proposal for enhancing the electricity rates, the department has burdened the consumers in another way. The department bought electricity at higher rates and is charging the difference from the consumers. This will lead to an increase in the bills by 20 to 30 per cent depending upon the category. The charges have been levied for all type of consumers -- domestic, commercial and industrial. The charges levied are from 57 paise to Rs 2.56 maximum per unit over and above the existing rates charged from the consumers. This is the fourth hike in the bills this year. Naveen Manglani, president of the Chamber of Chandigarh Industries, said the charges would ruin industries in the city. He said the process of levying the FPPCA charges should be made transparent and people should be told why they are being charged so high. He said following the FPPCA charges, the cost of electricity for the industrial sector had touched Rs 7 to Rs 9 per unit, the highest in the region. Baljinder Singh Bittu, president, FOSWAC, said the FPPCA charges were unjustified."

Battling sexual harassment charges and the recent setback of being dropped from the Indian hockey team for the European tour, Sardar Singh should consider himself lucky for being recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award. “This is undoubtedly one of the best moments of my career. This is the best thing to have happened to me in a very long time,” the 31-year-old Haryana midfielder said from Bengaluru. A police complaint was filed against him for allegedly sexually harassing a British woman hockey player of Indian origin on pretext of marriage. “This is all destiny. When you haven’t done anything wrong, God can’t be cruel to you. The award shows that people still have faith in me. They still support me as I enter the last phase of my career,” Singh added. The news of Khel Ratna recommendation has rejuvenated the Sirsa-born player and he hopes to continue fighting for his place in the team. “It has strengthened my resolve to continue fighting for my place in the team and the external forces. This award has motivated me to continue playing for India for another 2-3 years. My focus is to play the next year’s World Cup, CWG and the Asian Games,” he added."

A meeting best forgotten,"MOVIE REVIEW - JAB HARRY MET SEJAL

Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering. So much so even the delectable song Hawayein written by Irshad Kaamil and composed by Pritam gets lost and can’t hold love in the air."
5 Punjab cops among 8 arrested for snatching heroin,"Chandigarh, August 5

The arrested policemen are attached with State Counter Intelligence unit, said Additional Director General of Police, Border Range, Harpreet Singh Sidhu, who is also STF chief.

Sidhu added that the action was part of the STF's sustained campaign to break the nexus between drug traffickers and police.

“Rajinder Singh Sohal, SP, STF, Mohali unit, had received information last light that a police party comprising personnel from Counter Intelligence, Punjab, snatched 300 gm heroin from drug trafficker Narinder Singh and extorted Rs 8 lakh under threat by impersonating STF unit, Fazilka, and released him without taking any legal action,"" he said.

The policemen arrested include Sub-Inspector Sushil Kumar, constable Gagandeep Singh, Head Constable Jarnail Singh, constable Harjit Singh and Sub Inspector Sushil Kumar.

""Sub-Inspector Sushil Kumar conspired with other police personnel and went to Lalru area which is out of their jurisdiction. They used their own private cars after changing the number plates and did not inform their senior officers or take permission from them.

""They stopped the vehicle of Narinder Singh in Lalru area posing as a team from 'STF unit Fazilka' and took him forcibly towards Fatehgarh Sahib side,"" Sidhu said.

He said the police officials first snatched the heroin and later extorted money from the trafficker.

Guard against water damage,"HOME TRUTHS

Saurabh Agarwal

The arrival of monsoon is a welcome respite from the summer heat. But on the flip side, the wet spell is also associated with leaking roofs, seepage, and in some cases, collapse of buildings due to structural failure. It is a false notion that little can be done to prevent water-related issues once a structure has been constructed. Now, a range of products are easily available in the market that can ensure maximum protection from water damage right in the beginning at the construction phase, and even as an after-construction solution to protect homes and buildings. Read on to get a better understanding of the underlying causes of the problem and the range of remedies and solutions available to effectively address the problem at hand:

What causes water damage

Shoddy construction and use of sub-standard materials can cause cracks and crevices in concrete structures that allow water to penetrate. These are not just an eye-sore aesthetically, but also pose a hazard to the structural strength of the building. Identifying the root cause and prompt corrective measures to deal with any seepage or leakage is important to prevent the problem from worsening.

Installing drainage system and maintaining it is the first logical step that must be undertaken from the construction phase itself. A proper drainage system must, therefore, be installed on priority basis if your home doesn’t have one.

Awareness is the key to prevention

As the saying goes — A stitch in time saves nine. Thus, following basic principles of water proofing at relevant stages of construction is a sure shot way of ensuring a water-proof structure that stands the test of time. Design and construction elements to mitigate the danger at the design stage, provision for effective drainage systems, use of suitable materials such as bitumen or silicone-based water proofing systems in terrace and walls along with water repellant paints and emulsions are also effective in the fight against seepage, leakage and dampness.

For new constructions, admixtures, plasticisers and integral water-proofing compounds are available to provide an effective barrier against water from cutting through concrete. These can be conveniently built-in when constructing structures like foundation and retaining walls in basement, wet areas (toilet, balcony and kitchen), terrace, overhead and underground tanks, swimming pools, podium slab etc.

For the water-proofing solutions to be effective, critical components of the structure such as block walls and underground foundation need to be in top shape.

Solutions to check out

There are several corrective measures that can be adopted as per the problem and structural composition of the building.

Liquid waterproofing is generally adopted for concrete and plasters. This innovative waterproofing solution acts as a tonic for cement and can be applied from the foundation to the roof of the building. This cement additive is specially formulated to increase the life span of buildings by preventing the development of cracks thereby preventing leakage and rusting.

Water proofing compounds are increasingly becoming popular not only as a deterrent to water ingress but also as an aid for healthy construction, emulsion and protective coatings to limit the effect of vagaries of weather on buildings.

Five water proofing solutions that are currently preferred are:

Conventional systems would include box-type water proofing with impervious stone slabs.

Crystalline waterproofing systems and flexible membrane water proofing systems involve application of chemicals on the surface of concrete.

Chemical coatings react with the soft by-products of the cement hydration process and form hard crystals. These crystals lodge themselves in the concrete pores, thereby making it impervious.

Water-repellant impregnates are silicones which due to their low-viscosity impart repellant property to the surface on application.

Filing for motor insurance claim? Think twice,"Neeraj Gupta

People buy motor insurance mainly for two reasons — first and foremost, to protect their vehicle against any damage caused by an accident and secondly, because it is mandatory by law. Out of millions of accidents which happen on Indian roads annually, the vast majority of them are not fatal and claims for such accidents are called petty claims, where claim amount is less than the premium. While most of us prefer filing a claim immediately after an accident, we often face a dilemma on whether or not we should be filing a claim for smaller damages such as scratch or dent. So, should you file a claim every time? Here are a few pointers to consider before filing a claim from your insurer:

Do calculation

It is crucial for you to measure your claim amount against deductibles, depreciation and NCB benefits, and decide which one will be beneficial in the long run. Your motor insurance plan comes with a deductible clause that makes you equally responsible for paying some percentage of the total claim amount from your own pocket. This could be anywhere between 10%-20% of total repair cost, depending upon the size of the engine of your car. An inbuilt deductible is called as compulsory deductible and the amount is fixed Rs 1,000 up to 1500cc and Rs 2,000 above 1500cc. For instance, you have a comprehensive insurance plan without add-ons for a three-year-old car and you apply for a claim of Rs 10,000 to get the repairs done. In this case, you may have to pay somewhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 as deductibles and depreciation cost. Your insurer, on the other hand, would pay the rest of money that is Rs 4,000-5,000. So, if you were to make a claim here, you would undergo loss; knowing that you will have to let go 25% NCB and also pay for repairing from your own pocket.

No claim bonus

Apart from this, filing a claim impacts your claim history and creates a perception about your profile in the mind of insurance companies. In simple words, no claim bonus is a report card of your driving abilities. In India, there is no mechanism to calculate your driving skills; therefore, insurance companies rely on NCB. Maintained NCB simply means you have not made any claim in past years and hence you are a safe driver.

Dilemma

Scenario 1: Hitting someone else’s car or property. You should claim insurance if the damage is considerable. However, if the damage to the third-person’s property is minor and no one got hurt, then the best thing to do is to get the repairs done on your own. That way, you will escape from the hassle of long, time-consuming paperwork for a small amount. Scenario 2: Damage is going to cost Rs 15,000 or less. A big NO. Do not claim insurance for such a small amount. Settle it from your own pocket and save the insurance for worse days. However, you can claim benefits, if you own a new car with 0% NCB and zero depreciation add-on. Scenario 3: If the car is too old and you’re planning to purchase a new one anytime soon. Ever heard that you can transfer no claim bonus points to your new car and new insurance? It will be helpful not to dump the NCB benefits over a minor claim and, instead, use them to effectively lower your new insurance premium amount. In any case, you have to sell off the old car. Scenario 4: You have already made a claim this year. The number of claims you can make in a year are limited. As far as zero depreciation is concerned, it is limited to two claims per year, after two claims your plan will be handled as vanilla comprehensive policy, so must save it for an even worse scenario. Making a claim every time may look like a good thing to do for a short-term profit, but in the long term, you will face a bigger loss in terms of no NCB. Moreover, a lot of claims will make your driving history look too dangerous and you may have to pay a higher premium next time you buy an insurance policy. Hence, paying for small repairs from your own pocket will keep you in a win-win situation. The writer is Head of Motor Insurance, Policybazaar.com. The views expressed in this article are his own"

Agrees in principle to cut circle rates, illegal marriage palaces to be regularised

Chandigarh, August 4

To give a boost to the real estate sector, the Punjab Cabinet, which met here today, gave its nod to rationalising collector rates and reducing stamp duty on registration of property to 6 per cent (from 9 per cent) till March 31, 2018.

The government, in its Budget last month, had announced a cut in the stamp duty. Finance Minister Manpreet Badal called it an important step to revive the realty sector.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

For a property worth Rs 2 crore, a 3 per cent cut in stamp duty would mean a saving of Rs 6 lakh.

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh directed the Revenue Department to place a formal proposal on reducing the circle/collectorate rates before the Cabinet when it meets next. The Cabinet discussed at length the sluggish sale/purchase of residential and commercial property, which is affecting revenue collections.

The cut in stamp duty is expected to push up sale and purchase.

The Council of Ministers also decided to put off the proposed 10 per cent increase in Change of Land Use (CLU) charges, External Development Charges (EDC) and licence fee (LF) till March 31, 2020, for all real estate projects.

A new policy for granting approval to unauthorised marriage palaces and for building new ones was approved too, replacing the one framed by the earlier dispensation, regularising all such palaces raised before November 16, 2012.

New Delhi, August 4

The Delhi Metro, in association with an agency, Delhi Walks, specialised in organising heritage walks, is starting an initiative from tomorrow as part of which custom-designed special ‘walks’ will be arranged in the Old Delhi areas for tourists and heritage enthusiasts, to give them a detailed view of the rich and diverse cultural and historical heritage of many landmarks, said a spokesperson of the DMRC.

The inaugural walk will be titled ‘An Empire's Tale through the Blooming Red’. As part of this pilot project, a total of eight such walks with different themes will be arranged on all weekends of the month of August. Bookings can be made by calling on the number 9899692790 or by sending an email to share@delhiwalks.in.

As part of the ‘Heritage Walk’ series, the visitors will assemble at different Metro stations of Old Delhi and then proceed for the ‘walks’ accompanied by trained guides, the spokesperson said.

He said that Delhi Metro has opened its ITO-Kashmere Gate section on May 28 this year. This section is known as heritage line. The corridor passes through various historical landmarks such as Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid and Red Fort.

On this section, efforts have been made to portray the rich culture of the area through photographs, artworks, installations etc at all the stations. A portion of the Yellow Line also passes through Old Delhi areas such as Chawri Bazar and Chandni Chowk.

In order to portray the rich culture of the city, DMRC has installed artworks, exhibitions etc at many stations across the city.

This initiative is also an attempt by DMRC to take the city’s heritage closer to the people. During the hourlong walk, visitors are led by a guide, who seemingly subconsciously repeats, ""Don't get lost"", through the trail.

Come Dariba Kalan (market famous for jewellery) and Kinari Bazaar, one realises why each lane gets narrower and busier.

""Shah Jahan built this city because he wanted a bigger and better place than Agra, where he built the famous Taj Mahal. But, then it was inhabited by people from Agra, who came here and started living in the same way they used to!"" said the Delhi Walks explorer."
When a bus ticket became a ticket to acquittal,"Himachal man escapes 15-year jail in drugs case after his bus ticket proves police wrong

Satya Prakash

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 5

Next time you buy a bus, rail or air ticket, think twice before destroying it. The travel document could prove to be a crucial piece of evidence during a trial, in case you are falsely implicated in a criminal case.

(Follow

; and

)

When Naresh Kumar alias Nitu bought a bus ticket for travel from Nerwa to Chamunda in Himachal Pradesh in July 2012, he would have never imagined that it would save him from a 15-year-jail term in a drugs case.

Police apprehended him at Majhotli at 6.15 am and recovered from his possession a bag containing 2-kg ‘charas’ in the presence of independent witness Sita Ram and Shyam Singh, Nerwa depot in-charge, and bus conductor Khem Ram.

Police launched prosecution against Nitu under Sections 20 and 61 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.

Giving benefit of doubt, the Special Judge, Shimla, acquitted him. The trial court concluded that two theories had emerged with regard to the accusations against the accused.

It took note of the fact that Constable Rakesh Kumar, an eyewitness to the incident, had not been mentioned as a witness in the seizure memo.

However, relying on the testimony of police witnesses, the Himachal Pradesh High Court reversed the trial court’s acquittal order and sent Nitu to jail for 15 years and ordered him to pay a fine of Rs 2 lakh.

The High Court also rejected the defence counsel’s objections regarding discrepancies in the police theory, saying “Any discrepancy with regard to distance could be attributed to memory loss with passage of time, and was not required to be with mathematical precision. The time with regard to purchase of bus ticket had not been established.”

But a Supreme Court bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice Navin Sinha set aside the High Court’s verdict and restored the trial court’s order of acquittal after Nitu’s counsel Rishi Malhotra pointed out that his client could not have been apprehended at 6.15 am at Majhotli as he boarded the bus at only 6.51 am at Nerwa.

Malhotra contended that his client was taken from the bus at Chopal after it arrived from Majhotli and the narcotics was planted on him to falsely implicate him the case.

The bench accepted Malhotra’s argument that road distance between Nerwa and Majhotli being 26 km and it would take at least one hour or more to cover the distance in the hills and Nitu would have reached Majhotli at 8 am.

The top court took note of the fact that the bus ticket clearly mentioned the appellant’s time of boarding the bus as 6.51 am and independent witness Sita Ram specifically denied in his testimony that Nitu was apprehended in his presence and that any search, seizure and recovery was conducted in his presence.

Contrary to police claim, Sita Ram – who was declared hostile -- deposed that he was called to the police station at 1 pm and asked to sign certain papers.

“In a case of sudden recovery, an independent witness may not be available. But if an independent witness is available, and the prosecution initially seeks to rely upon him, it cannot suddenly discard the witness because it finds him inconvenient, and place reliance upon police witnesses only,” the bench said.

The evidence of an independent witness could not be discarded without any reason to hold that the police version was the truth, it added.

“Prima facie, the prosecution story that the appellant was apprehended at Majhotli at 6.15 am becomes seriously doubtful if not impossible. The bus would have reached Majhotli at about 8 am or thereafter only. The conclusion of the High Court that passage of time, and memory loss, were sufficient explanation for the time difference, is held to be perverse…,” the top court said, reversing the High Court’s finding."

An increasing number of students have been gravitating towards Humanities stream and a bachelor in arts degree over the past few years. The competititon for “hot” subject combinations for UG courses is very fierce, especially in Delhi University colleges and even in other cities like Chandigarh. BA is no more considered to be an easy option and career-oriented students take extreme care in choosing the subject combinations that will keep them relevant in the job market later on.

However, once the students choose to go this route, they face confusion about the subject combinations they need to choose from. Here are some winning subject options that would hold you in good stead and cover maximum surface area for choosing career options:

Psychology- Sociology-Economics

A BA with this combinations will open doors in economic, social, and fields of psychology. Sociology and economics as social sciences are closely related. While economics deals with the production, consumption and distribution of wealth, sociology allows us to study these aspects in relation to the societal structures.

Job prospects

This is one of the best combinations that provides an opportunity to specialise in any one of the three main subjects. Most graduates with a bachelor’s degree in psychology who don’t go on to further study find work in fields such as business administration, sales or education.

You can also find work in the community and social services sector as counselors, mental health workers and psychiatric aides, or in criminal justice/forensic psychology as correctional and police officers, parole and probation officers, and interviewers for various criminal justice agencies. NGOs and International organizations are also seeking who have studied psychology.

You may also find work as sociology research assistants, but most of you wind up in other fields, such as social services, administration, management, or sales and marketing. An undergraduate degree in sociology might also qualify college graduates to work as case managers, child care workers or homeless/housing workers or move into education administration or teaching,.

Studying economics will equip you with a strong grasp of economic principles which will help to make more informed decision and get into the government sector, banks, accountancy, insurance companies, regulatory bodies etc.

Sociology-Political Science- Economics

This subject combination actually prepares you to become a generalist that the civil services exam requires. The other interesting fields such as journalism and mass-communication, law, management, NGOs, education, film making etc are open for further exploration. Students also get empowered enough to set up their own start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures.

Job prospects

Sociology offers several enticing career options due to the different specialisations that one can choose from. Research institutes, the criminal justice system, public health and welfare organisations, private businesses, law firms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions, advertising firms, survey and polling organizations are only some of the example where people from this background are required.

There are options of working in other sectors with area specialists to help function.

Being a sociologist asks for a lot of patience along with dedication to the work. Employers will look for people with good communication and research skills along with the capacity for detailed observation.

After completing bachelor’s/master’s program in political science, several opportunities are available in both government and private sectors. Politics, public administration, law, and marketing fields are always in need of good political scientists.

Political scientists can even opt for campaign management, polling and electoral politics, and university and college teaching. The career prospects in political science have widened enough in the voluntary organisations and NGOs. The international voluntary organisations, like UNO, have huge scope for proficient political scientists across the world. Besides, they can join media houses as political journalists and political researchers/analysts.

Economics is perhaps the only Arts course that requires the student to be ‘swift’ in maths. While most economists have advanced degrees (in most cases a PhD), there are many lucrative career opportunities for those choosing economics at the undergraduate level. Data analysis, banking and finance, and market analysis are some avenues open to aspirants. Some even go on to becoming stock brokers.

Kuldip Dhiman

When poet Jaleel Manakpuri was being felicitated by an organiser who was not familiar with the nuances of Urdu, a friend sitting next to the poet said, “Jaleel sahab, aaj aap zaleel hone wale hain.” (Jaleel sahib, today you are going to be humiliated). This is because a slight difference in pronunciation can change the meaning completely in Urdu. Jaleel means ‘glorious’, and if pronounced zaleel, it means ‘to be humiliated’.

Urdu, along with its twin sister Hindi, has been a language of the masses for more than 700 years. Both grew out of what is called khari boli, the general language of communication in northern India. While Urdu is normally written in the Persian script, and has more Persian, Turkish and Arabic words, Hindi is written in the Devanagari and inclines more towards Sanskrit. These are virtually indistinguishable to the outsider.

The name ‘Urdu’ has its origins in the Turkish word ordu which means ‘army camp’, and over the centuries, it has produced great literature, especially poetry. A single sher (couplet) of Urdu can help you express what cannot be said in a thousand words. However, with the rise of English as the lingua franca, and with an unfair association of Urdu with religion, this beautiful language seems to be losing favour with the masses. Many Urdu aficionados have begun to feel that the language is slowly dying, while experts in the field hold that Urdu is doing much better than before.

Rekhta, an organisation devoted to the promotion of Urdu language and literature, recently held a mushaira (poetic gathering) at the Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh. If numbers are any indication, it was heartening to see that the hall was jam-packed with young and old, with many of them standing outside the theatre hall to listen to the poets. The same is true of wherever mushairas are held. Litterateurs from Punjab such as Saadat Hasan Manto, Sahir Ludhianvi, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Gulzar and hundreds of others have made tremendous contribution to popularise Urdu.

Its popularity notwithstanding, Urdu certainly remains in the shadow of English. Dr Kumud Bansal, Chairperson, Haryana Urdu Akademi, Panchkula, observes, “Not just Urdu, all Indian languages are suffering. Children are not being taught their mother tongue anymore. Most parents want their children to learn only English. This is because of the slave mentality we have. This is the reason we need Urdu academies. Have you heard of an English academy?”

We move over to Malerkotla, a town rich in Urdu culture. Talking about the current health of Urdu, Dr Rubina Shabnam, Secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, says: “Urdu is the language that emerged in the undivided Punjab. In his book, Punjab Mein Urdu, Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani, the great linguistic and researcher, has shown through research based on historical evidence that the greater Punjab was the birthplace of Urdu. So Urdu is rooted in this region.” However, not all scholars agree with Shirani.

Talking about the academy and its aims, Dr Shabnam says, “We started in 2014, and we have a budget of only Rs 50,000 per annum. Even with this meagre sum, we have managed to hold stage programmes but have not been able to publish anything. Now, the government has given us a one-time sum of Rs 3 crore. With this, we hope to realise the aims of the academy. Recently, I met Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister, and he said he would give us a hundred crore rupees. If we got this amount, we would be able to encourage Urdu writers, and poets. Presently, we are starting free Urdu learning centres in six cities of Sunam, Bathinda, Ropar, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Patiala.”

Regarding the popularity of Urdu, Prof Mahmood Alam, former professor at Government College, ex-secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, and writer of a poetry collection Shikast-e-Khwab, says: “If you ask me about the current status of Urdu, I would say it is far better than before. Two decades ago, Urdu was not being taught in as many schools as it is being taught now, and there were not as many students as we have now. During my time, there used to be four teachers, and we had about four or five students who wanted to learn Urdu. Now you have 30 students, but unfortunately only one teacher. Many wish to learn Urdu but they get discouraged because it does not offer employment opportunities.”

Rubbishing language politics, Professor Alam observes, “People say that there is friction between Hindi and Urdu. They say languages create conflict between different people, but this is not so. Languages bring people together. If Hindi and Punjabi speakers learn Urdu, their Hindi and Punjabi pronunciation will improve, and vice versa.”

One has to learn the finer points of this language in order to speak it well. As Dagh Dehalvi puts it: “Nahin khel ai Dagh yaron se kah do; Ki ati hai Urdu zaban ate ate” (O! Dagh, tell friends that learning Urdu is not a child’s play; It takes its own time to be mastered).

Amarnath Wadehra, a diehard Urdu protagonist, remembers the days of his youth when Urdu poets were a rage in Lahore, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and the rest of Punjab. “There used to be regular mushairas that went on all night, and people came in hordes to listen to their favourite poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi, Firaq Gorakhpuri and many other stalwarts. Urdu poets did a lot to fan the flames of the freedom moment, and bring about a social change. Many freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for the country singing ‘Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mei hai’. The younger generation should learn English for getting jobs, but they must also learn Urdu to enrich their personality.”

Born in 1937, Pakpattan, Pakistan, Dr HK Lall has been teaching Urdu for the past four decades. “Urdu is in my blood. My father taught it to my brother and me.” Even at 81, he continues to teach the language untiringly. “Khidmat-e-Urdu karunga umr bhar; Yeh meri puja, mera imaan hai.” (I will serve Urdu all my life; It is my worship, it is my conscience).

Disappearing readers

Propagators notwithstanding, the fact is that the circulation of Urdu newspapers and magazines is going down by the day. In 2001, the total number of Urdu newspapers in the country was 2,906, but many have been forced to go online or have closed shop because of falling circulation. In a telephonic conversation, Sham Dass Khanna, news editor, Hind Samachar, the number one Urdu daily in Punjab, said, “The situation is alarming. From 1,20,000 copies per day until the 1990s, our circulation has come down to 37,000 copies per day. Our readers are disappearing because Urdu does not promise career options.”

Measures needed

In order to improve the condition of Urdu, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Nadeem, who conducts certificate and diploma courses in Urdu and Persian at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib, says: “We plan to start special classes for students who are doing post-graduation and doctorate in Punjabi because there is a close relationship between Punjabi and Urdu. The knowledge of Urdu is important even for religious studies because the poetry of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Gobind Singh is replete with Persian words and phrases.”

Urdu is the language of Punjabi culture because it was born in Punjab, observes Dr Nadeem. “It is essential to learn Urdu, because once you learn how to read and write it, doors open to eight languages because they all used the same script. These languages are: Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kashmiri, Pashtu, Dogri, Sindhi, and also Punjabi because in Pakistan, it is written in the Persian script. If you examine Punjabi and Urdu, you will notice that there are so many similarities. For example, chhabeel comes from the Arabic word sabeel; ardas comes from arz-e-dash.”

Dr Mohammad Ayyub Khan, programme in-charge, Haryana Urdu Akademi, points out the practical problems in the propagation of Urdu: “There is an acute shortage of teachers. At Panjab University, Punjabi University, Guru Nanak Dev University, and Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, they have appointed only one Urdu teacher, and this one teacher runs the entire department. How can they do justice to their jobs? In MA classes, we have eight subjects, so we need at least four Urdu teachers. It is not that there are no posts, but I fail to understand why these are not being filled up. It is not that the government is not giving funds to promote the language; the funds are not being properly utilised.”

Muhammad Rafique, lecturer, political science at Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), Malerkotla, says: “A team from Delhi came here to study the status of Urdu in this tehsil, and they gave a good report about it. They said, in other states, about 1,200 Urdu teachers have been appointed but their output is very poor. We have only 45 teachers, but their output is tremendous.”

Sahibzada Ajmal Khan Sherwani, a poet belonging to the royal family, suggests that if we want people to learn Urdu, we must produce excellent literature, films, TV serials and plays in Urdu. We see that the rise or downfall of a language is directly linked to the rise or downfall of its literature. “Urdu is very popular, and one of the reasons is the extensive use of Urdu in the film industry. Another reason for its popularity is various TV channels that telecast Urdu programmes, serials, seminars, and mushairas. In addition to this, the government must open more institutes and encourage students to learn it in schools and colleges so that great writers and poets are produced.”

Speaking of Urdu, he wrote a verse: “Hoon main Urdu, hai dilon mei mera maskan dekho; Kaun kehta hai ki meri koi jagir nahin” (I am Urdu, and my abode is in the hearts of people, Who says that I have no legacy?).

The legacy of Zauk, Sauda, Momin, Iqbal, Hali, Faraz and others is alive indeed in the hearts of the masses."

After his disqualification by the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case on July 28 Nawaz Sharif had announced that Shahbaz Sharif would be prime minister for remaining 10-month tenure of the party after interim arrangements of 45-day for which Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was elected premier.

In the background interviews, some PML-N leaders said they are of the view that Shehbaz Sharif is made to miss a ""golden opportunity"" to succeed his elder brother as there was no guarantee that he would get the same chance in 2018 if PML-N won the election, as more players from the elder Sharif family will be there in the race for the top slot.

“His wife Kalsoom will be strong candidate for the prime minister in case PML-N won the 2018 general election if his daughter — Maryam — doesn’t find herself cleared of corruption charges she faces in the accountability courts by then,"" a top PML-N leader said. ""Perhaps Shehbaz missed the golden chance of becoming premier, thanks to smart politics of his elder brother. Who knows about 2018 election's outcome and family politics then.”

“Sharif actually told his brother that he couldn't take his chances with him (Shahbaz). Sharif fears Shahbaz might take control of the party once he becomes and will also hand over Punjab province to his son Hamza,"" he said.

Another leader said: ""Sharif played excellent family politics. First he announced his brother successor. Later he built a campaign within the PML-N through his close aides establishing a narrative that Shahbaz's quitting of Punjab would be disastrous for the party as it might be split and face difficulties in 2018 polls. Had not Nawaz and company known the importance of Punjab for PML-N earlier?""

On the other hand, Shahbaz had tried unsuccessfully to have his brother take him to the Centre and leave Punjab to his son Hamza.

Maryam, who is blamed for Dawn Leaks and giving 'ill-advice' to her father regarding handling the Panama Papers case legally and politically, is also not in favour of his uncle's elevation to the Centre.

""Maryam does not like to see the total control of Shahbaz and his family in the Centre, Punjab and the PML-N,"" another PML-N leader from Punjab said.

""Giving everything on the platter of Shahbaz was never in the scheme of things of the elder brother and Maryam. Blockade of Shahbaz to the Centre will help Nawaz a compete control over the party affairs and pave the way for future premier from his family,"" he said, adding that the current arrangement suited the leadership as Sharif would see matters in the Centre and run the government through ""puppet PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"" and Shahbaz reduced to Punjab.

Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said the decision to 'retain' Shahbaz had almost been finalised.

Asif says the party wanted Shahbaz in Punjab because of his relationship with MPAs in Punjab, as well as because of his knowledge of ongoing development projects.

""A large section of the party is of the view that Shahbaz should continue delivering in Punjab."" PTI"
Bharat-22: Jaitley unveils new exchange-traded fund,"Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 4

Well-diversified portfolio with six sectors

ETF functions like a mutual fund scheme and is bought by investors as units

Bharat-22 will have a diversified portfolio of six sectors, including energy, FMCG, finance, basic material and industrial and utilities

This will be the second ETF from the government after it raised over Rs 8,509 crore from three tranches of CPSE ETF

The 22 scrips include central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), state-owned banks and government’s strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T held through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI)

To boost disinvestment of government holdings in public sector companies, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today announced a new exchange traded fund (ETF) called Bharat-22 consisting of 22 stocks of PSUs, banks and strategic investments held through SUUTI. In the Budget Speech of 2017-18, the Finance Minister had promised to use ETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares. The target for CPSEs’ disinvestment in 2017-18 was set at Rs 72,500 crore. Last year, the government raised Rs 8,500 crore by divesting through CPSE ETF. During the current financial year 2017-18, the government has realised approximatley Rs 9,300 crore through nine disinvestment transactions so far. Jaitley said the Cochin Shipyard issue has oversubscribed 73 times and is among the successful public issues in recent times. Compared to energy heavy CPSE ETF, Bharat-22 is a well-diversified portfolio with six sectors (basic materials, energy, finance, FMCG, industrials and utilities.) ICICI Prudential AMC will be the ETF Manager. Jaitley said globally ETF assets have grown significantly and there are $4 trillion worth assets under management (AUM). These are expected to touch $7 trillion by 2021. Large investors, including sovereign and pension funds, prefer investing in ETFs due to the benefits of ETF being low-cost and less risky, highly liquid, transparent in nature and that these can be traded at real time market price. In the Indian context, ETF has been a preferred instrument for investment by provident funds following flexibility given to them by the government for their investments.

Trump to get rakhis from women of a remote Haryana village,"Gurgaon, August 5

He may have not heard of Rakhi, but the women and girls of a remote Muslim-dominated village ""symbolically"" named by an NGO after US President Donald Trump will send him 1001 sacred threads on the Hindu festival that celebrates the brother-sister bond.

The gesture by the residents of Marora village in the backward Mewat region represents the ""wish of the people that ties are further strengthened between India and the US"", says the NGO, which has adopted the village.

The village had come into limelight after Sulabh International Social Service Organisation (SISSO) chief Bindeshwar Pathak had announced to name it 'Trump's village'.

The district administration had later said the move to rename the village was ""illegal"", forcing the organisation members to remove boards mentioning the new name.

They said signage boards and banners carrying the new name of the village and image of Trump had been removed by the organisation.

The village, with a population of 1,800 people, lies under Punhana Tehshil, some 60 km from Gurgaon.

""The NGO has been conducting many welfare programmes for women and girls in the village,"" Monica Jain, vice president of the NGO, said.

""These students have made 1001 rakhis with photos of Donald Trump and 501 rakhis for Narendra Modi. Women and girls of the village consider them their elder brothers,"" she said.

The consignment of rakhis was sent yesterday through cargo so that it reached the US president on Raksha Bandhan on August 7. The villagers are also sending invitations to the two leaders to visit the village.

Widows of the village have also expressed a desire to meet Modi on Raksha Bandhan at his residence in the national capital and tie rakhis.

""I have made 150 rakhis within three days for Trump bhaiyaa. I also written in a letter to be sent to the White House that the girls of your village want you to visit it with PM Modi,"" said 15-year-old Rekha Rani, a resident of the village.

Sulabh had recently constructed 95 toilets in Marora to implement Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship program to make every village in the country open defecation free.

The village has 140 houses and only 45 of them were equipped with toilet facility. Sulabh constructed the remaining 95 toilets, Jain said. —PTI"
‘False Manesar FIR’: CBI court registers complaint,"Land case takes twist, complainants ‘under scanner’now

Naveen S Garewal

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 4

The Manesar land case has taken a new twist with the court of the Special Judge, CBI, at Panchkula registering a complaint against those who had got an FIR registered alleging that they were forced to sell 400 acres at a throwaway price over a decade back after the then Congress government in Haryana initiated acquisition proceedings. In a complaint before the CBI court, it has been alleged that those getting the FIR registered never sold any land and the FIR amounted to perjury and contempt of court. The CBI is investigating the Manesar land case after the BJP government handed over investigation into an FIR by one Om Parkash Yadav and Naresh Kumar, registered at Manesar police station on August 12, 2015, alleging that he and several other villagers were forced to sell land at a cheap rate after a notice under Section 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act was allegedly issued at the behest of certain builders, politicians and bureaucrats. The acquisition process was later dropped, causing them a huge loss, it was claimed. In the matter that came up before Special Judge Jagdeep Singh, it has been alleged that those who got the FIR registered never sold any land between 2004 and 2007 as claimed in the FIR and the registration of a false complaint invited action under Sections 340 and 190 of the CrPC for initiating perjury proceedings as well as a criminal contempt for making “patently false, palpable and sheer contradictory allegations to a speaking verdict of the Punjab and Haryana High Court”. After the BJP government came to power, it had on August 15, 2015, handed over a case pertaining to sale of private land in Manesar (Gurugram) to the CBI, completing all formalities in less than 48 hours after registration of an FIR. The Congress had alleged political vendetta. The CBI was handed over the investigation into this matter that had already been decided by the High Court and which is pending in the Supreme Court. Besides Yadav and Naresh Kumar, complainant Ravinder Kumar has also impleaded CBI officials and a former Additional Chief Secretary as respondents and accused them of hatching a criminal conspiracy. In fact, Om Parkash had lost his case on merit before the High Court but concealed this fact while registering the FIR in 2015. The High Court in 2014 had clearly observed that Om Parkash sold his land voluntarily and entered into a collaboration agreement with a private builder only in 2008 after dropping of land acquisition proceedings, which were in operation between 2004 and 2007. The special court has fixed hearing for August 16 for preliminary evidence. Notably, the state government recently admitted its fault by seeking an apology in filing wrong facts unintentionally regarding issuance of licences before the Supreme Court during pendency of the SLP. However, this is after the SC had reserved its judgment on April 12. In fact, Ravinder Kumar, the same complainant, had filed an intervention application before the Supreme Court by informing it about wrong and false facts submitted by the state government."

When poet Jaleel Manakpuri was being felicitated by an organiser who was not familiar with the nuances of Urdu, a friend sitting next to the poet said, “Jaleel sahab, aaj aap zaleel hone wale hain.” (Jaleel sahib, today you are going to be humiliated).

Kuldip Dhiman

When poet Jaleel Manakpuri was being felicitated by an organiser who was not familiar with the nuances of Urdu, a friend sitting next to the poet said, “Jaleel sahab, aaj aap zaleel hone wale hain.” (Jaleel sahib, today you are going to be humiliated). This is because a slight difference in pronunciation can change the meaning completely in Urdu. Jaleel means ‘glorious’, and if pronounced zaleel, it means ‘to be humiliated’.

Urdu, along with its twin sister Hindi, has been a language of the masses for more than 700 years. Both grew out of what is called khari boli, the general language of communication in northern India. While Urdu is normally written in the Persian script, and has more Persian, Turkish and Arabic words, Hindi is written in the Devanagari and inclines more towards Sanskrit. These are virtually indistinguishable to the outsider.

The name ‘Urdu’ has its origins in the Turkish word ordu which means ‘army camp’, and over the centuries, it has produced great literature, especially poetry. A single sher (couplet) of Urdu can help you express what cannot be said in a thousand words. However, with the rise of English as the lingua franca, and with an unfair association of Urdu with religion, this beautiful language seems to be losing favour with the masses. Many Urdu aficionados have begun to feel that the language is slowly dying, while experts in the field hold that Urdu is doing much better than before.

Rekhta, an organisation devoted to the promotion of Urdu language and literature, recently held a mushaira (poetic gathering) at the Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh. If numbers are any indication, it was heartening to see that the hall was jam-packed with young and old, with many of them standing outside the theatre hall to listen to the poets. The same is true of wherever mushairas are held. Litterateurs from Punjab such as Saadat Hasan Manto, Sahir Ludhianvi, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Gulzar and hundreds of others have made tremendous contribution to popularise Urdu.

Its popularity notwithstanding, Urdu certainly remains in the shadow of English. Dr Kumud Bansal, Chairperson, Haryana Urdu Akademi, Panchkula, observes, “Not just Urdu, all Indian languages are suffering. Children are not being taught their mother tongue anymore. Most parents want their children to learn only English. This is because of the slave mentality we have. This is the reason we need Urdu academies. Have you heard of an English academy?”

We move over to Malerkotla, a town rich in Urdu culture. Talking about the current health of Urdu, Dr Rubina Shabnam, Secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, says: “Urdu is the language that emerged in the undivided Punjab. In his book, Punjab Mein Urdu, Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani, the great linguistic and researcher, has shown through research based on historical evidence that the greater Punjab was the birthplace of Urdu. So Urdu is rooted in this region.” However, not all scholars agree with Shirani.

Talking about the academy and its aims, Dr Shabnam says, “We started in 2014, and we have a budget of only Rs 50,000 per annum. Even with this meagre sum, we have managed to hold stage programmes but have not been able to publish anything. Now, the government has given us a one-time sum of Rs 3 crore. With this, we hope to realise the aims of the academy. Recently, I met Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister, and he said he would give us a hundred crore rupees. If we got this amount, we would be able to encourage Urdu writers, and poets. Presently, we are starting free Urdu learning centres in six cities of Sunam, Bathinda, Ropar, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Patiala.”

Regarding the popularity of Urdu, Prof Mahmood Alam, former professor at Government College, ex-secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, and writer of a poetry collection Shikast-e-Khwab, says: “If you ask me about the current status of Urdu, I would say it is far better than before. Two decades ago, Urdu was not being taught in as many schools as it is being taught now, and there were not as many students as we have now. During my time, there used to be four teachers, and we had about four or five students who wanted to learn Urdu. Now you have 30 students, but unfortunately only one teacher. Many wish to learn Urdu but they get discouraged because it does not offer employment opportunities.”

Rubbishing language politics, Professor Alam observes, “People say that there is friction between Hindi and Urdu. They say languages create conflict between different people, but this is not so. Languages bring people together. If Hindi and Punjabi speakers learn Urdu, their Hindi and Punjabi pronunciation will improve, and vice versa.”

One has to learn the finer points of this language in order to speak it well. As Dagh Dehalvi puts it: “Nahin khel ai Dagh yaron se kah do; Ki ati hai Urdu zaban ate ate” (O! Dagh, tell friends that learning Urdu is not a child’s play; It takes its own time to be mastered).

Amarnath Wadehra, a diehard Urdu protagonist, remembers the days of his youth when Urdu poets were a rage in Lahore, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and the rest of Punjab. “There used to be regular mushairas that went on all night, and people came in hordes to listen to their favourite poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi, Firaq Gorakhpuri and many other stalwarts. Urdu poets did a lot to fan the flames of the freedom moment, and bring about a social change. Many freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for the country singing ‘Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mei hai’. The younger generation should learn English for getting jobs, but they must also learn Urdu to enrich their personality.”

Born in 1937, Pakpattan, Pakistan, Dr HK Lall has been teaching Urdu for the past four decades. “Urdu is in my blood. My father taught it to my brother and me.” Even at 81, he continues to teach the language untiringly. “Khidmat-e-Urdu karunga umr bhar; Yeh meri puja, mera imaan hai.” (I will serve Urdu all my life; It is my worship, it is my conscience).

Disappearing readers

Propagators notwithstanding, the fact is that the circulation of Urdu newspapers and magazines is going down by the day. In 2001, the total number of Urdu newspapers in the country was 2,906, but many have been forced to go online or have closed shop because of falling circulation. In a telephonic conversation, Sham Dass Khanna, news editor, Hind Samachar, the number one Urdu daily in Punjab, said, “The situation is alarming. From 1,20,000 copies per day until the 1990s, our circulation has come down to 37,000 copies per day. Our readers are disappearing because Urdu does not promise career options.”

Measures needed

In order to improve the condition of Urdu, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Nadeem, who conducts certificate and diploma courses in Urdu and Persian at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib, says: “We plan to start special classes for students who are doing post-graduation and doctorate in Punjabi because there is a close relationship between Punjabi and Urdu. The knowledge of Urdu is important even for religious studies because the poetry of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Gobind Singh is replete with Persian words and phrases.”

Urdu is the language of Punjabi culture because it was born in Punjab, observes Dr Nadeem. “It is essential to learn Urdu, because once you learn how to read and write it, doors open to eight languages because they all used the same script. These languages are: Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kashmiri, Pashtu, Dogri, Sindhi, and also Punjabi because in Pakistan, it is written in the Persian script. If you examine Punjabi and Urdu, you will notice that there are so many similarities. For example, chhabeel comes from the Arabic word sabeel; ardas comes from arz-e-dash.”

Dr Mohammad Ayyub Khan, programme in-charge, Haryana Urdu Akademi, points out the practical problems in the propagation of Urdu: “There is an acute shortage of teachers. At Panjab University, Punjabi University, Guru Nanak Dev University, and Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, they have appointed only one Urdu teacher, and this one teacher runs the entire department. How can they do justice to their jobs? In MA classes, we have eight subjects, so we need at least four Urdu teachers. It is not that there are no posts, but I fail to understand why these are not being filled up. It is not that the government is not giving funds to promote the language; the funds are not being properly utilised.”

Muhammad Rafique, lecturer, political science at Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), Malerkotla, says: “A team from Delhi came here to study the status of Urdu in this tehsil, and they gave a good report about it. They said, in other states, about 1,200 Urdu teachers have been appointed but their output is very poor. We have only 45 teachers, but their output is tremendous.”

Sahibzada Ajmal Khan Sherwani, a poet belonging to the royal family, suggests that if we want people to learn Urdu, we must produce excellent literature, films, TV serials and plays in Urdu. We see that the rise or downfall of a language is directly linked to the rise or downfall of its literature. “Urdu is very popular, and one of the reasons is the extensive use of Urdu in the film industry. Another reason for its popularity is various TV channels that telecast Urdu programmes, serials, seminars, and mushairas. In addition to this, the government must open more institutes and encourage students to learn it in schools and colleges so that great writers and poets are produced.”

Speaking of Urdu, he wrote a verse: “Hoon main Urdu, hai dilon mei mera maskan dekho; Kaun kehta hai ki meri koi jagir nahin” (I am Urdu, and my abode is in the hearts of people, Who says that I have no legacy?).

The legacy of Zauk, Sauda, Momin, Iqbal, Hali, Faraz and others is alive indeed in the hearts of the masses."
Loosen up to lose weight,"Ratna Raman

Ratna Raman

It is increasingly true that urban Indians with long work hours and less time to fix themselves wholesome meals are “piling on the pounds” (putting on weight) by consuming foods full of unhealthy oils, sugars and processed flour. Sedentary (involving little physical activity) lifestyles and the increased consumption of empty calories in “convenience foods” (packaged foods, readily available at shops) are also playing havoc with people’s health. “Couch potatoes” (slang, person seated on a sofa, couch, play-station, or watching TV) lead lives of “repose” (rest). When human bodies, dynamos of energy are subjected to minimal limb movement, adipose (fat) tends to accumulate. Un-stretched limbs “pose” (present) their own set of hazards. It is better to walk, jog, run, do Pilates, visit the gym or adopt yoga poses, because physical activity always “counter-poses” (is in opposition to) the piling up of fat. The anxiety to lose weight on the part of the obese is matched by the eagerness of the weight-loss industry to help people lose extra pounds. This energy is manifested in personal weight loss manifestoes and advertisements offering weight loss programmes. Popular weight loss programmes advertising miracle cures or diets, offer advice on how to “loose weight.” While supporting the cause of weight-loss for reasons of health, fitness and well-being, I stridently oppose the assault on language perpetrated by people mindful of the extra weight they are struggling with. Yes, sometimes there could be a need to lose a lot of weight. Adding an extra ‘o’ to the verb ‘lose’ is incorrect use of language and does not really help matters. The verb “lose” is present tense. Weight can be “lost” (past tense) and “losing” (present continuous) weight is a possibility for most people most of the time. To lose weight may be difficult, but “loss” (noun) is always traumatic. The “oss” (noun) of a dear one, a pet, a favourite object generates grief in varying measure. Material objects can be replaced or sometimes even found at “lost and found” counters at schools and public offices . This does not hold true for living beings or for abstract human values such as love, faith, trust, innocence, The expression “throwing your weight around” (abusing a position of power) has very little to do with either “weight loss” or “loose weights”. The adjective “loose” is the opposite of tight. So you can wear a shirt that is “loose-fitting” or a pair of trousers that are “loose” at the waist. You may want to “loosen” a tie that your corporate job forces you to don on a hot summer’s day or “let loose” a volley of invectives (swear continuously) because you jammed your thumb in the door. “Loose” is a word with an entirely different playing field. It can be quite liberating to let chained or caged creatures or even words loose. Such action usually generates freedom and well-being. “Free weights” are dumbells, barbells and kettebells found at gyms and training centres. Singular weights of specific value are used on a range of weighing scales by countless sellers of wares. Seldom attached, the value of every gram or milligram is inscribed on the surface of the weight itself. Perhaps, the incorrect usage “loose weight” originated because quantities of free weights exist visually, everywhere around us. Health “Heavy-weights” (experts) recommend that we “loosen up” (relax), laugh, eat sensibly, exercise and get a good night’s rest to knock off the pounds."

An increasing number of students have been gravitating towards Humanities stream and a bachelor in arts degree over the past few years. The competititon for “hot” subject combinations for UG courses is very fierce, especially in Delhi University colleges and even in other cities like Chandigarh. BA is no more considered to be an easy option and career-oriented students take extreme care in choosing the subject combinations that will keep them relevant in the job market later on.

However, once the students choose to go this route, they face confusion about the subject combinations they need to choose from. Here are some winning subject options that would hold you in good stead and cover maximum surface area for choosing career options:

Psychology- Sociology-Economics

A BA with this combinations will open doors in economic, social, and fields of psychology. Sociology and economics as social sciences are closely related. While economics deals with the production, consumption and distribution of wealth, sociology allows us to study these aspects in relation to the societal structures.

Job prospects

This is one of the best combinations that provides an opportunity to specialise in any one of the three main subjects. Most graduates with a bachelor’s degree in psychology who don’t go on to further study find work in fields such as business administration, sales or education.

You can also find work in the community and social services sector as counselors, mental health workers and psychiatric aides, or in criminal justice/forensic psychology as correctional and police officers, parole and probation officers, and interviewers for various criminal justice agencies. NGOs and International organizations are also seeking who have studied psychology.

You may also find work as sociology research assistants, but most of you wind up in other fields, such as social services, administration, management, or sales and marketing. An undergraduate degree in sociology might also qualify college graduates to work as case managers, child care workers or homeless/housing workers or move into education administration or teaching,.

Studying economics will equip you with a strong grasp of economic principles which will help to make more informed decision and get into the government sector, banks, accountancy, insurance companies, regulatory bodies etc.

Sociology-Political Science- Economics

This subject combination actually prepares you to become a generalist that the civil services exam requires. The other interesting fields such as journalism and mass-communication, law, management, NGOs, education, film making etc are open for further exploration. Students also get empowered enough to set up their own start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures.

Sociology offers several enticing career options due to the different specialisations that one can choose from. Research institutes, the criminal justice system, public health and welfare organisations, private businesses, law firms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions, advertising firms, survey and polling organizations are only some of the example where people from this background are required.

There are options of working in other sectors with area specialists to help function.

Being a sociologist asks for a lot of patience along with dedication to the work. Employers will look for people with good communication and research skills along with the capacity for detailed observation.

After completing bachelor’s/master’s program in political science, several opportunities are available in both government and private sectors. Politics, public administration, law, and marketing fields are always in need of good political scientists.

Political scientists can even opt for campaign management, polling and electoral politics, and university and college teaching. The career prospects in political science have widened enough in the voluntary organisations and NGOs. The international voluntary organisations, like UNO, have huge scope for proficient political scientists across the world. Besides, they can join media houses as political journalists and political researchers/analysts.

Economics is perhaps the only Arts course that requires the student to be ‘swift’ in maths. While most economists have advanced degrees (in most cases a PhD), there are many lucrative career opportunities for those choosing economics at the undergraduate level. Data analysis, banking and finance, and market analysis are some avenues open to aspirants. Some even go on to becoming stock brokers.

New Delhi, August 4

The Delhi Metro, in association with an agency, Delhi Walks, specialised in organising heritage walks, is starting an initiative from tomorrow as part of which custom-designed special ‘walks’ will be arranged in the Old Delhi areas for tourists and heritage enthusiasts, to give them a detailed view of the rich and diverse cultural and historical heritage of many landmarks, said a spokesperson of the DMRC.

The inaugural walk will be titled ‘An Empire's Tale through the Blooming Red’. As part of this pilot project, a total of eight such walks with different themes will be arranged on all weekends of the month of August. Bookings can be made by calling on the number 9899692790 or by sending an email to share@delhiwalks.in.

As part of the ‘Heritage Walk’ series, the visitors will assemble at different Metro stations of Old Delhi and then proceed for the ‘walks’ accompanied by trained guides, the spokesperson said.

He said that Delhi Metro has opened its ITO-Kashmere Gate section on May 28 this year. This section is known as heritage line. The corridor passes through various historical landmarks such as Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid and Red Fort.

On this section, efforts have been made to portray the rich culture of the area through photographs, artworks, installations etc at all the stations. A portion of the Yellow Line also passes through Old Delhi areas such as Chawri Bazar and Chandni Chowk.

In order to portray the rich culture of the city, DMRC has installed artworks, exhibitions etc at many stations across the city.

This initiative is also an attempt by DMRC to take the city’s heritage closer to the people. During the hourlong walk, visitors are led by a guide, who seemingly subconsciously repeats, ""Don't get lost"", through the trail.

Come Dariba Kalan (market famous for jewellery) and Kinari Bazaar, one realises why each lane gets narrower and busier.

""Shah Jahan built this city because he wanted a bigger and better place than Agra, where he built the famous Taj Mahal. But, then it was inhabited by people from Agra, who came here and started living in the same way they used to!"" said the Delhi Walks explorer."
The Tribune: Life+Style,"Ever wondered about the life of vendors, who are often scorned at various traffic light-points in tricity? Meet a few of them…

Manpriya Singh

Just as the red light begins the countdown starting from 120 seconds, a little boy approaches with heart-shaped balloons. Roll up the car windows, get busy with your smart phone or wait for the lights to go green. After all, it’s a disturbing sight. Either scoot or shoo them away. “Sab hamain bhagate hain, police waale ya phir gaadi wale,” 18- year-old Bagarah, who originally hails from Rajasthan hates the rootless existence. It’s been a couple of years of selling various knick-knacks at different light points ;from Sector 35 lights to Phase 7 lights Mohali.

Like he said, “Sab hamain bhagate rehte hain.” So what is he selling these days? “Main balloons bechta hoon,’ he points to a pump and to unaired balloons lying in a packet. “Abhi phulaye nahin hai.” Err…How does he know they are balloons and not gubaare? “Aapke jaise log kehtein hain, Oh Balloons toh hamain pata hai inko balloons kehte hain.”

Is it disguised begging?

Just refer to it as disguised begging and pat comes the reply. “Bheekh maangne se toh acha hai,” declares Shankar Prasad, who sells all seasonal things from Santa caps to Tri-colour at the Mani Majra traffic lights. Currently he is trying to sell car shades.

But wouldn’t it be better if they instead tried finding a job indoors instead of selling in the middle of road on a crazy hot afternoon.

“Gulaami ya naukri karne se toh acha hai,” retorts 20 something Sami Akhtar, who hails from Bihar has been selling all car-related accessories at various traffic lights in the city since 2012. So how many does he end up selling in a day? “500 -700 kama hi lete hain.” For two to three hours spent at traffic lights, it might appear as a decent enough sum; perhaps lucrative too! However, it’s not easy finding what things will click with buyers. Sami goes all the way to Delhi, to Azadpur market, to procure things that he feels will sell like hot cakes to customers stopping at traffic lights.

Toys anyone?

It isn’t easy getting them to talk, let alone come forth with details. Or answers to questions that have often intrigued all of us while stopping at the lights. The promise of a sale is not sure to act as an ice-breaker. “Yeh na ho ke police waale aake bhagade,” 24- year-old Kabir is justified in his apprehensions. After all by selling coconut slices at Sector 29 light point, he supports as many as 10 people back home. It’s been two to three years and he makes about 500 rupees on a good day!

Lakshmi is quite an ironic name for a teenage girl who admits to not making enough by selling balloons at light points. But who buys these balloons — girls or children? “Ladkiyan zyaada leti hain,” she smiles, hinting towards those accompanied by boyfriends. Little wonder, by selling just about 20 ballons a day, there is not enough for even two square meals. Then what they do? Joining her is Pooja, who also hails from Rajasthan. “Then we pluck whatever berries and fruits we can get from trees,” she points to a jamun tree above. As for their outfits, “These also we got from Rajasthan.”

Sister, please buy it

Perhaps, one of the first things that comes to your mind when you find a ten or 11-year-old selling tissue paper boxes at Sector 35 lights is…err…why isn’t he in school? While that’s quite an obvious story of all the children being forced into child labour in India, we move on to something less abstract…when is his birthday? “Hamara birthday nahin hota,” reluctantly shares Sanjay, who hails from Rajasthan, on being promised at least one sale. Well, where do the boxes come from? “We get them from Ram Darbar.” Ok so how many does he manage selling?

“Today is my first day…I came a month ago from Rajasthan. And I haven’t sold any since morning and it is afternoon.” Wouldn’t some smart marketing lines help? “Main kehta hun, didi le lo.” He adds, “I have been told that I should try and sell these to girls especially the younger ones.” The little one has got his target audience in place. It’s time to leave him with the next round of lights. Life, lights or traffic…they just go on.

NASA's Curiosity rover marks 5 years of Mars exploration,"Washington

NASA's Curiosity rover that found evidence that ancient Mars had the right conditions to support microbial life has marked five years of exploring the red planet.

Curiosity, which landed near Mount Sharp five years ago, is examining clues on that mountain about long-ago lakes on Mars.

On August 5, 2012, the mission team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, exalted at radio confirmation and first images from Curiosity after the rover's touchdown using a new ""sky crane"" landing method.

Transmissions at the speed of light took nearly 14 minutes to travel from Mars to Earth, which that day were about 248 million kilometres apart, NASA said.

Those first images included a view of Mount Sharp. The mission accomplished its main goal in less than a year, before reaching the mountain.

It determined that an ancient lake environment on this part of Mars offered the conditions needed for life — fresh water, other key chemical ingredients and an energy source.

On Mount Sharp since 2014, Curiosity has examined environments where both water and wind have left their marks.

Having studied more than 600 vertical feet of rock with signs of lakes and later groundwater, Curiosity's international science team concluded that habitable conditions lasted for at least millions of years.

With higher destinations ahead, Curiosity will continue exploring how this habitable world changed through time, NASA said. PTI"

Chandigarh, August 4

Twenty students of Government Model School, Mani Majra, were rushed to hospital after suffering from ""common side effects"" of the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine.

A majority of the children complained of rashes, fever and stomach ache while some complained of vomiting and nausea.

According to officials of the UT Heath Department, 19,706 children were vaccinated in over 70 schools in the city. The students were vaccinated in the afternoon following which many complained of stomach ache, some developed rashes while others were down with fever.

Official sources said 16 students were admitted to the Civil Hospital in Mani Majra while three were rushed to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16.

However, all children were sent back home after treatment. Anxious parents complained that the Health Department should have issued an advisory regarding the possible side effects of the MR vaccine. Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director, Health Services, UT, said there was no need to panic as side effects such as fever and rashes could occur in some cases following the vaccination. “Three children were rushed to the GMSH, Sector 16. I do not have the details of the children admitted to the Mani Majra hospital. However, all students were discharged in the evening,” said Dr Kashyap. He said the vaccine was of high quality and had been approved by the WHO.

Subhash, whose daughter studies in Class IV at Government Model School, Mani Majra, said, “My daughter was administered the vaccine in the afternoon. After sometime, she complained of fever and suffocation. Soon, some more students showed similar symptoms. Without wasting time, I, along with the school staff, took the ailing children to hospital. Soon, more children with similar problems arrived at the hospital.”

Suraj Kumar, father of another student who was taken ill, said there was chaos inside the hospital. Two students were accommodated on a bed. However, by evening, all children were fine.”

Common side effects

'Injection spot' reactions (pain, redness, swelling or a lump), fever, rash, headache, dizziness, joint or muscle pain, nausea and vomiting.

Badnore opened drive

UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had inaugurated the measles-rubella campaign on Thursday. Badnore highlighted the importance of the vaccine in the elimination of measles and control of rubella. He appealed to all children to take this vaccine and pass this message to their friends and neighbours as well. As many as 3.10 lakh children in the city will be covered under the MR vaccination drive. Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director, Health Services, UT, said all children from nine months to 15 years of age would be vaccinated."
Migrants will not get welfare for first five years: Trump,"Washington, August 5

Days after announcing his support to a merit-based immigration system, President Donald Trump has said that migrants will not get welfare in the first five years after they arrive in the US.

""You cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country. You can't just come in, like in past weeks, years and decades--you come in, immediately start picking up welfare,"" Trump said in his weekly web and radio address to the nation.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""For five years, you have to say you will not be asking -- or using our welfare systems. As I said in my address to Congress, the time for dreaming big, bold and daring things for our country has begun,"" the US President said.

Trump said early this week that he announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based green card system that ends the abuse of welfare system, stops chain migration and protects American workers and economy.

According to the US President, the country is moving in the right direction.

""This week, the DOW Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high; never ever has it been so high. In May, the unemployment rate hit a 16-year low. And last quarter, real GDP growth increased to 2.6 per cent,"" he said.

""Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we're putting America workers and families first. The American Dream has always been about doing what we love and doing it for the people we love,"" he added.

For too long, he rued, the dreams of many Americans have been put out of reach by Washington.

""Washington funded one global project after another, while allowing other countries to drain our jobs and drain the wealth of the United States of America. Then, Washington taxed and regulated our own workers and industries, taking away their ability to earn a living,"" he said.

But those days are over, Trump said.

""My administration is working tirelessly on behalf of the American people. We have removed regulations and targeted unfair trade practices that are hurting Americans all over the world. We're ending the war on coal and unleashing American energy. We're introducing a tax plan to grow our economy and create more jobs,"" Trump said. —PTI"
Ode to a legend,"A visit to the Rafi museum is like a pilgrimage for the singer’s fans. A tribute to Mohammad Rafi, whose death anniversary falls tomorrow

Rajendra Rajan

Standing in front of the Rafi Mansion in Bandra, Mumbai, I could not resist the temptation of having a glimpse of the small private museum dedicated to Mohammad Rafi. Memories of this legendary singer, whose music continues to mesmerise even after 37 years of his bidding adieu to this world, are still afresh at the small museum housed in the mansion. As I stepped into the museum, I found myself amid a repository of pictures, posters, golden records, LPs, musical instruments, trophies and numerous other mementoes displayed in a small room. Thousands of 78 RPM and 45 RPM records have been stacked, along the walls of the room. It is quite a challenge to maintain and keep intact thousands of LP and EMI records after a long span of seven decades. Dust has gathered on the torn covers of some LP records. The Padma Shri, he was honoured with, has been kept in a glass case carefully. A number of trophies and mementoes awarded to Rafi during his lifetime for the films which had scored silver, golden or platinum jubilee tags can be found here. The records from films like Taj Mahal, Khilona, Mughal-e- Azam, Pyaasa, Professor, Amar Akbar Anthony, Brahmachari, Uran Khatola, etc. here took me to the golden era of melodies. Parvez Ahmed, youngest son-in-law of Rafi who takes care of the museum, was an unassuming person. He was happy to narrate incidents from the legendary singer’s life. “Rafiji was not fussy about the amount of fee paid to him for the recordings. Whatever was given to him, he accepted with humility. He sang many songs for which he had charged only one rupee. Nissar Wasmi was one such music director. Many struggling film producers would plead with him to get their songs recorded for free. He would happily oblige. At the age of 16 in 1941, Rafi recorded his first song “Soniye ne heerye nee” for Punjabi film Gul Baloch in Lahore. His first song for Hindi film Gaon Ki Gori was recorded in 1944 in Bombay. Lyrics were “Ai dil ho kabu mein”. His last song “Tu kahin aas paas hai dost… phir bhi ye dil udaas hai dost” for Aas Paas was recorded on July 26, 1980. Some rare black and white photographs of Mohammad Rafi have been displayed at the museum. There’s also a large pencil sketch of Rafi donated by one his fans. The old black and white landline telephone and his personal favourite, a small Sharp Radio, have been preserved. A table with glass on it from where Rafi would send his autographed pictures to his fans by post has also been preserved. His crockery, pictures, tanpura, harmonium, etc. have been huddled in a little space. Indeed the precious heritage of Rafi needs more space for preservation. Will the government or millions of Rafi fans ever set up a museum in Mumbai where all his memories could be preserved for posterity?"

The GST Bill underwent a long gestation period, having been first initiated in 2000 by the Vajpayee government. In 2006, the then Finance Minister P. Chidambram announced in his Budget speech that the target date for implementation of the GST Bill would be April 1, 2010, and formed an empowered committee of State Finance Ministers to design the roadmap. However, it was not until May 2015 that the Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha. The Bill was eventually passed by the Rajya Sabha on August 3, 2016, after ratification by the states, received assent from President Pranab Mukherjee on September 8, 2016.

Finally on July 1, 2017 the GST Bill formally came into effect.

Eliminates tax redundancies

The major highlight of the Bill is that it eliminates tax redundancies; a manufacturer pays tax only to the extent of his value addition, not on the whole cost of the good sold, as the raw material supplier would have already paid tax on his goods. Similar tax incidence is applicable on all stages of the supply chain, each paying tax on the extent of value added by them.

In effect, GST eliminates unaccounted for goods in all stages of the value chain. Now this begs a question, why is there so much of hue and cry surrounding the GST and its implementation?

A big positive

Largely the fears are around the uncertainty surrounding how things will work with new procedures and compliances and the impact it would have on sales. All these apprehensions are short-term in nature, over the longer term it is structurally a big positive.

Teething issues

To my mind the fears that consumption will get adversely impacted are inaccurate. Having said that, yes there will be some short-term teething issues as we align to the new framework, and there would be specific impact to certain sectors. Some segments will get impacted for a shorter period of time and probably some industries would change from the longer term viewpoint, but that is the idea behind this reform.

Balanced tax slabs

The other fear that people have is that the new tax regime might end up becoming inflationary. In this regard, I feel the government has been cognisant of this while framing the multiple tax slabs, which have evolved after numerous iterations and criticisms; and are very balanced. However, there will be things which will be cheaper and those which will get dearer; but on an aggregate basis I don’t expect a widespread inflationary impact, especially in lieu of the fact that the government has signalled its seriousness in enforcing the anti-profiteering clause, if the need arises.

Efficient, better market place

I would like to take you down memory lane when we migrated from the outcry system to online trading and when we moved from physical settlement to dematerialisation settlement. There were a lot of worries around job losses, cost increase, volumes going down. In hindsight, the results are evident. These shifts have created a much larger, efficient and better market place. Certainly, there were impediments at first, and things were uneasy till we got used to it, and eventually it led to structurally smoother, safer and more efficient systems.

Transparency

From the customer point of view, GST ushers in a lot of transparency, and also brings down the aggregate price of goods and services. This is primarily because of the cascading impact of taxes and tax redundancies, whereby the end consumer bears the burden of the incremental taxes. Secondly, in the earlier scenario, the states had varying taxes and tax rates, under the One Nation, One Tax regime, the tax uniformity gives companies the freedom for setting warehouses and optimising transport costs, the ultimate beneficiary of which is the common man. Lastly, the GST is estimated to increase the GSP by 100-150 bps in the longer run, higher growth, implies more job opportunities and the common man shall stand to benefit from the same.

Remarkable achievement

As India gets into the process of implementing its largest taxation reform since Independence, of subsuming hundreds of different tax rates of thousands of goods and services across all its states and Union Territories into just five tax rates, one must acknowledge this remarkable achievement, against the backdrop of such a vast socio-economic and political disparity across a federal polity such as India. It is said change is inevitable, but progress is optional and GST implementation is a confluence of both.

The GST Bill underwent a long gestation period, having been first initiated in 2000 by the Vajpayee government. In 2006, the then Finance Minister P. Chidambram announced in his Budget speech that the target date for implementation of the GST Bill would be April 1, 2010, and formed an empowered committee of State Finance Ministers to design the roadmap. However, it was not until May 2015 that the Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha. The Bill was eventually passed by the Rajya Sabha on August 3, 2016, after ratification by the states, received assent from President Pranab Mukherjee on September 8, 2016. Finally on July 1, 2017 the GST Bill formally came into effect.

Eliminates tax redundancies

The major highlight of the Bill is that it eliminates tax redundancies; a manufacturer pays tax only to the extent of his value addition, not on the whole cost of the good sold, as the raw material supplier would have already paid tax on his goods. Similar tax incidence is applicable on all stages of the supply chain, each paying tax on the extent of value added by them. In effect, GST eliminates unaccounted for goods in all stages of the value chain. Now this begs a question, why is there so much of hue and cry surrounding the GST and its implementation?

A big positive

Largely the fears are around the uncertainty surrounding how things will work with new procedures and compliances and the impact it would have on sales. All these apprehensions are short-term in nature, over the longer term it is structurally a big positive.

Teething issues

To my mind the fears that consumption will get adversely impacted are inaccurate. Having said that, yes there will be some short-term teething issues as we align to the new framework, and there would be specific impact to certain sectors. Some segments will get impacted for a shorter period of time and probably some industries would change from the longer term viewpoint, but that is the idea behind this reform.

Balanced tax slabs

The other fear that people have is that the new tax regime might end up becoming inflationary. In this regard, I feel the government has been cognisant of this while framing the multiple tax slabs, which have evolved after numerous iterations and criticisms; and are very balanced. However, there will be things which will be cheaper and those which will get dearer; but on an aggregate basis I don’t expect a widespread inflationary impact, especially in lieu of the fact that the government has signalled its seriousness in enforcing the anti-profiteering clause, if the need arises.

Efficient, better market place

I would like to take you down memory lane when we migrated from the outcry system to online trading and when we moved from physical settlement to dematerialisation settlement. There were a lot of worries around job losses, cost increase, volumes going down. In hindsight, the results are evident. These shifts have created a much larger, efficient and better market place. Certainly, there were impediments at first, and things were uneasy till we got used to it, and eventually it led to structurally smoother, safer and more efficient systems.

Transparency

From the customer point of view, GST ushers in a lot of transparency, and also brings down the aggregate price of goods and services. This is primarily because of the cascading impact of taxes and tax redundancies, whereby the end consumer bears the burden of the incremental taxes. Secondly, in the earlier scenario, the states had varying taxes and tax rates, under the One Nation, One Tax regime, the tax uniformity gives companies the freedom for setting warehouses and optimising transport costs, the ultimate beneficiary of which is the common man. Lastly, the GST is estimated to increase the GSP by 100-150 bps in the longer run, higher growth, implies more job opportunities and the common man shall stand to benefit from the same.

Remarkable achievement

As India gets into the process of implementing its largest taxation reform since Independence, of subsuming hundreds of different tax rates of thousands of goods and services across all its states and Union Territories into just five tax rates, one must acknowledge this remarkable achievement, against the backdrop of such a vast socio-economic and political disparity across a federal polity such as India. It is said change is inevitable, but progress is optional and GST implementation is a confluence of both. The writer is President and CEO, Edelweiss Securities.

Maharashtra govt gives green signal to bullock cart racing,"The Maharashtra government has finally given the green signal to commence bullock cart racing in the state. According to state government sources, a notification has been issued and the sport can begin with immediate effect.The news was received with joy in different parts of rural Maharashtra where the sport is organised regularly.Reports from the interiors of the state say the first bullock races in Western Maharashtra will begin as early as Sunday.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Facing pressure from farmers’ groups, the Devendra Fadnavis government amended the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act, 1960, with effect from July 31 this year to allow the traditional sport of bullock cartracing.“We have inserted a number of conditions, including one which states that bullock cart racing should be held only with the permission of the district collector. The collector’s office will also verify whether the animal is tortured in any way. Violation of the rule will be punished with fines of Rs 5 lakh and imprisonment of three years,” an official from the rural development department said.The notification, however, has drawn the ire of animal rights activists. According to representatives of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), bullocks are naturally not meant for racing and getting them to race involves inflicting severe punishment on them, PETA India’s public policy head Nikunj Sharma said in a statement.He said the PETA is preparing to challenge afresh the clearance given to Jallikattu by the Tamil Nadu government and bullock cart racing by Maharashtra."

Is it disguised begging?

Toys anyone?

Sister, please buy it

Just as the red light begins the countdown starting from 120 seconds, a little boy approaches with heart-shaped balloons. Roll up the car windows, get busy with your smart phone or wait for the lights to go green. After all, it’s a disturbing sight. Either scoot or shoo them away. “Sab hamain bhagate hain, police waale ya phir gaadi wale,” 18- year-old Bagarah, who originally hails from Rajasthan hates the rootless existence. It’s been a couple of years of selling various knick-knacks at different light points ;from Sector 35 lights to Phase 7 lights Mohali. Like he said, “Sab hamain bhagate rehte hain.” So what is he selling these days? “Main balloons bechta hoon,’ he points to a pump and to unaired balloons lying in a packet. “Abhi phulaye nahin hai.” Err…How does he know they are balloons and not gubaare? “Aapke jaise log kehtein hain, Oh Balloons toh hamain pata hai inko balloons kehte hain.”Just refer to it as disguised begging and pat comes the reply. “Bheekh maangne se toh acha hai,” declares Shankar Prasad, who sells all seasonal things from Santa caps to Tri-colour at the Mani Majra traffic lights. Currently he is trying to sell car shades. But wouldn’t it be better if they instead tried finding a job indoors instead of selling in the middle of road on a crazy hot afternoon. “Gulaami ya naukri karne se toh acha hai,” retorts 20 something Sami Akhtar, who hails from Bihar has been selling all car-related accessories at various traffic lights in the city since 2012. So how many does he end up selling in a day? “500 -700 kama hi lete hain.” For two to three hours spent at traffic lights, it might appear as a decent enough sum; perhaps lucrative too! However, it’s not easy finding what things will click with buyers. Sami goes all the way to Delhi, to Azadpur market, to procure things that he feels will sell like hot cakes to customers stopping at traffic lights.It isn’t easy getting them to talk, let alone come forth with details. Or answers to questions that have often intrigued all of us while stopping at the lights. The promise of a sale is not sure to act as an ice-breaker. “Yeh na ho ke police waale aake bhagade,” 24- year-old Kabir is justified in his apprehensions. After all by selling coconut slices at Sector 29 light point, he supports as many as 10 people back home. It’s been two to three years and he makes about 500 rupees on a good day! Lakshmi is quite an ironic name for a teenage girl who admits to not making enough by selling balloons at light points. But who buys these balloons — girls or children? “Ladkiyan zyaada leti hain,” she smiles, hinting towards those accompanied by boyfriends. Little wonder, by selling just about 20 ballons a day, there is not enough for even two square meals. Then what they do? Joining her is Pooja, who also hails from Rajasthan. “Then we pluck whatever berries and fruits we can get from trees,” she points to a jamun tree above. As for their outfits, “These also we got from Rajasthan.”Perhaps, one of the first things that comes to your mind when you find a ten or 11-year-old selling tissue paper boxes at Sector 35 lights is…err…why isn’t he in school? While that’s quite an obvious story of all the children being forced into child labour in India, we move on to something less abstract…when is his birthday? “Hamara birthday nahin hota,” reluctantly shares Sanjay, who hails from Rajasthan, on being promised at least one sale. Well, where do the boxes come from? “We get them from Ram Darbar.” Ok so how many does he manage selling? “Today is my first day…I came a month ago from Rajasthan. And I haven’t sold any since morning and it is afternoon.” Wouldn’t some smart marketing lines help? “Main kehta hun, didi le lo.” He adds, “I have been told that I should try and sell these to girls especially the younger ones.” The little one has got his target audience in place. It’s time to leave him with the next round of lights. Life, lights or traffic…they just go on.

"Kejriwal, others adversely impacted my reputation: Jaitley","DEFAMATION CASE

New Delhi, August 5

(Follow

)

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday charged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal with making ""a series of false, scandalous and defamatory allegations"" with regard to the alleged DDCA controversy which had ""adversely impacted"" his reputation.

During a stormy proceeding in a Delhi court, the chief minister and five other AAP leaders, facing criminal defamation case lodged by the union minister, attempted in vain to get the recording of Jaitley's testimony stalled on grounds, including that Kejriwal has had to engage a senior lawyer to replace noted jurist Ram Jethmalani, who had had a bitter fallout with him recently.

Besides the Chief Minister, AAP leaders -- Ashutosh, Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay Singh, also sought adjournment on the ground that their lawyers were unwell.

Their plea was rejected by the court which went ahead with the recording the statement of Jaitely.

Referring to alleged assertions made by six AAP leaders, the veteran BJP leader said his reputation has been ""adversely impacted"" among the public due to ""a series of false, scandalous and defamatory allegations"" made by Kejriwal and others in connection with the alleged DDCA controversy.

Kejriwal and others had accused Jaitley of financial irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) of which he was the president from 2000 to 2013, leading the minister to lodge defamation cases against them.

Senior advocate Siddhatha Luthra and advocate Manoj Taneja, appearing for Jaitley, opposed the plea of Kejriwal and others seeking adjournment and said it was frivolous and part of their ""delaying tactic"".

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sumit Dass thereafter allowed Jaitley, the complainant, to record his statement, saying, ""I do not find any reason to stall the proceedings.""

While the union minister was recording his statement, Ashutosh, Singh and Vishwas opposed the proceedings, saying they felt ""handicapped"" since their advocates were not available and they lacked knowledge about the legal proceedings.

Recording of Jaitley's statements remained inconclusive and the court posted the matter for further hearing on September 25.

Meanwhile, Kejriwal was given exemption from personal appearance for the day by the court after his counsel submitted that he was busy in a meeting.

Kejriwal, Ashutosh, Singh and Vishwas, along with Raghav Chaddha and Deepak Bajpai, were on March 25 put on trial in the case.

The notice was framed against the accused under Section 500 (punishment for defamation) of the IPC to which they had pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

Jaitley had filed the complaint alleging that the accused had defamed him in a controversy regarding Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) which he headed for over a decade.

A civil defamation suit was also filed by Jaitley before the Delhi High Court in the matter seeking Rs 10 crore as damages. — PTI"
Fall of a rising star,"S Nihal Singh

BJP's double triumph in Bihar

S Nihal Singh

It is sad to see the fall of a promising leader. While the country has been astounded by the performance of Mr Nitish Kumar befitting a trapeze artiste resigning from the chief ministership of a grand coalition to become a chief minister again on the coat-tails of the Bharatiya Janata Party within the space of 24 hours, he crossed the thin dividing line between political opportunism and betrayal. Indeed, the sense of betrayal is so deep in Bihar and in the country outside of the partisan warfare being carried out by his erstwhile ally Lalu Prasad that Mr Kumar has had to offer an unconvincing explanation four days later, saying that he had no option but to do what he did. He had the obvious option of dismissing his deputy, Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav, and sort out the problems arising from it in the coalition. Now that the dust has settled on the climactic events, its consequences and Mr Kumar's calculations that led to them have become clear. Mr Kumar has handed the BJP a double triumph by returning the party to power reversing the electoral verdict of two years ago and fatally diminishing his own stature to place himself at the mercy of the BJP leadership. Looking back, Mr Kumar had been preparing his ground for the switch some time ago. First, he sided with the demonetisation decision, which was opposed by his fellow Opposition leaders; then he supported the BJP candidate for the presidency instead of the joint Opposition candidate and made a habit of absenting himself from Opposition meetings while lunching and dining with the Prime Minister. Mr Kumar's moves seemed to be predicated on the belief that he could end up as the joint Opposition candidate in the 2019 general election to fight a losing battle and court political wilderness. He said as much in predicting that the Opposition could not match Mr Modi's popularity in 2019. Thus he chose self-advancement over anything resembling a will to fight a good fight. In the process, he shocked some of his own followers in the party, in particular the veteran leader Sharad Yadav. Only his chief spokesman on television remained superbly unperturbed. Mr Kumar has been with the BJP earlier in the tolerant era of Vajpayee both at the Centre and in Bihar. Before his ambition destroyed him, he did some good work in administering Bihar. He made a string of compromises along the way. After the assembly elections, his JD (U) was the smaller party, compared to Lalu Prasad’s RJD. To become Chief Minister, he had to take two of Lalu's neophyte sons in his Cabinet, one of them as his deputy, and send a daughter to the Rajya Sabha from the coalition’s quota. As is universally known, Lalu treats politics as a family business. With time running out, Mr Kumar took the extraordinary step he did to sign up with the BJP. Mr Kumar's volte-face raises the important question of what happens to the Opposition's plans for using the Bihar model for building a grand coalition to contest the 2019 election. That model is now destroyed and there are quarrels enough for the Opposition parties to deal with. In immediate terms, it is a blow, but it is time for the Opposition to start framing a blueprint on the Sangh Parivar's weak spots. The BJP's singular weaknesses in the three years it has been in power at the Centre and longer in the states are: neglect of the farm sector leading to rising suicides and much suffering, poor funding of education and health, except for indoctrination of the young, creating an atmosphere in which cow vigilantes, genuine or fake, lynch cattle traders, on occasion to death and the absurd levels to which the propagation of a Hindu India is being taken, with cow ambulances in one BJP-ruled state while the poor carry their dead on bicycles. While the Congress and other Opposition spokesmen have raised some of these issues in Parliament, the need of the hour is to do ground work to exploit these deficiencies to build solid voting blocks. While the BJP has made the token gesture of making a Dalit the country's President, the Dalit community is still suffering every day from the depredations of Hindu vigilantes and resent the BJP's mindset in relation to their lot. Before gaining power at the Centre, the BJP with its pronounced caste prejudices was essentially an urban party. Its legacy of a Brahmin-Bania configuration came at the expense of other lower castes, as recent occurrences in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have demonstrated. Its desire to cast its net wide in view of its national ambitions is obvious. But such gestures as the presidency and other token moves such as party president Amit Shah dining in Harijan homes will not fool many Dalits. The Opposition has its own dilemmas. The hoary old Congress Party is essentially leaderless, with Mr Rahul Gandhi more a liability than an asset. Ms Mamata Banerjee is devoting all her energy to safeguarding her dominance in West Bengal from a prowling BJP. Tamil Naidu is poised at a delicate stage with the BJP fishing in troubled waters depending on the chances of a merger of the two AIADMK factions with the self-proclaimed successor to Jayalalithaa, Sasikaka, making waves while still in jail after causing the transfer of two senor IPS prison officials on the perquisites she reportedly enjoyed after paying handsome bribes. The one message the BJP and the Sangh Parivar are sending out is that they are no respecter of norms or morality to win electoral power. If they are short of votes, they manoeuvre to form governments through inducements, as in Goa and Manipur. In the case of Bihar, as we have seen, they lure the Opposition leader to their side and offer him support. In short, in common with the Trump presidency in the United States, Mr Modi believes in his form of transactional relationships to climb to power across the country. Morality can look after itself, he seems to suggest, while his party reigns supreme with the aim of converting India into a Hindu country."

US informs UN its intention to withdraw from Paris deal,"Washington, August 5

The US has submitted its formal communication to the UN indicating it will withdraw from the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement as soon as possible, the State Department has said.

The communication is in line with the decision announced by President Donald Trump recently, which was one of his key electoral promises.

But according to the terms of the pact, the US can’t fully withdraw until November 4, 2020, which would be a day after the next presidential election is held in the US. This means the next US president could still rejoin the agreement.

The Paris climate deal aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2°C since the start of the industrial age.

The State Department said that the US submitted a communication to the UN, in its capacity as a depositary for the Paris agreement, regarding the US intent to withdraw from it as soon as it is eligible to do so.

As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging with the agreement if the US can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers, it said in a statement.

The US supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security, it said.

“We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in many nationally determined contributions,” the state department said.

However, the US will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP-23) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect US interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration, it said.

“Such participation will include ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris agreement,” it added. PTI"

Dali’s surreal gift for the Maharaja,"Capt MS Kohli (retd)

With the effort of the top management of Air India, the surrealist painter Salvador Dali agreed to make a special objet d'art for the national carrier. Air India had stepped in after Independence to patronise artists and showcased their works in an enviable collection.

Capt MS Kohli (retd)

SUUREALIST master Salvador Dali, Spain's most prominent artist who died 28 years ago, hit the world Press recently when his moustache on exhumation of his body on courts' orders was found in perfect “ten-past -ten” shape as it used to be in his lifetime. Some 50 years ago, during my visit to Europe, I had discovered a union of world's two trademark moustaches Dali's and the Air India Maharaja's, which had resulted in creating a rare art piece for Air India. In 1967, as a successful Everest leader, I was invited by the French government to the International Meet of Mountaineers at Chamonix (France). I had taken an Air India flight to Geneva, from where Chamonix is about 90 minutes' drive. My excitement knew no bounds when our plane flew over Mont Blanc. A few days later while climbing Mount Blanc, I discovered the remains of a plane which had crashed on Mount Blanc in 1966, killing Homi Jehangir Bhabha — the first Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. On my return to Geneva, Nari Dastur, Air India's Regional Director Europe, invited over 1000 Swiss climbers and dignitaries to meet me at a fabulous reception. The following day, I met Nari Dastur in his office. He told me an interesting story about art collection by Air India which was making rounds in many social circles of Europe. It was based on an initiative taken by him. Nari, a legendary figure fully committed to Air India, was extremely popular throughout Europe. Nari visited Spain and approached the world-famous Surrealist artist, Salvador Dali, to design a special piece of art for Air India. Dali immediately agreed. Nari wanted to know the cost involved. Dali surprised him with his demand to get him ""A live baby elephant from India."" Nari thought he was joking, but Dali was quite serious! Big-hearted Nari struck the deal. However, Dali did not divulge what he had in mind. Air India flew a two-year-old elephant from Bangalore, accompanied by a mahout (keeper) to Geneva. The elephant, nick-named “Big Baby”, was trucked to Cadaquez (Catalunya) in Spain, where it was received by Manager Air India Spain and cleared through the customs. The mahout then presented the elephant to Dali, who took it home. There were wild celebrations in Cadaquez. The Mayor declared a three-day holiday to welcome the new arrival. The elephant was paraded for public viewing in the Plaza. Thousands of people arrived from the neighbouring towns. In honour of the elephant, there were three nights of fun, festivity, music, dance, wine and pink champagne (Dali's favorite). A new drink 'Sherpa Tea,' introduced by the Indian Tea Board, which I too was promoting at the request of the Indian Tea Board, was served to guests. It was a mixture of wine and tea chilled at the same temperature and mixed. An Indian astrologer was flown in from Mumbai to read palms and predict the future. The elephant was finally presented by Dali to the Barcelona Zoo in a ceremonial manner. Dali kept his promise to Air India. He decided to create a unique piece of art, a “double image”. The magic of Air India inspired Salvador Dali to create what is probably the most-unusual ashtray in the world. The ashtray was composed of a shell-shaped centre, with a serpent twined around its perimeter. It was supported by two surrealist headstands of an elephant on one side and a swan on the other. These supports were based on Dali's double-image effect. The master explained to Nari in his own words. “The reflection of the elephant appears to be a swan and the reflection of the swan appears to be an elephant.This is what I have done for Air India. Thus the swan upside down becomes an elephant's head inverted and elephant inverted becomes a swan.” It was the first time that an artist of Dali's stature had designed an object d'art for an airline. JRD, Bobby Kooka and Nari Dastur were delighted. This unusual piece of art was presented to art lovers and friends of Air India globally. Nari was privileged to present one piece to Prince Juan Carlos of Spain. This ashtray became one of the most- important Air India pieces of modern Indian art. After Independence, the rajahs had ceased to have the means to fund artists and the art ""market"" had not yet take off. Air India filled the gap. The national carrier not only bought paintings but also commissioned works to adorn its offices in India and abroad, to print on its calendars, posters, covers of in-flight menu cards, timetables, exclusive giveaways and other publicity material. Air India soon received international acclaim for its most fabulous art collection. Collected over six decades, from the 1950s onward, the works came from great masters of the world. Under the patronage of JRD Tata and Bobby Kooka, Jal Cawasji supervised this remarkable operation. Rajeev Lochan, Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art and an artist himself, remembers that it used to be a matter of pride to be in the Air India collection. Senior artist Paramjeet Singh remembers that Air India had picked up one of his paintings from his first group exhibition at the Jehangir Art Gallery. His wife, Arpita Singh's large canvas called “Flight”, however, finds pride of place among the 66 paintings and five sculptures chosen to be exhibited at the NGMA. Many a time, Air India did not even have to pay for the paintings. As V Thulasidas, former Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, wrote in his preface to a book published in 2008 on the collection: “Often, a work of art was added to the collection in lieu of an air ticket to the artists because, during this period, art did not really have any commercial value.” MF Husain too has spoken about this to art-historian Yashodhara Dalmia: ""They would take the paintings and give free air tickets in return. As a result, the artists could travel to Czechoslovakia, Hong Kong, Paris. I did about four or five trips.” In 2012, when the fear of Air India going bankrupt brought the art collection valued at hundreds of crores into the limelight, the national carrier began to give thought to what to do with it. In March 2013, around 15 paintings of B Prabha, the leading woman artist of the 1950s and 1960s, travelled to Paris as part of an exhibition to commemorate the International Women's Day. The same year, for the first time, Air India's iconic collection of artworks by Indian masters MF Husain, SH Raza, B Prabha and Anjolie Ela Menon, among others, housed in its various offices across the country were brought together at an exhibition, “Air India salutes Indian Masters” in the National Art Gallery, New Delhi. As the talk of the Maharaja being sold is becoming louder and louder, the government and those who are aware about India's art treasures, should make an all-out effort to retrieve these gems and build a museum.

World Para Athletics: Punjab boy runs away with gold,"Indervir Grewal

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 4

Following in the footsteps of his senior compatriots, Aamit Kumar produced one of his best performances to secure a gold for India at the World Para Athletics Junior (U-20) Championships at Nottwil, Switzerland, on Thursday. The 18-year-old from Punjab won the gold medal in the 200m T42-47 event in 23.23 seconds, which was just shy of his personal best of 23.11 seconds recorded at the 5th China Open Para Athletics Championships in Beijing in May. Aamit had won silver in China. Aamit, who hails from Mandi Gobindgarh, has been training at the Punjab Institute of Sports centre at Anandpur Sahib for three years. Aamit won the 100m, 200m and 400m gold medals at the Nationals recently, and was named the best athlete. “This is a brilliant performance. I think this is the first gold medal in sprints at the World Championships for India,” said Jagbir Singh, Aamit's coach at Anandpur Sahib. “He has been improving constantly since his Nationals performance.” Aamit, who was afflicted with polio when he was an infant, has an underdeveloped right shoulder and runs in the T46/47 classifications. He got into athletics at his school in Mandi Gobindgarh, where his father works at a warehouse. Three years ago, it was his physical education teacher who encouraged him to go for the trials for the Sports Department's wings. “It shows great mental strength to produce this sort of time at such a prestigious world event. If he keeps on performing like this, I am sure he will win medals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games next year,” the coach added. At the Nationals, Aamit had beaten three-time Asian Games medallist Sandeep Singh, but his understated celebration after such a feat showed his level-headedness. Sandeep has won three Asian Para Games silver medals, one in the 200m and two in the 400m, which is also Aamit's favourite event. Aamit will also participate in the 400m race in Nottwil. “The 400m race is on Saturday. Aamit messaged me after the gold medal. His confidence is very high. I am confident of another medal, if not a gold, tomorrow,” Jagbir added."

To give a boost to the real estate sector, the Punjab Cabinet, which met here today, gave its nod to rationalising collector rates and reducing stamp duty on registration of property to 6 per cent (from 9 per cent) till March 31, 2018. The government, in its Budget last month, had announced a cut in the stamp duty. Finance Minister Manpreet Badal called it an important step to revive the realty sector.For a property worth Rs 2 crore, a 3 per cent cut in stamp duty would mean a saving of Rs 6 lakh. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh directed the Revenue Department to place a formal proposal on reducing the circle/collectorate rates before the Cabinet when it meets next. The Cabinet discussed at length the sluggish sale/purchase of residential and commercial property, which is affecting revenue collections. The cut in stamp duty is expected to push up sale and purchase. The Council of Ministers also decided to put off the proposed 10 per cent increase in Change of Land Use (CLU) charges, External Development Charges (EDC) and licence fee (LF) till March 31, 2020, for all real estate projects. A new policy for granting approval to unauthorised marriage palaces and for building new ones was approved too, replacing the one framed by the earlier dispensation, regularising all such palaces raised before November 16, 2012.

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today intervened in support of his key functionary, Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar, whose appointment has been challenged in the High Court. Kumar had refused to attend office for almost two days, amid a turf war between officials in the CM’s office and Capt Amarinder’s advisers supported by two bureaucrats. Kumar is learnt to have met the CM late in the afternoon. Capt Amarinder is said to have assured him that the matter would be resolved. Subsequently, Kumar attended the Cabinet meeting this evening. The old guard among the ministers, too, is learnt to have rallied round Kumar and snubbed the advisers. Two ministers — Brahm Mohindra and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa — are said to have played a role in persuading Kumar to resume work. Yesterday, Kumar had written to the CM, saying that he would not attend office till the case was decided and the onus of defending his appointment was on the government. Bureaucrats led by Kumar (a retired IAS officer of the 1983 batch) and the political advisers as well as MLAs of the ruling party have been at loggerheads, with the latter often going public against governance being left to the babus. Kumar and other officers in the CMO have been denying the advisers’ requests for the transfer of officials or for getting their bills — beyond the stipulated limit — cleared. The political appointees’ grouse is that bureaucrats overrule them and that they have little say in matters of governance. Sources attributed the filing of a PIL (public interest litigation) against Kumar to these advisers, who were helped by two senior IAS officers. The PIL was filed by a lawyer owing allegiance to the Akali Dal. The sources, however, said Akali leaders had denied any role in the matter. When contacted, Advocate General (AG) Atul Nanda denied that there was a tussle between the CMO officials and the AG’s office. He said he had the highest regard for Kumar and would defend the Chief Principal Secretary’s case to the best of his ability."
Last batch of 89 pilgrims leaves for Amarnath from Jammu,"Jammu, August 5

The last batch of 89 pilgrims on Saturday left for the cave shrine of Amarnath from here to join the annual yatra which entered its last phase, officials said. The shrine is located at an altitude of 3,880-metre in south Kashmir Himalayas. “All 89 pilgrims present at the Bhagwati camp left in four vehicles amid tight security arrangements around 2.45 am. They crossed the Jawahar Tunnel–the gateway to Kashmir–along the Srinagar-Jammu national highway around forenoon,” the officials said. The final batch included 15 women and 37 seers, they said. While 56 of them have preferred the traditional 42-km Pahalgam route in Anantnag district, 33 others will join the yatra through the shorter 16-km Baltal route in Ganderbal district, they said. The yatra entered its final phase after ‘Chhari Mubarak’ (the holy mace of Lord Shiva), being carried by a group of seers, including its custodian Mahant Deepindra Giri, joined the yatra at Pahalgam on Thursday. After special prayers and other rituals, the saffron- obed holy mace was taken to Chandanwari on Friday and will reach the holy cave for final prayers on August 7 after night halts en route to Sheshnag and Panjtarni, marking the conclusion of the 40-day yatra on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. The yatra which began on June 29 from the twin routes recorded a footfall of 2,58,414 pilgrims who paid obeisance at the naturally formed ice-shivlingam till Friday evening. PTI"
Rwanda leader Kagame wins 3rd term in vote he called ‘a formality’,"Kigali, August 5



Rwanda’s longtime President Paul Kagame has won a third term in office in what he had called “a formality.”

Electoral authorities overnight said Kagame has won more than 98 per cent of the vote with 80 per cent of the votes counted so far, with no major change expected when final results are announced today. He had faced two challengers.

Kagame has already addressed jubilant supporters at party headquarters and urged Rwandans, including those who hadn’t supported him, to work together.

Kagame has led the East African nation of 12 million people since the end of its genocide in 1994 in which more than 800,000 people died.

The 59-year-old president has been praised for the country’s economic growth, but human rights groups accuse his government of using state powers to silence opponents. Rwandan authorities deny it.

A constitutional amendment in 2015 allows Kagame to stay in power until 2034 if he pursues it.

Kagame was running against Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda the only permitted opposition party and independent candidate Philippe Mpayimana. Three potential candidates were disqualified for allegedly failing to fulfil requirements including collecting enough signatures.

With 80 per cent of the votes counted, Mpayimana had received just 0.72 per cent and conceded defeat and congratulated Kagame. Habineza received 0.45 per cent.

Candidates had been barred from putting campaign posters in most public places, including schools and hospitals. The electoral commission vetted candidates’ campaign messages, warning that their social media accounts could be blocked otherwise.

More than 80 per cent of Rwanda’s 6.9 million registered voters cast their ballots, according to Charles Munyaneza, executive secretary of the Rwanda Electoral Commission. — AP"
"Submit proposal on Fastway’s tax dues, Capt tells Navjot","Rajmeet Singh

Chandigarh, August 4

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today told Local Bodies Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu to come up with a proposal on the recovery of alleged tax dues to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore from Fastway Transmission Private Limited. Sidhu tried to bring the matter as an agenda item during the Cabinet meeting, but it was not included. However, the CM gave him a hearing. Sidhu stated at the meeting that he had been misquoted by the media on being advised to “go slow” in the tax “evasion” case. Sources said he was asked not to speak to the media on the issue. Later, Sidhu told the media, “I have been asked to submit a proposal so that we can bring an ordinance to conduct an audit of the cable company. By levying a nominal tax, we will be able to have access to their income details and subscriber base.” Sidhu had recently asked the Chief Minister’s office to take a call on the recovery of tax dues."

Paris, August 2

Today, August 2, is Earth Overshoot Day. The day humanity exhausts its allowance of planetary resources such as water, soil, and clean air for all of 2017, as per environmental groups.

Earth Overshoot Day has arrived on August 2 this year, a day earlier than in 2016, according to environmental groups WWF and Global Footprint Network.

It means humanity will be living on ""credit"" for the rest of the year.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""By August 2, 2017, we will have used more from Nature than our planet can renew in the whole year,"" the groups had said in an earlier statement.

“This means that in seven months, we emitted more carbon that the oceans and forests can absorb in a year, we caught more fish, felled more trees, harvested more, and consumed more water than the Earth was able to produce in the same period.”

The equivalent of 1.7 planets would be required to produce enough to meet humanity's needs at current consumption rates.

Calculated since 1986, the grim milestone has arrived earlier each year.

In 1993, it fell on October 21, in 2003 on September 22, and in 2015 on August 13.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and gas make up 60 per cent of mankind's ecological ""footprint"" on the planet, said the groups.

There was some good news. While coming earlier every year, the advance of Earth Overshoot Day has slowed down, said the statement.

Individuals can contribute to stopping, and eventually reversing, the trend by eating less meat, burning less fuel, and cut back on food waste, said the report. — AFP"

"Ludhiana court grants bail to Rakhi Sawant, but asks her to surrender on August 7","Ludhiana, August 5

A court here on Saturday granted anticipatory bail to actress Rakhi Sawant but ordered her to surrender before it on August 7 in a case related to ""objectionable"" remarks by her against Valmiki, the author of the epic Ramayana.

Granting her anticipatory bail, Sessions Judge Gururbir Singh directed her to surrender before the court of Judicial Magistrate Vishav Gupta on August 7.

The judicial magistrate's court had cancelled the bail of the actress after she failed to appear before it on July 7 despite directions.

While granting her bail on July 6, Judicial Magistrate Vishav Gupta had directed her to attend the hearing on July 7.

Local advocate Narinder Adiya had filed the complaint against Sawant on July 9 last year, claiming her comments — allegedly made on a private television channel — had hurt the sentiments of the Valmiki community.

The actress had tendered ""an unconditional apology"" to the Valmiki community after its members voiced outrage over her alleged remarks. PTI"
"The Tribune, Amritsar news","Tribune News Service

Amritsar, August 4

The Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) has won the legal battle for its chunk of land opposite Red Cross Bhawan at Ranjit Avenue. The AIT fought a long legal battle to get back its land worth Rs 200 crore.

According to information, the AIT had notified the Ranjit Avenue Scheme on January 21, 1972, and had acquired the land in August 1973. Around 9,500 square-yard chunk of land was under the ownership of Brahm Boota Akhara, a religious sect. The AIT gave Rs 2.05 crore to the akahara as compensation for the acquisition of land. But the AIT failed to get the possession of the land as the akhara had given the land on lease for 99 years to five different persons. They declined to give up their possession of the land. The tenants have tried to get a stay order from the court.

The case has gone through several phases. The lease-holders further signed the power of attorney to a private firm. The firm reportedly managed to get a Change of Land Use (CLU) certificate with the involvement of AIT officials. A major controversy erupted when the private firm managed to get the CLU.

However, the local court gave the verdict in the favour of the AIT, but the Trust did not take any action against any of the officials or employees for their involvement in forgery.

The land is located on a prime area of the city and the land mafia was keen to grab the chunk. The private firm had passed the plan for the construction of a Mall by submitting invalid registered papers and the CLU.

Meanwhile, AIT officials are happy after getting the possession of the land worth Rs 200 crore. Sandip Singh, law officer of the AIT, stated that a long battle had been fought to get the land, so everyone had been celebrating the moment."

Sikh referee calls for unity after facing racial abuse online,"Singapore, August 4

A 33-year-old Singaporean Sikh referee has called for unity within the football community after he was subjected to racial abuse on social media following a match here. Sukhbir Singh had reportedly made some controversial decisions while officiating last Saturday’s International Champions Cup (ICC) match at the National Stadium in Singapore, where Inter Milan beat Chelsea 2-1. Singh awarded a penalty to Inter after striker Stevan Jovetic was brought down by Chelsea full-back Cesar Azpilicueta, and the second was disallowing a late equaliser by Blues forward Michy Batshuayi. Fifa match agent Baljit Rihal tagged Kick It Out who said that it had “received reports from the public on the racist abuse on social media aimed towards Singaporean Sikh referee during Chelsea’s friendly against Inter Milan”. Some netizens took to Twitter to criticise Singh’s decisions and commented on his ethnicity. “I wouldn’t say I’m affected by it because I haven’t read the tweets, but that doesn’t mean I condone racism. It’s (racism in football) something that definitely needs to be looked into. There should not be any bias towards anyone’s race,” Singh was quoted as saying by The Strait Times. Singh has called for unity within the football community and said everyone should be allowed to believe in what they believe in freely and participate in what they want to participate in, especially when it comes to sports. Sport is supposed to unite people and not divide us, he said. The anti-discrimination bureau ‘Kick It Out’ is investigating the incident, a move praised by Singh. He added that he had not experienced any racial abuse while refereeing locally, and has “not come under any circumstances where a report was needed”. PTI"
For the Punjab that doesn’t read,"One woman is on a mission to push Punjabi children towards books. How far can she go?

Sarika Sharma

Gurmeet Kaur is not being rude but says Punjabi kids have no love for books. She is saying this after her weeks of travel through the state.

“Phones and television have taken over their lives,” jumps in her six-year-old daughter Liv Kaur. The little one, who is on her first visit to India from the US and has a Polish father, surprises one with her chaste Punjabi. Dressed in a salwar-suit and carrying a duppatta, she floors you with her ease with the language. You gush when she stresses on the ‘correct pronunciation’ of pippal and hints at the lack of it here in Punjab schools.

For Gurmeet, a software architect-turned-writer and publisher of Punjabi books, this trip is an attempt at acquainting Liv with her culture. But she is also here for inculcating reading habit among Punjabi children, or at least try doing that. During the visit, she visited a number of private and public schools. By the end of it, as she sits talking to us, she has some observations to make: One, government schools in Punjab are better off when it comes to children knowing their mother tongue. Second, private school kids have no language of their own. “The latter, I feel, are the most unfortunate. In school, they are told to speak in English, an acquired language. In the society, they communicate in Hindi, which is not their mother tongue. Sadly, Punjabi is encouraged neither at school, nor at home. A friend calls them bezubaan peedhi, the generation without a voice. And this is so true. When they are not connected to a language, their minds are shut and their imagination is limited,” she says.

With the government school students, she noticed that kids who were twice Liv’s age mixed up muharni and thus pronunciation. “And they couldn’t identify a tippi from a bindi,” she says. But she is also glad that the trip shattered her perception about government schools in Punjab. She says the kids were sharp. “They could read and enjoy the books I brought along with me.”

For the general lack of love for books, she blames the “lack of reading culture” amid the Punjabi community. “The only way to inculcate that culture is to start with children. They are today bombarded with electronic media; their attention span to reading has diminished considerably. The children’s literature in Punjabi not only has to compete with literature in other dominant languages a child is surrounded by, but also with the electronic entertainment that they have free access to.

This “lack of reading” culture is also a challenge in the distribution of the books, she points. “Punjabis prefer to spend money on clothing, jewellery and media, but not on books. I believe in old fashion bonding with a child, with a book, in a quiet time; so that the books become their friends for a lifetime. That is why I published my content strictly in the form of books.”

Back home, she volunteers her time to teach Punjabi to the children of the Punjabi diaspora . Her four-year-old Punjabi Immersion School has 23 students learning the language from her on the weekends where she uses poetry, songs and stories to teach. And she believes in practising what she preaches. Her son, Angad, who graduated from Columbia University, New York, studied Punjab school board books till fourth grade. She wants Liv to finish till class XII.

Before Gurmeet came here, she also wanted to see if there was a market for her books in Shahmukhi. But looks like Punjab has a long way to go. It needs to first love its mother tongue.

Stories for her daughter

Gurmeet Kaur says her daughter has become a brand ambassador for her books on this trip. She has been telling people how the stories are in Punjabi but transliterated in Hindi and have a glossary at the end for those who “don’t understand something”. Liv, was in fact, who sent this software engineer on the path of publication. She was expecting her when, at the baby shower, her friends gifted her English books. Her husband was, meanwhile, building his own library of Polish books for her. “These books were out of the world but they didn’t speak to my soul. My eyes kept searching for the ones that were missing from the collection. Not one of the books I received was in my Ma-Boli, Punjabi,” she says. She set out to first find books for her and, on finding none, started publishing them. The challenges ranged from finding the right story to the right illustrator, retelling them both in Punjabi and English. But the most difficult part was publishing, marketing and sales. “I like to create. Business is not my forte. I had to self-publish these books because my standards are high thus raising the cost of the project. No publisher wanted to deal with an unknown experiment at the time. But the response from readers has kept me going.”"
Chinese tourists arrested after Hitler salutes in Germany,"BERLIN, Aug 5

German police on Saturday arrested two Chinese tourists for making illegal ""Heil Hitler"" salutes in front of the historic Reichstag building that houses the German parliament.

Berlin police officers say they detained the two men, aged 36 and 49, after they were seen striking the Nazi-era pose and photographing each other with their mobile phones.

They face charges for ""using symbols of illegal organisations"", the police said in a statement, and were released after posting bail of 500 euros each.

Germany has strict laws on hate speech and symbols linked to Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled between 1933 and 1945.

The Reichstag is a powerful symbol in Germany. It was destroyed by fire in 1933 by an arsonist thought to have been paid by the Nazis, who then blamed the blaze on the Communists and used it as an excuse to severely restrict civil liberties. Reuters"
"NIA custody of Geelani’s kin, 3 others extended by 10 days","New Delhi, August 4

Terror trail

A special court extended the custody of Geelani’s son-in-law Altaf Ahmed Shah and three other separatists Peer Saifullah, Mehrajuddin Kalwal and Nayeem Khan

The NIA had sought 12 days of custody, saying that the accused were required to be confronted with evidences gathered in the case

The agency had arrested seven persons on July 24 in the case of alleged funding of terror and subversive activities in the Kashmir valley to fuel unrest

A special court today allowed the NIA to continue with the custodial interrogation of Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s son-in-law Altaf Ahmed Shah and three others for 10 more days in a terror funding case. The other three separatists whose custody has been extended are Peer Saifullah, Mehrajuddin Kalwal and Nayeem Khan. The NIA had sought 12 days of custody, saying that the accused were required to be confronted with each other and with the evidences gathered in the case. The agency had arrested seven persons on July 24 in the case of the alleged funding of terror and subversive activities in the Kashmir valley to fuel unrest. The other three separatist leaders — Shahid-ul-Islam, Farooq Ahmed Dar and Mohamad Akbar Khanday — were sent to judicial custody till September 1 after the NIA told Special Judge OP Saini that they were not required for further interrogation. Senior advocate Siddhartha Luthra, appearing for the probe agency, said Altaf Ahmed Shah, popularly known as Altaf Fantoosh, and three others were required to be taken to distant places in the Valley in connection with the probe. A lawyer associated with the case said that during the in-chamber proceedings, the NIA also requested the court to put its remand application in a sealed cover as it contained sensitive information, which was allowed by the court till the next date of hearing. The agency had earlier told the court that it had received information that Hafiz Saeed, head of Jamat-ul-Dawah, and separatists, including members of the Hurriyat Conference, had been acting in connivance with banned outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Dukhtaran-e-Millat and others to raise and receive funds from inside and abroad through illegal channels, including hawala. The money was being raised to fund separatist and terror activities in restive J&K, it had said, alleging that the accused were waging a war against the country and they were involved in various offences punishable under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The accused were involved in creating unrest by way of anti-India demonstrations and bandhs, which were done on their and others’ instructions. Advocate Rajat Kumar, appearing for the accused persons, however, had claimed that they were falsely implicated and they had been cooperating in the probe which had been going on for the past one month. Fantoosh was in the custody of J&K Police, which had put him under preventive detention immediately after Eid last month. Geelani’s close aides Tehreek-e-Hurriyat spokesman Akbar and Peer Saifullah were arrested by the NIA from the Valley. Shahid-ul-Islam is the spokesman for the moderate Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. The houses of those arrested had been raided by NIA sleuths last month. The raids were part of the NIA’s efforts to clamp down on separatist groups for allegedly receiving funds for subversive activities in the Valley. — PTI"
Ayodhya cross-appeals: Justice Dipak Misra to head three-judge Bench,"Top court to take up Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid case at 2 pm on August 11

New Delhi, August 5

Justice Dipak Misra — who is all set to succeed Justice JS Khehar as the next Chief Justice of India later this month — will head the three-judge Bench that would hear the Ramjanmbhoomi-Babri Masjid case on August 11.

According to the cause list issued by the top court’s Registry, the other two judges on the Special Bench are justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer,

Almost seven years after the Allahabad High Court’s order dividing the 2.7-acre disputed land at the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site equally between Ram Lalla, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Wakf Board, the Supreme Court will take up cross-appeals filed by various parties on August 11.

Appeals against the September 30, 2010, verdict of the Allahabad High would be heard at 2 pm on Friday, a circular issued by the top court said.

The listing of the vexed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid problem case almost two weeks after Chief Justice of India JS Khehar assured senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy that the appeals would be take up soon.

“We are going to list the main matter soon. We will take a decision on it,” a bench headed by CJI Khehar had on July 21 told Swamy after he mentioned the matter for urgent listing.

Swamy — an intervener in the case — had said the appeals were pending for the last seven years and they needed to be heard urgently. He had said his petition for enforcement of his right to worship without much hassle at the makeshift temple, too, was pending. He had demanded expeditious disposal of all these cases.

Hindus believe that Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya thousands of years ago. During Mughal emperor Babar’s rule, a mosque was constructed at the place in 1528 after destroying the temples existing there.

The RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, and BJP have been running a campaign for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.

On December 6, 1992, kar sevaks of right wing Hindu organisations demolished the disputed structure. Many BJP leaders, including LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, face criminal charges in connection with the demolition.

But the civil dispute over 2.7 acres is a separate one that has been on since 1961 when the Sunni Wakf Board took the matter to court.

Swamy told the Bench that the Centre had in an affidavit filed in 1994 said that it would hand over the disputed land for construction of temple if it was proved that the Babri Masjid was built on a pre-existing temple. He said it had been proved by the Archeological Survey of India and the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court had accepted it. He had suggested that the mosque could be constructed across the Saryu.

Earlier, the CJI had offered to play a mediator to solve the contentious issue if parties agreed to it, saying a negotiated settlement of the Ayodhya dispute was a better option. But the parties to the dispute could not agree to the suggestion."
Timeless appeal of Cordoba,"Intolerance goes against the grain of people of Cordoba. This Spanish city has survived savage bigotry and cultural revolution with grace

Hugh and Colleen Gantzer

Nostalgia brought the trees to Spain. Thirteen centuries ago, North African people had captured this Iberian country. Yearning for the desert ambiance of their homeland, they had planted date palms wherever they could. They had even developed an architectural style around the curved, drooping, feathery fronds of these graceful trees. Date palms still shade the avenues and gardens of Cordoba and provided welcoming relief as we started to discover this beautiful and historic city. The “Moors”, as these North Africans have been called, were Muslims and they transformed Cordoba into the largest and most cultured city in Europe in the 10th century. For most of their long reign, they also exhibited a great deal of religious tolerance. Judaism had thrived under many of their caliphs. We walked through the Jewish Quarter, La Juderia, to one of the three medieval synagogues remaining in Spain. It’s a cool and beautiful monument to a once-thriving community. Hebrew inscriptions cover the white, stucco, walls of the prayer hall and there is a balcony looking down into it: presumably it was meant to sequester the women in the congregation. Sadly, it is no longer a living place of worship because the Spanish Jews, the Sephardic people, were expelled by the later, intolerant, rulers of Cordoba. Outside the synagogue in Cordoba, however, there is a statue to the 12th century scholar, philosopher and physician, Maimonides. The smiling people of Cordoba assured us that intolerance goes against their grain. “We are very easy going. We like gardens, flowers, delicate jewellery, meeting friends at roadside cafes: gentle things like that. Even in the short while you are here, you will sense it.” We did. We strolled down the narrow streets of the Calleja de las Flores. Flowers cascaded out of planters hung on whitewashed walls. We peeped through beautiful wrought-iron gates into courtyards cool with fountains and foliage. Once again we sensed the persistence of the town’s Islamic heritage. Such inward-looking houses, with open courtyards not only provided ventilation but also ensured the privacy of the women of the family. We walked out of this flower-decked passage, down the narrow lanes into broader streets, through wide plazas. Groups sat at tables in open air, under bright umbrellas, conversing as animatedly as starlings. There is a relaxed, outdoorsy ambience about this southern part of Spain: almost as if it was an ebullient Oriental civilisation that had, somehow, become grafted on to the Occident. This made an impact on us dramatically when we entered the great cathedral, still referred to locally as La Mezquita, the mosque. The Moors bought half the church and, for a while, both Christians and Muslims shared the shrine. Then, to cater to the growing Islamic population, the ruler, Abd ar-Rahman, bought the other half in 784, paying the Christians well and allowing them to build other churches in the town. St Vincent’s Church was torn down and, slowly, a great mosque grew on its old, Germanic, Visigoth foundations, and beyond. It was a slow and painstaking process. Four successive rulers oversaw the construction of the mosque, and its expansion. Eventually, after more than 200 years of sporadic work, it eventually covered an area of more than 24,000 sq m. Then, in 1236, the Christian king, Ferdinand III, conquered Cordoba. But it was only 200 years later that the church, which had been converted into a great mosque, was reconverted into a great cathedral. The result is a structure of overwhelming grandeur… a soaring blend of Moorish, Renaissance and Spanish Baroque… virtually defying description. But you don’t have to be a student of architecture to appreciate the towering magnificence of the building. The first impact is that of a forest of columns and arches in stripes of pink and beige. The overall impression is that of entering a dense and stylised grove of palms: and this, in all likelihood, is what they were intended to convey. Over and above this, are the rich embellishments of Christian architectural styles seen in the great cathedrals of Europe. Cordoba has survived savage bigotry and a great cultural revolution with sustained grace. The tough but flexible palm is, clearly, its most timeless and meaningful icon."

Annoyed over accumulation of rainwater in Sirki Bazaar, demand meeting with MC Commissioner

Bathinda, August 4

High drama prevailed at the office of the Municipal Corporation Bathinda this afternoon when residents and traders of Sirki Bazaar staged a protest outside the MCB building.

Annoyed over rainwater still accumulated in Sirki Bazaar, the protesters locked the MCB officials and workers inside the building for almost an hour and a half.

Senior deputy mayor Tarsem Goyal, deputy mayor Gurinderpal Kaur Mangat and several councillors were also locked inside the building.

Seeing the main gate locked and a crowd of protesters outside, residents who had come to the MCB office to get their work done returned.

The officers then informed MCB Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal about the protest, who in turn directed the senior officials to intervene and pacify the protesters.

Not the ones to bow down easily, the protesters remained adamant on meeting the Commissioner to discuss their demands.

After persuading, the protesters relented and unlocked the gate but only after they were promised that the Commissioner would hold a meeting with them to find a solution to the problem of waterlogging.

The protesters threatened that in case the promise was not fulfilled, they would intensify their stir.

Leading the protesters, Congress leader Harjinder Singh Sidhu alleged that the MCB officials were indulging in corrupt practices.

“The MCB has become an epitome of corruption in the city. The MCB officials are least concerned about the issues that the city residents are facing. They are more inclined towards planning projects through which they can mint money,” he said.

The protesters alleged that every year the MCB claims that it is prepared to tackle waterlogging during the monsoon season but even five minutes of heavy rain is enough to deflate them.

“For the past five decades, we have been facing the problem of waterlogging, which is increasing with every passing year as the population of the city is increasing. The city area is expanding, in turn putting extreme pressure on the sewerage system,” said protesters.

They added that monsoon meant problems and loss of business since the customers didn’t come to Sirki Bazaar during these days."
"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","LONDON: Scientists have revealed the source of human heartbeat in unprecedented detail, an advance that may help surgeons repair hearts without damaging precious tissue.

London

Scientists have revealed the source of human heartbeat in unprecedented detail, an advance that may help surgeons repair hearts without damaging precious tissue.

Researchers, including those from University of Manchester in the UK, developed a way of producing three-dimensional (3D) data to show the cardiac conduction system - the special cells that enable our hearts to beat.

The 3D data makes it much easier to understand the complex relationships between the cardiac conduction system and the rest of the heart,"" said Jonathan Jarvis from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.

Soaking post-mortem samples in a solution of iodine means soft tissue such as the heart can absorb X-rays and become visible, researchers said.

With modern X ray scanners, scientists can make detailed 3D images. In the best images, they can even see the boundaries between single heart cells, and detect in which direction they are arranged.

Within the heart, there is a special network called the cardiac conduction system that generates and distributes a wave of electrical activity stimulating the heart muscle to contract, researchers said.

This system makes sure that the various parts of the heart contract regularly and in a coordinated way, a bit like a team of rowers in a boat race.

If the system is damaged, and one part of the heart contracts out of time with the rest, then the heart does not pump so efficiently, they said.

The new data gives a much more accurate framework than previously available for computer models of the heartbeat and should improve the ability to make sense of troublesome heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation that affects 1.4 million people in the UK, researchers said.

The data reveals exactly where the cardiac conduction system is in a normal heart. For example, it shows just how close it runs to the aortic valve.

""We also use the data to make 3D printed models that are really useful in our discussions with heart doctors, other researchers and patients with heart problems,"" Jarvis said.

New strategies to repair or replace the aortic valve must therefore make sure that they do not damage or compress this precious tissue, researchers said.

""In future work we will be able to see where the cardiac conduction system runs in hearts that have not formed properly. This will help the surgeons who repair such hearts to design operations that have the least risk of damaging the cardiac conduction system,"" Jarvis said.

The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports. PTI"
Electing next Vice-President,"A political office with constitutional obligations

Votes will be cast today for electing a new Vice-President of India. The contest is between M Venkaiah Naidu of the BJP and other NDA allies, and Gopalkrishna Gandhi, sponsored by the Congress and its allies. Members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha constitute the elite electoral college. The contest is unequal in terms of merit but the outcome is known in terms of numbers. Mr. Naidu should romp home comfortably, but, as Mr Gandhi argues, a contest is necessary and a very essential part of democracy. The Vice-Presidential job is a constitutional office; but the most substantive part of the Vice-President's job is his role as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. It is in this role that a Vice-President gets tested and, judged. The Rajya Sabha is a rule-based institution and it is the responsibility of the Chairman to summon the requisite neutrality and fair-mindedness; it is for the Chairman to protect the Rajya Sabha’s autonomy and voice. In this context, Gopal Gandhi offers sobriety, reflection and even-handedness; Venkaiah Naidu has been around for a while and is not unfamiliar with the parliamentary landscape. But he is an intensely BJP man. The last time a BJP man adorned that office was during the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat tenure. Shekhawat was a tall leader in his own right and thought of himself as an equal peer to the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani. Naidu lacks that stature; perhaps he lacks the desire to be equal to or taller than the Prime Minister. The election for the new Vice-President is taking place in the larger context of deepening polarisation. And, this polarisation is much more than political; it is being seen by the two contestants and their quarterbacks as a larger battle of ideas and visions. Gopal Gandhi speaks of growing intolerance and bigotry and warns against “a new Partition” being sown in our minds. Naidu is, unsurprisingly, at ease with the ruling establishment and its political prejudices and preferences. The predicted outcome, though, will not settle decisively the outcome of this battle of ideas."

Paris, August 2

Today, August 2, is Earth Overshoot Day. The day humanity exhausts its allowance of planetary resources such as water, soil, and clean air for all of 2017, as per environmental groups.

Earth Overshoot Day has arrived on August 2 this year, a day earlier than in 2016, according to environmental groups WWF and Global Footprint Network.

It means humanity will be living on ""credit"" for the rest of the year.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""By August 2, 2017, we will have used more from Nature than our planet can renew in the whole year,"" the groups had said in an earlier statement.

“This means that in seven months, we emitted more carbon that the oceans and forests can absorb in a year, we caught more fish, felled more trees, harvested more, and consumed more water than the Earth was able to produce in the same period.”

The equivalent of 1.7 planets would be required to produce enough to meet humanity's needs at current consumption rates.

Calculated since 1986, the grim milestone has arrived earlier each year.

In 1993, it fell on October 21, in 2003 on September 22, and in 2015 on August 13.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and gas make up 60 per cent of mankind's ecological ""footprint"" on the planet, said the groups.

There was some good news. While coming earlier every year, the advance of Earth Overshoot Day has slowed down, said the statement.

Individuals can contribute to stopping, and eventually reversing, the trend by eating less meat, burning less fuel, and cut back on food waste, said the report. — AFP"
The Tribune: Movie Reviews,"Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering. So much so even the delectable song Hawayein written by Irshad Kaamil and composed by Pritam gets lost and can’t hold love in the air."

Decoded: What caused Neanderthals to die out,"London

Early modern humans and Neanderthals shared a similar diet — consisting mainly of mammoth and plants — and also competed for food, which led to their downfall, new research has claimed.

""According to our results, Neanderthals and the early modern humans were in direct competition in regard to their diet as well -- and it appears that the Neanderthals drew the short straw in this contest,"" said Dorothee Drucker, biogeologist from the University of Tubingen in Germany.

The first representatives of Homo sapiens colonised Europe around 43,000 years ago, replacing the Neanderthals there approximately 3,000 years later.

""Many studies examine the question of what led to this displacement — one hypothesis postulates that the diet of the anatomically modern humans was more diverse and flexible and often included fish,"" added Herve Bocherens from the University of Tubingen.

Previous research suggested that early modern humans had a more varied diet than the Neanderthals. They fished for their food, did hunting and gathering across the plains.

However, the new study showed that our ancestors rarely ate fish but preferred a diet very similar to that of the Neanderthals.

Importantly, the proportion of plants in the diet of the anatomically modern humans was significantly higher than in Neanderthals — mammoths, on the other hand, appeared to have been one of the primary sources of meat in both species.

The findings showed that just like the Neanderthals, early modern humans or our ancestors had mainly mammoth and plants on their plates, creating a battle for food that Neanderthals lost, the researchers said.

For the study, appearing in the journal Scientific Reports, the team researched on the dietary habits of early modern man on the basis of the oldest known fossils from the Buran Kaya caves on the Crimean Peninsula in the Ukraine.

They measured the percentage of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in the bones of the early humans and the locally present potential prey animals such as Saiga, horse and deer.

""The results revealed a very high proportion of the nitrogen isotope 15N in early modern humans, which originate but primarily from the consumption of mammoths,"" Bocherens noted. — IANS"

The Municipal Corporation (MC) has started fogging as a preventive measure for dengue and chikungunya in city areas. It was started on August 1 and will continue for coming months.

The corporation will cover the whole city in the next two weeks. It has 11 vehicle-mounted fogging machines in addition to newly purchased 30 small shouder-mounted machines which can easily be taken to small and congested areas of the city.

The old city has small streets where old vehicle-mounted machines can’t move. The newly purchased small fogging machines can now easily access the areas. The Health Department had started meetings with all municipal corporations for preparation for the seasonal diseases in the month of April.

On the directions of the Commissioner of the civic body, Dr Basant Garg, the health and sanitation department had started anti-larva drive two months ago.

For this exercise, the mapping was done for the last two years to see the number of cases in a particular area in a ward. The anti-larva activity has been completed in more than 25 wards which will be completed during the first week of September.

More than 200 people were challaned where larva was found and also residents were made aware of dengue and chikugunya. The maximum cases were from wards 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, Basti areas, industrial areas, PAP and some parts of the periphery of the city. The chief sanitary inspectors and sanitary inspectors are looking after the whole drive."
"Khrushchev blasted Mao for 1959 border skirmish with India, says report","Beijing, August 5

(Follow

; and

)

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev squarely blamed China's Mao Zedong for the border skirmish in 1959 with India and the subsequent escape of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, absolving then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of any blame, a media report said today.

According to a transcript of a stormy meeting between Khrushchev and Mao published by Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, the Soviet leader bluntly told the then chairman of China's ruling Communist Party that he was responsible for the situation in Tibet and the tension with India.

The acrimonious meeting towards the end of September that year - a little over a month after the skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops - reportedly forced the Soviet leader cut short his visit to Beijing.

The Post attributed the Cold War International History Project of Wilson Centre as the source of the transcript.

The meeting began with Khrushchev telling Mao: ""You have had good relations with India for many years. Suddenly, here is a bloody incident, as a result of which Nehru found himself in a very difficult position.""

""If you let me, I will tell you what a guest should not say: the events in Tibet are your fault. You ruled in Tibet you should have had your intelligence [agencies] there and should have known about the plans and intentions of the Dalai Lama,"" Khrushchev told Mao.

Mao shot back: ""Nehru also says that the events in Tibet [were] our fault. Besides, in the Soviet Union they published a TASS declaration on the issue of conflict with India [supporting India].""

He was referring to a report in the Russian state-run news agency TASS, urging India and China to reach a negotiated settlement.

Khrushchev also told Mao that he was ""outraged"" by the Chinese calling the Soviet Union ""time-servers"".

""Take back your accusations; otherwise we spoil relations between our parties. We are your friends and speak the truth.

We never acted as time-servers with regard to anybody... If you consider us time-servers, comrade Chen Yi, then do not offer me your hand. I will not accept it,"" Khrushchev told Mao and other Chinese leaders who attended the meeting.

After that visit, relations between China and then Soviet Union appeared to deteriorate leading to Beijing warming up to the US. PTI"

Mohali, August 4

A 24-year-old migrant was electrocuted while four others sustained burn injuries at the Chandigarh International Airport at Mohali here this morning. The incident occurred around 10 am when Shankar Sahu from Chhattisgarh, along with his colleagues Harishanker (19), Manoj (25), Ved Parkash (25) and Sobhran (21), was dragging a 25-foot-high aluminium ladder from the cargo area to the airport terminal when it came in contact with a 22-foot-high overhead 11kV high-tension wire. All victims, hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, were hired on daily wages by a contractor for some ongoing work at the airport. According to eyewitnesses, all of them fell unconscious after receiving the electric shock. They were rushed to Fortis Hospital at Mohali in an ambulance of the hospital, which is usually stationed outside the airport for emergency purposes. Shankar Sahu was declared brought dead at the hospital. “We started the treatment of the other victims immediately and now their condition is stable,” said one of the doctors. Later, the victims were shifted to the Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32, Chandigarh. Harishankar is the brother of the deceased, Sahu. Ved Parkash said all of them were busy chatting while dragging the ladder from the cargo area to the airport terminal area for setting up a canopy at the entrance to the airport. “The ladder was foldable and we had removed its upper parts before dragging it. Nobody noticed the overhead electricity wire. All of sudden, I got a shock and found myself lying on the hospital bed,” said Ved Parkash. The victims sustained burn injuries on their hands and arms. Fazal Ahmad, supervisor of the contractor, along with their advocate, Jatin Arora, reached the hospital. “We will bear all expenses on the treatment of the victims and will also provide them all kind of help,” said Arora. Inspector HS Ball, SHO, said kin of Sahu and the other victims had been informed about the incident. “Let them come and record their statements; after that we will initiate our legal process,” said the Inspector.Timely help and presence of mind shown by some workers at the airport played a crucial role in saving the lives of the other victims. The workers, including Mukesh, Pawan Kumar, Rajvir and Chandan Singh Rajput, said they used chairs and bamboo sticks to separate the victims from the ladder. “All of them had fallen unconscious. We rubbed their hands and feet and pumped their chest before the ambulance reached around 20 minutes after the incident,” claimed the workers. “Had the ambulance come earlier, the deceased could have been saved,” they said. However, the hospital authorities said, “A doctor from Fortis Hospital, stationed at the airport for medical assistance, received a call from the CISF control room at 10.27 am and immediately responded. In order to save time, he took the Fortis ambulance along with him and arrived at the scene in less than five minutes. The patients were admitted in the Emergency at Fortis Hospital at 10.40 am”."

Cook had made 46 from 103 deliveries and the celebrations from the South African fielders emphasised the value of his wicket. Seamer Kagiso Rabada bowled with energy and accuracy and he too had cause to celebrate when he removed Westley, for 29, with de Kock producing a superb diving catch.

It gives the history of the draft Bill from the earliest times to date, it gives a list of the classes of officials and non-officials whose opinions have been asked for, and it informs the public that ""it is incorrect to suppose that Government has made up its mind in regard to the necessity for legislation,"" and that ""should it be decided to proceed with the project, further opportunities will be given for criticism at a later stage."" This information is useful so far as it goes. But one thing material the communiqué does not appear to give, or at all events it does not do so in a convincing manner, and that is the need for action at the present juncture. We are not concerned at the present day what the conditions were in 1910 that led to the drafting of a Bill that was the parent of the present one."

Shimla, August 4

Virbhadra loyalist MLAs from politically significant Kangra district targeted Transport Minister GS Bali at the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting yesterday for interfering in their Assembly segments. The meeting, held in the presence of AICC general secretary Sushil Kumar Shinde and secretary Ranjeet Ranjan here, saw the Virbhadra camp targeting Bali and HP Congress Committee president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu as part of their strategy. A majority of the legislators, including Sanjay Rattan, Jagjivan Pal, Neeraj Bharti and Yadvinder Goma hit out at Bali for interfering in their constituencies and projecting leaders against them. Incidentally, Pawan Kajal, Independent MLA from Kangra and now associate Congress member, also lodged a protest that Bali was interfering in his segment and not taking him into confidence. The importance of Kangra was at full play as the MLAs also demanded that Virbhadra should be projected as the face of the party and the elections be fought under his leadership. Legislators, including Rakesh Kalia from Una and Bamber Thakur from Bilaspur, vociferously made a demand to project a single face, considering Virbhadra’s popularity and wide mass base. Some leaders, including AICC secretary Asha Kumari, objected to the manner in which a section of the party leaders, including HPCC chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, were targeting Virbhadra. Some of his supporters also raised the issue of talk of some party MLAs deserting the party and being in touch with the BJP. Bali, who kept his calm all this while, finally retaliated and threatened to leave the meeting but was persuaded by others not to do so."
Rise to the challenge,"Building parameters catering to the needs of physically challenged and the elderly are key to inclusive habitations in the urban space

Aniel Kuumar Saha

A number of city development authorities in India launch group housing residential schemes for citizens from time to time. But it is ironical that the configuration and design of apartments on offer under these schemes are not sensitive to the needs of the physically challenged and the elderly. Even privately built residences have this lacuna. As per the census of 2011, India’s total disabled population is around 2.2 per cent (more than 2.5 crore persons). Considering the 1.25 billion population in the country, the number of disabled is significantly higher. There are also more elderly in our society. But as a result of the complete disregard for their specific needs, a large number of these people live in dwelling spaces which are not equipped enough for them. And disability being of different kinds and categories, the amount of problems for the physically challenged is very different. Actually, in most of our cities the very basic need — housing and mobility - remains a challenge for them.

While India has already passed the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill- 2016, the condition of living and standards followed for the disabled and the elderly remains abysmal in the country.

So what is the solution? The solution lies in promoting the development and construction of disabled-friendly apartments and transportation corridors and mobility across our cities. Keeping these things in mind, architects and designers have to become an important part of the design as well as the construction process. A number of design elements that can make life easy for the physically challenged and the elderly can be incorporated in the apartments.

Some such elements can be:

The common passage should have side bars on the walls to hold and walk; all staircases on the premises should be low rise and not very steep.

Easy signage and Braille signage should be a must for the benefit of the hearing and visually impaired, respectively

The steps on the staircases should be wide enough for someone who has problem in walking. For completely disabled, there should be provision of a separate lift or a separate ramp should be there.

Within apartments, too, there are certain modifications required. These can be:

Every apartment entrance and exit door has to be wide enough to make the entry of a wheel chair easy.

Rooms should have wide doors and at least one washroom/toilet has to be spacious enough to accomodate a wheel chair.

Water fittings should be installed at a lower level. The bathroom should also be accessible with grab bars around the toilet, tub and shower.

Light switches and thermostats have to be easy to reach. Kitchen counters should also be low enough to use effectively.

Within mass housing developments, particular units can be customised for the buyer with a disability or for families having a member suffering from a physical handicap.

The Model Building Bylaws 2016 (Chapter 8), IS Code 4963, CPWD guidelines for Barrier-Free environment give a very detailed design and planning guidelines to provide a barrier-free environment for disabled and elderly people. Thus for actual implementation and enforcement, there is a need for a strong business and political will. And the intent should be greater than mere profiteering.

— The writer is CMD, SAHA Groupe

What does the law say?

Section 45 of the notified Act requires all public buildings to be made accessible within five years of the notification of rules. However, the revised National Building Code of India should incorporate elements of a universal design to bring down barriers for the disabled.

The Act is a revised and modified version of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1996. Both aimed at creating a barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities and the elderly. Both the Acts have also mentioned about features for residential premise."
