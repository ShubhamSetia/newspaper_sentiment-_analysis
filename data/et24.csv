Charge that Narayana Murthy forced CEO Vishal Sikka to resign is a lie,"By Vallabh Bhanshali

Walk away I did, but it did not mean a walk over/

Targets hiding behind the non-target/

I prefer speaking to Keeping quiet /

When will my countrymen learn to speak up

*******

These are the words that came to mind when I imagined what it must be to be in Mr Narayana Murthy‚Äôs shoes‚Ä¶

Omkar, I walked away. Not once. That cannot mean a walk over, allowing a walk over what was built painstakingly.

I spoke up and kept speaking up, not because I am a founder or that along with my wonderful colleagues a part of large block of voting power. I spoke up because if I noticed something remiss as a shareholder it had to be pointed out for everyone‚Äôs good. Those who take criticism and respond positively benefit immensely whereas a critic has little to gain. On the contrary, he is prone to be judged cantankerous as I have been. Worse, in both a tragic and comic manner, my motives have been questioned and I am being dictated to walk away!

All the same I must speak up. I must choose my words and target thoughtfully. One should be fair and open to admission of a mistake in doing so. These are some of the principles that I keep in mind and that also went into communication and governance policy at Infosys. In a way these were some of the pillars that held Infosys aloft.

It is obvious that the corporate governance code at Infosys wasn‚Äôt built in a day. Building it required thought, imagination and belief in fairness. The rules of governance were made as a matter of faith in them and not for instant benefits or cover ups. They were built around one simple realization, viz. when multiple constituencies are involved winning and sustaining their trust was paramount and that was possible only by transparency and exercising acute diligence.

It also required that we subjected ourselves to greater questioning, in the immediate term losing business secrets and other limitations. These restrictions did not deter us from writing in the first annual report after we became a public company that ‚Äò we will always be transparent and we think transparency is a competitive advantage‚Äô. Not many people understood the implication of what we said. Over time we were proven right as reflected in the growing confidence of customers, employees and shareholders.

We kept adding layers to transparency. We added the practice of giving half yearly results, quarterly results, audited results, interim balance sheet and so on much before it became law to do so. All based on the same principle that let others judge us based on data and not on certification, self or paid ones.

We did not stop there. We thought even if Indian companies did not practice it or the regulation did not require it, we thought it appropriate to give guidance so that a small investor or broker who did not have the wherewithal to do deep analysis could invest or divest based on it. Of course, our guidance had to be credible, more so in terms of downside protection.

When Sarbanes Oxley code was introduced in the US demanding that the listed companies come clean and a window of period was provided for the same we would become the first company to file ‚ÄòNo change in disclosure‚Äô statement. It was a proud moment for us and for India.

A lot of these facts are well known or are a part of Infosys legend but I felt compelled to mention by way of background to what I have to say.

I must expose the mis-statements made in utterly poor taste in the context of Vishal Sikka‚Äôs resignation as CEO of Infosys.

I thought it was patent that constant comments and questioning of governance based on public data or on a whistleblower‚Äôs report,

were targeted at the Board or its leadership. These questions cannot be targeted at the CEO. They were always targeted at the Board and or its leadership. The CEO has to be enterprising and in that process, can make a mistake. It is and was the Board‚Äôs job to keep him both motivated and discreet. The Board has to lay and enforce its guidelines in a dynamic manner.

Thomas Jefferson said in the context of democracy ‚Äòthat it is only when the government is afraid of the people and not the other way around that Democracy can be said to be successful‚Äô. The words could not fit better to a board managed company. The CEO must be bold but not so bold that he dictates the board and lays the rules of governance. It is the board that should not let that happen.

Unfortunately, this is what seems to have happened at Infosys. Amongst numerous examples of this let me take just one.

In 2016 the CEO announced goals for 2020, rather abruptly, which were ambitious by all accounts and naturally, had to be abandoned. It is strange that the while the Board has raised a finger at my motives it completely failed to question the motive or the meat of that abrupt move. What lay along that garden path and where was it leading to, should have been the most natural questions. It didn‚Äôt need great professional skepticism but the Board simply let that happen. In retrospect, everyone can see why was that announced made and what lay along that path. Equally facile and naive was the Board‚Äôs announcement of abandonment of those goals! Slightest questioning would have avoided the great embarrassment to the company, a company that met or came close to its guidance for a number of years. When track record of this kind was being trampled on, at least to the discerning, it became clear that grave weaknesses were being institutionalized.

Infosys came back from crises in 2001 and 2008 strongly because there was a sense of trust and fairness in warp and weft of the company and the crisis galvanized them into both unity and strength. Companies with weak governance and unfair practices find it difficult to survive crisis. A dam that cannot hold a flood back is a bigger curse than the flood itself. Its test lies only when a flood arises.

If I could clearly see that eventuality I had a choice to keep quiet. I could persuade myself that I had walked out voluntarily and I should treat Infosys as a closed chapter bearing its progress and distress with equanimity. It was easy but that is not me. I knew I could be misunderstood as wanting to come back or impose my nominee as the CEO. What a travesty! Someone who walked out no sooner a CEO was found with billions of dollars in the company would not do so to come back at the drop of a hat! I am old, have my own tragedies but sane enough.

I have pondered on the accusations being made against me for forcing Vishal to resign. It is a lie. It is the Board, rather its leadership that did it. The Board failed to enforce good practices and went around seeking endorsement from paid agencies instead of dealing in data and letting the world judge for itself. That is all that I demanded. It was the Infosys practice and at least some of the current directors have been party to such situations and disclosures. But that was not to be. Its attempts to strengthen itself ended in a ludicrous situation of having multiple people holding posts with the suffix chairman!

The need for a large company to have a strong CEO is unquestioned. But good governance, the fountainhead of a company, and a workforce motivated and comforted by a pervasive sense of fairness are even more important. If the board governance improves I have no doubt that the deep-rooted culture and competence of Infosys will restore its glory.

The public reactions are not lost on me. They anguish me. Not because the market capitalization has gone down. It is not the affronts to me. It is much worse. It is the deep-rooted culture of bearing what is not right, particularly in India, that is the sore point. Democracy, a company or for that matter any relationship can become and remain strong only when people have the courage to speak up. Speak up in a fair and persistent manner. Those who prefer to suffer losses than speak up are destined to do so.

At my age, I don‚Äôt know how long I will be able to speak up. My misfortune that I will die without seeing Indians having learned to speak up. Financial fortunes vanish like the privy purses of the kings when you don‚Äôt have the wherewithal to protest and protest in time.

I have restrained myself in my statement by stating the obvious to but that may have been lost to the less clued in. Lost in the din of falling share price and the statements by those hiding behind Vishal who portrayed himself to be my victim. He was never my target.

Fashion Diaries: Here‚Äôs Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one‚Äôs fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone‚Äôs going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it‚Äôs a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

OPPO F3

Well, selfies come handy not just to change display pictures, but when we need to check our pretty faces anywhere, anytime. And if on some days, if we look a bit too extra cute, why not click a selfie and save it too, right? And if you use a Selfie Expert phone, your picture is bound to look even prettier. If you want more, nowadays they even have a beauty mode btw!

And when friends are around, the selfie-game gets even better!

OPPO F3

Because when we are with our favourites, we are always in our happy and cheerful spirits which totally reflects on our pictures too. With a wide-angle group selfie, we can even get a full-length selfie to compare each other's style quotient!

One last word: Our phone's style quotient speaks a lot about our fashion diaries.

Pinterest

That‚Äôs why, nowadays people focus not just on the colour of the phone, but even on extra-accessories for it such as phone cases, bedazzlements or extra-customizations. Recently, even Bollywood style-icon Deepika Padukone had customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as the #F3DeepikaEdition.

OPPO F3

She had designed her own icon with OPPO, which has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded along, at the back of the phone and it pretty much signifies her personality, isn‚Äôt it? The special Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera ‚Äì one for Selfie, one for group selfie, a 16 MP selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

So, dear style-divas if you are planning on buying a new phone, go for a Rose Gold OPPO F3, it‚Äôs pretty much going to be your new personal stylist!"
5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. üåº A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy üë¶üíï A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It‚Äôs time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibeüí§ A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you‚Äôre a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you‚Äôre not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime üíï A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."
"renewable energy production: Karnataka at 3rd spot in renewable energy production, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Bengaluru: Karnataka has overtaken Gujarat to become the third highest producer of renewable energy after Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.The state, which occupied the fourth position last year, has outranked Gujarat in the recently released progress report of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy Energy minister D K Shivakumar said in a tweet: ""At 7,458MW, Karnataka now has the 3rd highest installed capacity in renewable energy. We will soon surpass Maharashtra to become 2nd in India."" The neighbouring Tamil Nadu is on top with 10,625 MW.G V Balaram, MD of Karnataka Renewable Energy Devlopment, said with the development of Asia's biggest solar park at Pavagada in Tumakuru district, they were confident of clinching the number one spot by April 2018. Farmers have voluntarily contributed over 12,000 acres for the project, which is estimated to cost Rs 20,000 crore.What led to the paradigm shift? ""The third rank among 29 states follows a marked shift in policy. Strong government support coupled with an attractive renewable energy policy has propelled Karnataka to the third place,"" Balaram said.He said the turnaround was possible because of increased targets fixed by Union ministry of renewable energy at 175 GW (gigawatts) by 2022. The Karnataka government revised its policy twice and set an ambitious target of solar energy generation at 6,000MW by March 2022 while the state's solar power potential is estimated to be above 24,700 MW.""Wind and solar energy have received good response, and the state has added 3,200 MW from renewable energy sources in the past four years. This year, we will add 3,000MW from solar power alone,"" he added.At present, he said Karnataka is the only state to provide such a lucrative proposition for solar power adoption. The state government acts as a major facilitator to bridge the energy demand and supply gap and supply power to the grid. Solar energy is getting cheaper by the year and in some time, it would be cheaper than the electricity grid,"" Balaram added""The favourable policy has also enabled large corporates to buy significant proportion of their power from solar farms at a discount to supply to grids under long-term contracts with solar developers,"" said Mahesh Raviraj, an executive associated with a reputable solar company.The Karnataka government is also working with farmers to lease their land for solar and wind power generation and make them stakeholders in the energy future. When it comes to cogeneration (use of power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time) and biomass generation, Karnataka is growing faster than other states."

"BP's Africa partner Kosmos reports positive gas drill test results, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Oil and gas producer Kosmos Energy , which along with oil major BP Plc plans to produce gas off Mauritania coast, said a test drill showed that a key field would produce about 60 million cubic feet of gas per day.

Kosmos, which was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market on Tuesday, claimed the well is capable of producing about 200 million cubic feet per day once fully operational.

The company had in 2015 discovered a gas pool in the Tortue 1 exploration well, part of the Greater Tortue Complex spanning Senegal and Mauritania, contained more than 15 trillion cubic feet of gas.

Last year, BP acquired working interest in Kosmos' exploration blocks in Mauritania and Senegal, including the Tortue field.

Oil majors including BP and Total are investing in the waters of Senegal and Mauritania, boosted by recent drilling successes and relatively low costs.

Kosmos holds a 28 percent interest in Tortue, BP 62 percent, and Mauritania's state-run oil company Societe Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures et de Patrimoine Minier the rest."
"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let‚Äôs start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‚Äòcheck‚Äô and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. ‚ÄúThe children have just finished singing the national anthem‚Ä¶but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.‚Äù What a telling moment! Doesn‚Äôt that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, ‚ÄúOverall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.‚Äù

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‚Äògolis‚Äô and ‚Äògaalis‚Äô reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‚Äòacche din‚Äô will finally arrive ‚Äî if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he‚Äôd gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India‚Äôs room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the ‚Äúsense of unease among Muslims‚Äù, and referred to ‚Äúa sense of insecurity creeping in‚Äù. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull‚Äôs eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn‚Äôt make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari‚Äôs interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India‚Äôs respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to ‚Äúfollow your basic ideology and instinct.‚Äù If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a ‚Äúmannerless‚Äù man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‚Äòreshape‚Äô his Independence Day speech. That word ‚Äòreshape‚Äô is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‚Äòreshape‚Äô a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered ‚Äî perhaps at gunpoint ‚Äî to ‚Äòreshape‚Äô our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‚Äòreshaped‚Äô. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister‚Äôs speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today‚Äôs India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister‚Äôs below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let‚Äôs see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, ‚ÄúI have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.‚Äù

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what‚Äôs going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‚Äòsmall war‚Äô with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."
Placebo As Real Remedy,"Your attitude, lifestyle, mental balance and emotional harmony are the best placebos, writes MUKUL SHARMA



Although mentioned in this column earlier, but to reiterate in a revised context, Norman Cousins was a distinguished editor of the Saturday Review for the better part of 40 years, author, professor, political activist and world peace advocate. During the course of his long career he won several accolades including the United Nations Peace Medal, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and Pope John XXIII‚Äôs personal medallion. In 1964, however, his life took an unimaginable turn which was to ultimately make him far more famous ‚Äî and controversial at times too ‚Äî than he could ever arguably have been otherwise. After returning from a trip to the former USSR, he fell ill and was diagnosed as suffering from a suddenonset case of the crippling connective tissue disease which is also referred to as a collagen disease. Experts at more advanced clinics confirmed this and added a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as well.He was told he had one chance in 500 to survive and given a few months to live, at that. Now Cousins who dabbled in biochemistry and behavioural medicine from time to time read and discovered that both his disease and the medicines were apparently depleting his body of vitamin C, among other things.



He decided to develop his own recovery programme. Accordingly he did three things. One, he got out of hospital against the advice of his doctors and checked himself into a hotel suite nearby; two, he started watching huge amounts of comedy films like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Candid Camera; and, three, he began taking daily megadoses of vitamin C ‚Äî way above the recommended dosages and in life-threatening proportions. But within six months he was back on his feet, and within two years he was able to return to his full-time job at the Saturday Review. He chronicled his experiences in the best-selling 1979 book Anatomy Of An Illness As Perceived By The Patient. When Cousins had a heart attack 15 years following his earlier illness,he wondered whether it would be possible to recover from two life-threatening conditions in one lifetime, but he was determined that he could. As he was brought into the hospital on a stretcher following the attack, he sat up and said, ‚ÄúGentlemen, I want you to know that you‚Äôre looking at the darnedest healing machine that‚Äôs ever been wheeled into this hospital.‚Äù Once again Cousins recovered fully and wrote The Healing Heart: Antidotes To Panic And Helplessness.



He finally died in 1990, ten years after his first heart attack, sixteen years after his collagen illness, and twenty-six years after his doctors first diagnosed heart disease. So what‚Äôs the new context we‚Äôre talking about here now? Well, since Norman Cousins‚Äôtime it has been unequivocally demonstrated by experiment after experiment that taking hefty outsized doses of vitamin C could have had no effect whatsoever on ankylosing spondylitis.And though laughter can help boost the immune system, it can‚Äôt possibly do so to such a ridiculous extent. The incredible effects had to be the result of the placebo effect where if the patient sincerely believes in the efficacy of a surreptitiously administered fake medicine ‚Äî it still works. When Cousins was later confronted by this scientific evidence, he simply said that given another similar health problem, he would do exactly the same even if he knew it was a nonfunctional medication. Turns out he wasn‚Äôt wrong. Recent research at the Harvard Medical School has shown that even when people know they‚Äôre getting a fake medication ‚Äî like being told upfront that it‚Äôs a placebo ‚Äî they get better nonetheless and actually prefer it over what physicians would normally prescribe. It seems one‚Äôs attitude, lifestyle, outlook,mental balance and emotional harmony make the best placebo of them all.Yoga teachers and Zen masters have been saying the same thing all along.¬¶"

"Pradhan meets Odisha CM Patnaik to resolve Paradip refinery tax issue, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today met Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here and discussed an ongoing tax issue between Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the nation‚Äôs largest fuel retailer, and the state government over the latter withdrawing tax incentives provided for setting up the Paradip refinery project in 2004.‚ÄúDiscussion happened in positive environment and both sides displayed the willingness to come to a mutually benefitting and agreeable solution,‚Äù Pradhan said in a tweet following the meet.The Odisha government had in February this year sent a notice to IOC stating it is withdrawing the promised 11-year tax deferment on payment of sales tax on Paradip refinery products sold in the state.The state government had originally offered the tax incentives to IOC and its then partner Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) in December 1998 to invest in setting up a refinery in the state. These investments were withdrawn in February 2000, leading to the company shelving the project.The state later restored the incentives and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IOC in February 2004 for providing a set of eight sops. The state government had reportedly withdrawn the tax incentives in ""public interest"", citing 6-year delay in commissioning of the project that was larger in capacity than originally planned 9 million tonne plant.IOC, however, pointed out the February 2004 MoU clearly allowed change in design, capacity and configuration of the project and that the Odisha government was informed about the change in capacity and the delay in construction caused by cyclone, land acquisition and law and order problems, according to a report.As per the MoU, IOC was to commission the refinery in 2009, but actually did it in November 2015 and the state government allowed IOC to avail of construction-related sops totalling Rs 550 crore all through the six years.The foundation stone of the Paradip refinery was originally laid by the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 2000."
Tiger Shroff Saves Rumoured Girlfriend Disha Patani From An Embarrassing Moment On The Ramp!,"It has, for long, been rumoured that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been dating but the couple has kept what's between them under wraps. Often they have been spotted together and the rumours thereafter spread like wildfire.

Recently, the alleged couple attended the Lakme Fashion Week together, and what happened there was rather cute that fans have been fawning over.

Just like Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani was also supposed to walk the runway but she didn't. Why, you ask? Because Tiger saved her from what could have been a major embarrassing moment.

So, before the diva walked the ramp, Tiger figured out that the stage was made up of a reflective glass, and her alleged girlfriend was wearing a short dress. Being a keen observer of thing or just being a caring boyfriend, Tiger was seen muttering something into her ears and thereafter she decided not to walk the ramp.

Isn't that cute?

Earlier as well, the alleged couples of the B-town have saved their girlfriends from such awkward moments. Remember, how once, Salman told Katrina to cover up her neck while at a press conference through Alia Bhatt.

Also, how once Singh Rajput saved Kriti Sanon from a probable wardrobe malfunction?

That's indeed cute, isn't it?

"Pneumonia: India grants Pfizer patent for blockbuster brand Prevenar 13, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: India has granted US drug giant Pfizer a patent for its blockbuster vaccine Prevenar 13 , used to protect children against life threatening pneumococcal diseases. The approval comes over a decade after the company applied for the patent in the country. Pneumonia is one of the leading cause of deaths of children under five years of age. India has seven pneumonia related deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the 2016 Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report by John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Prevenar 13 is approved to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases caused by 13 strains of streptococcus pneumonia, according to Pfizer. The vaccine provides the ‚Äúbroadest‚Äù serotype coverage of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine available in the world today, the company‚Äôs spokesperson told ET.Pfizer subsidiary Wyeth‚Äôs application for grant of Prevenar 13‚Äôs patent ‚Äúentered national phase‚Äù in October 2007, according to the Indian Patent Office‚Äôs document that granted the approval. Over the years, this patent application has been opposed by Indian vaccine maker Panacea Biotec and global medical humanitarian organisation M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF).According to those opposing the application, Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine lacked the novelty for it to be considered for a patent but the patent office, in its approval on August 11, dismissed these arguments.According to the office, Pfizer has demonstrated ‚Äúsurprising effects‚Äù that have to be considered as establishing that the vaccine is inventive.‚ÄúWe are pleased to note that the validity of the Prevenar 13 patent has now been recognized by the Indian Patent Office,‚Äù a Pfizer spokesperson told ET.‚ÄúSupported by extensive clinical research and real-world experience, each dose of PCV 13 requires 400 different raw materials, 580 manufacturing steps, 678 quality tests and two and a half years to produce‚Ä¶Pfizer remains committed towards further enhancing access of this vaccine in India, both in the market as well as through partnership with the Government to expand introduction in the public program.‚ÄùPrevenar 13 was launched in India in 2010, according to the spokesperson.The vaccine has consistently been one of Pfizer‚Äôs strongest performing brands, experiencing year-on-year growth in the ‚Äúmid double digits‚Äù and capturing 18% of the Indian vaccine market, according to Pfizer‚Äôs 2016 annual report.This March, the Indian government introduced Pfizer‚Äôs PCV 13 vaccine into its national immunisation program through a program funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Around five states (approximately 5.15 million babies) are expected to be covered in the first phase."
"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India‚Äôs freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat ‚Äì today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected ‚Äì political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians‚Äô narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department‚Äôs 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations ‚Äì which included Nathuram Godse‚Äôs Hindu Rashtra Sena ‚Äì viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn‚Äôt ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province‚Äôs chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh‚Äôs decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government‚Äôs delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police‚Äôs fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar‚Äôs participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year‚Äôs rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh‚Äôs anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, ‚ÄúOf late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation‚Äôs activities.‚Äù

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman‚Äôs query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh‚Äôs mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh‚Äôs growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had ‚Äúinfiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes‚Äù. It further stated ‚Äúthe organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.‚Äù

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government‚Äôs real intention: ‚Äúthe holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.‚Äù Subsequently, the Sangh‚Äôs training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh‚Äôs weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists‚Äô privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation‚Äôs history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."

Merger drama and fragile Tamil dreams,"Two factions of Tamil Nadu‚Äôs AIADMK party have come together, attempting to fill a J Jayalalithaa-size hole after her death earlier this year. E K Palaniswami of AIADMK (Amma), the standby incumbent, will continue as chief minister. His rival O Panneerselvam will be accommodated as deputy chief minister. It is common knowledge that the reconciliation was brokered by the BJP, in power at the Centre. The BJP believes that its role as dealmaker between the two factions of AIADMK and support to keep it in power in Chennai, will allow it to get a toehold in the southern state.

Elections for the assembly are due only in 2021. But Lok Sabha polls are due in two years, and Tamil Nadu‚Äôs 40 seats, 39 of them now held by the AIADMK, are crucial for the BJP. Its managers like Amit Shah know that an alliance with the AIADMK might enable the party to make inroads into India‚Äôs vast southern peninsula. Yet, there are two reasons why the gamble might fail to yield results. One, a third, disgruntled AIADMK faction, led by TTV Dhinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaa‚Äôs aide Sasikala, claims the support of 20 elected lawmakers. Sasikala is behind bars on a case related to disproportionate assets. If Dhinakaran withdraws his lawmakers and sides with the main opposition party DMK, the incumbent government could fall.

Two, even if this does not happen, the BJP is firmly identified as a north-Indian outfit by Tamil voters. For decades now, the latter have consistently voted for Dravidian parties, relegating even the once-powerful Congress to the margins of electoral politics. The BJP cannot be faulted for its attempts to break new ground. But the tremendous uncertainty that has gripped Tamil and AIADMK politics casts a long shadow over administrative stability and governance."
"Pharma sector funds continue to bleed. Is it time to quit?, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The pharma sector funds have been bleeding for more than a year now. The category returned -14.53 per cent in one year, -3.91 per cent in three months and -9.59 per cent in one month. Many investors are anxious about their investment in pharma funds and what future holds for these investments.Sonam Udasi, fund manager, Tata India Pharma & HealthCare Fund, believes the pharma sector does not look attractive in the near term but he believes the sector would surely bounce back in the long run. ‚ÄúA sector goes through its ups and downs. A consumer-focussed sector like pharma will never totally lose its sheen in an emerging market like India,‚Äù Udasi says.The pharma sector has been impacted badly by both domestic and global factors. Some major Indian pharma giants have seen hurdles in business by the US Food and Drugs Association ( FDA ). Indian companies have been facing hurdles to export drugs to the US and the regulations are expected to get tighter under Donald Trump.However, experts believe that mutual fund investors who have invested in pharma sector funds should not get out of their schemes now. ‚ÄúThe sector is going through a phase and it will come back. The point is that retail investors shouldn‚Äôt be having more than 5-10 per cent allocation to any sector fund. If you have a small allocation, you don‚Äôt need to worry. Stay invested,‚Äù says Puneet Oberoi, Founder, Excellent Investment Advisors.Sonam Udasi believes there are still companies to look for, majorly the smaller companies. ‚ÄúThe big companies might do well but not very soon. The valuations are attractive and the sector has some really good bets in some smaller companies,‚Äù he says.Udasi believes that investors who can wait should invest in pharma funds now. ‚ÄúCome in with a long-term investment horizon. We might see a turn-around in the coming two to three years,‚Äù he adds.Even Oberoi believes that new investors can consider starting investing in the pharma sector funds if they are familiar with the sector and have the time to wait. ‚ÄúThis is a good time to invest for those who have a fair knowledge of the sector. The sector is at its lowest and will only rise from here,‚Äù says Oberoi."

"Indian Railways: Indian Railways signs first EPC contract to speed up electrification, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: With the aim of boosting its ‚Äò Mission Electrification ‚Äô plan, Indian Railways signed its first Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with L&T for large electrification projects on Friday. The contract valuing Rs 1,050 crore for electrification of 781 route kilometres (RKM) was awarded by Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE) and Konkan Railways.‚ÄúFor faster execution of Railway Electrification projects, Indian Railways has changed from Business as usual (BAU) approach and entrusted new electrification works not only to Railway PSUs like Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) and Rail India Techno Economic Service (RITES) but also to Power Grid Corporation India Limited (PGCIL),‚Äù the ministry of railways said in a statement.The contract was awarded for electrification of Delhi Sarai Rohilla ‚Äì Rewari and Alwr ‚Äì Bandikui ‚Äì Jaipur ‚Äì Phulera ‚Äì Ajmer (353 rkm) section at a cost of Rs 594 crore and Roha ‚Äì Verna (428 rkm) of Konkan Railway at a cost of Rs. 456 crore. Also, eight agreements were also exchanged between Zonal Railways and Public Sector Undertakings for 1,735 rkm of electrification projects valuing Rs 1,746 crore.This comes on the heels of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) stating in its audit report on ‚ÄòElectrification Projects in Indian Railways‚Äô that the Indian Railways lost savings to the tune of Rs 3,006 crore on account of delays in execution 21 railways electrification projects out of 29 projects which were examined.Under ‚ÄòMission Electrification‚Äô, ten different electrification projects covering 2,516 rkm at a cost of about Rs. 2,797 crore have been finalized in a short duration, the statement added. ‚ÄúIt is a very important milestone for us. We had also announced in the rail budget that we will increase the pace of electrification. Around 42 per cent of electrification will be doubled in the next 5 years. Rs 16,500 crore of track doubling has also been sanctioned which will be electrified after getting commissioned,‚Äù rail minister Suresh Prabhu said at the signing.Prabhu also said the national carrier is also in the process of procuring electric locomotives from GE and Alstom , adding that the manufacturing of the locomotives will begin within a few months. He also stated that electrification has been given a higher thrust during the last four years as a total of 103 electrification projects were sanctioned.‚ÄúWe are also introducing 40,000 retrofitted and modernised coaches. Railways is constantly reforming itself by taking various initiatives in energy sector. With rolling stock getting modernised, lines getting electrified and guage conversion you can imagine the huge impact it will have on the whole Indian Railways network,‚Äù he added.The national carrier aims to reduce its total energy bill by over Rs 4,000 crore per annum through rapid electrification. At present, only 42 percent of the total Indian Railways network is electrified. The rail ministry plans to increase its electrified network to 52,400 rkm by 2021. On completion of 90 percent of railway electrification, the national carrier expects its total energy bill to come down to Rs 16,000 crore as against Rs 26,500 crore at present."

Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let‚Äôs have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn‚Äôt about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason ‚Äî utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear ‚Äî it just can‚Äôt do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn‚Äôt have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation ‚Äî it just can‚Äôt do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‚Äòcover-their-backside‚Äô approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu‚Äôs approach is this ‚Äî do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won‚Äôt get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style ‚Äî across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn‚Äôt do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India‚Äôs top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India‚Äôs medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India‚Äôs best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals ‚Äîcleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn‚Äôt have to be free) that offers Indian‚Äôs good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."
The Best Way Out,"Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape, the problems will continue, creating ‚Äòlooping patterns‚Äô in your life, says MARGUERITE THEOPHIL



Sometimes, it feels easier to avoid a problem or challenge ‚Äî or even an opportunity that has no guaranteed positive outcome. You distract yourself, make excuses, procrastinate; do anything but enter the situation. There are times when this is simply self-preservation; nothing too wrong there ‚Äî but often it keeps you from entering a space that will help you learn and grow or keeps you stuck in a place that diminishes you. Sometimes,though,you are thrown into just such a situation, ready or not. You struggle, going through most stages of what is called the ‚Äògrief cycle‚Äô, an extended form of this being the stages of shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression ‚Äî but you stop short of the last two: testing (of realistic options and solutions) and acceptance. This is because often acceptance does not mean the end of things; it is the beginning of moving into spaces, into decisions, into unfamiliar ways of being you would rather not move into. Such an attitude and the corresponding behaviours are often referred to as escapism. Escapism is when you try to avoid something. Some escape by excessive sleeping, shopping, eating, playing or inordinate time spent online. Some drown themselves in work; or alcohol or drugs. We all know people who stay in jobs or abusive marriages only because they are afraid of failure in pursuing what they love, or because they are not sure if there is another better someone elsewhere.People who avoid challenges because they are afraid of possible pain and suffering; who avoid healing their past because they are reminded of their deepest sorrows;who avoid confronting issues because they think they have no strength to face them.



‚ÄòBetter the devil we know‚Ä¶‚Äô they say sadly. Rather than ease your pain and suffering, this attitude prolongs and sometimes deepens them. At times people think the solution is to bury them or numb themselves to their effects ‚Äî but the issue and its effects just stay dormant, silently growing until the day it will all resurface. Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape from, your issues will not miraculously disappear.They continue, creating ‚Äòlooping patterns‚Äô in your life ‚Äî getting stuck again and again in similar situations and contexts, thinking the same things,feeling the same emotions,doing the same things, linking up with similar people. Looping patterns require conscious intervention in order to break out of them.And the best and most wise advice for these times ‚Äî though not that easy to follow ‚Äî is:‚ÄòThe best way out is through.‚Äô An old teaching story comes to mind: Once upon a time, there was a tortoise on a ship, and the ship sank in the middle of the ocean.The tortoise made it to a bit of land surrounded by water on all sides except for one. The strip of barren land led up to a high, steep, craggy mountain. To avoid starving to death, the tortoise decided to climb to the top,hoping that he would be able to cross, and find something to eat on the other side. You would know this would take a long, long time; not only was the terrain daunting ‚Äî this is a tortoise we are talking about! When he finally got to the snow-covered summit he was freezing cold, and then a blizzard started.



He just managed to make out a narrow pathway leading down the other side of the mountain and made his way towards it. But ahead on the path was a big monster that wouldn‚Äôt stop shouting, ‚ÄòVuuh uuh uuuuh!‚Äô This sound and his fear almost killed the tortoise; all he wanted to do was hide his head inside his shell. But, looking around him, he noticed many other animals of all sizes lying there, frozen to death. He summoned up all his courage to move down the path towards the monster.The closer the tortoise got, the more the monster changed its shape. Then, when he was almost upon it, the tortoise realised that what he had thought was a monster, was only a great pile of rocks, what he thought were dead frozen animals were other smaller rocks. As for the ‚ÄòVuuh uuh uuuuh!‚Äô ‚Äî the tortoise realised this was just the sound of the wind blowing through a small cave. He made his slow but determined way to the greenery that he could see ahead. Remember, in the process of working through your issues, you don‚Äôt always win quickly. Sometimes you may make some progress, only to slide back later.



Sometimes, you get beaten back down almost immediately, particularly if it involves dealing with something you have been struggling with for a long time. Don‚Äôt be afraid of asking for help or guidance; admitting you need help does not make you weak, it makes you strong.You might need help and support of others, professionals or loved ones, to ‚Äòhang in there‚Äô, but ultimately, it is your journey. Yet being convinced that the best way out is through, you find out that as long as you keep going, as long as you keep confronting your issues, as long as you keep fighting, as long as you confront your fears, as long as you know that the way out lies through and beyond all this ‚Äî you become stronger and stronger, and find a way to conquer the mess.

"New solar norms to stop bullying by power distribution companies, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: India on Tuesday announced new norms to improve bankability of solar power projects and boost investments without raising tariff, even as the International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ) said the country can raise renewable energy use to meet a quarter of its demand by 2030.The solar guidelines, laid down by the renewable energy ministry, prevent discoms from unilaterally amending or terminating PPAs (power purchase agreements), a recent trend among states which threatened the bankability of projects.The norms prescribe tariff-based bidding method for purchasing solar power by discoms, with at least a 25-year PPA tenure to keep tariffs low. Simultaneously, Provisions for compensating generators in case of arbitrary termination of PPAs as well as in cases where power cannot be sold due to technical constrains have also been provided to improve bankability and reduce risks for generators.The risk of a generator's revenue getting blocked due to delayed payment or non-payment has been addressed through provisions of LC (letter of credit), payment security fund and state guarantee.The guidelines also takes into account issues arising later from solar projects due to change in law, an issue that has nearly run aground large coal-fired power projects burning imported fuel.Early commissioning and partial commissioning of solar projects have not only been allowed, but incentivised by way of allowing the PPA for a minimum 25 years from the scheduled commissioning date under the new norms.Issues related to land, connectivity and clearances and the extension in the case of delay have also been streamlined for ensuring project preparedness as Narendra Modi government implements the world's largest renewable energy project.""Increasing renewable energy deployment could save the (Indian) economy twelve times more than its costs by the year 2030, creating jobs, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and ensuring cleaner air and water, with savings on health-related costs. Furthermore, the renewable energy technologies identified in the report would lower the demand for coal and oil products between 17 per cent and 23 per cent by 2030, compared to a business as usual scenario,"" IRENA said in a report.The report says Meeting India's electricity demand, which has grown by 10% a year over the past decade, and attaining the country's economic growth targets will require significant investments in power-generation capacity and related infrastructure, and in transport, buildings and industry sectors, creating important opportunities for renewable energy deployment.The IRENA report shows that investments in renewable energy capacity must more than double to make the most of India's potential. Mobilising affordable financing and adapting new business models will be essential to achieve this.India will also need to accelerate the transformation of its power system to integrate higher shares of renewables by strengthening transmission grids, reducing grid losses, and in general improving the resilience of the power system by investing in more flexible system that values demand-response, interconnectors and storage, as well as greater transport and power-sector synergies.India's population and economic growth, combined with accelerating urbanisation, is expected to increase the number of people living in cities and towns from approximately 435 million in 2015 to 600 million by 2030. In addition, estimates suggest that 80 million households ‚Äî roughly 300 million people ‚Äî have limited or no access to electricity. Renewables can improve energy access for poor communities and bolster energy security through diversified, and largely indigenous, sources of supply."
"Putting a price cap may not work in IVF, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: ‚ÄúIn India, there is no clear projection of the number of In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) centres. There is no clear record or mandatory registration,‚Äù said Dr Rishma Pai, President, Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India ( FOGSI ).Unregulated IVF clinicsThe IVF and ART (assisted reproductive technology) industry has been witnessing growing demand due to changing lifestyles and women marrying in their 30's today. Due to this rising demand, there has been a rapid increase in the number of IVF clinics. In India, just 20 percent of IVF clinics and only 2 percent of ART centres are registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ).‚ÄúWe have tried to bring together data information with the National ART Registry of India (NARI) but it is voluntary and the number of clinics which have registered are very few. It is because of this that there is no standardisation in result, policy or cost,‚Äù added Dr Pai.Dr Devika Chopra, Obstetrician, Gynaecologist & Fertility Specialist at ‚Äé Bhatia Hospital , said, ‚ÄúICMR is trying to get the IVF centres regulated. There are efforts being made but it has not been very effective in enforcing the law.‚ÄùSocial stigma associated with infertilityInfertility is more of an emotional trauma then a medical one, especially in the Indian setup. Talking about the other challenges in India like social stigma associated with infertility, Dr Chopra said, ‚ÄúEven today it is considered as a woman's responsibility to bear a child. After knowing that getting pregnant naturally is not possible and the woman may need ART, there is a sudden change in their behaviour and towards the woman.‚ÄùImportance of counsellingWith IVF techniques rapidly becoming an assessable option, women facing non-conception build up huge expectations. Elaborating on the lack of knowledge and awareness about the IVF success rates, Dr Nandita Palshetkar, Medical Director, Bloom IVF Group, said, ‚ÄúFailure is a major aspect and the success rates are not hundred percent. Counselling the woman, communicating with her and giving her an informed choice are very important.‚ÄùCommenting on the same, Dr Chopra said, ‚ÄúThe patients need to be counselled before going for IVF and that is where we are lacking in India. It is important to adequately counsel the couple and not rush through the process as it may impose psychological trauma on the patient.‚ÄùCap on IVF costIVF prices can invariably vary as there is zero transparency in the cost. A single IVF cycle can cost anywhere between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh. Such variation in cost has often invited suggestions like price caps in order to make it more standardised.‚ÄúPutting a price cap may not work but I think what we need to do is offer low budget cycles or free cycles to economically unprivileged people and that would be more sensible than capping the price,‚Äù said Dr Palshetkar.Dr Chopra said, ‚ÄúNational capping limit would have certain variables because not all women would respond to the same amount of drugs. The major costs in IVF are the drugs that you are giving; a younger woman may require lesser injections but an older woman may require more. So, how would you set up the cost is the question.‚Äù‚ÄúAssisted reproduction is the need of the hour. I believe that IVF can be a major source of benefit to most couples and even to our GDP,‚Äù added Dr Chopra."
Your personal data is yours & nobody else‚Äôs,"Court (SC) who have said your right to privacy is fundamental, ranking right up there with rights to life and freedom of expression. Privacy as a fundamental right probably didn‚Äôt matter much in 1954, when the first anti-privacy judgement was delivered. It matters now, when companies like Alphabet (owner of Google), Microsoft, online retailers, Facebook and Twitter can snoop into your finances, links with family and friends, mails and opinions. The SC order implies that your data belongs to you, not to companies or regimes. Big Brother regimes try to manipulate every thought and action of their citizens. The latter descend into a Stalinist hell of self-censorship, paranoia, spying and snitching on each other. In 1962 the Soviets worked out a telephone-based system that allowed a group of people involved in launching rockets and missiles, to communicate across vast distances via a phone network. This was the ancestor of the internet.

Fast forward to 2012, when Russia drew up its Internet Blacklist. Apparently, this was to protect children from harmful content, curb drug use and other evils. That was the fudge. Soon, it expanded to include sites ‚Äòinciting hatred‚Äô, ‚Äòsuspected extremism‚Äô and ‚Äòdeviant behaviour‚Äô including gay relationships. By August 2014, a ‚ÄòBloggers‚Äô Law‚Äô came into force, where all Wi-Fi and chat-room operators had to collect users‚Äô data, verify their passports and store them. Social media was controlled by a complex thingummy called Deep Packet Inspection. In July 2016, Russia passed the Yarovskya Law, forcing telecom operators to record and store all conversation, message and internet traffic for six months. This November, a new law will ban all software and websites that try to go around Russian filters. Phrases like ‚ÄòCaucasus‚Äô, ‚ÄòCrimea‚Äô and ‚ÄòUkraine‚Äô are taboo; Bitcoin has been blocked recently.

All this operates under the System of Operational reports to the FSB, successor of the KGB. Sorm arm-twists telecom and hardware companies to allow snooping. It also mandates inspection, arrest and shutdown without warrants.

On September 20, 1987, the first email was sent out from a primitive system in China. It said, ‚ÄòAcross the Great Wall, we can reach every corner in the world.‚Äô What irony. In less than 15 years, a system called the Great Firewall (GFW) controlled all online traffic. In 2003, GFW spawned Golden Shield to monitor and censor content. All backbone providers are owned by the communist state.

Before it walked out of China, Google agreed to block searches on phrases like ‚ÄòTiananmen‚Äô or ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô. Companies like Yahoo and Microsoft have bowed to all strictures of Beijing. Ironically, almost all the hardware that runs Beijing‚Äôs spying machinery is outsourced from US companies like Cisco Systems.

Whistleblower Robert Snowden showed how the US‚Äô National Security Agency (NSA) spiced up its mandate to track terror by spying on US citizens, as well as those from friendly nations. Snowden‚Äôs revelations implied that once data is centralised by the State, it is easier for online crooks to steal vast chunks of Investigative Measures (Sorm), which information. Financial information ‚Äòdumps‚Äô are sold on the Dark Internet, and used to hack into personal accounts or bank systems to steal cash.

In the last three years, India has lurched towards large-scale data snooping. Its primary vector is the Aadhaar ID number and card. The original idea was to stop subsidy leakage. It is now mandatory to have an Aadhaar number to file tax returns and open new bank accounts, enlarging the scope of financial fraud. Infants in Anganwadi cr√®ches now need Aadhaar to get a midday meal. Never mind media reports that suggest that the Aadhaar system is about as secure as a sieve.

Petitions to rein in Aadhaar begged the question whether your data was yours or whether companies and governments could filch it. On Thursday, the Supreme Court made your right to privacy, including personal information, a fundamental right. We might yet pull back from the abyss."

"Johnson & Johnson baby powder: Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $417m in lawsuit linking baby powder to cancer, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LOS ANGELES - A Los Angeles jury on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay a record $417 million to a hospitalized woman who claimed in a lawsuit that the talc in the company's iconic baby powder causes ovarian cancer when applied regularly for feminine hygiene.

The verdict in the lawsuit brought by the California woman, Eva Echeverria, marks the largest sum awarded in a series of talcum powder lawsuit verdicts against Johnson & Johnson in courts around the U.S.

Echeverria alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about talcum powder's potential cancer risks. She used the company's baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007, according to court papers.

Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a ""proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,"" she said in her lawsuit.

Echeverria's attorney, Mark Robinson, said his client is undergoing cancer treatment while hospitalized and told him she hoped the verdict would lead Johnson & Johnson to put additional warnings on its products.

""Mrs. Echeverria is dying from this ovarian cancer and she said to me all she wanted to do was to help the other women throughout the whole country who have ovarian cancer for using Johnson & Johnson for 20 and 30 years,"" Robinson said.

""She really didn't want sympathy,"" he added. ""She just wanted to get a message out to help these other women.""

The jury's award included $68 million in compensatory damages and $340 million in punitive damages, Robinson said. The evidence in the case included internal documents from several decades that ""showed the jury that Johnson & Johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer,"" Robinson said.

""Johnson & Johnson had many warning bells over a 30 year period but failed to warn the women who were buying its product,"" he said.

Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement that the company will appeal the jury's decision. She says while the company sympathizes with women suffering from ovarian cancer that scientific evidence supports the safety of Johnson's baby powder.

The verdict came after a St. Louis, Missouri jury in May awarded $110.5 million to a Virginia woman who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012.

She had blamed her illness on her use of the company's talcum powder-containing products for more than 40 years.

Besides that case, three other trials in St. Louis had similar outcomes last year - with juries awarding damages of $72 million, $70.1 million and $55 million, for a combined total of $307.6 million.

Another St. Louis jury in March rejected the claims of a Tennessee woman with ovarian and uterine cancer who blamed talcum powder for her cancers.

Two similar cases in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said the plaintiffs' lawyers did not presented reliable evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer.

More than 1,000 other people have filed similar lawsuits. Some who won their lawsuits won much lower amounts, illustrating how juries have wide latitude in awarding monetary damages.

Johnson & Johnson is preparing to defend itself and its baby powder at upcoming trials in the U.S., Goodrich said."

While some suspected his fight with SRK during the world tour led to his hiding, others say he got into drugs and has been in rehab since then. The singer has not sung for more than a year and people are curious to know about what really happened with him during this span.

Honey Singh still has loyal fans who are eagerly waiting for his comeback. The makers have got in touch with the 'once upon a time superstar'.

"China commits to cut northern air pollution by 15 percent, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By David Stanway

SHANGHAI: China has pledged to cut average concentrations of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by more than 15 percent year-on-year in the winter months in 28 northern cities to meet key smog targets, the environment ministry said.

In a 143-page winter smog ""battleplan"" posted on its website on Thursday, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said the new target, for the October to March period, would apply to Beijing and Tianjin, along with 26 other cities in the smog-prone provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan.

China's efforts to control pollution have often roiled the prices of steel, iron ore and coal with output routinely curtailed as a result of emergency smog regulations and inspection campaigns.

China is under pressure this year to meet politically important 2017 air quality targets. It aims to cut 2012 levels of PM2.5 by more than a quarter in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and bring average concentrations down to 60 micrograms per cubic metre in the Chinese capital.

But PM2.5 averages rose in the first seven months of the year as a result of near record-high smog in January and February, which China blamed on ""unfavourable weather conditions"".

Experts still believe, however, that China remains on course to meet the 2017 targets set out in a groundbreaking air quality action plan published by the government in 2013.

""Actually, air quality from April to June was among the best over the last five years in Beijing and we still have confidence in achieving the target,"" said Shelley Yang, a project manager at the Clean Air Alliance of China (CAAC), a non-profit organisation that includes academic, government and corporate organisations that ""care about clean air"".

The extremely high PM2.5 levels in January and February will also make it easier for cities to achieve the 15 percent cut in the new year.

The government is still leaving nothing to chance, with some of China's smoggiest cities under pressure to complete annual steel and coal closure targets by the end of September and implement tougher restrictions in the following months.

By October, big steelmaking cities like Tangshan and Handan must have plans in place to cut output by as much as 50 percent to limit smog during the winter heating season starting in November.

The region is also under pressure to eliminate thousands of coal-fired boilers, further restrict coal haulage on roads and ensure that power generators, steel mills and coking plants complete upgrades aimed at controlling emissions before heating systems are switched on.

Hebei is responsible for a quarter of China's steel output, with Tangshan alone producing around 100 million tonnes a year, more than the United States. Neighbouring Shanxi is China's biggest coal producer, with more than 900 million tonnes of annual output.

In a note this week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said the winter restrictions could also reduce primary aluminium output by 400,000 tonnes this year.

In a separate notice on Thursday, the Hebei government promised to use an ""iron fist"" to deal with air pollution over the winter."

"Oil steady as storm heads into Gulf of Mexico, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","London: Oil prices steadied on Thursday, holding on to most of their recent gains after another fall in U.S. crude inventories indicated a tighter market, and as a tropical storm headed towards oil producing facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.

Benchmark Brent crude was down 5 cents a barrel at $52.52 by 0745 GMT. U.S. light, sweet crude was 5 cents lower at $48.36 a barrel.

Both contracts had risen more than 1 percent on Wednesday, buoyed by potential output disruptions from the Gulf of Mexico storm Tropical Depression Harvey.

""For the next few days, the U.S. market is going to be focused on Texas as Tropical Depression Harvey is expected to strengthen into a Category I hurricane by Friday,"" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta.

""Operators in the area are already closing down platforms and evacuating workers as a precaution,"" he added.

Harvey strengthened into a tropical storm late on Wednesday night with winds of about 40 miles per hour (65 km per hour) and was located about 440 miles (705 km) southeast of Port Mansfield, Texas, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.

Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil have all taken steps to curb some oil and gas output at platforms in the Gulf.

Beyond the weather, traders said declines in U.S. commercial crude storage levels were a sign of a gradually tightening market, although another rise in output held the market back.

U.S. crude oil production hit 9.53 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, its highest since July 2015 and up over 13 percent from their most recent low in mid-2016.

Despite this, U.S. crude stocks fell last week and gasoline stocks were down as well, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

Crude inventories fell by 3.3 million barrels in the week ending Aug. 18 to 463.17 million barrels, down 13.5 percent from record levels last March."
"How is GST going to impact your health?, Health News, ET HealthWorld","After a lot of deliberation and discussion, the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) has finally been rolled out for various products and services in the country. While you are probably aware of some of these changes, did you know that it could affect the cost of health care too?GST would have a constructive effect on this sector, considering it will now involve a merger of all these taxes into one uniform tax. This will not only smoothen out the way business is carried out, but also minimise the effects of multiple taxes applied to a single product.‚Ä¢ Since 8 different types of taxes are imposed on the Pharmaceutical Industry today, it will help the sector by streamlining the taxation structure.‚Ä¢ The switchover from the existing tax regime to GST will likely affect medicine prices. The cost of most essential drugs is expected to increase by a 2.29%‚Ä¢ The government has fixed GST rate of 12% on most of the essential drugs as against the current tax incidence of around 9%‚Ä¢ However, some select medicines, such as insulin, will see a lower rate with the government revising GST rate to 5% from 12%Moreover, GST could also enhance the operational efficiency by rationalising the supply chain, which may contribute 2% to the country‚Äôs Pharmaceutical industry. Indian pharmaceutical sector in numbers‚Ä¢ 3rd largest in the world in terms of volume‚Ä¢ Ranks 14th in the world in terms of value‚Ä¢ 5% of India‚Äôs GDP comes from the Healthcare sector‚Ä¢ Healthcare sector is expected to reach $150 billion by end of 2017The roll out of the GST is also expected to bring about a decrease in the overall cost of medical technology. Currently, the cost for this machinery is rather high, considering most medical equipment is imported. Additionally, under the present tax regulations, the duty levied on it is not permitted as tax credit. However, this may change once GST is implemented, as duty charged on such machinery and equipment may be allowed as credit.Medicines other than baby food, life-saving drugs and contraceptives may also witness a change in pricing due to varying tax rates. Under the proposed GST tax schedule-‚Ä¢ Baby food like glucose biscuits will be taxed at 18% and malted milk powder at 28%‚Ä¢ There will be a 5% tax on Life saving drugs‚Ä¢ Other drugs will attract a 12% tax‚Ä¢ Food supplements will be taxed at 18%Drugs other than life-saving could see higher prices in the future because under the present tax structure, these fall into the 5% tax bracket.However, the final impact of GST on the pharmaceutical industry is still not very clear. Industry experts are hopeful of a win-win situation for both, consumers and pharmaceutical companies. More importantly, reduced complexities and an overall reduction in costs could lead to profitability and promising development.Patients could end up paying higher medical bills and bear expensive hospitalisation costs as GST applicable on expenses incurred by hospitals has increased. The cost of surgeries is also expected to rise, considering disposables, drugs and reagents are now bracketed under 12% GST, as compared to the old tax rate which ranged between 2 to 5.5%. Additionally, services like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/ X-Rays and contrasts, may also increase in costs, albeit marginally.In the case of the fitness and wellness industry, sporting goods now fall under the 12% tax rate, while physical exercise equipment now attracts a 28% tax under GST. However, an appeal has been made to treat physical exercise equipment as sports goods, and bring it under the 12% GST rate. The implementation of an 18% GST rate would lead to higher prices for customers. It could bring down the demand for gyms and fitness centres, as these services could cost more.The hike of 3% post-GST, from the current 15%, will see an increased cost of insurance premiums in the health insurance sector. Both, existing and new policyholder will be adversely affected by these increased rates.For instance, if you are spending a total of Rs. 40,000 a year on insurance, excluding service tax, your current premium would be charged at 15%, which is Rs. 6,000. Under the new tax regime, this same premium will be taxed at 18%, which is Rs. 7,200. This means you pay an additional amount of Rs 1,200 from your pocket.The GST bill is looked at as a progressive measure that will facilitate seamless movement of goods across inter-state borders, improving efficiency and driving growth of the e-commerce sector. But consider this is just the beginning of the change, it is yet to be seen how this will impact consumers and sellers in the long run."
"GE, ABB restart talks over industrial solutions deal","New Delhi: General Electric Co has resumed negotiations to sell its industrial solutions business to Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd , after the U.S. industrial conglomerate moderated its price expectations, people familiar with the matter said.

The move underscores the determination of John Flannery, who took over from Jeffrey Immelt as GE's chief executive on Aug. 1, to continue to divest non-core assets, as he carries out a review of the company's portfolio.

GE is entertaining the possibility of selling its industrial solutions business for a little over $2 billion after initially hoping for more than $3 billion, four sources said this week. The talks with ABB had ended last month over price disagreements.

There is no certainty of a deal and another bidder could still emerge, the sources said. However, French electrical component and energy management group Schneider Electric SA , which Reuters reported in April was vying for the GE unit, has since lost interest, the sources added.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. GE and ABB declined to comment, while Schneider Electric did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

GE's industrial solutions business offers circuit breakers, relays, panel boards and other industrial electrical equipment for several markets, including the healthcare, mining, renewable energy, telecommunication, construction and data centre sectors.

GE, which makes everything from power plants and jet engines to medical scanners and locomotives, has been reviewing its portfolio after divesting its finance, appliances and NBCUniversal units in recent years. Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP has also been pressuring GE to cut costs and focus on its core industrial businesses.

Earlier this year, GE agreed to sell its industrial water treatment business to French waste and water group Suez SA and Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec for 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion).

Last month, Schneider Electric said it would acquire automatic transfer switch maker Asco Power Technologies for $1.25 billion from Vertiv, the former network power business of Emerson Electric Co that is now owned by private equity firm Platinum Equity LLC.

That deal eliminated Schneider Electric as a potential buyer for GE's industrial solutions business, because such a deal would face significant antitrust hurdles, according to the sources.

ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer has been under pressure to tackle lower profitability at the Swiss engineering company, after higher raw material prices and overcapacity issues dented its latest quarterly earnings."

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you‚Äôve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with ‚Äúaddiction of online binge watching‚Äù.

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn‚Äôt let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Donald Trump‚Äôs latest Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy: Not much South Asian comfort,"By Pinaki Bhattacharya

It was touted as the latest US strategy towards South Asia. And, we were told by US Secretary of Defence James Mattis, that the Camp David meeting last weekend was a culmination of many months of review of US policies for the Afghanistan quagmire. So, expectations were high in the four capitals of Kabul, Islamabad, New Delhi and Beijing.

But US President Donald J Trump let South Asia down. He talked about an increased US commitment to Afghanistan ‚Äî more boots on the ground. There were no numbers mentioned of fresh troop deployment, for that is a potential minefield in hyper-ventilating Washington.

US House of Representative SpeakerPaul Ryan, who was briefed earlier about what to expect from Trump‚Äôs current trumpeteering, almost called it prescient that the US President has called the latest strategy to be not time-based but ‚Äúbased on condition‚Äù ‚Äîwhich means, as Trump explained, ‚Äúcondition on the ground‚Äù.

Lessons on conflict resolution state that one needs to divine an acceptable‚Äò end state‚Äô before one sets the conflict-machine chugging. But it seems that Republican presidencies have not learnt the studied moves of the Nixon-Kissinger team. Instead, they seem as expansive as the Reagan administration that was too busy defeating the Soviet Union, thus making itself hostage to the Chinese economic miracle.

Which meant Ronald Reagan‚Äôs successor, George H W Bush, losing his presidency to ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the economy, stupid!‚Äô rhetoric of Bill Clinton. The burgeoning US public debt that Beijing continued to feed ‚Äî as reflected in the trade surpluses ‚Äî shows in the lack of ‚Äòstrategic autonomy‚Äô that Washington had enjoyed since World War 2.

George W Bush tried his hand in unilateralism, but ended up going down in American history books as a creator of not one, but two Vietnam wars in Af-Pak and Iraq.

Trump‚Äôs speech was devoid of any substance that could stir up the Indian subcontinent‚Äôs own ‚Äòstudio empire-builders‚Äô to reach for their TV microphones.

And what did Trump tell Pakistan that could make the tinpot generals of Rawalpindi quake in their boots? ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: we must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.‚Äù

Boilerplate words those. Thus, shorn of the finesse of a leader like Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan‚Äôs generals would rather have Beijing continuing its indulgence and play mediator for them.

Trump‚Äôs speech does very little for the confidence level of New Delhi, which is watching each muscle of the latest actor on the stage of Indo-US relations. There will be a holding operation that would be launched in New Delhi in the wake of this speech.

Not much extra commitment of India‚Äôs foreign exchange dollars will flow that Trump was hopeful of steering to Afghanistan. Of course India wouldbe doing its ‚Äòbest‚Äô. But that ‚Äòbest‚Äô would fall short of Trump‚Äôs expectations.

So, this speech was really about the domestic audience: not Trump‚Äôs own white- and blue-collar electoral base, but the Establishment, whose leading lights are now firmly in the Indiancamp.

This was evident in the penultimate days of the Barack Obama administration when former Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter got the ‚Äòblank cheque‚Äô of the Defence Authorisation Act passed by the US Congress. That may have evoked some fraught memories. But Pentagon can play around with it, military-industrial complex or no military-industrial complex."

Fear to tread: Should the travel advisory for every place on earth be ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt‚Äô?,"Only the date line changes. Exactly a week ago, London, Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Delhi, Islamabad respectfully made way for Barcelona. ‚ÄòMowing down tourists is the new normal‚Äô despaired the Evening Standard while Londoners sat transfixed to the too- familiar photograph of a bloodied avenue. Las Ramblas, the very metaphor of hedonism, had been bustling with carefree crowds when a van emerged like a bat out of hell ‚Äì driven with a fervour linked to the promise of heaven. The next Monday, a bomb alert evacuated the same stretch.

East and West have met in terror. True, each had had enough of its own, but now it‚Äôs of a common genre. What demons ‚Äì or angels ‚Äì drive 22-year-olds to get behind a wheel and ram coldly into unsuspecting strangers? And how alert can we be when jihad comes via such everyday objects as a van, kitchen knife ‚Äì or the tiffin box bombs of Mumbai and Delhi.

This column swells from my time on the Ramblas, my awe over something as civilised as a 1.2 km thoroughfare dedicated to pedestrians, leaving vehicles to fend for themselves on its margins. My first encounter with this incredible boulevard came at an international AIDS conference in 2002. It was where India‚Äôs HIV-afflicted finally found their voice, and through which a flamboyant Shatrughan Sinha swaggered as health minister. So the many stories to be filed kept me away from Las Ramblas‚Äôs tireless blandishments. But my hotel was right on it, and i went to bed with riffs of laughter and the weeping of violins. In the morning when i walked to catch my tube, it lay exhausted from its multiple orgasms.

Two other visits allowed a more touristy appreciation. Of the Ramblas‚Äôs gilded ‚Äòstatue‚Äô men, the segueing of the world‚Äôs accents, the flowers, food and baubles, the eccentric Gaudi architecture just off it, and suave Hispanics seducing over La Riojas or returning from a late-late concert, the men in long formal skirts (you read that right).

Now in London, my two always-must-dos are also stained by recent attacks: the Borough market and Westminster bridge. But the crowds still mill undaunted. It‚Äôs the most effective thumbed-nose to terror. Or so they say.

"Debate On Privacy Ends, Supreme Court Rules That Right To Privacy Is A Fundamental Right","In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court has ruled that the individual's right to privacy is a fundamental right. The SC order has finally put to rest the debate over individual's right to privacy, especially in the context of Aadhaar.

The order was delivered by a nine member bench comprising of Justices JS Khehar, J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, R F Nariman, A M Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay K Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer.

The apex court ruling came in a bunch of petitions challenging the government's decision to introduce the biometric data-enabled Aadhaar ID for citizens.

BCCL

The question of whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution was first raised in the apex court before a three-judge bench.

It was referred to a five-judge Constitution bench on August 11, 2015.

The five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice J S Khehar, met on July 18 to decide the issue, but was told by the Centre that the strength of the bench was inadequate as an eight judge bench in the M P Sharma case in 1954, and a six judge bench in the Kharak Singh case in 1962, had ruled that right to privacy was not a fundamental right.

AFP

The Centre, through attorney general K K Venugopal, had said, ""Privacy, even if assumed to be a fundamental right, consists of a large number of subspecies... It will be constitutionally impermissible to declare each and every instance of privacy a fundamental right. Privacy has varied connotations when examined from different aspects of liberties.

If the SC wants to declare it a fundamental right, then it probably has to determine separately the various aspects of privacy and the extent of violation that could trigger a constitutional remedy.""

AFP

The Unique Identification Authority of India, too, said privacy was not a fundamental right and there were sufficient safeguards to protect data collected from the people -- their iris scan and fingerprints.

Even though the government and the UIDAI continue to stand by their claim that Aadhaar data is safe, in May, security researchers discovered that the Aadhaar information of as many as 135 million people had leaked online.

Since then there have been a number of incidents from various parts of the country where people with malicious intends managed to break into the database and steal data."
The Hacker Of GoT Season 7 Episode 4 Leaked It Because He Wanted To Please His Girlfriend!,"It happens only in India?!

The first time it happened with the fourth episode of Game of Thrones, the most hyped and loved American series that the entire episode was leaked online before its official release, and it happened in India.

The leaked episode had Star India‚Äôs watermark on it, which means that Hotstar who is HBO‚Äôs partner in India for airing the episode was responsible for the leak. Later it turned out that Prime Focus Technologies‚Äîthe agency which manages Star India Private Limited‚Äôs data, is the root of the entire problem. Four people were arrested in the same regard and now one of them has revealed how it got revealed.

What was supposed to be a grave severe affair turned out to be rather funnier and realistic, to say the least.

So, now it has been revealed that one of the IT professionals named Alok Sharma who was under arrest in the same regard had sent the episode to his girlfriend in order to please her, and that is from where it was leaked and later uploaded online.

Twitter

‚ÄúInitially, there were suspicions that one of the accused had accessed the episode as his girlfriend wanted to see it. The girlfriend had then passed it onto others, one of whom uploaded it online,‚Äù revealed an official to Indian Express who was part of the probe earlier.

‚ÄúThe investigation is still in progress. However, so far, it appears that they had leaked it for self-consumption. We are now trying to find out who uploaded it online,‚Äù another senior officer added.

According to the report, first Alok had accessed the episode and it is he who shared it with the other four who are also under arrest. Police is trying to find out who uploaded it online.

Meanwhile, hackers responsible for the leak of the sixth episode have warned HBO that the finale episode will also be leaked before the actual air date.

11 Heartwarming Instances Which Prove That Humanity Trumps Every Religion & Caste,"Indians always get smitten by the momentous consequences of secularism in our country. Amid the murmur and babble that goes around validating the comeuppance of those asserting within religion, society, and groups, lies a society that's bonded.

We have instances where altercations between two people have led to communal unrest, where a word-war has lead to haggling of family members or mob lynching and where a 'rapist' from a different community is seen as community agenda.

But who is to say that India is a land of diversity and this multifariousness thrives in every part of the nation. We have people from Sikh community who have gone over and beyond their code of conduct to help distraught people, we have Hindus assisting Muslims during Ramadan and Muslim men risking their lives to save victims or Muslim women who have been making Shiva Lingas for 17 years.

Here we have curated a list of some instances that validate the bond of love Indians share and swear by.

Pooriben Leuwa, an 85-year-old Hindu woman has been fasting during Ramzan for the past 34 years, says that she and her Muslim friends ""share a faith called love"".

""For the past two years I have not been keeping well,"" Pooriben said. ""My family and my doctor have allowed me just three Rozas this year - 27th, 28th and 29th. But I argue with them every day to allow me to observe the entire 40 days.""

"Bill Gates Invests In A Startup That Grows Meat In A Lab, Trying To Solve The World Food Crisis","Bill Gates has joined forced with Cargill Inc, one of the world‚Äôs largest agriculture corporations, and other major business, to invest in technology that endeavours to develop meat from self-producing animal cells.

Consumers are demanding more and more protein that‚Äôs less reliant on food, grazing land, and water than livestock, and the coalition believes the answer lies with San Francisco-based startup Memphis Meats.

Memphis Meats produces beef chicken, and duck meat directly from grown animal cells, completely bypassing the need to raise and slaughter poultry and cattle. The startup recently raised $17 million in funding from investors like Cargill, the world‚Äôs richest man Gates, and billionaire Richard Branson.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to have invested in Memphis Meats,‚Äù Branson said in an email in response to questions from Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúI believe that in 30 years or so we will no longer need to kill any animals and that all meat will either be clean or plant-based, taste the same and also be much healthier for everyone.‚Äù

The move is a response to increasing demand for meat that is organic, and more sustainable than current systems, as well as doesn‚Äôt involve cruelty to animals ‚ÄúThe world loves to eat meat, and it is core to many of our cultures and traditions,‚Äù co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats Uma Valeti said in the statement. ‚ÄúThe way conventional meat is produced today creates challenges for the environment, animal welfare and human health.

While some areas are suffering extreme droughts, in Southeast Asia, the number of record-setting daily rainfall amounts doubled over the past three decades. Up to a quarter of Bangladesh is inundated in a normal year, and century-level flooding could put 60 per cent of the country under water, the report says. Storm surges from tropical cyclones, destructive winds and landslides are other risks from weather extremes.

Science says: Fast-melting Arctic sign of bad global warming One of the coldest places on Earth is so hot it's melting. Glaciers, sea ice and a massive ice sheet in the Arctic are thawing from toasty air above and warm water below.

"North Korea's trade with China hit by sanctions, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Beijing: China's imports from North Korea slowed in July while its exports to the sanctions-hit country dwindled after surging in recent months, according to official Chinese statistics.

Overall, bilateral trade between the two countries stood at USD 456 million last month, down nearly seven per cent from June, according to General Administration of Customs figures.

The decline is partly due to a steady decline in China's imports from its neighbor, which fell to USD 156.3 million in July, down three per cent from the previous month and more than 30 per cent year on year.

China, the main ally of Pyongyang and the recipient of some 90 per cent of North Korea's exports, suspended all imports of coal in February in compliance with United Nations sanctions.

The aim of these restrictions is to deprive the Kim Jong-Un regime of crucial currency sources in order to check its controversial nuclear programme.

Following a seventh round of sanctions adopted in early August by the UN Security Council, Beijing recently announced it will also suspend its purchases of North Korean iron, lead and seafood.

Chinese exports to the Stalinist regime fell to $299.8 million in July, down more than eight per cent from June.

But exports were up 55 per cent year on year. North Korea considerably increased its purchases from the Asian giant in recent months, including appliances, mechanical parts, textiles and solar panels.

In Dandong, a Chinese border town, AFP found last month that vibrant trade continued despite sanctions - with many Chinese shops continuing to offer jewels made of North Korean gold and silver, which have long been banned from the other side.

US President Donald Trump has urged China to step up pressure on its turbulent neighbour.

The Trump administration angered China this week by slapping punitive measures on several Chinese and Russian companies accused of supporting the North Korean nuclear programme and attempting to evade US sanctions.

The key targets were Chinese coal importers."

"Piyush Goyal: Centre rejigs PPA, takes the wind out of state power discom bullies, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The Centre has taken a stern view of state distribution companies violating contracts by bullying solar and wind power developers to cut prices, which bankers say will discourage lenders and investors.The minister for power, coal, renewable energy and mines, Piyush Goyal , has expressed concern at the development and has opposed violation of contracts that have already been signed. Goyal is spearheading India‚Äôs massive expansion of renewable energy capacity, which has made India a world leader in growth of wind and solar generation.‚ÄúThe government view is very clear that the legal framework has to be respected.All PPAs, whatever the legal terms are, they will be respected. But if a PPA has a mutual negotiation clause, and somebody is willing to do it, then what can be done?‚Äù he told ET.Fierce competition in solar and wind power auctions along with falling prices of equipment have helped tariffs tumble to record lows, making older projects look very costly. This has prompted many state discoms to ask project developers to sell electricity at the lowest available rate even if the contract for a particular plant was signed when costs were much higher.A government official said the Centre was considering sending an advisory to states, cautioning them about the adverse implications of their efforts to arm-twist companies to cut rates. The Indian Banks Association has also written to the power and finance ministries saying that the action by states was threatening the viability of projects, which in turn would make their loans risky.States where project developers are being pressured to cut tariffs include Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, UP and Jharkhand. Government officials said that renewable energy projects are a key part of India‚Äôs efforts to meet its climate commitments and to reduce the use of polluting fossil fuels, and the effort to promote clean energy has the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At a recent meeting with the wind developers and state nodal agencies for renewable energy, newly appointed secretary of the renewable energy ministry, Anand Kumar, expressed great surprise at the deluge of complaints from developers. Most of them related to state discoms trying to go back on their commitments on wind energy.He promised to do something about the matter and also told them to keep filing petitions before the appropriate forums. Subsequently, there has been a meeting of state regulators with MNRE officials at which issues raised by developers were discussed with them. Thereafter MNRE has also been in touch with the power secretaries of different states pointing out the problems that have arisen and urging them to get their discoms to behave and honour commitments.Kumar also wants power purchase agreements to be honoured unless there is an issue of irregularity or corruption."
F1 Champ Lewis Hamilton Is All Set To Match Legendary Michael Schumacher‚Äôs Record In His 200th Race,"Three-time world champion Lewis Hamilton will start his 200th Grand Prix in Belgium this weekend, seeking to match German legend Michael Schumacher's record of 68 pole positions.

With the summer break out of the way, the British driver will be chasing his fifth win of the season as he bids to claw back points on title-race leader, four-time champion Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari.

AFP

Back in Europe after spending F1's now-traditional European summer break in the Caribbean, Hamilton, who gave up third for his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas in Hungary, lies 14 points behind Vettel.

Hamilton won at Spa in 2015, but was beaten by team-mate and 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg last year and has had mixed results at the famous old sprawling and high-speed circuit.

AFP

In 2008, when he won his first title, he was relegated from first to third for cutting a chicane, and he has suffered in other incidents including a collision with Rosberg, that left him with a puncture, in 2014.

Seeking his third Belgian win, Hamilton will be the pre-race favourite to win again, but knows that Ferrari have regained the momentum in the title race following their dominant one-two finish led by Vettel in Hungary.

AFP

Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff has already warned his squad not to take anything for granted.

""Assumptions are dangerous,"" he said. ""We have seen too many times already this season that the form book can be rewritten from one weekend to the next.

""So we will be making no assumptions.""

The race may also be affected -- as often in the past -- by the capricious micro-climate of the region, which can mean parts of the track are under water in rainfall while others remain dry.

That, for Max Verstappen, may be a bonus as he bids to put a mixed season to date back on the road.

""I just love the track and it'll be nice seeing so many orange fans in the stands,"" said Red Bull's Belgium-born Dutch driver.

""Spa is my favourite track -- you have to get everything right, but when you get a good lap, it's very rewarding.""

That could also be said of Ferrari's second driver Kimi Raikkonen, a four-time Spa winner, who has been confirmed on the team's roster next year.

""It will not be easy for us, as Mercedes has the horsepower, but we will do what we can and who knows? Let's see what happens.""

A big crowd is expected to camp out and herald Formula One's ""return to work"" from the beach at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix where Stoffel Vandoorne will hope to mark his retention by McLaren with a strong showing in front of his home fans.

"Food Is Going To Be Flying Through The Skies In Iceland, Thanks To This Drone Delivery Service!","Even as Amazon experiments with drone deliveries in the US, Iceland is about to flag off drone delivery within its borders.

It‚Äôs interesting to note that the company responsible for that to happen doesn‚Äôt even make drones!

Israeli-based drone logistics company Flytrex partnered with a local on-demand goods service AHA in Reykjavik, to set up a small delivery route in the country‚Äôs capital.

Flytrex doesn‚Äôt make the drones that‚Äôll conduct the deliveries. Instead, it‚Äôs responsible for enabling the service itself. The company has spent the last few years working with local policy framers and authorities, training AHA employees, and setting up a cloud-based network to run the drone service.

Because this is a trial run, there‚Äôs only one delivery in the works right now. Flytrex and AHA will be using a hexacopter to fly food and other goods across a bay that drivers normally have to drive around. A driver from AHA will bring the goods to one side of the bay, where it will be loaded onto a drone, flown across the bay, and then loaded onto another truck to complete the journey. The entire delivery, which would normally take hours, could be completed within minutes.

The modified drones being used can carry packages up to 3kg across 10 kilometres, though this particular trial only requires them to travel 2 km. The setup is perfect for AHA, which usually delivers things like groceries, food, and alcohol. There‚Äôll be about 20 of these deliveries every day, until they can be expanded to multiple routes around Reykjavik by the end of the year."

He signalled a number of changes in US‚ÄîAfghanistan policies, warning that it was time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to ‚Äùcivilization, order and to peace‚Äù.

It is clear that the heat is going to be turned on Pakistan by the Americans. The US Congress is proposing to enact a legislation to progressively reduce/cut off economic and military aid and supplies to Pakistan. America‚Äôs allies, notably UK, Germany, and Japan will supplement the American effort.

The US will also be enhancing its military presence in Afghanistan. The proposed US Congressional Legislation requires the administration to deny economic and military assistance to Pakistan, if it does not mend its ways.

Trump has indicated that while it ‚Äúmay be possible‚Äù to have a political settlement with ‚Äùelements in the Taliban‚Äù, this can take place only after it ends violence.Secretary of State Tillerson has stated: ‚ÄúThis entire effort is intended to put pressure to have the Taliban understand that you will not win a battlefield victory and we may not win one, but neither will you‚Äù.

He added: ‚ÄúAt some point in time, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end‚Äù. Tillerson also made it clear that the US could revoke the status of ‚ÄúMajor Non-NATO ally‚Äù that Pakistan enjoys, clearing the way for stringent restrictions on arms supplies and economic assistance. It is now evident that the US intends to link arms and economic assistance to Pakistan ending support for terrorism in Afghanistan, through the Taliban and Haqqani network. It is also possible that US drone strike on the Pakistan -based, ISI supported Taliban and its leadership will be stepped up.

How will Pakistan react to these new US policies? Rawalpindi will protest loudly at US policies. The message will be quietly sent to the US that if it turns the squeeze too much, Pakistan will be forced to deny use of its soil to American military supplies and aid to Afghanistan. The aim will be to force the US to cool off on sanctions, by holding out promises of Taliban good behaviour, in the event of the US agreeing to continue economic and military assistance. This is something, which India and Afghanistan should ensure does not happen. There will substantial pressure on the US to agree to an early resumption of ‚Äúunconditional dialogue‚Äù with the Taliban. This should, however, remain conditional on a verifiable end to Pakistan support for cross-border terrorism. China has already made noises of support for Pakistan.

Beijing has made it clear that it will back Pakistan on its position regarding a role for the Taliban, which equates the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Trump has made it clear that India remains a ‚Äústrategic partner‚Äù not just in South Asia, but across the entire ‚ÄúIndo-Pacific‚Äù region. The old hyphenation between India and Pakistan has been eroded, but India has to be careful on this score. We also need to bear in mind that Russia, Iran and China have close contacts with the Taliban. Economic cooperation and military training for Afghanistan has to be quickly stepped up.

"L&T electrical business: Schneider, Eaton frontrunners to buy L&T‚Äôs electrical business, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi/Mumbai: Schneider Electric SE, the French industrial multinational and Eaton Corp have emerged as the top contenders to acquire Larsen & Toubro‚Äô electric and automation division for Rs 15,000-Rs 17,000 crore as India‚Äôs largest engineering group looks to prune its portfolio and exit non-core areas, said three officials aware of the ongoing developments. Schneider Electric has teamed up with Temasek , the Singapore's state investment company for the buyout, while Eaton has re-engaged after their 2011 bilateral discussions with L&T, fell through. It is not clear yet if it will also form a consortium with a financial sponsor.Binding offers are expected by next month.The two are believed to be far more serious than other potential suitors that included Siemens AG, Swedish- Swiss multinational ABB, Hitachi, Honeywell and few global buyout funds. According to one of the sources, Schneider is the more aggressive of the two and have given an indicative offer of Rs 17,000 crore but clarity on that will emerge once the binding bids are on table.Spokespersons of Schneider, Temasek, Eaton Corporation and Larsen & Toubro all declined to comment on speculation and rumor.However, L&T‚Äôs high valuation expectation may turn out to a deal breaker, even this time around, warned an official directly in the know. But company watchers feel prospects of a successful transaction are brighter this time around because the division‚Äôs plants have been segregated from the parent and real estate has been clearly demarcated at all the locations, thereby making it easy to value the assets.In case the discussions fail yet again, L&T may resort to an alternative strategy of shifting the division in a wholly owned subsidiary ‚Äì it already has an enabling provision to do so -- and will list it on Indian bourses, an official added.‚ÄúIn FY17, L&T monetised its stake in its two key IT subs. This, together with the divestment of General Insurance business, helped the company to completely fund its investments in Nabha Power/ Hyderabad Metro in FY17. Even going forward, we anticipate investments to be limited to development businesses and consol capex to moderate to Rs30bn annually vs Rs 80bn over FY12-16,‚Äù said analysts Aditya Bhatia, Pratik Rangnekar and Veenit Prasad from Investec in their August report on the company .L&T‚Äôs electrical and automation business offers a wide range of products and solutions for electricity distribution and control in industries, utilities, infrastructure building and agriculture sectors. Its product portfolios include includes low and medium voltage switchgear systems, industrial and building automation solutions, surveillance systems, energy meters and protection relays and has manufacturing facilities at Navi Mumbai, Ahmednagar, Vadodra, Coimbatore and Mysuru in India as well as in Saudi Arabia, Jebel Ali (UAE), Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and the UK.The business runs six switchgear training centres across the country educating engineers, consultants, contractors, technicians and electricians about good electrical practices. Larsen & Toubro‚Äôs division generated revenues of Rs 4,650 crore and operating profit of a little over Rs 700 crore in 2016-17.Compared to Schneider that has a listed Indian arm, Dublin headquartered Eaton has a small presence in India and have been looking at a bigger play, especially via L&T.Interestingly, both ABB and Schneider are also believed to be competing with PE heavweights KKR, Warburg Pincus and to acquire General Electric‚Äôs Industrial Solutions business for $3 billion. That global M&A is expected to be a key reason why ABB opted out from bidding aggressively for the L&T business.Schneider Corporation that specialises in energy management and automation solutions, spanning hardware, software, and services Global industrial conglomerates has been aggressively expanding its foot print in Indian market. Since 2010 it has made more than half a dozen acquisition that include Luminous, Digilink, Uniflair, Areva T&D, and Invensys among others. Some of them are standalone acquisition some are parts of global deal.But even for Schneider, which has a relatively small operation in India comparing to Siemen AG and ABB, the acquisition will help in making a strong player in one of the fastest growing markets that is far from saturation. Its Indian subsidiary Schneider Electric Infrastructure Limited in which it owns 75 per cent stake, has reported operating profit of Rs 67 crore on a turnover of Rs 1,288 crore, last fiscal. Its market cap is Rs 2,780 crore.Most of the European conglomerates are facing headwinds in their home markets and a slowdown in China, once pegged as the single most important outpost for many. Indian economy that has been on a gradual rebound offers them a sweet spot, feel analysts.More importantly, with a wide footprint, spanning across India, UAE and Saudi Arabia, a potential takeover will further consolidate their presence in several emerging geographies.‚ÄúL&T Ltd has 3 main companies housed in it ‚Äì construction, heavy engineering which includes defence and the electric and automation division. Hydrocarbons is already a separate company with a separate P&L. Consolidation of portfolio is the stated goal so that Naik‚Äôs successor inherits a less sprawling and management portfolio. Since 2015, it is trying to also sell its valves business, said a company official on condition of anonymity.‚Äù"

In terms of disbursement, we have grown 25% and our growth has come from all segments like distribution, transmission renewables. We are working towards realising the the goal of the government of providing assured, affordable and quality power for all in the shortest possible time. Coming to the margins, yes there has been a marginal decline in the margins. However,they continue to remain above 4% as far as NIM is concerned.t is one of the Lanco power projects. We have an overall exposure of about Rs 500 crore. but we are not the sole lenders. There are several other lenders. Our exposure as a proportion of the overall exposure is about 15%. We have made an appropriate provision as mandated by Reserve Bank of India and our gross NPA as proportion of our loan book is less than 2.6% and in net NPA it is sub 2%. Ours is a financial institution with a sole exposure to power sector which has the lowest NPAs among all the peers.Let me say categorically that we are grateful to the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We have carefully studied them and have taken note of those observations. It needs to be abundantly clarified that this is a joint report and pertains to our sister concern PFC. CAG has made pointed comments relating to REC and to PFC. In those observations that have been made, which have been erroneously in my view presented by some of the media outlets, says that we did not adhere to the RBI norms.

Not Everything Green Is Natural Or Herbal. Watch Akshay Kumar Reveal True Ayurveda,"PARTNER

Bollywood‚Äôs torch bearer of fitness and a humble activist, Akshay Kumar believes in talking about anything and everything that is relevant to the masses. From educating people about fitness and self-defense to promoting the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, he has done it all. And once again, Akshay is back with an important message for his fans.

An avid user of Ayurvedic products, Akshay truly believes that Ayurveda is the answer to most of the modern lifestyle problems that we face. Using natural remedies have always been a part of our culture and is the way to go for him. But with the rising trend of using natural products, a number of ayurvedic products have cropped up in the market and not all of them are made using pure ayurvedic means.

In a new commercial for Lever Ayush, Akshay goes all out to point out the na√Øve ways in which we categorize ayurvedic products like skin care creams, soaps, and toothpaste. He points out that not every product that has a green packing or leaves on its packaging are essentially products made of Ayurveda. In a bid to educate us about the Sahi Ayurveda, Akshay talks about Lever Ayush that makes a range of Ayurvedic products using original, time tested ingredient and recipes from ancient ayurvedic texts and granthas. Lever Ayush brings alive ayurvedic recipes from over 5000 years to help solve modern-day beauty problems with their skin care, hair care, oral care products and soaps. Watch the video to know more!"
"ITC to enter healthcare sector with hospital, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket.

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‚Äònationalist‚Äô mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India‚Äôs ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism‚Äôs about freedom for the mind and democracy‚Äôs about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It‚Äôs time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar‚Äôs vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP‚Äôs madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don‚Äôt these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‚Äòsabka saath sabka vikas‚Äô in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‚Äògolf-playing Macaulayputra‚Äô, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities ‚Äì of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation ‚Äì feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn‚Äôt call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that‚Äôs why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler‚Äôs supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent‚Äôs ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That‚Äôs because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other‚Äôs shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It‚Äôs really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That‚Äôs why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament ‚Äì the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet ‚Äì the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism‚Äôs unobtrusive ‚Äòsoft power‚Äô, one that‚Äôs created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It‚Äôs time to change the goal of ‚ÄòHindu Rashtra‚Äô to the more inclusive ‚ÄòIndian Rashtra.‚Äô The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it‚Äôs a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there‚Äôs one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it‚Äôs Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India. Super-cool isn‚Äôt it? Watch the video to virtually experience this cool augmented reality battle with the chilly monsters!"

She fought a legal battle and got the 'Hindustan ki beti' back home within a fortnight. Uzma came back on May 25. The filmmaker wants to show the struggles behind the horrific incident.

Watch A Cyber Security Team Hack An Adorable Robot And Turn It Into A Tomato-Stabbing Psycho,"Elon Musk and other leaders in robotics have already warned the world about what kind of damage rogue robots can do, but this video indicates the problem could be much worse.

If the footage is to be believed, a team from cyber security research firm IOActive hacked into a home assistance robot and turned it into the nightmare from a slasher horror flick.

Alpha 2, produced by UBTech in China, is an adorable little bot designed to help around the house in a small capacity. What IOActive did is update the bot‚Äôs firmware by accessing the USB port on its back, and tweaking it to give them control of its functions. So yes, the most explicit way to demonstrate that probably would be with flashing red eyes, an evil cackle, and a load of tomato stabbing.

The worst part is that the Alpha 2‚Äôs Android OS doesn‚Äôt use code-signing to verify the signature of the update being installed, making the entire process ridiculously easy. It‚Äôs how any average hacker could gain access to your Internet-connected device, and install a malware of their choice.

‚ÄúThis attack serves as an example of how dangerous these systems can be if they are hacked,‚Äù IOActive‚Äôs principal security consultant Lucas Alpa said in a post. ‚ÄúManipulating safety limits and disabling emergency buttons could directly threaten human life‚Äù

So if you think a loophole in an AI‚Äôs code making it go rogue is the bigger problem in the future, there are also malicious actors looking to actively sabotage your robots."
Government must develop its ‚Äòhuman capital‚Äô akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here‚Äôs another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you‚Äôre in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‚Äògovernment capital‚Äô (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks ‚Äî including the policymakers ‚Äî must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind ‚Äî at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations ‚Äî prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn‚Äôt specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government‚Äôs business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one‚Äôs own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‚Äòown‚Äô its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI‚Äôs service, become ‚Äòhuman capital architects‚Äô by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

Over 300 enquiries have already been received by the online medical education company. ‚ÄúWe strive to provide quality education to professionals in the healthcare industry and this programme will bring in that quality for MBA aspirants in healthcare. We believe that the course has a huge potential in terms of generating industry ready professionals. MBA is already one of the most sought after programmes in the higher education space in India. We expect this to be one of our top 5 programmes in the next two years,‚Äù said Gerald Jaideep , CEO, Medvarsity.The partnership between Medvarsity and Amity University is currently signed for three years but both the institutions look forward to a longer association. ‚ÄúHealthcare has become one of the largest sectors in India -- both in terms of revenue and employment, with market size of over $100 billion with 15% estimated growth every year. The industry has a huge potential for employment. We will ensure that students are educated about the course and employment opportunities across the country, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities,‚Äù said Ajit Chauhan, Vice Chairman, Amity University Online.Talking about challenges, Chauhan said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really see a challenge in programme delivery. The internship programme will present a strong proposition for students. However, what we really need to focus is on programme awareness and possible career opportunities for students. Since MBA with specialization in healthcare management is still at a nascent stage in comparison to other specialization programmes in healthcare and therefore it needs more awareness education among students.‚ÄùThis year, Medvarsity has also partnered with Cornell University to provide online certification programmes in healthcare education."

SC issues show cause notice to BCCI top brass

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 08:53 PM

BCCI's top brass have been asked to appear personally by the SC for the next hearing. ¬© Getty

The Supreme Court, on Wednesday (August 23), issued a show cause notice to the top brass of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, namely acting President CK Khanna, secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, asking them to personally appear on September 19 (next date of hearing) and offer their explanation to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) for the continued resistance towards the implementation of the Justice RM Lodha panel reforms.

While the CoA reiterated to the apex court that not a single recommendation had been implemented till date, the Supreme Court asked the CoA to prepare the draft constitution in line with the July 24, 2017 order.

However, the apex court didn't heed to the request made by the CoA in its fifth status report regarding their expulsion.

The hearing on the latest status report submitted by the CoA on BCCI's functioning was originally meant to take place last week, before it was adjourned to Wednesday (August 23).

Earlier, in its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Vinod Rai-led Committee of Administrators was scathing in its criticism of the BCCI. The CoA had called for the expulsion of the current office bearers of the board for non-compliance of the court's orders to implement the Lodha reforms. Taking into account the court's order dated January 2, that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their positions with the board, the CoA requested the three-member bench for the removal of acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry and acting president CK Khanna.

The CoA had also noted that in the absence of a working committee, administrators, and not the office-bearers needed to be given the authority to manage the board's affairs. The CoA had also added that the office bearers were limiting the role of the board CEO Rahul Johri.

Incidentally, during the Special General Meeting (SGM) held on July 26 this year, Johri wasn't allowed to partake in the meeting under intriguing circumstances. Choudhary had then observed that the Apex Court in its judgment dated July 24 had ruled only office-bearers with regard to state associations eligible to attend the SGM. Therefore, the board claimed to have been following the order of the Supreme Court ""in letter and spirit"".

The ruling that was taken into account to deny Johri's participation in the meeting was related to CoA's objection about N Srinivasan and Niranjan Shah attending BCCI's meetings. The apex court had stated on July 24 that only the office bearers of the state associations can attend BCCI's meetings.

CoA had also stated in its report that the board was impeding the implementation of the 'new administrative structure' which is based on accountability and clarity. The Supreme Court, on their part, had asked the BCCI to identify those ""exceptional and extremely limited areas of difficulty"" in relation to implementation of the Lodha reforms.

At its Special General Meeting held on July 26, the BCCI had then said the following needed to be re-examined: one state-one vote policy, the number of members in selection committees (which had been reduced to three from five), the concept of associate membership, the segregation in relation to functions executed by office bearers and paid professionals, disqualifications or restrictions on office-bearers in terms of age cap, tenure, cooling-off period and the formation of Apex Council.

The three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud had given its nod to reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership.

In its Status report, the CoA, however, had quoted Rai and said, ""the heart, kidney and lungs are being taken out of these reforms"" in relation to the board observing that the crux of the reforms approved by the Supreme Court was ""impracticable.""

Last year, in a landmark judgment on July 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had approved majority of the recommendations put forth by the three committee, led by retired Chief Justice RM Lodha. The board, on the other hand, was given a deadline of six months to implement the accepted reforms.

Privacy as fundamental right: Minding our business,"By Smriti Parsheera

The Supreme Court‚Äôs upcoming verdict on whether we have a fundamental right to privacy will be one of the most momentous decisions of our times. It is, however, inopportune that this vital issue has arisen as an offshoot to the Aadhaar litigation.

Both sides are alive to the fact that the decision will take them a step closer or further from proving their stance in the main petition. This has undeniably coloured the arguments in court. The real implications of the nine-judge decision will, however, run much deeper than the immediate questions of Aadhaar.

The term ‚Äòprivacy‚Äô, while not expressly spelt out under the Constitution, forms the crux of what it means to live a dignified life in a liberal democracy. The concept of a secret ballot, for instance, finds its origin in the need for ‚Äòpolitical privacy‚Äô, our ability to vote anonymously, without the promise of reward or fear of persecution. Section 94 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, codifies this right by providing that a person cannot be mandated to disclose for whom she has voted, not even before a court of law.

Then there‚Äôs ‚Äòphysical privacy‚Äô that guards a person‚Äôs body and physical space from unwelcome intrusions. ‚ÄòBehavioural privacy‚Äô gives us the freedom to keep private our religious practices, sexual orientation and associations. ‚ÄòInformational privacy‚Äô deals with the expectation of privacy in the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. ‚ÄòCognitive privacy‚Äô calls for new thinking about the use of technologies that can decipher thoughts and brain activities.

Some of these rights are already covered by existing constitutional provisions, some have been protected under laws, while others are still waiting to be born. A legal right can, however, not be a substitute for a fundamental right. Legal rights can be conferred and withdrawn at will and their validity rests on conformity with the Constitution.

The declaration of privacy as a fundamental right will not imply that it will become an unassailable, paramount right, which can never be undone. The contours of privacy, and the limitations on its scope, will have to evolve through jurisprudence developed by the courts. Even until recently, when we believed privacy to be an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, the Supreme Court had pointed on several occasions that privacy is not an absolute right.

For instance, in Mr X vs Hospital Z ((1998) 8 SCC 296), while dealing with the right to confidentiality of an HIV patient, the court held that in case of a conflict between right to privacy and right to health of another, the latter prevails. In another case, ordering a person to undergo a medical examination was not regarded as being violative of the person‚Äôs right to privacy where the test was necessary to determine unsoundness of mind, a recognised ground for divorce. The person could still refuse the medical examination, allowing the court to draw an adverse inference (Sharda vs Dharmpal, AIR 2003 SC 3450).

Conferring privacy with the status of afundamental right will achieve two key goals. One, it will offer a guaranteed constitutional framework to test against ingressions into the various dimensions of privacy. Two, it will provide courts with greater confidence when comparing the tradeoffs between privacy and other constitutional protections.

The separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary demands that courts cannot question the wisdom of legislative actions. So, any law, no matter how odious it may appear, cannot be struck down by a court unless covered by certain specific grounds. These grounds, as stated most recently in the Aadhaar-PAN case (WP Civil No. 247 of 2017), are that the legislature did not have the competence to make the law; or the law is void for being in violation of any of the fundamental rights or any other constitutional provisions.

If privacy is not to be a fundamental right, what protection would we have against future transgressions of this right by various laws? Always having to derive this right from other provisions in the Constitution would dilute its efficacy. Relying on political processes to solve the issue would be too little, too late.

The key challenge, therefore, is not just about the privacy implications of the Aadhaar Act, or any other legislation, but the unforeseen laws and practices of the days to come. A few years ago, the Bombay High Court directed the UIDAI to share the biometric information of Aadhaar holders in Goa to aid the CBI in a rape investigation. The UIDAI challenged this before the court on grounds of privacy, which was accepted by the court.

The passage of the Aadhaar Act has now closed the door on such speculative searches, at least so far as biometric data is concerned. If the law were to be subsequently amended to allow biometric data to be shared for investigation and surveillance purposes, one would like to believe that the supporters of the Aadhaar architecture will join the detractors in opposing such a move. What we will need then is a fundamental right to privacy against which the actions of the legislature can be tested.

"Price caps on most medical devices soon?, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: A draft national medical devices policy that could bring most medical devices within the ambit of price regulation while also outlining measures to boost local manufacturing of devices has been circulated by the Centre.The proposal, which comes soon after a draft national pharma policy , marks continued government activism to reduce costs of medical care and control insurance payouts in view of steep treatment and hospitalisation expenses in the private sector. Currently, only a few critical medical devices are under indirect price control and 80% of all devices are imported products.This poses a challenge for the government when regulating prices of even select devices like stents or knee implants as it has to base its calculations on landed price of imports.The draft suggests creation of a national medical devices authority to promote local manufacturing as well as a separate pricing policy and a division under the national pharmaceutical pricing authority ( NPPA ) to regulate the price of such devices. ‚ÄúThe government may announce a separate policy enunciating the principles for regulating prices of identified medical devices and implement the same by notifying a separate medical devices prices control order,‚Äù the draft says.It suggests amending the Essential Commodities Act and the scope of NPPA‚Äôs functions and, instead, create a separate body ‚Äì national medical devices authority ‚Äì to boost growth of the medical devices sector. The medical devices market in India is estimated at around $7 billion, growing annually at around 15%. The department will also meet industry bodies on Thursday at New Delhi‚Äôs FICCI to discuss the draft policy.However, industry executives said the department has re-circulated a 2015 draft policy without changes though the industry has submitted its several recommendations.‚ÄúWe do not understand the purpose of this meeting. For pharmaceuticals, DoP has circulated a fresh draft, whereas in case of medical devices there are no changes in the draft even after two years of deliberations. We have already submitted our recommendations,‚Äù says Rajiv Nath , forum coordinator for the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry.Civil society representatives say the draft policy does not consider patients‚Äô interest. It alleged that DoP has bypassed civil society and public health groups on draft pharma policy and medical devices. ‚ÄúThe DoP denied us even an observer status in Thursday‚Äôs meeting,‚Äù Malini Aisola of the All India Drug Action Network, a civil society group, said.The draft policy also suggests DoP bring a detailed proposal for creation of the new authority in six months. The autonomous body will be under the DoP."
"Time for UCC: If unifying India is Modi‚Äôs mantra, uniform civil code with minority backing will transform Indian society","The Supreme Court judgment outlawing instant triple talaq was a landmark decision but it also highlights difficulties faced by judges in resolving thorny issues that overlap between civil matters and personal laws. Justices Nariman, Lalit and Joseph took the stand that triple talaq is not integral to the practice of Islam and isn‚Äôt protected by Article 25(1) safeguarding religious freedoms. But Justice Joseph disagreed with the Nariman-Lalit view that a colonial-era legislation surrendering ‚Äúmarriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq‚Äù to personal law regulated triple talaq, and hence must be tested against Article 14 guaranteeing equal protection of the law.

Instead Justice Joseph, like Justices Khehar and Nazeer, reaffirmed that the law applicable to Muslims ‚Äúshall only be their personal law namely Shariat‚Äù and then proceeded to ascertain whether triple talaq was sanctioned by Quran. But should judges be forced into laboured interpretations of religious laws in matters like marriage that fall within the domain of civil law? All three judgments on triple talaq conducted their own inquiries into Muslim laws, on essentially theological issues, and arrived at different interpretations.

For women coping with marital, divorce, inheritance and alimony disputes, vacuum in the statute on grounds of primacy of personal laws is a gross violation of Article 14. Justices Khehar and Nazeer, with qualified support from Justice Joseph, implored Parliament to extend the codification of laws, ‚Äúan issue of paramount importance‚Äù, to Muslims too. But codification of personal laws will not end discrimination if the personal law is fundamentally discriminatory. Even the Hindu codes still have provisions that favour men over women. A Uniform Civil Code (UCC) would bring clarity, cut through the messiness necessitated by dealing with abstruse theological matters, and actualise Article 14‚Äôs promise of equality.

But UCC seems tough to achieve in today‚Äôs fractious political climate. To bring it closer, every party must drop the selective secularism it currently practises and move towards genuine secularism. This responsibility falls especially heavily on BJP and NDA as they are politically dominant in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is best placed in decades to take the initiative. He has parliamentary backing and his party manifesto promised a UCC if elected. But Modi must first win minority backing by propounding an inclusive agenda in all walks of public life. After GST on the economic front, UCC is the ultimate measure to ‚Äúunify‚Äù Indian society."
Is our criminal justice delivery system finally becoming tech-savvy?,"The federalisation, centralisation, or unification ‚Äì call it what you may ‚Äì of the country, despite all the divisive political rhetoric and polarising acts, is proceeding on multiple tracks as we speak. The assumption of power by a majority government in 2014 gave impetus to this process. The successful rollout of GST best exemplifies this. There is talk of bringing more entries on the state list to the concurrent list to create centralized processes that ensure economies of scale, uniformity, and ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù outlook. Suddenly, even the Uniform Civil Code looks possible. No less in import and impact is the launch of the Digital Police Project under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) database. This is despite police being a subject in the State List of the Constitution and many states suspecting that CCTNS was a Union ploy to annex their police powers. But good sense prevailed and the imperative of cyber networking progressed, albeit at a slow pace.

CCTNS now allows citizens to register FIRs online, a landmark move which saves complainants, especially those grievously wronged or injured, the suffering and trauma of visiting police stations. In one stroke it inverts the colonial legacy that made the police station an object of fear and resentment and makes it just another public service which citizens can avail of from any location. The Kerala Police admitted as much when it categorized certain police stations as ‚ÄúJan Maitri‚Äù police stations were citizens are guaranteed to receive exemplary courtesy and service from police officers. Feudal tendencies like prostrating before the daroga to plead for registering an FIR now give way to an e-mail alerting the daroga that an FIR has already been lodged without His Majesty‚Äôs permission.

The CCTNS will also offer seven other important services in 34 States relating to person and address verification. Verification of employees, tenants, nurses, seeking permission for hosting public events, tracking lost and found articles, and following up on vehicle theft can now take place through CCTNS without mandatory visits to the police station. The home ministry also claimed that police verification of passport applications will also proceed online. Taken together all these measures are convenient and save time for citizens and cops. CCTNS will hopefully ensure foolproof verification of criminal antecedents. This is an important step which can help net repeat offenders like the Uber taxi driver Shiv Kumar Yadav who raped a 27-year-old woman executive and was a suspect in another rape case.

At the launch, Union home minister Rajnath Singh said the CCTNS portal will provide investigators with a complete history of any criminal from anywhere across the country. Often police forces struggle to identify inter-state criminal networks or criminals who ensure that they do not repeat a crime in the same police station precincts to prevent police officers from creating a pattern of crimes. Rajnath also claimed that steps were being taken to integrate different organs of the criminal justice delivery system like the police, courts, prisons, prosecution, forensic laboratories, and juvenile homes through the CCTNS.

This can help significantly expedite trials. Currently, when court issues warrants and summons these are executed through the police. But until the next date of hearing judges and magistrates have no idea whether the summons/warrants have been executed. Often when they return without being executed, hearings become infructuous and have to be adjourned. The case with forensic labs is no different. Trial court judges and police wait inordinately long periods for testing of samples and return of results. A centralized system that can help judicial and police staff monitor progress and demand expedited disposal will help. Equally important is the integration of prisons with courts and police stations. A central system that can coordinate prisoner information, dates of their hearing, number of days, months and years they have lived in prison under trial, or under sentence makes for progressive reform and may help address the unacceptable fact that two-thirds of our prisons are choked by long incarcerated under-trials.

It is important to free police personnel from needless paper work and help them focus on their law and order and crime detection tasks. The CCTNS is not just a digital initiative but can turn around the image of police forces if it meets the vision enunciated by Rajnath Singh. It is important that the data is jealously guarded, does not fall into the hands of hackers, and does not violate the privacy of suspected criminals. While I am not certain whether the colonial legacy of the police force will retreat with digital initiatives like CCTNS such modernisation is always welcome."

"Take speedy decisions, PM to bureaucracy, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all wings of the government to work in a synchronised manner and pressed the bureaucracy to take speedy decisions, promising that honest decision-making with good intention would always be encouraged.

Good governance should be a priority for the officers, he said during an interaction with a group of over 70 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries in the central government, according to a PMO statement.

Modi asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.

The prime minister said the combination of development and good governance is essential for the welfare and satisfaction of citizens, the statement said about the interaction that took place last evening.

He emphasised the need for all wings of the government to work in harmony and synchronisation to achieve the best possible results, it added.

Underlining the importance of breaking silos, he pressed for efficient internal communication between various departments of the government.

Modi said all officers must keep the poor and the ordinary citizens in their minds while taking decisions, the PMO said.

The prime minister said this was a unique opportunity for the officers to deliver their utmost for the benefit of the nation.

He underlined the necessity of speed and efficiency in decision-making and said that honest decision-making with good intention would always be encouraged by the union government, the statement said.

During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as a digital and smart governance, administrative procedures and accountability, transparency, doubling of farmers' income, skill development, Swachh Bharat, consumer rights, environment protection, and building of New India by 2022, the PMO said.

The prime minister said the world is looking towards India with positive expectations.

He said the entire world feels that a successful India is vital for a global balance.

There is also a strong undercurrent for excellence from the common citizens of India, he said, adding that youth from humble backgrounds, with very limited resources are achieving best positions in competitive exams and sports.

He asked the officers to work to promote this spontaneous upsurge of talent, recalling the spirit and energy that they themselves would have possessed in the first three years of their service."
"PPA renegotiation by discoms may adversely impact RE sector growth: ICRA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Recent attempts by state-owned power distribution utilities ( discoms ) in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh to renegotiate or cancel signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with wind and solar power developers could have an adverse impact on the renewable energy (RE) sector, credit ratings agency ICRA has said.If implemented, the renegotiation could also impact the credit profile of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and investment interest from the private sector, the agency said. ‚ÄúSignificant uncertainty exists for wind-based IPPs which have recently signed PPAs based on feed-in tariffs. The same is estimated to be about 830 MW in Andhra Pradesh and 490 MW in Karnataka. Such cancellation or renegotiation, if finalized by discoms, may be legally challenged by the affected IPPs and the resolution of the same could be a protracted affair,‚Äù Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head, ICRA said.He, however, added that the agency understands the centre is trying to dissuade state discoms from such unilateral action on PPAs.Apart from this, several PPAs tied-up by wind and solar power developers with state-owned discoms do not have any termination penalty clause related to any discom in the event of default, the report stated. These PPAs usually do not have any deemed generation clause and are based on single part tariff ‚Äì which is linked to actual generation.‚ÄúAs a result, the wind and solar energy projects with PPAs at a relatively higher tariff in comparison with average power purchase cost of the off-taker discom remains exposed to a risk of forced back-down / grid curtailment, a situation which has occasionally been seen in a few states in the past,‚Äù the report said.This also comes at a time reverse auction-based bidding mechanism has helped in lowering the wind power tariffs under the 1,000 MW scheme by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE). It has prompted discoms to stop signing PPAs based on feed-in tariff and instead opt for the auction route.‚ÄúThe visibility for actual wind-based capacity addition remains quite weak in near term. Nonetheless, long term demand drivers remain intact due to an improved tariff competitiveness of wind and solar energy against conventional energy sources, large untapped renewable potential and strong policy and regulatory support. However, the resolution of the PPA renegotiation or cancellation issue remains crucial to retain investor interest in the sector,‚Äù Majumdar said.The tendering process for projects as announced by discoms in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and the second 1,000 MW scheme by MNRE is yet to be concluded."

"Good time to join the dots, cross the T‚Äôs","By Karan Singh

We are on the cusp of a broad-based consolidation wave in Indian business. One has only to read the headlines to grasp the heightened level of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity across sectors. These big-ticket deals are driven by emerging opportunities and led by dominant players who are reshaping the industry structure within their sectors.

In telecom, the number of service providers has fallen from more than 10 to 4-5. The most recent merger proposed between Vodafone and Idea will create an entity with a combined enterprise value of an eye-popping $23 billion, making it the largest telecom company in India. Among old-economy companies, UltraTech Cement closed its $2.4-billion acquisition of Jaypee Group‚Äôs cement assets. Even the relatively young e-commerce sector has been reduced to a two-horse race between Flipkart and Amazon.

The last financial year saw a record level of M&A deals, valued at $66.2 billion. This year promises to be even bigger. Incidentally, a majority of 2017 acquisitions have been domestic, rather than cross-border, deals.

What is driving this surge? And what lessons do these deals offer for corporates? There are four broad triggers behind the heightened action.

Industry disruption: A prime example is of Reliance Jio, which compelled other telcos to respond so that they could remain viable and improve their market position ‚Äî with a focus on increasing access to spectrum, retaining customers and weeding out duplicate costs to protect their operating economics.

Distressed assets: Distressed assets are allowing stronger players to improve their strategic positions cost-effectively, as in the cement and power industries. Jaypee, for instance, has had to sell its cement assets to pare down its debt.

Regulatory changes: Regulatory changes and moves such as consolidation of banks, notably the merger of the State Bank of India (SBI) and its associate banks, are the next big trigger.

Overseas assets: Availability of reasonably priced overseas assets allows Indian players to solidify and expand their global strategic aspirations. They are doing this smartly by accessing cheaper overseas financing and benefiting from richer Indian multiples. Motherson Sumi‚Äôs acquisition of PKC Group, the Finnish maker of automotive wiring systems, is a case in point.

These trends also indicate that the market is starting to mature. Companies are preparing to take advantage of the next chapter of growth and positioning themselves to capture a share of future profit pools.

However, those considering M&A should weigh the following factors. cess. First, periods of turbulence are crucibles of both opportunity and risk, offering a chance to reshuffle decks. Bain data from the US suggests that during such periods, there is potential for companies to move up or down two quartiles in terms of market position. And for those changes to endure. Although the possible rewards are great for strong companies, weak players can make big mistakes: if not handled strategically or not well-executed, M&A actions may create lasting casualties.

Second, acquisitions that improve strategic leadership, undertaken by companies performing well, have higher odds of success. So, what are the economic rules for profit-making in the industry? Is it about being scale-driven (global, national or regional)? Or is it about share position in premium categories (consumer products), or access to proprietary assets, or resources that drive value creation?

Third, successful M&A deals are usually carried out by serial acquirers with a repeatable model, not by companies that make big bets infrequently. M&A moves by companies that have a weak core can also be disastrous.

Fourth, diligence and integration are both critical in ensuring suc-cess. To avoid getting caught up in deal fever and overbidding, companies need to establish a clear and strategic deal thesis and test it objectively during diligence. During integration, it is vital to follow the money and focus heavily on the key value drivers of the deal. It is equally important to customise the integration approach depending on company size and whether it is a scale or scope deal.

Finally, the importance of noregret moves cannot be overemphasised. These include reassessment of strategy and rules of the game as industry dynamics change; a focus on strengthening customer loyalty and differentiation as competitive intensity increases; and, from a defensive point of view, a focus on achieving the highest level of cost efficiency.

A superabundance of capital will contribute to the trend, with corporate and financial investors sitting on significant dry powder they can deploy. Armed with an understanding of today‚Äôs M&A landscape, companies can leverage the unfolding opportunity for strategic boldness, and for forging a new path to economic leadership.

"Fujifilm aims to double revenues in India by 2020, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Chennai: Fujifilm India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan-based Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, is aiming to more than double revenues by 2020, on the back of huge demand for its digital medical devices, a top official said here today.

The company had recorded revenues of Rs 900 crore in 2015, Fujifilm India managing director Yasunobu Nishiyama said.

""Our revenue was Rs 900 crore in (FY) 2015. This year we are expecting Rs 1,400 crore. By 2020, we are expecting revenues of Rs 1,800 crore..."", he told reporters.

Nishiyama and senior company officials were here to unveil the company's first Experiental Zone -- Wonder Photo Shop at the Express Avenue Mall here.

""We are expecting to grow by 14 per cent this year."", he said to a query.

Asked on those factors that would drive the company to double its revenues from India operations, Nishiyama said 50 per cent of revenue was contributed from digital medical device business, remaining from photo-imaging and graphic card business, respectively.

""The demand for digital medical devices is increasing by 15-20 per cent (year-on-year)"", he said, adding the market potential in the country was ""huge"".

To a query on inauguration of Wonder Photo Shop business, he said, ""investment in one Wonder Photo Shop will be Rs three crore. We are planning to have 8-10 Wonder Photo Shops across India.""

The company would be investing around Rs 30 crore for expansion of Wonder Photo Shops over the next three years, he said.

On Fujifilm Wonder Photo Shop, he said the company had 18 Wonder Photo Shops in various countries including Europe, North America, Australia, China, Russia.

""The first Wonder Photo Shop was opened in Tokyo in February 2014,"" he added."
Spare the taxpayer: Recapitalisation of public sector banks needs to come with governance reforms,"Financial results of public sector banks for April-June quarter show that they remain fragile. Collectively, they made a loss when their private sector peers turned in profits. This performance was not a one-off. Three years ago, a Reserve Bank of India committee concluded that government as shareholder has suffered negative returns over decades. If this situation prevails in public sector banking, a commercial endeavour, it is because successive governments are able to pass on losses to taxpayers. This cannot continue any longer.

NDA has promised to recapitalise its loss making banks and merge some of the weaker ones with sound banks. This is inadequate to deal with a systemic problem where banks flounder once every decade. Recapitalisation, therefore, must be accompanied by deeper banking reforms or else hapless taxpayers will soon be presented with another bailout bill. The primary cause for the current state of affairs is government‚Äôs majority stake in banks. This forces public sector banks to deal with an additional regulatory layer in the form of the finance ministry. This also leads to attendant problems such as banking heads with too short a tenure, low pay scales and fear of multiple investigators scrutinising commercial decisions in hope of unearthing ‚Äòcorruption‚Äô.

Around 17 years ago in an earlier NDA government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha proposed lowering government‚Äôs stake to 33% which would have removed some constraints public sector bankers work under. This would have provided bankers space to be more nimble and take timely decisions. It is time for current finance minister Arun Jaitley to actualise his predecessor‚Äôs plan.

De Villiers gives up ODI captaincy; available to play all three formats

South African batsman AB de Villiers has stepped down as the captain of the One-Day International side with immediate effect. With so much speculation surrounding his Test future, de Villiers also made it clear on Wednesday (August 23) that he will be available to play in all three formats of the game from late September when South Africa begin their home season.

He last led South Africa in ODIs during the Champions Trophy in May-June, which ended in major disappointment as the side couldn't even make it past the Group Stages. Following the tournament, he had to fill in temporarily for Faf du Plessis as the T20I skipper for the series against England.

Making the announcement through a video released on his app, de Villiers felt that it was time for someone else to take over the role. He also pulled his weight behind Faf du Plessis, who has done a good job leading the Test and T20I teams.

""Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I've informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,"" de Villiers said. ""It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for somebody else to lead the ODI team forward.""

There has been a lot of speculation and even disappointment among fans, about him opting out of Test matches. It has led to much concern over his future in the longest format of the game. De Villiers last played a Test in January 2016, against England, and has since been unavailable due to either injury or workload concerns. Addressing those doubts, de Villiers completely dismissed suggestions that he was putting himself before the team.

""A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,"" de Villiers stated. ""Over the past year or so, I've tried to manage my commitments. I've felt mentally and physically tired. Playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll. Together with Cricket South Africa, we've tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say that I'm picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas and even to suggest I'm somehow putting myself before the team. This is simply not true. Playing for South Africa is and will always be the greatest privilege of my life.

""Following this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived. I want to get back on the field and I have assured the national selectors that I'll be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly. But I'll be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.""

South Africa's next assignment is against Bangladesh, when they come touring in late September. The tour begins with a two-Test series, followed by three ODIs and two T20Is.

"Cancer hospitals: Healthcare Global to set up 12 new hospitals in 18 months, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Healthcare Global Enterprises (HCG), a Bengaluru-based chain of specialised cancer care centres, plans to set up a dozen new hospitals over the next 18 months, the publicly traded company‚Äôs chairman, BS Ajai Kumar, said.HCG plans to expand its network of cancer care centres to about 30 from 21 now, and will add a few more IVF clinics to its existing network, Kumar told ET.HCG has a partnership with Kamini Rao, a leading medical practitioner in the field of assisted reproduction, to run IVF clinics under the brand name ‚ÄòMilann‚Äô.The IVF clinics contributed about a tenth of HCG‚Äôs revenues of Rs 700 crore for the previous financial year.Founded 27 years ago by Kumar, a doctor trained at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, the hospital chain has expanded to include centres in cities such as Cuttack, Ahmedabad and Vijayawada.It recently acquired a facility in Kenya‚Äôs capital, Nairobi, and is scouting for more facilities in Africa and the Middle East.Kumar, 66, who returned to India after practicing as a medical and radiation oncologist for nearly two decades in the US, said HCG‚Äôs model-‚Äîwhat he described as ‚Äòvalue based medicine‚Äô‚Äî has been chosen as a case study by the Harvard Business Review and the World Bank, as the hospital chain has been able to drive down the cost of cancer treatment to almost a tenth of global prices in some cases while achieving the same outcomes.The hospital chain has a stated policy of not to invest in land and takes up facilities on lease rental model from owners. In certain cases, it also enters into partnerships with doctors who own the land and building.A 60-bed facility could cost as much as Rs 35-40 crore to build, not including real estate costs, according to Kumar.HCG raised Rs 650 crore through an initial public offering of shares in March last year. International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, and Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec were among investors that subscribed to shares in the offering.The family office of Wipro founder Azim Premji and Singapore state investor Temasek divested partial stakes in the IPO but continue to remain prominent investors in the company."

"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don‚Äôt want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don‚Äôt interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that‚Äôs the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors‚Äô well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."
"Smile Train aims to empower local doctors and professionals to treat patients : Dr. Alvaro Figueroa, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Co-Director, Rush Craniofacial Center, Chicago and also Member, Medical Advisory Board, Smile Train , talks about the various protocols followed by Smile Train in providing effective cleft care. Edited excerpts:Effective cleft care cannot be provided by just one professional, it needs to be done by a group of professionals because patients that are born with cleft lips and palates have many needs that one specialist cannot treat by himself/herself. Usually the team is composed of several members, a surgeon, a paediatrician, anaesthesiologist and many medical support professionals.At Smile Train, in addition to providing cleft repair surgeries , we focus on comprehensive transformation with expert interventions for pre and post-operative care. Hence, we have specialists from dentistry, orthodontics, speech therapy, hearing aids, psychology and mental health, and social workers. We at Smile Train believe in not just providing surgery to heal the cleft visibly, but also provide comprehensive cleft care to improve speech so that children born with clefts can lead a normal life. Speech therapists and orthodontists play an integral role in ensuring that quality comprehensive care is provided to all.The impact at the end of the entire process, is a complete transformation in the patient who emerges as a confident and beautiful individual.Smile Train is a charity that was started in 1999 and since then, has provided help and assistance in cleft care across 85 countries. India and China are two of the biggest programs and recipients of this support. Smile Train aims to empower local doctors and professionals to treat patients with cleft lips and palates and enable them to provide treatment to people in their own communities. Smile Train does not rely on professionals coming from other countries to do the treatment. This ‚Äòteach-a-man-to-fish‚Äô model is also helping build capacity in these countries to enable local hospitals and doctors to provide free cleft care to children throughout the year, rather than flying in missions from abroad, intermittently. It has also enabled us to provide ancillary services such as speech therapy and orthodontics to ensure comprehensive cleft care.Through a fair and totally transparent but highly rigorous process of screening, Smile Train credentials hospitals and surgeons who deliver safe, quality treatment to children. An independent, voluntary team of very senior and celebrated plastic surgeons and anaesthesiologists form the Smile Train Medical Advisory Board which credentials hospitals that apply to become a partner.Once the Board is convinced that the hospital is equipped with safety protocols and has experienced surgeons and associated medical staff to provide safe surgeries to children, the hospital enters into a formal agreement with Smile Train. As of today, Smile Train works with close to 1100 partner hospitals in over 85 countries. In India, Smile Train works with 160 partner hospitals and over 250 partner surgeons.At Smile Train, safety and quality come first. All treatment partnerships are strictly required to follow Smile Train's Quality Improvement Protocol, which lays down the basic elements needed to ensure safe surgeries and provide ongoing improvement of the quality of outcomes. The surgery of every patient is closely evaluated, and follow-up surgeries or ancillary treatments and therapies, such as orthodontics, speech therapy, etc., are provided accordingly. When a team has been approved by Smile Train, there are different requirements that partners need to fulfil, and one of the requirements is documentation of what they are doing.We document our patients‚Äô progress for two reasons ‚Äì firstly, to evaluate and assess what the team is doing to ensure there is proof of effective utilization of grants. The second and important factor is that documentation of patients especially at the critical stages of surgical care or other services, allows teams to monitor the progress of their patients on a long term basis.Eventually, this information will help us improve our services across teams around the world, and would help individual teams to determine how well they are performing, since Smile Train grades some of these records that the teams are sending. If we determine the quality of surgeries do not meet the global quality standards, Smile Train will find ways to train and upskill doctors and facilitate access to additional support.Doctors are provided with opportunities to attend international conferences, engage with well-known partner surgeons to adopt and implement best practices in the field. Our partner doctors ensure that protocols set by Smile Train are adhered to at all times. Visits by an independent team are conducted to maintain a close check on the surgeries being performed at our partner hospitals."
Seeing rail safety as a systemic factor,"Yet another rail accident points to the pressing need to revisit the issue of safety from an organisational perspective. As former General Manager Sarabjit Arjan Singh said on this page (February 11, 2017), the Railways must move away from inquiring into the chain of events that led to an accident to identifying what, in the structure and functioning of the organisation, led to decisions that produced the accident. Human error is identified as the culprit in most inquiries. But why do Railway humans err repeatedly in this disastrous fashion? Does the Railways specialise in recruiting bad apples?

In the recent Utkal Express derailment, the tracks under repair were not closed for traffic, and the train was allowed to speed along. In the Kaifiyat Express accident, a dumper was left on the tracks. A culture of safety is conspicuous by its absence. Once the Railways operate more trains than the tracks can handle, complete with the capacity reduction that accompanies periodic track repairs, its minders are constantly called upon to make trade-offs between safety and making the trains run on time. Block off traffic, so that the track can be repaired thoroughly, or do a hasty job of the repair so as to spare Railways the flak for late trains? If someone gets the trade-off wrong, it is easy to send him off on leave or premature retirement. But what of the decision to allocate less money to extending track capacity and more to running new trains, while the overall budget for investment stands constrained because of the fear of raising fares? There is little point in fixing blame on some individuals.

Just as sending a hundred satellites into space makes India‚Äôs brand value rise, frequent rail accidents dent it too. It is in everyone‚Äôs interest to overhaul the culture of the Railways to make safety an integral part of all decisions."

Her Past With Ranbir Is The Reason Why Katrina Asked Makers To Change Title Of Her Next Film!,"Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma's next with Aanand L Rai has been in news since very long. The trio, who was last seen in Jab Tak Hai Jaan is coming together for another film and the project was initially titled Katrina Meri Jaan, claim reports.

However, just a few days ago, it was confirmed that the title of the film has changed. Katrina clarified rumors related to the film and said,

Tiger shoot ......... 44 degrees üòé play time with @biancahartkopf and @zahirabbaskhan A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) on Aug 4, 2017 at 9:41pm PDT

‚ÄúI play an actress in the film, but I don‚Äôt play myself. I‚Äôm not Katrina Kaif. My character has a different name in the film. So, it obviously cannot be called Katrina Meri Jaan.‚Äù

But now reports claim that it was Katrina who wanted to change the title of the film. It was after noticing the similarities between her real life, her affair with Ranbir Kapoor that Katrina didn't want her name to be used in the title since she didn't want people to notice that it was based on her life.

A DNA report has quoted a source saying, ""Especially, because the character of the actress in the film goes through a terrible breakup with her actor-boyfriend. Given that Ranbir and Katrina‚Äôs breakup is still being talked about, she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with the similarities being drawn between her reel and real life. It was too close to reality, so she requested Aanand to use a different name for her character.‚Äù

And that's when the entire team of the film was convinced and decided to not name the film Katrina, Meri Jaan. Umm, okay then. We understand the x-factor here, Kat!

Faf du Plessis to lead World XI in 3 T20Is in Pakistan

The World XI side that will tour Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in September, will be led by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, PCB chief Najam Sethi announced in a press conference on Thursday (August 24). The first two T20Is of the Independence Cup will be played on September 12 and 13, and the final game will be played on September 15, in Lahore.

The squad boasts of as many as five South Africa players, namely Hashim Amla, David Miller, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir, apart from skipper du Plessis himself. The star-studded 14-member squad will feature three Australians too - George Bailey, Ben Cutting and wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine. Darren Sammy, who was a part of the Pakistan Super League 2 Final, will lead the West Indian representation alongside Samuel Badree.

There is one player each from England, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, in Paul Collingwood, Tamim Iqbal, Thisara Perera and Grant Elliott respectively. The only countries which do not have a representation in the World XI squad are India, and Zimbabwe. Andy Flower was appointed coach of the touring side previously.

Faf du Plessis (C), Hashim Amla, Samuel Badree, George Bailey, Paul Collingwood, Ben Cutting, Grant Elliott, Tamim Iqbal, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Tim Paine, Thisara Perera, Imran Tahir, Darren Sammy

""I am honored to have been appointed as the captain of such a diverse, attractive and well balanced side. Like most of the players, I look forward to my maiden tour of Lahore and play my part in the safe and gradual resumption of international cricket in Pakistan,"" du Plessis said on the momentous occasion.

""All the members of the squad have complete faith in the assessment and judgement of the security experts who have assured that there will be no compromise on the safety and security of all those involved in the series. As professionals, we are being paid to play in the series but the bottom line is that if we don't feel safe, no amount of money can get us there. In this background, we will land in Lahore with nothing except cricket on our minds.

""In my career, I have featured in some very exciting matches against Pakistan but to play in Pakistan in front of its passionate supporters, will be a unique experience which I cannot wait to explain. As a player I understand the importance of playing in front of home crowds and that is something I am sure that Pakistani players will relish,"" du Plessis added.

The PCB chairman, who has been in the public eye for his constant attempts to bring international cricket to Pakistan, looked a relieved man at the press conference but didn't conceal the enormity of the efforts that they had to put in to get as close to this. ""From putting this World XI together to getting people on board, to pull in 1.2 billion dollars to put in place the requisite security plans for the security agents and officials to visit our country and assess the arrangements, all of this would not have been possible without the relentless support of Giles Clarke,"" Sethi said.

""You would know that he also heads the Pakistan Task Force unit. We are indebted to Mr. Clarke for the great effort he has put in bringing all of this together for all of us. I thank him for his support, and I know the whole of Pakistan is thankful to him too.

""The three-member security cell will arrive in the first week of September. We just finalised it over a conversation today. They will oversee all the arrangements and will discuss it with the Punjab government. Following this, the team would arrive and we get started with the series,"" he further added.

""I must confess this was a difficult project to take up. All of us wanted to make this happen but there were so many elements involved, you need assistance from the government, administration, police, rangers, army, and FICA is involved too. Getting them on board was the most difficult task. There were a lot of issues and we worked steadily towards resolving all of them. There were financial challenges too.

""See, there are only 15 odd days remaining now, and today, we have received the names of the players. Broadcasters wanted the names of the players for the rights to be sold, you can assume the challenges involved.

""Now my next challenge is to host cricket in Karachi. I have received numerous calls asking for the same, from the governor, media and so many others. That truly is my next objective. As of date, the foreign players and the security experts are not ready for it. We will look to take PSL to Karachi, once that is staged successfully, the roads to more cricket there would open up,"" Sethi noted.

Pakistan are also due to host Sri Lanka and West Indies, after the conclusion of the three-T20I series against World XI. The Windies are expected to visit Pakistan some time in late November for a three-match T20I series.

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

What the players and coach said:

Hashim Amla: I am looking forward to the trip to Pakistan. The rehabilitation of my shoulder is progressing well and I am confident of being fit for the matches.""

Andy Flower: ""I have visited Pakistan in 1993, 1996 and 1998 with the Zimbabwe cricket team. I have enjoyed all my previous tours of Pakistan and look forward to returning to Lahore next month. All the players are satisfied and comfortable with the security arrangements that will be put in place for the series and are happy to be a part of the first step towards the safe return of international cricket in Pakistan.

""We now look forward to playing some exciting cricket, so that we can entertain the Lahore crowd who have waited long enough to see local as well as international stars live in their backyard.""

Sarfraz Ahmed: ""I am really excited to see the World XI team coming to Pakistan and I keenly look forward to play in front of a committed crowd who support us. I can assure all Pakistani cricket fans that we have missed playing in front of them, like they have missed watching us live in action.

""But this wait is about to end and I am sure better times lie ahead for all of us. I am confident that through this tour of World XI, the global cricket community, including players, media and visitors will get a better understanding and perception of Pakistan, which is a peace loving and extremely hospitable nation.

""I would like to congratulate PCB and ICC for making this tour happen and I look forward to some exciting matches in front of a packed Gaddafi stadium. I am confident that following the success of these matches, Pakistan will not only host regular international series but at all international cricket centres as well.""

"Coal to account for 68 per cent of total power mix by 2026: Report, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Coal will remain the foremost fuel preference for India's power sector and is expected to account for around 68 per cent of the total power mix by 2026, BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Group said in a recent report.

""Coal will remain the dominant fuel choice for India's power sector, given the vast domestic feedstock available to power generators,"" BMI Research said in the report.

The Fitch Group company further said India's power sector will expand rapidly over the coming decade, driven by underlying economic growth, electrification efforts and power sector reform implemented by the government.

""We forecast coal to account for around 68 per cent of the total power mix by 2026, supported by the gradual commissioning of the substantial coal project pipeline...,"" it said.

The report further said overall, reform in the mining sector since 2015 has drastically improved the availability of coal for the power sector. However, feedstock volatility will remain a downside risk to coal-fired power generation over the coming years.

In August, Coal India announced that 62 coal mining projects out of a total of 120 ongoing projects were suffering from delays, stemming from issues related to forest clearing, land acquisition, and rehabilitation and resettlement.

The share of hydro-power in the Indian power mix will reduce marginally over the coming decade, from around nine per cent currently to just over seven per cent in 2026, this is despite annual average growth rates in hydro-power generation of 3.8 per cent, it said.

""This is due to other sectors, such as coal and gas, out pacing the hydro-power sector in terms of generation growth. There are a number of large-scale hydro projects under construction and in the planning stage, and the government has taken steps to accelerate their development,"" it added."

"Portrayal of suicide on TV : There is always another solution. Editorial on Netflix series ""13 Reasons Why"" in the BMJ, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Vienna, 23 August 2017 : ""It is important to address the problem of suicide on TV in order to de-stigmatise it.But it all depends on 'how' it is done. It is important to show that there is always another solution, that there is always another way out of a difficult life situation"". That is the central message of an editorial written by MedUni Vienna researchers led by Thomas Niederkrotenthaler (Suicide Research Unit at the Center for Public Health) that appeared in the BMJ about the portrayal of suicide on TV in response to the controversial Netflix series ""13 Reasons Why"" (""Dead girls don't lie""), in which a young woman takes her own life.This message is completely in line with this year's motto for World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 September 2017: ""Take a minute, save a life"". Says Niederkrotenthaler: ""Together with American suicide prevention experts, we want to put pressure on Netflix and perhaps we can persuade them and other sections of the entertainment industry to change the way they portray suicide on TV.""Addressing the issue of suicide ‚Äì but in the right way The experts at MedUni Vienna believe it is all about ""how"" it is portrayed. It is not a matter of avoiding the issue of suicide ‚Äì quite the contrary. Says co-author Benedikt Till from MedUni Vienna: ""The subject needs to be de-stigmatised and must therefore be dealt with on TV. However, it is important to show how you can survive a suicide attempt and take back control of your life ‚Äì that there is always a way out. That could be enormously helpful.""To this end, the researchers from the Medical University recently got together with colleagues under the umbrella of the Austrian Society for Suicide Prevention (√ñGS) to publish a brochure entitled ""How to deal with Netflix series '13 Reasons Why' in school"", which also serves as a model for teachers, doctors and also families to help them address other portrayals of suicide.

"NTPC: NTPC to secure 33 per cent of coal requirements from own mines by 2030, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: State-owned power generator NTPC Ltd plans to secure around a third of its coal requirement through its own captive coal blocks by 2030, the company said in its annual report. NTPC has been allotted 10 coal blocks with a peak production capacity of more than 100 Million Tons Per Annum (MTPA). With these, the company envisages being one of the largest captive coal mining companies in India.‚ÄúThe previous fiscal saw the flag off of your company‚Äôs first coal rake, from its mining operations at Pakri Barwadih . This coal is being used at Barh Thermal Station of NTPC, in Bihar. This is an important step in the direction of secured fuel supplies for your Company. The medium term target for mining will be able to cater to more than 10 percent of its present coal requirements,‚Äù Gurdeep Singh, Chairman & Managing Director, said to the company‚Äôs shareholders in the report.As per its long term corporate plan, NTPC has envisioned to reach a total installed capacity of 130 GW and annual generation of more than 600 billion units (BU) by 2032. ‚ÄúThe capacity will have a diversified fuel mix comprising 65.4 percent coal, 4.6 percent gas, 1.5 percent nuclear and 28.5 percent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) including hydro. Therefore, by 2032, non-fossil fuel based generation capacity shall make up nearly 30percent of NTPC‚Äôs portfolio,‚Äù the report said.The company also plans to replace its old and inefficient units with technologically advanced, efficient and environmentally compliant units by 2032, in a phased manner. ‚ÄúNTPC would continue pursuing the power trading business in India as well as with the neighboring countries increasing its market share in the region through its wholly-owned subsidiary ‚ÄòNTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd‚Äô,‚Äù the report said.NTPC is also planning to make a foray into e-mobility and battery storage, supported by Research & Development and collaboration with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and research institutes, the report stated. ‚ÄúApart from this, NTPC is taking several initiatives to contain pollution in various forms. Two such projects your Company is experimenting with are waste-to-energy and biomass co-firing,‚Äù Singh said.As per the report, NTPC crossed the 50,000 MW mark in Installed capacity in the previous fiscal. The company commissioned 3,845 MW and added 2,190 MW to its commercial capacity during FY16-17. The installed capacity of NTPC Group is 51,671 MW as on 31 March, 2017."

"Let‚Äôs talk about discrimination: Supreme Court outlawing triple talaq was no surprise, it should have gone further","There is something naturally perverse about a husband being given the right to annul his marriage unilaterally by merely uttering the word ‚Äòtalaq‚Äô thrice. It does not require an Islamic cleric or a constitutional scholar to find this practice abhorrent, discriminatory and disrespectful of women. It was thus little surprise that the Supreme Court outlawed instant triple talaq, a judgment hailed for empowering women in their struggle for gender equality.

But that is unfortunately where praise for the judgment must begin and end. Scarcely has a judgment with such a progressive outcome been underpinned by such regressive reasoning. The dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Khehar and Justice Nazeer considers triple talaq, despite being discriminatory, to be protected by freedom of religion in the Constitution. To offset this result, they recommend legislation by Parliament on this issue and before such legislation, prevent Muslim husbands from pronouncing triple talaq.

Justices Nariman and Lalit, in their majority view, consider Sharia law to have been statutorily incorporated by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. Given that all laws enacted by the legislature have to be in conformity with the Constitution, they hold Section 2 of the Act, to the extent that it enforces triple talaq, to be arbitrary. Justice Kurian, the swing vote, agrees with the conclusion of the majority that triple talaq is invalid. However he comes to this conclusion not on constitutional grounds, but pursuant to an ecclesiastical finding that triple talaq has no basis in the Quran.

The dissenting opinion is surely astonishing. If personal law can be constitutionally protected, then it is commonsensical that such personal law can also be challenged on constitutional grounds. Further, if it is constitutionally protected, neither can a Muslim husband be disallowed from exercising his fundamental right to pronounce triple talaq nor can Parliament be expected to come up with a law that says otherwise.

On the contrary Justice Kurian‚Äôs swing vote holds, arguably correctly, that instant triple talaq is against the tenets of the Quran and consequently not part of Sharia law. Given it is not part of Sharia law, he considers it outlawed by the Act and hence invalid. To resolve the matter at hand, this is sufficient. However, as an approach to resolving knotty questions of personal law, this enquiry would require judges to delve deep into religious texts to ascertain their true meaning.

The hazards of such an exercise are well-known to the judiciary from what followed in the aftermath of the Shah Bano judgment (1985). Sacrificing constitutional adjudication at the altar of religious pontification from the Bench is an unwitting dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution.

In contrast, a more conscious dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution takes place in the majority opinion of Justices Nariman and Lalit. By holding that the Court has the power to strike down parliamentary legislation as arbitrary under Article 14, it has converted a question of the rights of Muslim women into a contest for one-upmanship with Parliament. This is not what a landmark judgment for gender equality looks like ‚Äì on the contrary its express silence on the core question of discrimination, speaks louder than its words.

Even when it has spoken ‚Äì to partially outlaw Section 2 of the Act as arbitrary ‚Äì it is conceptually flawed. Its finding compounds a conceptual misadventure that began with Justice Bhagwati‚Äôs view in Royappa (1973). Royappa held that governmental action could be challenged as arbitrary under Article 14 because the right to equality, enshrined in Article 14 mandated the rule of law, which was the antithesis of arbitrary state action.

Two examples demonstrate why bringing arbitrariness in through the backdoor of equality in Article 14 was faulty. If all spectrum licenses are cancelled with inadequate reasons by the state it is arbitrary, but hardly an act of inequality; conversely if universities have different rules for men and women in the interest of safety, the rules are unequal, but hardly arbitrary. Simply put, equality and arbitrariness are not the same thing.

Using arbitrariness as a sword to scythe through parliamentary legislation, risks the danger of collapsing the whole of the Constitution into one article. If Article 14 means arbitrariness and arbitrariness means nothing but the rule of law, then simply replacing the mass of provisions with Article 14 should do. This result means that the Damocles‚Äô sword of a free-floating judicial determination of arbitrariness now hangs over every parliamentary and state legislation in this country.

In terms of upsetting separation of powers and arrogating powers to itself, this judgment trumps even the NJAC case. Politicians in a celebratory mood would be well-served to recognise that the Constitution is no longer supreme, the judges are.

In the final analysis, it is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women‚Äôs rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women. On a matter critical to the lives of women in India, when five male judges of the Supreme Court rule on arcane questions of constitutional and ecclesiastical law instead of calling out personal laws as discriminatory, one knows that even if a victory has been achieved, the battle for gender equality will continue to remain a long and hard one."

"Under new rules, less than 50% private MBBS seats filled, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representative image

NEW DELHI: Deemed universities and private colleges across the country are staring at a huge crisis of unfilled undergraduate medical seats under the new system of centralised counselling introduced under the Supreme Court‚Äôs orders this year.As the third round of counselling comes to an end on Thursday, more than 50% of MBBS seats and almost 85% of dental seats in these institutes are still vacant.The final mop-up of vacant seats is scheduled for August 28 (after 5 pm) and the admission process comes to an end on August 31. These institutes fear that a majority of their seats will remain unfilled as, under the new rules, these universities will not be allowed to admit students on their own. Sources said even in government colleges nearly a third of the 15% seats under the all-India quota has remained vacant till now.However, unlike deemed universities and private colleges, government institutions will get a chance to fill these seat as these will be transferred to the states. A senior health ministry official said the Directorate General of Health Services ( DGHS ), which is conducting the counselling, will seek legal opinion on how to resolve the crisis of unfilled seats.While this may come as a ray of hope for medical aspirants, what is troubling the deemed universities is the new matrix of counselling, under which these institutes will have to go by the DGHS list even after the final transfer of seats. According to the head of a private medical college in Karnataka, ‚ÄúWe have 200 MBBS seats, of which 30 are for NRIs. In this category, we have filled just one seat. Of the 170 general seats, 89 have been filled after DGHS counselling till the mop-up round. In BDS, we have filled 29 out of 100 seats.‚ÄùThere are deemed universities where no admissions have taken place till now.‚ÄúAfter the mop-up round, which is getting over tomorrow, the seats will be transferred to the deemed universities.And for every 10 vacant seats, DGHS will release a list of 100 candidates (10 times higher). But when a similar process during the first three rounds has yielded next to nothing, we expect less than 10% of the vacant seats to be filled. Till last year, deemed universities had the option of choosing their students,‚Äù said the vicechancellor of a deemed university in Hyderabad.The admissions are being conducted based on NEETUG, 2017. ‚ÄúThe counselling has been undertaken as per the apex court‚Äôs order and guidelines, and no changes are possible to tackle the issue of unfilled seats. We are going to seek legal opinion and also approach the court again. Otherwise there is a possibility of up to 12,000 seats remaining unfilled this year,‚Äù said a senior DGHS official."

Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man‚Ä¶ actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man‚Ä¶ wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: ‚ÄúThis is fine and all but ultimately useless. What‚Äôs the point of all this socialism? Wasn‚Äôt it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.‚Äù

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP‚Äôs martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."

"Unit Tariff: Solar tariffs at Rs 3 a unit may be the new normal: NTPC CMD Gurdeep Singh, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh said Rs 3-3.20 a unit tariff for solar power may be the new normal and can be achieved without the support of ‚Äúcheap funds or cheap panels"", which have been a concern for the industry.Solar and wind energy units generate less than 10% of the global electricity output and have remained on the side-lines historically as these projects were taken up to fulfill a social responsibility towards clean energy But these green energy sources have seen a decline in prices making them comparable to conventional energy and causing a disruption in the power sector. India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.‚ÄúWe should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.‚ÄúWe are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,‚Äú Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."

Mamata Does It Again: Prohibiting Durga idol immersions on Muharram neither helps security nor ensures communal harmony,"In a re-run of last year, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has ordered that no Durga idol immersions will take place on Muharram which falls on October 1, a day after Bijoya Dashami. Idol immersions will resume from October 2 thereafter and continue till October 4. Mamata has justified this decision on security grounds, saying that it is necessary to facilitate Muharram processions and prevent clashes between Hindus and Muslims. She had passed similar orders last year which were challenged in the Calcutta high court on grounds of minority appeasement. However, it‚Äôs also true that small communal clashes did take place last year across various districts of Bengal when Muharram and celebrations for Durga Puja overlapped.

There‚Äôs no denying that Mamata‚Äôs order is upsetting a significant section of the Hindu population in Bengal. Durga Puja is the biggest festival for Bengalis. If in future Muharram were to fall bang in the middle of the four-day festivities, would Mamata call a halt to all celebrations? The state government is responsible for security for all. It should ensure both Durga Puja rituals and Muharram processions are carried out smoothly. By being hypersensitive about Muharram, Mamata herself is stirring up the communal cauldron.

On the security front, she is actually increasing the risk of clashes by imposing a moratorium on Durga idol immersions on Muharram. For, such a moratorium is bound to rub Hindus in Bengal the wrong way, creating an atmosphere of resentment. And communal clashes are much more likely to take place when people are resentful. Hence, Mamata‚Äôs order fails on the security logic. This leaves one to conclude that Mamata is doing all this to appease the minority vote bank. And that gives an opening to BJP which is looking to make inroads in Bengal on the strength of Hindu grievances.

Let‚Äôs put things into perspective. Muharram is essentially observed by Shia Muslims. And Shia Muslims are a minority in Bengal. According to some estimates, there are only one lakh Shias in the entire state. Hence, managing Muharram processions shouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal. However, in making it a big deal Mamata is fanning the flames of communalism. She must remember that she is the chief minister of all peoples in Bengal and guard against the appearance of favouritism no matter how well-intentioned her decisions are."
"RIL: Reliance Industries' backward integration to boost petrochemical margins, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Reliance Industries , India's most valuable company, is set to benefit further from backward integration that would maximise margins at its petrochemicals operations.With the commissioning of the ethane substitution project, which entails importing 1.6 million tonnes of ethane from the US every year, RIL would lower its dependence on feedstock such as propane and naphtha that are used in ethylene production.RIL is the first company in the world that has started large-scale ethane import to supply feedstock to its petrochemical unit.The move could add up to $300-400 million (Rs 2,000-2,500 crore) to FY18 operating profits at the petrochemical segment, translating into about a fifth of the total operating profits of Rs 12,990 crore in the previous fiscal. The petrochemical segment accounts for nearly one-third of standalone revenues and operating profits at RIL.Vipul Shah, COO petrochemical at RIL, said: ""The ethane import project could add $300-400 million to the operating profit of the company based on the current crude oil prices.However, the potential benefit could expand if crude oil heads north.""The cost arbitrage of imported ethane, as compared with naphtha, is around 30% at current prices: Hence, the move could translate into sizeable savings for RIL.Due to the booming shale gas production in the US and limited cracker demand, ethane is becoming surplus in the US.Imported ethane will lower the need for feedstock at RIL's crackers in Dahej, Hazira and Nagathone, which currently have feedstock requirements of 900 ktpa, 2.5 mtpa, and 900 ktpa, respectively. This means that imported ethane will cater to a third of the total requirement at the three facilities.The comparative prices of ethane, propane, and naphtha show that imports will allow RIL to optimise the feedstock portfolio in a volatile market , helping shore up margins.In the June quarter, the petrochemical segment margins stood at 15.8%, a record for the business. Besides, the new project will also increase ethylene production capacity by 200 KTPA from 1.9 MTPA.The payback on the project is attractive. RIL will invest around $1.6 billion on the project. With incremental savings of $400 million a year, the investment implies an attractive payback of four years.In the past four years, the company has invested around $15 billion on downstream projects such as paraxyelene expansion, ethane imports, refinery off-gas cracker and petcoke gasification plant, and these investments are expected to stabilise in the next few months.The Street expects investments in downstream products to add $2.5-2.7 billion to the operating profits: RIL has said incremental EBITDA would be in the region of $3-3.5 billion."

"Trump‚Äôs Afghanistan strategy, if followed through, opens a window of opportunity for India","Donald Trump‚Äôs gut instinct had said something else, but the demands of the Oval Office prompted him to deliver a ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù South Asia strategy. If it is followed through it can have wide-ranging implications for the region. Most important, it gives India a small opportunity to reshape the region and its role in the larger Asian geopolitics.

The good: US understands Pakistan is the problem, and for the first time we saw language on Pakistan that we would have liked to see a decade ago, both from Trump as well as Tillerson. For the second time since 9/11, Pakistan appears to be at a ‚Äúwith-us-or-against-us‚Äù moment.

Even more important, US apparently no longer believes, as generations of Pak-hugging Americans did, that Pakistan can be incentivised towards better behaviour if India could be kept out of Afghanistan or more lenient on Kashmir. Not that long ago, US was asking India how many consulates we had in Afghanistan, asking us to ‚Äúdo less‚Äù. Thankfully Osama bin Laden, Mullah Mansour and a host of other terror notables chillin‚Äô out in Pakistan contributed to a change of heart, at least among the generals if not in Foggy Bottom.

The new strategy, as Tillerson clarified, will focus on not allowing Taliban/ al-Qaida to win, or the US to ‚Äúlose‚Äù. Through that deliciously vague strategy, Washington is signalling they now ‚Äúhave the watches and they have the time‚Äù, opening up the space for a whole range of options to be exercised on Af-Pak in the coming months from drones to economic sanctions, CT operations, etc. Nobody knows the winning combination, but the generals who have skin in the game, McMaster, Mattis and Kelly, may do what they have always wanted to. By not releasing troop numbers, they have allowed themselves a degree of flexibility while keeping political pressure at bay.

On the ground, the situation is dire. The alphabet soup of terror groups from al-Qaida to Haqqanis, Taliban and LeT are not distinct entities, as Bill Roggio points out, they are closer today than they have ever been. It‚Äôs not for nothing that Sirajuddin Haqqani is the deputy chief of Taliban, and Haqqanis have been close to al-Qaida just as LeT, which was born in Kunar, is close to Taliban. In some areas Taliban have even worked together with Islamic State.

Afghanistan has got one more shot at getting things right. Ashraf Ghani‚Äôs dysfunctional government has to get its act together as well. Apart from building infrastructure India can play a role here, to beat some sense into the feuding boys ‚Äì Ghani and Abdullah ‚Äì with Hamid Karzai on spoiler alert.

Yes, India can invest a lot more in Afghanistan. More infrastructure, more development projects will undoubtedly follow after the Indian government completes its own Af-Pak review, which was waiting for the US one. But India cannot deliver governance. It‚Äôs an issue India has always skirted around, but it needs to be addressed.

India has an opportunity to work with both Russia and Iran to revive the spirit of the 90s, when all three faced a common enemy. In fact, the speech gives India an opening ‚Äì the stabilisation of Afghanistan should be seen within the larger regional matrix involving China, Iran and Russia, all of whom can play negative roles as Russia and Iran show. This is not in India‚Äôs interest, and India needs to work harder to offset US-Russia, US-Iran hostility.

Neither Trump‚Äôs speech nor Tillerson‚Äôs reading of the riot act to Pakistan‚Äôs foreign minister in the coming days will change Pakistan‚Äôs behaviour or strategy substantively, or, for that matter Taliban/al-Qaida‚Äôs ‚Äì yesterday‚Äôs suicide attack in Lashkargah showed the enormity of the problem. Pakistan will bank on China to offset the pressure the Americans will undoubtedly exert, and hope their nukes will do the rest. Pakistan will continue to bet on the US giving up before they do. Which is possible, and Indians will be watching out for US/Trump giving up before Pakistan/Taliban.

As for re-hyphenation with Pakistan, India remains the world‚Äôs biggest ‚Äúhyphenator‚Äù, so don‚Äôt lose too much sleep over it. Instead, we should reflect on this unexpected window of opportunity and make the most of it before things start going south, as they inevitably will."
"EESL to sign MoU with Malaysian counterpart to replicate UJALA scheme in Malaysia, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Following the successful implementation of the Indian government‚Äôs Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) in UK, the Malaysian government has now evinced interest in replicating the scheme in Malaysia.The state of Melaka in Malaysia is set to partner with EESL with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Green Growth Asia (GGA) and EESL in the first week of September 2017 on the sidelines of the Urban Environmental Accords (UEA) at the Melaka Summit.‚ÄúWe were deeply encouraged by India‚Äôs UJALA story, which is being implemented by EESL. As the world‚Äôs largest zero-subsidy government LED distribution programme, this is an extraordinary example of successful energy efficiency programmes that we believe should be replicated in Melaka, ‚ÄùChief Minister of Melaka, Malaysia, Datuk Seri Utama Ir. Haji Idris bin Haron, said in a statement released by EESL on Friday.Being the Chairman of the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee, he also is keen on collaborating with EESL in other programmes in addition to the UJALA scheme , the statement added.The UJALA scheme implemented by EESL has now become a global case study, whereby we have been approached by the governments of many countries to seek assistance for implementation of similar interventions in the energy efficiency space, with the Government of Melaka being the latest addition. In line with this, we have already commenced talks with the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee soon to assess their requirements.‚Äù Raj Kumar Rakhra, National Programme Manager (UJALA), EESL, said.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme, according to the ministry of power The scheme has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."

Thunderbolt News Episode 5: Pulling Off A Nitish To Wonder Woman Sushma Swaraj,"Thunderbolt News Episode 5: Pulling Off A Nitish To Wonder Woman Sushma Swaraj

No screaming, no zillion talking heads screaming over each other. This is the sort of news your parents grew up on. With a twist of lime. And a butter toast on the side. Wholewheat obviously."
Aadhaar & Privacy: Like Dal and Roti,"It is welcome that a nine-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court has unanimously determined that the right to privacy is a fundamental right implicit in the Constitution, taking the Preamble and the fundamental rights spelled out in Part III separately and together. This puts paid to conflicting interpretations arising from differing observations on the subject in a number of past judgments by smaller benches.

The five-member bench hearing petitions against Aadhaar has a clear answer to existential doubts about the right to privacy. The Attorney General who told the Court the right to privacy is not a fundamental right now stands corrected. But does this mean that the ground has been laid for throwing India‚Äôs unique identity project out of the window? Far from it. Fundamental rights are precious but not unconditional. Article 15 guarantees against discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, etc. Yet, it is followed up with the qualification that this does not mean the state cannot carry out affirmative action. This qualification immediately applies to Article 14‚Äôs guarantee of equal treatment of all citizens by the state. Article 19 (1) (a) offers the right to free speech, but that is subject to considerations of national security, morality, public order, decency, friendly relations with foreign states. Similar considerations circumscribe Article 19(1) (b), which offers the right to assemble without arms. Freedom of conscience under Article 25 is subject to morality, public order and health, besides other fundamental rights.

Article 21, which offers the right to life and liberty, and is one of the principal fonts of the right to privacy, can be constrained by the due process of law. If the Aadhaar law is found to contain due process, the fundamental right to privacy can coexist with Aadhaar, with far more comfort than, say, what Nitish Kumar found, first in a Modi-led NDA and, later, in the company of Lalu Prasad.

As Justice Sanjay Kishen Kaul says explicitly, breaching individual privacy would be perfectly justified in a number of cases ranging from the statistical to the epidemiological. One man‚Äôs credit history is his private business, you might think. But a credit score requires his credit history to be ranked alongside the credit history of others. Such a comparative ranking calls for credit information of individuals to be gathered by a rating agency, invading the privacy of all borrowers. For trading off this bit of privacy, society gets in return a huge benefit: more security for the savings that banks lend out and lower rates of interest for borrowers with a good credit history.

Aadhaar offers the promise of superior expenditure control and avoidance of welfare expenditure being cornered by the undeserving and the unscrupulous. It enables the migrant poor to establish identity wherever they are. But this benefit cannot justify any laxity in securing vital personal information gathered for Aadhaar.

The privacy judgment call for follow-up protective legislation on two counts. One, to regulate the conduct of the state when it breaches individual privacy and infringes on personal liberty. In many civilised states, such a breach calls for a prior court order, obtained on grounds of national security or something else, and parliamentary oversight of what was done with that permission to snoop. India must enact a law to delineate how, to what extent and to what end the state can breach the right to privacy and to hold those who do so to account, preferably by testifying to a committee of Parliament. Two, India needs a data protection law, to regulate the use of individual data by non-state agencies, to give individuals some degree of control over their data and to harmonise India‚Äôs data protection regime with those of other major jurisdictions. Such harmonisation can win international commitments for reciprocal protection of other nationals‚Äô data, allowing for a rich harvest of data-based economic activity, ranging from analytics to artificial intelligence, making use of and providing jobs to India‚Äôs huge pool of young talent.

It would make sense to institute a controller of data protection with the mandate to ensure that individual data is not put to any use that brings harm to the data-subject, or to others. But the contours of a data protection regime are the subject of a debate different from the one settled by the SC as to whether privacy is a fundamental right."
"Exercising immediately after study may help you remember, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket."
Make laws on data protection and privacy swiftly,"The old order changeth yielding place to new, concluded Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, one of the nine members of the Supreme Court bench which unanimously ruled that individual privacy is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The ruling, even if silent, will have an impact on Aadhaar, the unique identification number used by the government to disburse money for welfare schemes.

Is Aadhaar compatible or not with the Right to Privacy? That‚Äôs something another bench of the Supreme Court will rule on. Instead of waiting for the next ruling, the government should enact laws on data protection and privacy. Thats a message from the apex court as well.

Justice Kaul, in fact, mildly rapped the government for dilly dallying on the Privacy Bill in 2005. Seven years later, a group of experts appointed by the Planning Commission and steered by AP Shah gave its report on privacy. But its recommendations remained on paper.

In the course of the hearing the government informed the SC about its decision to set up the BN Srikrishna panel to identify key data protection issues in India and recommend ways to address them. No one can quibble with the government‚Äôs position that the digital economy must grow, and in parallel the personal data of citizens must be secure and protected. So there is hope! said Justice Kaul.

The Chief Justice of India also concurred with the view that data protection is indeed ‚Äúa complex exercise which needs to be undertaken by the state after a careful balancing of privacy concerns and legitimate state interests, including public benefit arising from scientific and historical research based on data collected and processed.‚Äù

It makes sense for India to take a page from the European Union that has stringent laws to protect a citizen‚Äôs data. ‚ÄúThe European Union Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data may provide useful guidance in this regard. The State must ensure that information is not used without the consent of users and that it is used for the purpose and to the extent it was disclosed‚Äù.

The SC ruling says that the concerns expressed (by privacy advocates) on the possibility of the State infringing the right to privacy can be met by the test suggested for limiting the discretion of the State. One, the action must be sanctioned by law. Two, the proposed action must be necessary in a democratic society for a legitimate aim. Three, the extent of such interference must be proportionate to the need for such interference and most important there must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such interference.

Interestingly, the EU regulation also recognises what is called ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù. This comes into force if, say, a person, does not wish that his personal data should be stored or processed as it has no relevance, is incorrect and serves no legitimate interest. But there are checks on exercising this right as well.

The SC‚Äôs observation on the need to have a law data protection is timely and useful. The ball is now in the government‚Äôs court."

"Astronaut urine may be recycled into nutrients, plastic, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Researchers are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.

Washington, Aug 23 : Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make long duration space trips more feasible.

Astronauts can not take a lot of spare parts into space because every extra ounce adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape the Earth's gravity.

""If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we will need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them. Atom economy will become really important,"" said Mark A Blenner, from the Clemson University in the US.

The solution lies in part with the astronauts themselves, who will constantly generate waste from breathing, eating and using materials.

Unlike people on Earth, Blenner said, spacefarers wouold not want to throw any waste molecules away.

Researchers are studying how to repurpose these molecules and convert them into products the astronauts need, such as polyesters and nutrients.

Some essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, have a shelf life of just a couple of years, said Blenner.

They will need to be made en route, beginning a few years after launch, or at the destination.

""Having a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing what they need, when they need it, is the motivation for our project,"" Blenner said.

The biological system includes a variety of strains of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. These organisms require both nitrogen and carbon to grow.

Researchers discovered that the yeast can obtain their nitrogen from urea in untreated urine. Meanwhile, the yeast obtain their carbon from CO2, which could come from astronauts' exhaled breath, or from the Martian atmosphere.

However, to use CO2, the yeast require a middleman to 'fix' the carbon into a form they can ingest.

For this purpose, the yeast rely on photosynthetic cyanobacteria or algae provided by the researchers.

One of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers. Those polymers could then be used in a 3D printer to generate new plastic parts.

Researchers are continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerised into different types of polyesters with a range of properties.

For now, the engineered yeast strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients, but the scientists are working on boosting output.

They are also looking into applications here on Earth, in fish farming and human nutrition. For example, fish raised via aquaculture need to be given omega-3 fatty acid supplements, which could be produced by Blenner's yeast strains. MHN SAR MHN"

Worship Is Work,"Does God favour those who attend to their work in factories and offices, or those who sit for long in puja, wonder UMA RAM and K S RAM



Afavourite home-assignment for pupils in schools till some decades ago was to write an essay on ‚ÄòWork is Worship‚Äô. The teacher made the task easy by describing the contours of the essay:True worship lies in doing work.We should work hard.We should not waste time in idle (idol?) worship.She almost suggested that God favours those who bend their backs and attend to their work in the factories and offices,rather than those who sit for long in puja. Few of us (including the teachers who set the assignment) ever suspected the politics that went into this seemingly simple exercise. Few of us could have suspected that it was part of the Macaulian manipulation of education in India that aimed to produce an army of ever-ready servants for the government. In a land known for sedentary ways of life revolving around stretched pujas and innumerable special days for festive duty and special service, such spiritual re-engineering was necessary for developing human resources to uphold the Raj. There is probably nothing in our scriptures or in the scriptures of any major religion anywhere to support the idea that work is worship. In fact, there is good evidence to suggest the opposite: that worship is work in the real sense.Krishna describes this in his discourse on action and inaction.



‚ÄòHe who sees action in inaction and inaction in action truly sees, he tells Arjuna. Sarva‚Äôrambha parityaga, renouncement of all initiatives is declared a virtue in one who is coursing ahead on the spiritual highway. Let life unfold itself and do with disinterested diligence the tasks that such unfolding presents for you. Religion began as magic.It,in fact, continues to be so. An incense stick waved around a symbol of godhead is essentially an act of waving the magic wand for a good day ahead.The day unfolds the will of God. Work presents itself and it is perfectly in order to perform it to the best of one‚Äôs ability as service in the will of God.To initiate work, or to avoid the task that has presented itself before you would mean meddling with God‚Äôs action plan. He knows, we don‚Äôt.To surrender to his action plan is true work. Work, as we understand it, is the elaborate, tedious striving to secure livelihood. Our ancients realised that there can be another way of securing it. This is through symbolic action, a kind of magic, better understood as worship. The Karma Kanda in the Vedas is essentially a manual of magic to help achieve life‚Äôs purposes. Creation itself is magic. In the Book of Genesis, God sees darkness and says, let it be day, and it was day. To say is to do.Worship is a mild simulation of such magic.Worship is not counter to work.Worship is work.To learn this is to learn the art of living. The real challenge, though, lies in understanding worship.Worship can be self-defeating if it is fruit-centric. One can be damned by getting one‚Äôs prayers answered. Rabindranath Tagore thanks God for the blessing of frustrating his prayers time and again. True worship lies in joyous surrender to the will of God.



Again, it is important to know as to who is the object of worship. Hinduism is often criticised for entertaining numberless demigods. What is missed is that there exists a great unity among this seeming diversity. All services reach the One God. But the results are according to the intermediate demigod to whom the service was directed. The message is clear:focus on the Ultimate One God, even as you worship and propitiate a demigod. Worship need not always be physical. Ideal worship is mental, whether accompanied by physical acts or not. And, a subtle instruction is that worship is not for one‚Äôs own pleasure but for the pleasure of God.And it is an incessant engagement, not a fixed hour ritual.The comfort God promises to such an unwavering devotee ‚Äî nitya‚Äôbhiyukta ‚Äî is: ‚ÄòSecuring your mundane well-being is my concern ‚Äî yoga‚Äôkshemam vahamyaham.‚Äô

"Woman's health is far beyond mother and child care: Anika Parashar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, COO,talks about the need to rethink about woman's life today. She discusses the various issues and possible solutions to empower a woman today. Edited excerpts:Priority health was conceptualised few months back, it has actually come out of a lot of learning that we had in the last year or so. La Femme being its own business vertical in the Fortis Healthcare group, we realised that till now woman's health in India has been viewed primarily with an obstetric focus. So when we talk about woman's health it is mostly about mother child health rather than comprehensive woman's health, so these clinics focus on other areas of a woman's life and actually nudge a woman to actually get check-ups and get preventative care if required. We launched this across our hospitals which are in four locations.When we talk about woman's healthcare we talk purely about the birthing stage of their lives but woman are beyond their birthing stage, we exist as pre mothers and post mothers as well. The campaign came in the interest to actually cater to women of different life stages and to be able to provide them with comprehensive health solution for these stages of life. Like La femme, there are other hospitals in the country that say that they are women health hospitals but the primary focus for all of us has been obstetrics, during the birthing and delivery stage of a woman's life. We have taken this step to put together comprehensive care clinics with 360 degree care which is mental health, dermatology, endocrinology, gynaecology, nutrition and fitness because we are trying to tell women that you are important so start thinking yourself as important as well.PCOS is a prevalent problem all over the world, in India more so because of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance. More women are being detected in their late teens with PCOS which is why we are looking at these clinics. We actually do corporate camps and our doctors address this issue of PCOS particularly because there is a grave need to give women the emotional, physical and clinical support that they require if detected with PCOS because there are definite health consequence to this condition. As we are detecting and diagnosing more and more PCOS, it is having an impact on Indian woman's health and it needs to be addressed.Over the last decade or so breast cancer has become one of the most prevalent cancers in India and what is quit upsetting and shocking is that the presentation of breast cancer in India is at 3rd or 4th stages. The survival rate actually goes down and therefore the numbers of people which actually succumb to breast cancer are far greater. According to a WHO study that happened a few years back, in the US for every five or six women who have breast cancer one succumbs to cancer, in China it is one out of every four and in India it is one out of every two. So if we only took the care get preventative checkups, mammography, breast ultrasounds, if women invested in their health and we could catch the cancer at an earlier stage then the chances of them surviving would be far greater.Puberty now in happening in girls as young as nine and that brings about a lot of emotional and physical changes. This is happening because of all the lifestyle changes that we are going through as a contemporary society today; the kind of food that we eat, the stress levels that exist and the exposure that we have to chemicals, pesticides, plastic products etc are shifting the line of puberty where it used to start later to an earlier stage and young girls find it very difficult to cope with this. So not only they but also their parents need the support on how to handle this particular phase of their lives.One in every four teenager in India by WHO statistics has depression. Depression as a mental disease is becoming more and more prevalent in Indians whereas earlier it was a globally recognised disease. Now there are more and more therapist and counsellors available, we are looking at mental health as it should be looked at, it needs that kind of support that any physical ailment or illness would need.Breastfeeding has come a long way in India because of the work that lactation counsellors do, the BPNI (Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India) does, the government, a lot of the doctors and there is a very strong movement amongst the mothers as well. Several groups across social communities exist on actually increasing breast feeding. We recently opened a breast milk bank and we are opening another one in Bangalore to encourage premature babies to be able to feed donated mother‚Äôs milk if in case their own mothers don't lactate. So there is a huge breast feeding movement happening in India and women support systems have increased. We have our own breast milk bank in our Delhi facility in GK, we are opening one next month in Bangalore La Femme as well. Here women can donate breast milk if they have a surplus supply and women who are wanting to feed their babies but don't have that supply of breast milk can also take it. The idea is to be able increase the number of infants who actually get access to breast milk."

"Pavilion Gas clinches two-year LNG storage capacity deal in Singapore, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Mark Tay

SINGAPORE: Singapore's Pavilion Gas has won the right to use storage facilities at the city-state's Singapore LNG Corp (SLNG) liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, the companies said on Thursday.

The agreement will allow Pavilion Gas the ""rights to access tank capacity on a segregated basis"" for storage and reload operations over the next two years, the firms said in a joint statement.

The statement did not say how much capacity Pavilion was awarded. However, in February, SLNG announced it was offering 160,000 cubic meters of storage.

""We will work closely with SLNG to facilitate multi-user access of the SLNG Terminal for LNG trading activities,"" said Seah Moon Ming, CEO of Pavilion Energy and Pavilion Gas.

Pavilion has recently announced a number of LNG deals in Singapore, which has designs on becoming Asia's trading hub for the fuel.

Pavilion Gas, along with Shell Eastern Petroleum, won the rights to supply Singapore with LNG in 2016, and is due to begin first imports under the contracts this year.

Pavilion Energy, the parent company of Pavilion Gas, also performed Southeast Asia's first truck-to-ship transfer of LNG in May, demonstrating that the city-state was ready to begin LNG bunkering operations.

SLNG's terminal, located on Jurong Island in western Singapore, is the country's sole LNG import terminal. The terminal currently has three 188,000-cubic metre storage tanks and a regasification capacity of around 6 million tonnes per year. A fourth storage tank, which will add around 260,000 cubic meters of storage capacity, will be ready in 2018."

"diabetes: New diabetes drug reduces blood glucose by pushing it to urine: Dr Alvin C Powers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi:, President of, was recently in India to co-inaugurate ‚Äò International Diabetes Update ‚Äô 2017, which highlighted many advances in diabetes therapy and how to use these advances to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."
This Free Smartphone App Replaces Expensive Hearing Aids For People Suffering From Hearing Loss,"Losing your hearing can be a real problem, and if you‚Äôre young it‚Äôs twice as embarrassing. It doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs a medical condition, no one under the age of 50 would be comfortable being spotted with an earpiece.

And that‚Äôs exactly why MobileEars believes there‚Äôs a market out there for their unique product. The company markets it as an ‚Äúaffordable and attractive‚Äù solution for people with hearing loss, especially those in a younger age bracket.

‚ÄúMore people today will lose their hearing earlier than our ancestors‚Äô‚Äù says VP of sales and marketing for Listen AS (MobileEars' parent company), Arjun Bhatt. He believes one of the main problems with hearing aids in the market today is that they each cost between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. To top it off, hearing loss is not covered by most health insurance plans, and the doctor consults are expensive. Another major issue, is the stigma associated with wearing the earpiece needed to return hearing to the person.

Instead, MobileEars hopes to solve the problem in a cheap, accessible, and subtle fashion. Their app uses the microphone on a user‚Äôs smartphone to amplify sounds around them, and feed them back through headphones. The kicker here though is that it isn‚Äôt just an amplifier. It uses a form of speech recognition technology to pick up and amplify voices, whether a person speaking in front of you or on TV, and dim out the ambient noise.

MobileEye has also made provisions for variations in user‚Äôs extent of hearing loss, based on statistics of the condition. When you start up the app, it collects a few details like your age and gender to optimise the experience, but you can always fine tune it later.

Right now, the app needs a user to have their headphones connected, though the next logical step is improving the hardware, Bhatt says. The idea is to one day replace hearing aids entirely, though that may be a ways off.

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week‚Äôs declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee‚Äôs book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose‚Äôs Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji‚Äôs hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji‚Äôs prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
"Company Dumps Tons Of Orange Peels On Barren Land, Decade Later It Turns Into A Thriving Forest","Back in 1997, ecologists Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs ventured on an idea that turned a barren land into a thriving forest.

Dan Janzen

Both the ecologist approached a juice company and asked them to dump tons and tons of orange peels, obviously coming from the juice they've churned on the barren land.

The barren land was a nature preserve in the country's northwest region. Over 12,000 metric tons of sticky, mealy, orange peels were then dropped.

Dan Janzen.

The site was then left untouched for over 16 years with a mark for the future scientists to work on it. Timothy Treuer, a graduate was then asked to examine the site after all these years and see how different it is from its surrounding.

Upon his arrival, Timothy was surprised to see that the land where peels were dumped bears no similarity from its vicinity.

Leland Werden

""It was just hard to believe that the only difference between the two areas was a bunch of orange peels. They look like completely different ecosystems,"" he explains, reports Upworthy.

The entire area was thick and thriving with vegetation. Timothy along with other researchers then studied the site over the course of three years and examined the difference. The studies and observations were then published in journals of Restoration Ecology that claimed these discarded fruit parts assisted the area's turnaround.

Dan Janzen.

Compared to its vicinity, which has a single variety of tree, the site had two dozen species of vegetation. In addition to that, it had better soil, greater biodiversity, and well-developed canopy.

""You could have had 20 people climbing in that tree at once and it would have supported the weight no problem,"" says Jon Choi, co-author of the paper, who conducted much of the soil analysis. ""That thing was massive.""

Triple talaq: Removing gender injustice would only strengthen minority rights in India,"Triple talaq has been quashed by the Supreme Court. A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‚Äòpampered minorities‚Äô in their place.

Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.

At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.

For Muslim Women

To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.

Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world‚Äôs earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.

The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.

The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.

The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.

The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel‚Äôs statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.

Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole

Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.

Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.

When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.

In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.

And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.

The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.

Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all."

Why Trump is right on Pakistan and Afghanistan,"On Monday night, the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, asked Pakistan to knock it off. He vociferously declared that America‚Äôs future involvement in Afghanistan will be result-based and not time-based. A timetable for withdrawal was not even mentioned as Trump announced his Afghanistan strategy, which deserves the praise of being one of the best policies designed by the White House. Let¬¥s be clear: Obama¬¥s strategy of ‚Äúsurge and exit by 2014‚Äù was a disaster. If you tell the terrorists that you are going to leave, they will wait till you leave.

Afghanistan is viewed as America¬¥s longest war, now in its 16th year. Trump¬¥s speech is bad news for Taliban supporters and those elements in the military in Pakistan, which for a very long time have been allowed to get away with their attempt to play the double game of verbally supporting the war on terror and simultaneously supporting Islamic terrorist groups like the Haqqani network.

The most important conclusion to be drawn after listening to Trump¬¥s announcement is the recognition of the fact that abandoning Afghanistan is not the solution, even though he may have hinted at that during his election campaign. More important than this approach to Afghanistan is his clear statement with regard to Pakistan. Unlike Barack Obama, Trump has decided to directly address the issue of Pakistan¬¥s double game in his address to the nation. He unequivocally condemned Pakistan¬¥s support for Taliban and the Haqqani network while simultaneously receiving large-scale military assistance from US.

Since the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, Pakistan has received billions of dollars in aid from USA alone. But in the future that aid will be directly linked to Pakistan¬¥s willingness to cut its support for the jihadi groups that have killed scores of American soldiers in the past.

What one could hope is that further sanctions would be applied directly to those sections of the Pakistani military and intelligence services which play a direct and indirect role in the clandestine support for the jihadi groups. Pakistan has a difficult case to prove as Osama Bin Laden was caught and killed in Abottabad close to a military garrison. Here the European Union could also co-operate with US and impose travel bans on top military generals who make life miserable for people on the south Asian continent while basking in the sun on the beautiful beaches of Europe and America. No holiday for them if they are caught red-handed.

Lastly, there is no reason to fear the Chinese influence in Pakistan. Pakistan is well aware of the consequences of choosing China over America. Pakistani generals and the elite in Pakistan would rather send their children to US and Europe for further studies than to China.

If Pakistan and India co-operate and see Afghanistan as a territory to be developed and not as an area of contention and competition, much of the conflict in the region can be reduced.

India, Pakistan and Afghanistan can become a strong economic zone, where growth and development would mean improvement of the standard of living for all of its citizens. But it requires a willingness to accept a reconciliation process and give the power back to the common man. The common man in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan does not want war. He wants co-operation.

Trump finally got America‚Äôs policy on South Asia right. The million-dollar question is if he will be allowed to walk the talk. Since the time of Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan, India has been voicing its concern. It kept warning Washington that Bin Laden was in Pakistan and of its double game. The big question is: Will India now trust America? The proof of the pudding is in the eating. If America keeps its promise of demanding closure of all terrorist networks, also those affecting India, then the demand put on India of further engagement with Afghanistan will be seen as positive.

America also needs to put pressure on Europe to get straight with China, which is trying to fill in the gap in Pakistan and doing roaring business in Europe. When it comes to South Asia, America has finally got its policy right. The same cannot be said of the European Union."

Implications of right to privacy go well beyond privacy,"The Supreme Court‚Äôs unanimous ruling that individual privacy is indeed a fundamental right subject to reasonable restrictions has led to celebrations across the country. But there is more to the landmark judgement that just privacy and the court has also provided a ray of hope for India‚Äôs LGBT community. This comes after the court refused to decriminalise Section 377 of Indian Penal Code which relates to consensual sex among adult homosexual men in 2013.

Page 124 of the judgement reads, ‚ÄúSexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.‚Äù

SC‚Äôs verdict on #RightToPrivacy: Here is what the judges said https://t.co/0dBqc5O216 pic.twitter.com/Nlqv9GROKB ‚Äî Times of India (@timesofindia) August 24, 2017

Similarly page 404 mentions, ‚ÄúAs case law, both in the U.S. and India show, this concept has travelled far from the mere right to be let alone to recognition of a large number of privacy interests, which apart from privacy of one‚Äôs home and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures have been extended to protecting an individual‚Äôs interests in making vital personal choices such as the right to abort a foetus; rights of same sex couples- including the right to marry; rights as to procreation, contraception, general family relationships, child rearing, education, data protection, etc. This argument again need not detain us any further and is rejected.‚Äù

The government was hoping that a favourable verdict would help it extend Aadhaar to all essential services and even link it to some voluntary services as well. This had led to widespread criticism that the government was trying to completely monitor every individual through this move thereby violating privacy. The setback for the government could now be two-fold. Firstly the court had clarified that the right to privacy is not vague and amorphous as the government believes. Secondly, it recognises privacy interests as well."
A Riot Of Vegetables,"The vibrant colours of vegetables bring out the artist in me. It makes me internally happy, French chef ALAIN PASSARD says to RANJENI A SINGH



Till the year 2000, he cooked meat. Then began his love affair with vegetables,thanks to the garden he created in 2001. Since then, French chef Alain Passard has been dishing out vegetarian fare, with each plate turning out as a piece de resistance. Just like an artist who contemplates his palette before he paints the first stroke on the canvas, Passard takes a long look at the colours of vegetables ‚Äî ‚Äúa mauve, yellow, a marbly white, celadon green, a pearly orange,‚Äù to quote him ‚Äî for inspiration before getting into the technical aspects of cooking.And when he is not cooking, Passard is sculpting crabs and hedgehogs in bronze or making collages. The three Michelin star chef,known as the greatest vegetarian cook in the world,says,‚ÄúWhen I saw the vegetables in the garden, I wanted to change professions, to renew my senses,change my hand. It wasn‚Äôt so much killing animals that made me change but the excitement of travelling on a different kind of fabric.‚ÄùHe says that nature,too,does not like the same routine ‚Äî that is why she created seasons and seasonal vegetables to fire the imagination and you can,therefore,cook up something new every day. About his relationship with his garden, Passard says,‚ÄúThey definitely make me a better chef.



It‚Äôs made my cuisine better, and gives value to farmers, because a garden is a playground for culinary creation.‚ÄùTo not let refrigeration or any such thing meddle with the natural flavour of the vegetables, his lovingly tendered vegetables are transported from his garden ‚Äî located in the Eure and the Sarthe regions of France ‚Äî to his kitchen in Paris, in time to make meals. And when the vegetables of a particular season are over, the produce of the next season takes over. Such is his love for vegetables that his restaurant,Arpege, also sells organically grown vegetable baskets every morning.Six gardeners work at the vegetable garden in Fille sur Sarthe.Three people look after the vegetable garden in Bois-Giroult.The latest one,the garden of Porteaux, located opposite the Mont St Michel bay, has its own orchard. For the wellbeing of the gardens as well as the earth, there are two donkeys, two foals, as well as cows, chickens, and a goat that live there.Call it total communion with nature! Passard is proud of his prized possession: His vegetable garden. And he declares on his website,‚ÄúI grow my own vegetables to be able to tell a story from the grain to the plate‚Ä¶and to be able to combine the chef ‚Äôs touch with that of the gardener,two passionate professions.Through these gardens, I have trusted nature with my creativity;it is nature that dictates my actions. The most beautiful cookery book was written by nature itself.‚Äù



The shift from meat to vegetables has changed his perspective.‚ÄúSpiritually, it brought me a lot of happiness.I reconnected with painting thanks to the immeasurable amount of colours that vegetables can offer, and this gave me a completely new perspective on what being a chef means.It helped me realise that cooking vegetables was more artistic,‚Äù says Passard and adds, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs very personal. For me, there are different kinds of cooks: one that will nourish his inspiration through colours and seasons, the shapes and colours of vegetables, and one who doesn‚Äôt have that sensitivity and who will inevitably see his cuisine as a job, not as a passion, and a source of creativity.‚Äù He likes to listen to what is cooking, hearing the subtleness of the crackling,for he says, the sound of tomatoes cooking isn‚Äôt the same as the sound of beetroot cooking. ‚ÄúTaste is a combination of two or three flavours and it is linked to textures,and what gets on the plate is strong,yet delicate.‚Äù Does he agree with eastern wisdom that says,‚ÄòYou are what you eat‚Äô? He prefers to change the maxim to ‚ÄòYou eat what you want‚Äô.‚ÄúThat says even more about a person, because it is a personal choice. By eating what you want, you accept your tastes, and through the effort you put into it, you can know whether you like the art of the table or not,‚Äù says the chef. Is food all about cooking up a great dish and savouring it,or is it something more? ‚ÄúOf course! Cooking and savouring are decisive steps, but before they can even begin to exist, you have to think.Think about what it is you want, who you would like to share it with, what techniques and touches will you use? It all revolves around your senses, and they are moments you linger and long for,moments you cherish and that lead up to cooking, then serving. It‚Äôs such a sensitive space, so large....‚Äù And in this celebration of food, the family plays a key role. Passard believes that family meals are the richest of these moments.‚ÄúYou share dishes,ideas,a moment where you discuss your past,your future, because a family bond is timeless. It‚Äôs an opportunity to connect through classical dishes that everyone identifies with‚Äù. (Alain Passard interacted via email).

He said ""informational privacy"" could not be a right to privacy and it could not ever be a fundamental right.

The Attorney General had on Wednesday told the bench the right to privacy could be a fundamental right, but could not be ""absolute"".

The contentious issue of whether the right was a fundamental one was referred to a larger bench in 2015 after the Centre underlined two judgements delivered in 1950 and 1962 by the apex court that had held it was not a fundamental right.

Why missionary is the best position ever,"Getting all adventurous and acrobatic while trying out new positions for some mind-blowing sex is fun for sure. But the age-old missionary is a tried-and-tested formula that can never go wrong and always guarantees fulfilling sex no matter how vanilla it sounds. We give you four reasons that confirms missionary to be the best sex position ever.

It is easy

It‚Äôs simple and anybody can try and get it right in one go, be it a beginner or a pro. You don‚Äôt need any special skills or knowledge to amp up the kink factor. All that‚Äôs needed to turn up the heat is a lot of intimacy and the urge to pleasure each other as much as possible.

It is romantic

Missionary is a classic position that spells romanticism to the tee. It gives you ample opportunities to kiss, embrace and look into each other's eyes apart from, obviously, great sex. Intimacy reaches a whole new level as he gets inside you with full gusto and the two of you hold on to each other as you reach climax. It sure can‚Äôt get steamier.

It is comfortable

No special skills are required while having sex the missionary way and there are no possibilities of any discomfort. It doesn‚Äôt require bending and twisting and no matter how wild either of you are in bed, missionary sex scores high on the comfort factor.

It is customisable

A bit of tweaking here and there can add a lot of variations to the regular position. Lock his legs or bend your knees as he enters you for a deeper penetration. A bit of extra grinding and rolling from his end would be just perfect to help you both inch towards the Big O."

"FM Jaitely urges states to reduce VAT on petroleum products used for making goods, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today urged state governments to reduce Value Added Tax ( VAT ) on petroleum products used for making goods which attract Goods and Service Tax ( GST ), an official statement said. The move is aimed at easing tax burden on manufacturing sectors using petroleum products.The GST regime rolled out on 1 July excludes crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel while other products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha are included in GST. In the pre-GST regime, both petroleum products and final goods produced attracted VAT and hence input tax credit of petroleum products used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different states.However, in the post-GST regime, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products like natural gas, petrol and diesel used in manufacturing of the products attract VAT which leads to stranded taxes and cascading of taxes.‚ÄúIn view of this, in the pre GST regime certain States had lower rate of 5% VAT on Compressed Natural Gas used for manufacturing of goods. Some States also had lower rate of VAT on diesel being used for manufacturing sector. Thus the FM has requested other states also to explore the possibility of having lower VAT on petroleum products used for manufacturing items on which there is GST, so that there is minimum disruption in the costing of goods,‚Äù the statement said.At least one analyst told ETEnergyWorld VAT reduction on petroleum products used in manufacturing would reduce tax disadvantage currently suffered by City Gas Distribution (CGD) Companies as well as Piped Natural Gas (PNG) consumers along with the power, Ceramics, Glass, Chemicals, Pharma, Dairy, Steel and Engineering industry.‚ÄúCurrently CGD companies face a significant disadvantage when they sell PNG (Industrial and Commercial) as it continues to attract VAT on which input tax credit cannot be availed by its consumers who would be under GST. On the other hand, if they were to use liquid fuels such as Fuel Oil, Diesel, Naphtha, LPG, input tax credit is available because these products come under GST. If the states were to reduce VAT on PNG, that will reduce the tax disadvantage suffered by CGD companies and some of their consumers,‚Äù K Ravichandran, Senior Vice President at ICRA told ETEnergyWorld .He also added sectors such as ceramics, glass, chemicals, pharma, dairy, steel and engineering will be benefited as many of them use PNG. If the VAT were to be lower, under recoveries of companies operating in these sectors on taxes will be lower, which will improve their cost structure.Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the statistical arm of the oil ministry has projected the natural gas demand for the financial year 2017-2018 to be 494 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter Per Day (MMSCMD). Of which the power industry would require 225 MMSCMD followed by the fertilizer industry requiring 113 MMSCMD, city gas distribution 47 MMSCMD and Industrial requirement of 28 MMSCMD among others. Sanjiv Singh , Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the country‚Äôs largest fuel retailer, had recently said the firm is in talks with state governments for deferring levy of VAT on petrol, diesel, Aviation Turbine Fuel and crude oil to reduce the tax impact of these products as they are outside the ambit of GST."
Are we judging a Subway sandwich boy by his ability to cook a biryani?,"Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. ¬© Getty

Nineteen Windies wickets fell in a day of Test cricket in England recently. Sadder than the fact that it actually happened, was the fact that it didn't surprise a lot of people too much. We didn't rub our eyes in disbelief and even the narrative on whether a once great singer was singing terribly off-key is now an old one. As the emotional voice of West Indies cricket, Fazeer Mohammad, keeps telling us, this fall started a long time ago.

I have recently spent a lot of time in Sri Lanka, a place whose cricketers I have admired greatly for their skill and their modesty. Over three Test matches they were competitive for about three quarters of a day and some might say, that shouldn't have surprised me either. Maybe it just saddened me and expressing surprise was a means of lessening the impact.

Since the events have occurred simultaneously, they are a cue for a discussion on the state of test cricket. In England, where more is written about cricket than anywhere else (in India, we speak more about it, often in loud voices when the team loses; for eg. in a World Cup semifinal), there is even greater concern for Test cricket. It is understandable and yet futile. Understandable, because Test cricket still has strong roots in England; and futile, because they might be clamouring for a past that is never to return.

The grim pronouncements surrounding Windies and Sri Lanka leave me wondering if we are using the wrong metrics to judge teams now. It wasn't that long ago that Sri Lanka had mounted an outstanding run chase against India at the Champions Trophy. And the Windies are the only team to have won the World T20 twice. In Andre Russell, Dwayne Bravo and Sunil Narine, they have among the three most wanted players in T20 cricket and it wasn't that long ago that Chris Gayle was the reigning superstar of the format. Towards the end of India's short tour of the Caribbean in June and July, I saw the West Indies take apart a pretty strong Indian team in a T20 international.

The time has come then, some might say with justification that it came long ago, to ask ourselves whether the metrics we use to judge players and teams are still valid. Sanjay Manjrekar bemoans, and rightly so, the first class averages of those playing Test cricket now but maybe in the format they are more suited to play, Test and first-class records aren't the right indicators anymore. Players like Sunil Narine, and Lendl Simmons is actually a better example, have first-class records that you wouldn't glance at a second time but at what they are currently doing, they are invaluable. Dickwella and Gunathillake wouldn't have you up in worry the night before a game but they can trouble you over an hour's play.

Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way (and, dare I say, shot furtive glances occasionally), but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. Maybe cricket is running the 100 metre dash and we are judging the athletes for their endurance over 5000 metres. We don't ask Usain Bolt if he can run like Mo Farah but we want the Windies, the world champions over T20 cricket, to hang in there and fight grittily till the last man at a game that is ten times longer.

Many years ago, I had suggested that we accept that a slow cooked Hyderabadi biryani will have to live alongside a Subway sandwich. Indeed, we have accepted that but I fear we send the kid at the Subway counter to cook biryanis and bemoan his lack of skill. He might well turn around and say, as many in the Caribbean already are, that the queues outside his shop are longer.

"Varian Medical Systems: Today we need to build trust that comes through transparency and credibility in engagement with patients: Ashok Kakkar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Co-chair, FICCI Health Services Community andManaging Director,, Mumbai, talks about the highlight of FICCI HEAL Conference 2017 and shares his views on the recent healthcare amendments. Edited excerpts:If you look at the Indian healthcare scenario today, there are some excellent examples of patient centricity and excellence in care. Today India ranks almost at par with Western models when it comes to quality healthcare at affordable cost. Yet we also hear almost on a daily basis that today the Indian healthcare scenario lacks trust and the way the patients and the general consumers perceive especially the private healthcare with lot of suspicion. So I think, first and foremost what the sector needs to do and what the Indian hospitals need to do, is to build trust which comes through transparency and credibility in their engagement with their patients. The second piece, which again is corollary to the first one is how does hospitals today empower patients, whether it is through technology or otherwise and make them participate in the decision-making in the health decision-making and not treat it as a transaction or an episodial situation when a patient comes to the hospital he is discharged and then, you know, it‚Äôs all done with. It‚Äôs very important to ensure that the followships-survivorships are closely linked and patient remains in the center of the decision-making.FICCI is an excellent platform for exchange of ideas, where thought leaders both from public as well as private sectors engage and work towards betterment of the industry, and in this case in Healthcare sector. FICCI has very actively worked on issues of industry, working with the government whether it was related to taxation, custom duties, penetration of healthcare insurance in this country, and now we will look at the scenario around price-controls or standard treatment guidelines, public-private partnerships. So there are bunch of areas where FICCI has, and the teams, and the taskforces which FICCI creates, so that to ensure that there is inclusive approach in working on these subjects.I believe GST is good for the country, as well as for the healthcare sector, because it rationalizes and simplifies the environment. Having said that, and given the fact that healthcare services are exempt from GST, but, there could be an increase in input costs because lot of things that the hospitals buy, whether its medical equipment or other infrastructure, the impact of GST could be different, for example medical equipment especially capital equipment because of GST there is an increase in the custom-duty by two-two and a half points, so those will lead to increase in input costs for the hospitals. And given that, they cannot use this to set off, because there is no on-the-end GST, it make some increase in the cost but I think overall hospitals will have to find ways to be more productive and I don‚Äôt foresee that it would increase patient cost or the patient treatment channel.The pricing policy unfortunately has added a lot of confusion in this sector, while the intent may be good on part of the government to ensure that the patients are not exploited, because there have been cases around that. But what is very important is, for all the stakeholders again, government as well as the hospital providers to keep the entire care continuum and the costs around the care continuum in mind because it‚Äôs not just the device cost which is important, one has to look at the entire treatment, at what cost it can be delivered, say Angioplasty, at what price the Angioplasty gets delivered in the end to the patient is critical, is not just the cost of the stent for instant and I think, the government should've engaged the private sectors and the medical technology companies and the hospital providers in a manner that ultimately the patient would benefit, which unfortunately has not happened and that's where the confusion is.I believe there is a huge opportunity around public-private participation and the good news is that the government at the center is supporting it. The NITI Aayog had already been tasked to build models and NITI Aayog very actively has sought inputs from FICCI as an industry forum, they have invited even World Bank to help them build those models. We have done lot of PPPs in U.K and other parts of the world so we are helping t he government to create models which can then be adopted by the state governments. So that there is template available, and no one has to reinvent the wheel as far as PPPs are concerned because PPPs in healthcare can be very complex, and it‚Äôs important that in the end we build a model which is win-win and in the interest of patients at the large.When we talk about public-private participation or even private - private participation, example especially in the oncology space of private - private participation given the space in oncology is a little difficult the incubation is very long it requires a lot of regulatory approvals from AERB and so on. You will find some of the oncology chains in India going and setting up Oncology departments in existing hospitals. For instance, DMC in Ludhiana is a very good hospital run for several years doing excellent patient care but they had no oncology department so they invited a group called CTSI, Cancer Treatment Services International who run hospitals in Hyderabad to come and setup the Onco department and run it, so this is also a public private-private participation, it's not a public-private so we see these kind of models especially in oncology getting stronger there are companies like CTSI, Healthcare global, International Oncology, many of them who specialized in oncology. I see it‚Äôs a good step because building a hospital is not easy.Traditionally in India, it has been a doctor and his son and they will setup or a wife, to setup a hospital, but then it would normally be a one hospital phenomenon they would provide good service but they would not be able to expand because it requires huge amount of capital. So given now all the groups are coming in big corporates like this Apollo, Fortis, Max and they are expanding private equity funding which is coming in. CTSI got funded through TPG capital for instance so that gives them the breath and the muscle to then expand and reach out even to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there is a dearth of a good hospitals."

"Doctors in convoys: Specialists‚Äô lives on line, patients ignored, Health News, ET HealthWorld","CHENNAI: On April 26, 2003, when DMK president M Karunanidhi slumped midway through a speech in Coimbatore, two doctors from his convoy rushed to his aid ‚Äî only to meet the brawny chest of a security guard. Karunanidhi was rushed to a private hospital as the medical team watched from a few feet away.Little has changed since for doctors deputed to VIP entourages as they continue to fight for basic facilities and respect while on duty. Last week, the death of a cardiologist in an accident while going to join the chief minister‚Äôs motorcade, has prompted a group of government doctors to write to the director of medical education, questioning the practice of sending specialists on convoy duty and the lack of guidelines to ensure their safety.From travelling in ambulances that struggle to keep pace with SUV-led cavalcades, to scouting for food and accommodation, to being sidelined on those rare occasions when their services are required ‚Äî doctors say there is little dignity in being on convoy duty.""Everyone talks about a ‚ÄòBlue Book‚Äô with guidelines on who should be part of a VVIP ‚Äôs convoy but few know what it says,"" said Dr A Ramalingam, state organising secretary, Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association. Though many are accompanied by their personal physicians, a team of doctors, including specialists, are deputed from a government college in Chennai. Another group from district hospitals joins the convoy when it passes through their zone. ""All these doctors attend to an average of 150 patients in government hospitals daily,"" said Ramalingam.At present, doctors are deputed based on what the police demands, said a senior health official, adding that the department does not have a list of those entitled to have a medical team. ""There have been several instances where we‚Äôve had to pull out doctors on outpatient duty for convoy assignments, which vary from four hours to two days,"" said the official.The biggest problem is conveyance. A doctor in Madurai recalled a 2014 incident when seven doctors from Government Rajaji Hospital were bundled into a car that could accommodate five people, including the driver. They were accompanying a former President during his visit to Rameswaram. ""The old car could barely keep pace with the convoy. When the driver applied brakes, a doctor was injured,"" he said. When the team finally arrived at the destination, two hours after the convoy, they struggled to get close to the former President because of the surging crowd.A senior assistant professor in general surgery at Stanley medical college narrated his ordeal when in 2015 he was deputed to accompany the then Tamil Nadu governor to Neyveli to attend a wedding. The ambulance broke down in Tindivanam. ""We finally went in a van, sitting on top of the governor‚Äôs store supplies,"" said the doctor.Several doctors had a harrowing story to tell. One recalled driving away a cow that had sneaked up behind a public figure, only to be shooed by the leader‚Äôs aides.Doctors‚Äô associations say while it is the state‚Äôs duty to provide doctors to VVIPs in case of emergencies, they have to be deputed wisely.The director of medical education Dr Edwin Joe said he had got representations to streamline the process. ""We will be writing to the department concerned,"" he said."
"Govt brings in new norms on solar power procurement, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government has implemented new rules for buying power from grid-linked solar power projects through competitive bidding under the National Solar Mission to improve transparency and standardise auctions.

These guidelines, prepared by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), cover the grid-connected solar PV power projects with a size of 5 mw and above, an official said.

The official said this will help in reducing off-takers' risks, encourage investments, enhance bankability of projects and improve profitability for investors.

The norms provide that the minimum power purchase agreement tenure (PPA) will be 25 years that will help ensure lower tariffs. Besides, unilateral termination or amendment of PPA is not allowed.

The issues related to land, connectivity and clearances and the extension in the case of delay have been streamlined for ensuring project preparedness.

The event of default and the consequences thereof are clearly defined to ensure optimal risk sharing.

There is a provision for termination compensation to increase bankability of projects by securing investment by the generator and lenders against any arbitrary termination of a PPA.

The guidelines also provide for payment security mechanism. The risk of generator's revenue getting blocked due to delayed payment or non-payment has been addressed through provision of Payment Security Mechanism through instruments like Letter of Credit (LC), Payment Security Fund, State Guarantee and the like.

The early commissioning and part commissioning of projects have not only been allowed, but incentivised, by way of allowing the PPA for a minimum 25 years from the scheduled commissioning date under the new norms.

The penalties have been rationalised so as to reduce the overall cost to the generator while at the same time ensuring compliance with rules.

The new framework also contains provision for force majeure. Now, the PPA would have provisions with regard to force majeure definitions, exclusions, applicability and available relief as per the industry standards.

The successful bidder -- if it is a single company -- shall ensure its shareholding in the SPV company executing the PPA shall not drop below 51 per cent at any point prior to one year from the commercial operation date except with the prior approval of the procurer."
Bengaluru FC Just Defeated A North Korean Football Team,"Have you ever heard of a team called April 25? Well, it is one of the most successful teams in North Korea. This team was named after the Military Foundation Day and belongs to the Korean People's Army.

And the team has been beaten by India's Bengaluru FC 3-0 in the first leg of the AFC inter-zone semi-final match.

Star striker Sunil Chhetri was among the goal-getters. He led the charge with a 32nd minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match in front of the cheering home crowd at Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

BCCL

Heavy rains lashed the stadium an hour into the game and both the teams played under reduced visibility. Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty kick after Udanta was brought down by the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area. Chhetri stepped up and sent his shot at the center, which beat Ri Kang, who dived to his right.

Bengaluru scored their second goal through Udanta as the winger sprinted from the vacant right flank into the box and sent a superb left footer into the North Korean net.

Lenny Rodrigues completed the route as he sent the ball past Kang who was blinded by the splash of water on his face. Chhetri broke away and ran almost 50 yards to cut in and deliver the cross from the left to Lenny who made no mistake.

Chhetri missed a chance to score his second goal in the 42nd minute after Kang, who was off the line, managed to get a finger of a the Indian striker‚Äôs shot for a corner. April 25 also had their chance in 23rd minute as Ri Hyong Jin sent an accurate freekick but An Song Il‚Äôs header hit the crossbar and the ball rebounded back into play.

They also missed an opportunity coming their way to reduce the margin in the 71st minute as Kwon Ch sent a grounded cross but An Il Bom could not connect it properly.

Soon after the half-time break, April 25 got into their act, but the smartness of the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the situation. Kim Yu Song had beaten three Bengaluru men and was going for a shot from an angle into the goal in 49th minute but Sandhu denied him.

A couple of minutes back too, Gurpreet had done well to send the ball out of danger after Kim Jong Chol had flicked to An Il Bom, who sent a cross across the goal with all the defenders falling short of pace to get hold of it.

Bengaluru FC will now travel to Pyongyang on September 13 for the second leg match.

"Draft rules against 'cut practice' recommend 5 years in jail for doctors, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The nine-member committee working on the legislation recently submitted the first draft to the state's medical education department. A final version is expected soon

MUMBAI: A preliminary draft of the proposed legislation against ""cut practice"" has recommended a jail term of five years and penalty of up to Rs 50,000 against doctors indulging in unethical means to exploit patients.The nine-member committee working on the legislation recently submitted the first draft to the state's medical education department. A final version is expected soon.Tentatively named the "" Prevention of Cut Practices in Healthcare Services Act, 2017"", the legislation is being framed to clamp down on unnecessary referral of patients by a doctor, hospital or a diagnostic centre. A doctor or medical institution will face an inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) if a complaint is lodged against them under section 3 of the law that defines the offences of ""cut practice"".The ACB is expected to check the veracity of the complaint and complete the investigation within three months. It can seek additional time of three months. A provision of fining bogus complainants has been made. After a probe, the ACB will file a complaint before the sessions court, which will try the case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Till the inquiry is complete, anyone trying to malign the reputation of the doctor or the healthcare service provider shall be liable to one month's jail (see box).The draft rules also call for simultaneous action from the respective medical council under which the doctor or the hospital is registered. ""If a medical professional or a hospital is found guilty, the council shall take cognizance of such offence and initiate an inquiry into the case within six months of the receipt of the FIR,"" it says. It should take appropriate legal action and may also suspend the guilty for at least three months.Former DGP Praveen Dixit , who is heading the nine-member committee, said the draft will take into account public opinion. ""Stakeholders can send their opinion to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), which will be considered and incorporated after discussions,"" he said. He added that veterinary doctors, occupational therapists and even dentists will come under the purview of the law. Interestingly, the rules are silent on alternative medicine practitioners, such as homeopaths.DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said a series of meetings has been lined up with medical experts. ""Several clauses may be added, refined. We are planning to get the final draft ready by November and sending it to the law and judiciary department.

"Rosneft says Essar Oil deal will enable entry in one of the fastest growing markets, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Russian oil major Rosneft today said its acquisition of 49 per cent stake in Essar Oil will enable the oil producer entry in one of the fastest growing markets and it stands to gain from the over 3,500 retail pumps operated by Essar in India on the back of pricing deregulation of the country‚Äôs retail oil market.In a statement issued today, Rosneft said with the successful closure of the strategic deal for the acquisition of 49 per cent of Essar, ‚Äúa platform for further development of international trading ‚Äì entering the high premium markets of the Asia Pacific region and South East Asia has been created.‚ÄùThe company said it has successfully closed strategic transaction for the acquisition of 49.13 per cent of shares of Essar Oil Limited (EOL) from Essar Energy Holdings Limited (EOL) and its affiliates. An investment consortium comprising Trafigura and UCP has also announced the closure of their acquisition of a separate 49.13 per cent share of EOL.Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin said the completion of the deal marks the beginning of a new chapter for EOL. ‚ÄúTogether with our partners we intend to support the company to significantly improve its financial performance and, in the medium term, adopt an asset development strategy,‚Äù he said.Sechin added the closing of the deal is a remarkable achievement for Rosneft too as the Company has entered the high-potential and fast-growing Asia Pacific market. ‚ÄúThe acquisition of the stake in the Vadinar refinery creates unique opportunities of synergies with existing Rosneft-owned assets and will help improve efficiency of supply to other countries within the region,‚Äù he said.The company clarified in the statement the price parameters of the deal are in line with the legally binding agreements signed previously. The Vadinar refinery of Essar is a high-tech project equipped with all the necessary infrastructure with a refining throughput of 20 million tonne, Nelson complexity index of 11.8 and a conversion rate of 95.5 per cent, it said.The Vadinar refinery possesses high feedstock flexibility with heavy grades from Latin America accounting for more than half of all the feedstock processed. The refinery‚Äôs configuration is one of the most technologically complicated in the Asia-Pacific region and has significant prospects for expansion in development of the petrochemical production.‚ÄúThe availability of all the necessary infrastructure (a deep-water port, storage terminals and own power station are part of the transaction), as well as Rosneft‚Äôs shares in upstream projects in Venezuela and working offtake contracts with PDVSA will provide Rosneft with significant operational synergies and help improve the refinery‚Äôs economics. A further synergy will be derived from cross-supplies of oil products to Asia Pacific markets,‚Äù Rosneft said.The Russian oil major also said Essar Oil‚Äôs vast retail network of 3,500 pumps will improve the assets operational and financial performance thanks to the steadily growing local demand high value-added oil products and EOL‚Äôs retail development strategy.According to International Energy Agency (IEA), from 2000 onwards, motor fuel consumption in India grew on average 6.8 per cent annually. IEA predicts that by 2040 India‚Äôs automotive sector will be consuming 132 million tonne of oil equivalent (mmtoe) of oil products annually."

"Biocon developing 10 biosimilars that collectively target global market opportunity of over $60 billion: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India‚Äôs biopharmaceutical company Biocon , which ranks among top three biosimilar global players for insulin , has multiple successes in its container since its inception. So far, Biocon has successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars from laboratory to market in India.‚ÄúWe will continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in our research and development,‚Äù said, Chairman & Managing Director,. In an email interview with ETHealthworld, the Biocon chief shared her in-depth insights on the challenges, achievements and growth prospects of the biopharma industry in India. Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion‚Äôs share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‚ÄòStart-Up India‚Äô initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia‚Äôs first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‚Äòlab to market‚Äô in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‚Äòfirst-in-class‚Äô oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."

"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys ‚Äî starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka‚Äôs resignation on August 18 ‚Äî need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I‚Äôve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India‚Äôs boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect ‚Äî one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal‚Äôs remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn‚Äôt end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company‚Äôs board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company‚Äôs website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn‚Äôt, as you didn‚Äôt in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here‚Äôs my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys‚Äô share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn‚Äôt end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka‚Äôs pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal‚Äôs task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don‚Äôt I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren‚Äôt needed.

Omkar

GoI to prove it can keep your secrets,"By Nishit Dhruva & Khushboo Shah

The Supreme Court declaring privacy as a fundamental right is in consonance with the Right to Freedom. Privacy is a part of individual liberty and no person shall be deprived of privacy without due process of law.

At the same time, however, the Right to Privacy will have its own limitations and it can‚Äôt be an absolute right in itself. A person has the right to determine what sort of information about them is collected, and how that information is used.

The first task for the authorities will be to interpret and fine-tune all the domains where the issue of privacy is involved. Second, a robust mechanism must be created to ensure this fundamental right is ensured to each one of us. The first task will take care of the ambiguities in the rules, while the second will address the loopholes.

Privacy cannot have an inclusive definition till we list out the dos and don‚Äôts.

The biggest implication of the judgement will be on the Aadhaar row, which a five-member bench will now try to solve in the broad light of Thursday‚Äôs verdict. The Centre now has to convince the Supreme Court that forcing citizens to give a sample of their fingerprints and their iris scan does not violate privacy. The biometric information shared during the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card ‚Äî which includes not just the fingerprints but also a retina scan ‚Äî could become the next big problem of ‚Äòstolen identity‚Äô.

While banks are still struggling against security breaches over credit card usage despite implementing state-of-the-art cyber security measures, GoI has to prove itself to be capable of handling the security of such confidential data and being able to maintain confidentiality. The next crucial area is online privacy. In the light of today‚Äôs verdict, internet users can protect their privacy by taking actions that prevent the collection of information. Protecting personally identifiable information is important for preventing identity theft.

As far as social media policies and practices are concerned, it has been a suo motu disclosure when someone uploads a video, makes a comment, shares his location or an article. They are never forced to do so. With the new technological developments, the issue of data sovereignty ‚Äî the practice of subjecting information to the jurisdiction of data privacy laws on the basis of geographical boundaries ‚Äî may act as a chink in the right to privacy verdict armour.

Today, data is moving seamlessly across globe, with no ownership over its storage. Unless explicitly specified, Indian IT laws are not applicable to data stored outside India and data intermediaries can claim immunity by exploiting this loophole. This judgement will also leave an impact on India‚Äôs ambitious path to evolve as a complete digital economy. The question now is how much personal information can be stored, processed and used by both government and private parties.

The right to privacy, being an intrinsic right under Article 21 of the Constitution that provides the right to life and personal liberty, must have penal provisions in place for its violations. When the right to privacy relates to cyber crimes, the Information and Technology Amendment Act, 2008, separately deals with provisions with regard to penalties and compensations.

An important concern relates to the modernising of penal laws in many countries that exist prior to the advent of computers. On the one hand, existing laws have to change to cope with computer-related fraud such as hacking, malicious falsification and erasure of data, software theft and software attacks, and on the other, a new legislation is also necessary to ensure data protection and piracy.

Timorous Windies stride out to avoid embarrassment and series loss,"WEST INDIES TOUR OF ENGLAND, 2017

Timorous Windies stride out to avoid embarrassment and series loss

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 08:43 PM Rob Johnston in Headingley

Jason Holder will need to inspire his boys ahead of the second Test, failing which they could face another embarrassing defeat. ¬© Getty

""It was totally embarrassing.""

That was the great Curtly Ambrose's reaction to West Indies' defeat by an innings and 209 runs inside three days of the first Test at Edgbaston last week. The tourists lost 19 wickets on the third day which compounded an abject failure with the ball and in the field during England's first innings. In body language and spirit, they looked disinterested. Inexperienced they may be, but West Indies were inexcusably poor.

Given the tourists' abysmal performance in Birmingham, there is a real fear for their prospects in the remaining two matches of the series. A win in the second Test at Headingley, beginning on Friday (August 25), is perhaps unlikely but an improved performance is a must if simply to restore some pride in the battered West Indian team. They can take heart from their victory over Pakistan in Barbados in April which followed a similarly chastening defeat in the previous match in Jamaica.

If there is any hope for an improved performance, it is that West Indies are probably not as bad as they showed in the first Test. In Kraigg Brathwaite, Jermaine Blackwood, who scored an impressive half-century at Edgbaston, and Kemar Roach, there is proven Test match talent and there is promise too in Shai Hope and Roston Chase. With the genuinely quick Shannon Gabriel set to return to the side, the missing aggression that Ambrose said was sorely lacking from the visitors' display at Edgbaston, should be evident too.

West Indies coach Stuart Law and the young captain Jason Holder have had a job on their hands to raise the morale of their team in the lead up to the game and there has not been much time for them to do so. According to Law, the squad have had some honest sessions since their Birmingham defeat but he may be worried that Holder struggled to rouse any sort of reaction from his men at Edgbaston. He also erred tactically in a number of areas including not taking the new ball straightaway on the first evening when the lights were on. The captain surely needs to lift his game.

Unusually, England will probably want to see some improvement from their opponents too. With an Ashes series looming and a number of untried players at Test level in their side, a more demanding workout in Leeds will be just what the doctor ordered. Mark Stoneman, a debutant at Edgbaston, got an excellent delivery from Roach in England's first innings and will want a longer stay in this Test to show what he can do. So too will Tom Westley who suffered another dismissal playing across his front pad in Birmingham.

Headingley has not been a happy hunting ground for England of late which may give the visitors hope. England have won just two of their last seven Tests at the venue although they beat Sri Lanka comfortably last year and thrashed West Indies on their last tour in 2012. Then, England won the Headingley Test by an innings and 283 runs in the face of a similar hapless performance by the men from the Caribbean to the one last week. West Indies, and maybe England, will hope history doesn't repeat itself.

When: Friday, August 25, 2017. 11 AM Local Time

Where: Headingley, Leeds

What to expect: Headingley traditionally favours the seam bowlers and with plenty of wet weather in the build up to this match, there could be some grass left on the pitch for them to exploit. A Mohammad Amir-inspired Essex bowled Yorkshire out here twice inside two days, a couple of weeks ago. The forecast for the match is mixed with some rain forecast on a couple of the days and some sun on others.

Team News:

England:

At some point in the next two Tests, England would have looked to give both all-rounder Chris Woakes and legspinner Mason Crane a game ahead of the Ashes tour and that they did by handing Woakes a return, by replacing Toby Roland-Jones.

Probable XI:

Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (c), Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson

West Indies:

Fast bowler Shannon Gabriel should return to the side following an injury lay-off and will add much needed pace and aggression to the West Indian attack. There may also be a place for legspinner Devendra Bishoo who was surprisingly left out at Edgbaston. Miguel Cummins and Alzzari Joseph are the two bowlers most at risk from the last Test. Despite the brittleness of the West Indian batting, there is little depth in that part of their squad, although 20 year-old Shimron Hetmyer, who captained West Indies Under-19s to a World Cup win in 2016, could come in at the top of the order.

Probable XI: Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich (wk), Jason Holder (c), Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo/Miguel Cummins

Did you know?

Joe Root is one fifty away from equaling AB de Villiers's record of scoring 50-plus in 12 successive Tests.

The last time Windies played at Headingley (in 2007), they faced their heaviest Test defeat - by innings & 283 runs. They were bowled out for 141 & 146 and in comparison Kevin Pietersen alone scored 226 for England.

James Anderson is eight short of becoming the sixth bowler to take 500 Test wickets.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here‚Äôs How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let‚Äôs learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let‚Äôs say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here‚Äôs how you can too:

The I-Can‚Äôt-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

"Nigeria launches $200 mln fund to help local oil and gas firms, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Abuja: Nigeria launched a fund on Thursday with an initial value of $200 million to support local oil and gas firms, the oil minister said, part of a government drive to improve access to low-cost credit across the economy.

The Nigerian Content Development Fund (NCDF) would be financed through allocating the fund one percent of the value of all contracts awarded in the state-run upstream oil and gas industry, Petroleum Ministry said.

Oil sales make up about two-thirds of national revenues in Africa's biggest economy, which is in its first recession in 25 years largely caused by low global crude prices.

The new fund would offer finance to energy firms setting up manufacturing facilities or acquiring assets such as oil rigs, ministry officials said. It would also offer project financing and help refinance existing loans, they said.

""I would like to see this fund going to cutting edge, tech-driven businesses,"" Minister of State for Petroleum Emmanuel Kachikwu told an event in the capital Abuja to launch the fund.

The goal was to increase the size of the fund to $1 billion, he said, without giving a timeframe.

Firms would be able to borrow up to $10 million for a single project or investment at single digit interest rates over five years, officials said. Typically, a commercial bank would charge double digit interest rates in Nigeria.

The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) would manage the fund alongside the state-run Bank of Industry, officials said."

MUMBAI: The enforcement of bio-medical waste management (BMW) rules in municipal corporations in Maharashtra was found to be inadequate in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General 2016. The CAG audited 22 health care establishments between 2011 and 2016.Five HCEs at Nashik and Mumbai did not segregate BMWs as per the rules. Three HCEs in Nashik did not use blue/white translucent puncture proof containers. Instead, they used plastic bags. In two HCEs in Mumbai, sharp waste was mixed with incinerable waste, the CAG report found.In three HCEs, BMW was stored near the patient‚Äôs bed. In 16 of the 22 HCEs, BMW containers were not labelled as per the procedure.Of the 22 HCEs inspected, 20 operated without valid authorisation owing to delays from the MPCB , the CAG report said. Only 8 HCEs maintained a record of collection of BMW.The inspection of hospitals and common facilities by the MPCB was also inadequate, the CAG report found. In fact it said that the advisory committee advising the government and MPCB on the implementation of BMW rules did not meet in 2011-16."

A look into the role of the Port Chairman,"‚ÄúThe chairman of the ports should not merely be involved in the management of a port,‚Äù said Amitabh Kant CEO of Niti Aayog. He was speaking during a workshop on ‚ÄòAccelerating Sagarmala Implementation, organised by the Ministry of Shipping. He should also be involved in boosting exports, he said. Has the time come for a relook in the traditional role of the Chairman of the Major port of India?

If India were to scale up its exports and reach out to global markets, the ports should not only be linked with the sprawling manufacturing units that have come up around the port, but also be capable of handling non core activities of manufacturing.

Currently the brief of the chairman of a Major port in India is primarily to manage the port and oversee maritime activities that fall within his province. However a number of minor ports or private ports have come up along the peninsular region. The areas around these ports, in Mundra for instance, have expanded industrially, so much so that a considerable volume of exports is generated from these areas. Conversely a substantial volume of imports pass through these ports for the industries around it.

The southeast asian countries had consistently clocked a GDP growth of 10% for a considerable period of time. Much of their development could be ascribed to their policy of port led Industrialisation. The emphasis was on exports to reach the global markets. The domestic consumption alone was not enough to propel the country over the crest to sustain an impressive GDP growth.

In Shanghai and other ports in China, the port manager does not limit his role as its manager. He is responsible for industrialization, manufacturing and export of commodities that take place in the outlying areas around the port. In Shanghai the port Chairman looks upon himself as the man changing China, said Kant.

China has a lower container exporting cost than India, due to proximity of industrialized zone to the port area. The presence of major manufacturing and industrial zones in coastal regions developed as part of the Port-Led Policy of the government.

In Hong Kong, the entire process of production of an item to be exported takes place within the port area. Packaging, labelling, sorting- all the activities take place in the port area. Likewise in the case of re export, the item was imported, value added and then re exported -all activities were done within the port area.

For the first time the ambitious Sagarmala project has Port led Industrialisation, as one of the pillars underpinning its implementation. The programme envisages 14 Coastal Economic Zones. SEZ is being planned at the largest port in India, JNPT. Smart Port Industrial cities are under development at Kandla and Paradip. The port should be the hub, the nerve centre for the entire process of manufacturing activity.

Likewise in the hintertland regions, the Container Freight Stations (CFS) should take on more comprehensive role rather than being mere custodians of the cargo. The CFSs should be bigger in area that could take on the peripheral activities of manufacturing.

All these developments call for an expanded role for the Chairmen of the port or CFS. The time has come to review/amend their functions as administrators to take on a more broader role that would significantly contribute to India‚Äôs trade."

Yogi Govt Makes Aadhaar Card Must For Patients Who Need Govt Ambulance Service In UP,"The Uttar Pradesh government has made Aadhaar card mandatory for anyone wanting to avail its free ambulance service. Now, if a patient calls an ambulance to his home, his relative or he will have to produce their Aadhaar card. According to officials, this is being done to clamp down on anomalies in ambulance trips, including duration and distance, which have occurred. The recording of Aadhaar numbers of patients will help reduce fraudulent use of the vehicles. However, with large numbers of people, particularly in rural areas, still without Aadhaar cards, residents are expected to face considerable problems.

PTI/Representational Image

Health department officials pointed out that ambulance services provided by the government had several loopholes and flaws. Drivers sometimes made fake trips and wrote fraudulent details of patients to siphon off money for fuel. The drivers sometimes made fake calls themselves to make the trips. To stop such irregularities, the state government has sent a letter to all chief medical officers of districts in UP stating that Aadhaar is now a must if someone wants an ambulance.

BCCL/Representational Image

Bijnor CMO Suhveer Singh said, ""There are total of 53 ambulances, including those which can be called by dialling 102 and 108, in the district. 'Dial 102' ambulances are reserved for pregnant women, while other patients can dial 108 for an ambulance. No documents were required from the patient to avail the services earlier. Now the state government has instructed us that whenever anyone calls for an ambulance, his Aadhaar card must be produced.""

Representational Image

Singh added, ""The government has not declared the exact date to make Aadhaar card compulsory. For the time being, if a patient's condition is serious and he has no Aadhaar card, he can be carried to hospital. But soon the card is set to be compulsory for all patients.""

However, in the rural parts of the state, Aadhaar cards have still not been made by everyone. With the poor healthcare infrastructure already an issue, residents said the new rule would make the situation even more difficult for patients to reach hospital on time.

Punam Chaudhary, a resident of Puranpur village, said, ""It is a good move to curb corruption in the ambulance service. But if someone does not have an Aadhaar card, what will he do? In villages like ours, ambulances don't even arrive on time and we have to manage on our own.""

Will India shake off its grand delusions?,"‚ÄòTis the season for chest-thumping. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unquestionably on top of the heap. But what a heap it is. Over the past couple of weeks, quite a bit of nasty triumphalism has been on display. Such eruptions need a trigger, and a handy one was provided by the departing remarks of Vice-President Hamid Ansari.

The amount of opprobrium heaped on Ansari was astonishing and disproportionate. Just two weeks before Ansari‚Äôs retirement, President Pranab Mukherjee, in his own farewell speech, had said India‚Äôs soul resides in pluralism and tolerance. ‚ÄúWe may argue, we may agree or we may not agree. But we cannot deny the essential prevalence of multiplicity of opinion. Otherwise, a fundamental character of our thought process will wither away.‚Äù Mukherjee also spoke of the rising tide of violence: ‚ÄúAt the heart of this violence is darkness, fear and mistrust.‚Äù

These are stark and unambiguous statements, but they did not draw the kind of vitriol that Ansari‚Äôs ‚Äúsense of insecurity‚Äù remark did. In the days since, the BJP‚Äôs op-ed writers have weighed in with what can be charitably described as selective intellectualism. This is happening alongside a continual re-telling of history. Both strands converged in a column by the BJP‚Äôs national general secretary Ram Madhav titled ‚ÄòComing Full Circle at 70‚Äô.

Madhav wrote about the ‚Äúgenius of our country, which is rooted in its religio-social institutions like state, family, caste, guru and festival‚Äù, and went on to rubbish Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äôs leadership after independence, comparing him unfavourably with strongmen like David Ben-Gurion in Israel, Mao Zedong in China and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey.

Quoting from a sharp exchange of letters in 1945 between Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru over ‚Äònative wisdom‚Äô and village life as the centrepiece in new India. Nehru was peddling his colonial masters‚Äô views, Madhav said. He ignored the fact that the two men may have differed, but were extraordinarily close ‚Äì Gandhi did not disavow Nehru as the best choice to lead independent India or waver from naming Nehru his political heir.

Nehru may have been westernised, but he certainly had deep connections with rural India, travelling often into the countryside from his 20s. In the first years after independence, he wrestled with food scarcities, a better deal for farmers, and the abolition of the zamindari system so the share-cropper would get to till his own land. ‚ÄúFor the Congress the agrarian question was the dominating social issue and much time had been given to its study and the formulation of policy,‚Äù Nehru wrote in The Discovery of India. Twelve years later, the then prime minister wrote to a chief minister: ‚ÄúI would repeat that the keystone of our planning is agricultural production. We can never have surpluses for industrial growth unless these come from agriculture.‚Äù

Ironically, to underline his point Madhav quoted a Western writer. ‚ÄúThe liberal unease is palpable. Their plight is best described by Edward Luce in his book through a less-used Greek word demophobia ‚Äî fear of the mob. The mob, humble people of the country, are behind Modi. They are finally at ease with a government that looks and sounds familiar. They are enjoying it,‚Äù Madhav wrote.

Madhav is being disingenuous. Luce has used ‚Äòdemophobia‚Äô in his new book The Retreat of Western Liberalism to highlight the anxiety of the elites in western democracies. In a recent interview on Vox.com, Luce says that the United States and Britain are more vulnerable to populism because of their triumphalist and complacent stand on their economic and political models, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs not a surprise that wealthier people in the West, who are doing better than they‚Äôve ever done before, are feeling way more demophobic‚Äù.

When there was dismay at his apparent endorsement of vigilantism, Madhav responded that he had meant the humble masses, ‚Äúnot the mob in conventional sense‚Äù.

In another celebration of cultural nationalism, Delhi University professor Rakesh Sinha criticised Ansari‚Äôs ‚Äòbinary‚Äô view of majority and minority and noted: ‚ÄúFrom 2014 onwards, there has been a marked consolidation of saffron politics as India‚Äôs political executive is completely Congress-mukt ‚Äî the offices of president, vice president and prime minister are held by RSS men.‚Äù

He quoted Tajamul Hussain, a lawyer and member of the Constituent Assembly, as saying there had never been a tyranny of the majority in India. True ‚Äì but that was because the subcontinent had allowed itself to be ruled by tiny minorities ‚Äì the Mughals and the British ‚Äì for four centuries. In the Assembly, Hussain fought long and hard against a proposal to set aside reserved constituencies for Muslims. This was understandable ‚Äì he was the only Shia among 31 Muslim representatives from the provinces. On 26 May 1949, for example, Hussain argued that no ‚Äòspeck of separatism‚Äô ought to be permitted in the new Indian constitution: ‚ÄúOther minorities will also be encouraged to demand it. Minority within a minority must be logically entitled to it and thus, far from adding and aiding unity, it will only serve to promote separatism and create sectional strife, leading to untold religious, social and political complications.‚Äù

The makers of our constitution decided wisely in the end against constituencies reserved for minority religions. That has stood us in good stead. The same Nehru who is now being air-brushed out of our history and political discourse said in the Constituent Assembly on August 14, 1947, hours before independence: ‚ÄúAt a time when we are on the threshold of freedom, we should remember that India does not belong to any one party or group of people or caste. It does not belong to the followers of any particular religion. It is the country of all, of every religion and creed. We have repeatedly defined the type of freedom we desire. In the first resolution, which I moved earlier, it has been said that our freedom is to be shared equally by every Indian. All Indians shall have equal rights, and each one of them is to partake equally in that freedom.‚Äù

Seventy years after independence, we are still struggling with many of the fundamental questions the Constituent Assembly grappled with. We have still not fulfilled Article 44 in our Directive Principles of State Policy: ‚ÄúThe State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.‚Äù Bigotry and bias still stalk our land. But we deceive ourselves that we are an egalitarian democracy. I remembered Adi Shankaracharya, the genius who in his very brief life (788-820 CE) cemented Advaita philosophy and sanatana dharma (eternal duties) and wrote numerous treatises while criss-crossing India. In his Maya Panchakam (five verses on delusion) the refrain is: ‚ÄúAghatita ghatana patiyasi maya‚Äù (that is the unique effect produced by deceptive delusion). When will we emerge from our delusions?"

"From Shabana Azmi To Farhan Akhtar, Bollywood Applauds Supreme Court's Ruling On Triple Talaq","For long, Muslim women have been fighting against the Triple Talaq attempting to seek justice, and yesterday when the Supreme Court ruled the practice as unconstitutional, it seemed like the women of the nation achieved a milestone in their fight for their rights.

While there were some people who weren‚Äôt happy, others hailed the decision of the Supreme Court. And so did the Hindi film industry. From Shabana Azmi to Farhan Akhtar and others, the entire Bollywood industry applauded the decision.

wikimedia.org

‚ÄúThe Supreme Courts judgement against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have religious sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in secular India,‚Äù Shabana Azmi told TOI.

Farhan Akhtar also expressed his happiness on the same.

‚ÄúThe way the society is moving forward, the focus that is there on women‚Äôs rights and equality, and the fight for gender equality. It is very healthy that such a decision has been made. Now there is a six month window to figure out how it should be translated into a law, I hope it happens. Because it is a very archaic practice, it is time for it to go.‚Äù

"Technological advancements are transforming the entire healthcare industry : Dr GSK Velu, Health News, ET HealthWorld","ByChairman & Managing Director, Trivitron Healthcare Group of CompaniesAn unparalleled pace of technological revolution has transformed almost every aspect of our lives. We live in a technological era where we continuously switch between multiple devices for most parts of the day. Innovations in the digital space have now made it possible for consumers to use portable devices to access their medical history, keep an eye on their important signs, take tests at home and help in carrying out a wide range of tasks.Those days have gone by when one needs to wait for days and weeks to get effective primary healthcare. In present scenario, an individual is being advised his/her next appointment slot in two days, which seldom delivers a positive reaction.For the first time human beings are ‚Äòdigitized‚Äô. Any individual can now remotely and continuously monitor every heart beat, moment-to-moment blood pressure readings, the rate and depth of breathing, temperature of the body and many more. Now, we also have the technology to digitize a human being in highest definition, in granular detail, and in ways that most people thought would not be possible.In the present era, wearables are turning our daily health routines into a game, which is simultaneously making it easier for us to track and share our health data which is the next 'big thing'. These wearing devices allow a consumer to access their medical information, monitor their conditions and carry out a more active lifestyle.As more consumers are making use of wearable devices and apps to manage their health, it is slowly changing the dynamics of the patient-doctor relationship. Consumers having access to their own medical data makes them more knowledgeable and ultimately boosts their confidence when visiting with their doctor. These newly launched wearables and health apps have opened the door not only for doctors, but for Pharma brands and other marketers as well. Health brands now should be thinking about how to use these live patient data, or how to build patient profiles that can help align patients with right therapies.In spite of the progress in the healthcare industry , India still continues to struggle with critical issues and gaps in its healthcare system. The current hospital and welfare services are insufficient for the strain they encounter with as the growth of population ageing increases. In India, healthcare is underserved as well as under-consumed. Hard infrastructure and talent are both in short supply, and there are significant regional variations in healthcare delivery. Investments in primary care and public health have also been long been inadequate. Disruptive technologies have already transformed the delivery of public health services in the last few years, and in the new few decades, it is only going to evolve like extending care through remote health services to carry out basic protocols and much more. The primary focus of medicines have completely shifted from treating our diseases to keeping us healthy and enhancing the quality of our life. We can already imagine the round-the-clock sensors measuring how our hearts are doing while we are jogging.While technology driven disruptions is already making inroads into the health sector, our approach is limited to current socio-economic factors. How businesses and healthcare professionals prepare themselves in the coming decades also depends on cost challenges, presence of universal healthcare, social support and living arrangements of the elderly, income security and more. India will benefit to a great extent from gathering high-quality data on population ageing and using it to inform policies that will work towards creating and expanding income support and health insurance programs for older Indians.Today, Indian hospitals are stepping into the adoption of technology; government is facilitating many healthcare programs with the support of technology as their backbone. The government is now trying to build a standard for Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and medical devices which will soon help the hospitals to adopt medical technology faster, to align with the 21st century customers who believe in the fast delivery of services.Also with time, genomic based medicine is becoming more crucial and healthcare professionals keep a pace of this complex and rapidly developing field. Genomics and its related laboratory technologies have shaped a wealth of opportunities in fields such as medicine, industry and much more. It is vital to provide information for disease diagnosis and management through appropriate laboratory investigations. Effective patient care can be assured only through quality diagnosis, in each and every step. Clinical laboratories in recent times have gone through major technological advancements. With intense research development happening in the field of pathogenesis of diseases and personalized medicine, advanced diagnostic techniques and tests are being implemented extensively.Genomics continue to bring about far-reaching and impactful changes in the manner of diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases. Consistent research is being made particularly in diseases like cancer, congenital diseases and acute infections.These technologies are now becoming a big assistance to the doctors in diagnostics and determining the problems. They are being used to conduct researches and also find cures to the illness that are noticed in patients. Some equipment such CT scans MRI scan machines and even the tests that are conducted for detecting diabetics and cholesterol testing etc has now being supported by many health care manufacturing companies, encouraging faster and technologically-equipped India.Technological innovations across healthcare industry will go beyond the already used mobile technology, mobile devices, wearable technology telemedicine and information sharing platforms. One can be very optimistic about newer ways of healthcare delivery by way of drones, robots and artificial intelligence performed by humans, to reduce variability, cost and error whilst providing ‚Äòquality‚Äô healthcare system."
Latest News: Weird & Wacky News Online,
Supreme Court has done right to quash triple talaq,"The Supreme Court‚Äôs majority verdict declaring triple, or instant, talaq unconstitutional is an important, albeit limited, victory for Muslim women in India. It aligns India‚Äôs Muslim personal law, in this regard, with the law in most large Islamic nations that have already outlawed triple talaq, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. It opens the door for a serious engagement towards creating a civil legal code based on the principle of equality.

For women of Muslim faith in this country, the judgement marks a first important step. But there is still a long way to go. The judgement focused on a single issue, the triple instant talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, a frequent method of divorce among Sunni Muslims in India. It does not address issues like polygamy or nikah halala, or even the unilateral privileging of men in two other routes of divorce: talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan. Personal laws of other religious communities, Hindus and Christians, have gone through renditions to address some concerns relating to gender equality in matters of inheritance and polygamy. Despite the gains, gender equality does not permeate all aspects of civil law. The triple talaq judgement presents an opportunity to initiate a debate on putting in place a uniform civil code that brings equality ‚Äî across faiths and gender. The government should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. In doing so, care must be taken to strengthen democracy, rather than weaken it.

If any attempt to modify personal laws is seen not through the prism of gender equality and inter-community parity, but from a perspective of imposing the majority‚Äôs will over minorities, that would vitiate democracy. This depends not just on the modifications proposed in personal law but on the overall developments in the polity. Political parties would do well to not stoke sectarian passions in the name of personal laws. Ridding laws and practices of patriarchal privilege is not easy, but essential to move towards a more wholesome democracy."

7 Fruits That Can Boost Your Iron Levels Similar To How Vegetables And Supplements Do,"The benefits of increasing the intake of iron in your diet are no longer a mystery. From keeping your energy levels high to preventing hair loss or even tackling conditions such as anaemia; we cannot function without adequate levels of iron in our body.

chesterbennington.tk

We've been harping over vegetables like spinach and supplements that boost your intake of iron for decades now. But did you know that not only are some fruits loaded with iron they also help your body absorb it better from other sources. If you‚Äôre a lover of fruits though, these are some potent options you can try out:

Raisins

picturebritain.com

This easily accessible fruit is one of the most potent fruit sources of iron, with around 1.6 milligrams of iron in it. Raisins can be mixed with almonds, cashews and pistachios or mixed with sweet dishes.

Figs

fitbody.ro

The beauty about figs is that they can be eaten fresh or dried. Their iron content is amplified when they are soaked overnight.

Dates

media24.az

Not only are these fruits super-sweet a cup (250gm) of dates contain up to 3 milligrams of iron. Add it to salads or sweet dishes like ice creams.

Pomegranates

greek-gourmet.gr

You can literally never get bored of having pomegranates in any form you like every day. Whether it be in a salad or as fresh juice they are loaded with iron and can help you fight blood-related such as anaemia or iron deficiency.

Citrus fruits

slurrpy.com

Although the citrus fruits are an excellent source of vitamin C, the citrus in the fruit is ideal for absorbing the iron in the greens and the nuts.

Tropical fruits

healthexcellence.net

Fruits like guava, papaya, kiwi‚Äôs and mango contain copious amounts of vitamin C as well; thereby helping with the absorption of iron.

Berries

Berries such as raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and especially strawberries are also great sources of vitamin C, which can further help with the absorption of iron."
Is The Possibility Of A Hybrid Flu Pandemic A Reality? Here‚Äôs What You Need To Know,"Flu viruses have been a global threat in modern history ever since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 killed 40-50 million worldwide and infected at least 500 million. And now recent history continues to see the evolution of swine flu into different strains.

holahola

The 2009 swine flu pandemic saw the demise of over 200,000 people worldwide; marking another monumental unprecedented death toll due to a flu virus. India itself has already recorded 1,094 swine flu-related deaths this year.

healthshlok.com

Flu pandemics such as these from the past have shown us that different strains can mix and evolve into new strains of viruses that we have not had answers to. As we face another strain of an avian Influenza Virus (H7N9) that inflicted China not too long ago, scientists are taking matters into their own hands by testing for new viruses that can cause havoc to prepare themselves for the worst.

dailystar.co.uk

One such landmark study mixed a bird flu virus and a human flu virus giving birth to a hybrid flu virus as published in the journal Science.

Why is this important?

ftwonline.co.za

The study was conducted in an effort to understand how bird flu viruses naturally mix with mammal-infected viruses that are present in livestock who act as a host, which then trigger human pandemics.

What strains of viruses did the researchers mix?

mintmochamusings.com

The researchers mixed the deadly ‚Äòswine flu‚Äô virus (H1N1) and a subtype of the ‚Äòinfluenza A‚Äô virus (H5N1) a bird flu virus to check the potency of the resultant virus.

What is the motive behind creating such a virus?

ikon.mn

The researchers claim they are conducting these tests to help develop preventative vaccines for future to avoid pandemic breakouts. Lord May of Oxford, a former government chief scientist and past president of the Royal Society told the Independent UK, ‚ÄúThey claim they are doing this to help develop vaccines and such like. In fact, the real reason is that they are driven by blind ambition with no common sense whatsoever‚Äù.

What was the outcome of the experiment?

vanguardngr.com

They came up with a total of 127 virus combos; some of which were able to spread through the air. The researchers were trying to emulate a realistic scenario where animals such as pigs get infected with a strain of the virus. The bird flu viruses that were made airborne were able to inflict mammals, including human beings.

Is safe to run such an experiment?

wsau.com

The study was conducted in a laboratory with the second highest security levels in order to ensure that there are no accidental escapes. However, May claimed, ‚ÄúThe record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring. They are taking it upon themselves to create human-to-human transmission of very dangerous viruses. It‚Äôs appallingly irresponsible.‚Äù

So how dangerous is such a virus then?

vustug-info.ru

Since the experiment proved that the bird flu virus (H5N1) was able to mix with the swine flu (H1N1) virus to create a strain that can infect human beings, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to pay caution to the wind. Professor Simon Wain-Hobson, an eminent virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said it is likely that some or all of these hybrids could pass easily between humans and possess some or all of the highly lethal characteristics of H5N1 bird-flu, as reported in the Independent UK. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know the pathogenicity [lethality] in man and hopefully we will never know,‚Äù added Hobson.

The result of the experiment still remains unclear, however.

sulnews.com.br

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fabulous piece of virology by the Chinese group and it‚Äôs very impressive, but they haven‚Äôt been thinking clearly about what they are doing. It‚Äôs very worrying,‚Äù added Professor Wain-Hobson said. ‚ÄúThe virological basis of this work is not strong. It is of no use for vaccine development and the benefit in terms of surveillance for new flu viruses is oversold‚Äù.

Virologist Dr Vladimir Blinov had predicted next hybrid flu (swine flu and bird flu) after one that appeared in 1957, the H2N2 that took 2 million lives, can come from CHINA this year in a report by Daily Star.

Why Men Are More Likely To Be In A Grumpy Mood At Around 2pm In The Afternoon!,"As a guy, you‚Äôre prone to be a little a grumpy in the afternoon as compared to in the morning or evening hours. Not because we assume so because science says so!

cementmarketing.com

A recent study claims that men find their mood most slumped at around 2 pm in the afternoon!

Scientists from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia came up with this conclusion after taking the brain scans of men during various times of the day.

yamuzhchina.ru

The reason the researchers stated was due to of the activation of the reward-processing brain regions of the brain at different times of the day.

The findings showed that activation of a reward-processing region of the brain peaks in the morning and evening and dips at 2 p.m.

For the study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the team compared activation of the brain's reward system in young men during a gambling task at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.

trend.ge

They found that activation in the left putamen was lowest in the early afternoon. This finding may parallel the drop in alertness people tend to feel in mid-afternoon, the researchers said.

""While the left putamen had the greatest activation at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., it had significantly lowered activation at 2 p.m.,"" Jamie Byrne from the varsity was quoted as saying to Daily Mail.

""The left putamen is particularly responsive to unexpected rewards, so our data suggest that the brain's reward centres might be primed to expect rewards in the early afternoon and be surprised when they appear at the start and end of the day,"" Byrne added.

Understanding how activity in the brain's reward system changes throughout the day could have implications for depression, substance abuse and sleep disturbances, said Greg Murray from the Swinburne University in Australia.

"Firing of neurons changes the cells that insulate them, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Through their pattern of firing, neurons influence the behavior of the cells that upon maturation will provide insulation of neuronal axons, according to a new study publishing 22 August in the open access journal PLOS Biology by Balint Nagy Maria Kukley and colleagues at the University of T√ºbingen , Germany. The findings suggest the existence of a complex and nuanced interplay between neurons and the non-neuronal cells that support and protect them. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) give rise to oligodendrocytes, which wrap the axons of neurons in the central nervous system with myelin to electrically insulate them. Neurons signal to OPCs through chemical synapses. Previous work has shown that electrical or optical stimulation of nerve fibers influences the proliferation of OPCs and their differentiation into oligodendrocytes, but whether that stimulation acts like an on-off switch, influencing OPCs only by its presence or absence, or more like a dimmer switch, inducing a graded response in the OPC, has been unclear.To investigate that question, the authors studied oligodendroglial cells in the corpus callosum, a nerve tract which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, both in fresh brain slices and in living rodents. Using electrodes, they stimulated neurons to fire and recorded responses in the neighboring OPCs.They found that stimulating neuronal fibers in brain slices at low frequencies led to a slowly oscillating movement of ions through the membrane of OPCs, while high-frequency stimulation caused a much more rapidly oscillating movement of ions. High-frequency stimulation of neuronal fibers in living animals led to greater OPC proliferation (creating more OPCs) over the course of a week than did low-frequency stimulation; low-frequency stimulation, in turn, led to more differentiation of OPCs into pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, the cells that then go on to develop into oligodendrocytes which make myelin.How OPCs translate different patterns of neuronal firing into differences in proliferation and differentiation is unknown, but differences in firing pattern have been seen to affect gene expression in neurons themselves in a graded rather than on-off way, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be at work in OPCs. Intriguingly, different neuronal firing patterns affect properties of chemical synapses between neurons and OPC, as well as intracellular concentrations of ions in OPCs such as sodium, potassium, and calcium, in a distinct fashion. Hence, it is possible that neurons use synapses with OPCs to influence OPCs behavior, including proliferation and maturation. It is not yet known whether the frequency-related differences in behavior of OPCs actually match the neuron‚Äôs respective needs.Myelination in the brain is plastic. It can be influenced by our everyday behavior and is responsive to environmental inputs, with physical activity increasing it and social isolation decreasing it. Understanding the mechanisms mediating the effects of activity on myelination may offer significant opportunities for therapeutic intervention in disorders in which myelination or remyelination are deficient. ‚ÄúThis research may open new perspective to therapy of demyelinating disorders where remyelination strongly relies on the increased proliferation and differentiation of OPCs,‚Äù commented Kukley."
"Japan Now Has Robot Priests For Funeral Services, If You Desire A Tech-Savvy Death Ceremony!","In a classic case of first world trend-setting, Japan has started a truly unusual first-of-its-kind robot service.

A robot priest unlike anything you've ever seen before / REUTERS

At its ongoing Life Ending Industry EXPO 2017 -- yeah, let that sink it in for a moment, the fact that Japan has an expo for everything related to death -- a 'robot priest' wearing a Buddhist robe was unveiled, one that's programmed to conduct the end of life rites at funeral services.

Nissei Eco, a plastic moulding company in Japan which also offers funeral services, is putting the Buddhist robot priest up for sale. The robot is nothing but SoftBank's Pepper brand of humanoid robots which was first launched in 2014 -- this is just a new avatar in which the robot is programmed to carry out a specific function.

The robot priest will be able to chant Buddhist sutras, bang drums and livestream the funeral ceremony.

The robot priest will also cost less at 50,000 yen (about $450) per funeral compared to 240,000 yen ($2,200) or more charged by a human priest to perform the same traditional Buddhist funeral service in Japan, according to Reuters.

Anyone dead yet for me to rock and roll? / REUTERS

This robot priest also solves a crucial demographic problem which is gripping Japan, whose population is not only aging fast but also shrinking. Due to this phenomenon, many Buddhist priests are finding that their services are less in demand, making the profession financially unsustainable in the long run. Buddhist priests are forced to find part-time work to survive financially, requiring them to take up jobs outside of their core temple duties.

The robot is yet to be hired to conduct a funeral service in Japan. Whenever that happens, it will be a watershed moment for humanity. After all, we gave birth to robots in the first place, and to think robots will preside over death ceremonies of humans very soon, isn't without a sense of irony.

"Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar mastermind Pallekele miracle","INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar mastermind Pallekele miracle

Kaushik Rangarajan ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 01:44 AM

Dananjaya picked up 6 for 54 leaving India reeling at 131 for 7 before Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar guided the team home. ¬© AFP

Just like that, Kandy found its voice. A small group that had joined the beeline to leave the picturesque stadium rushed back to their seats. On the field, bodies in deep blue jerseys cascaded atop one another. When the cameras eventually caught a glimpse of young Akila Dananjaya, he offered a beaming, toothy smile.

KL Rahul became the third Indian batsman - after Kedar Jadhav and Virat Kohli - to be bowled by a Dananjaya wrong-un in the 18th over of the chase. Something extraordinary had transpired. India had fallen to 119 for 5. But something more utterly implausible was to follow. Something that would have made Sir Alex Ferguson exclaim, 'Cricket, bloody hell'.

India took a 2-0 lead in the five-match series as was widely anticipated before the game and when Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan put on their 11th century stand for the first wicket. But they got to the target, in a manner very few enviosioned. MS Dhoni - yes, him again - and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (53 not out) put on a miraculous unbeaten 100-run eighth-wicket stand that annulled Dananjaya's six-wicket wizardy before that. When Dananjaya took the sixth wicket with India at 131 for 7, their end seemed nigh and Sri Lanka's drought looked set to finish at last. When he returned a couple of hours later, the dip mysteriously disappeared and the wrong-un sat up for Bhuvneshwar to slap home a couple of boundaries to leave India 14 runs away.

By all means, this was an epic ODI, truncated to a 47-over chase after a brief spell of rain between innings. It was cruel to see a 24-year-old spinner, who'd returned immediately after his wedding to help his team belie their status as whipping boys, walk off with his head down. His bag of tricks had sent India spiralling into a dizzying collapse and thus deserving of all the hugs and the player of the match trophy that came his way at the end of the game.

Only 22 overs had been bowled when Axar Patel missed a skidder to be trapped LBW to become the seventh Indian wicket to fall. So purely from a time perspective, the story of Pallekele, 2017 had enough time for another chapter. And so, Bhuvneshwar joined forces with Dhoni in an attempt to script it.

India were able to recover from 131 for 7 because of the century stand between Bhuvneshwar and Dhoni. ¬© AFP

They batted and batted, ignoring the fact that there was such a thing called a boundary existed. A nudge to the leg followed by a tap to the off. That Sri Lanka held back two of Dananjaya's overs for later helped. Sri Lanan pacer's benevolence was an added positive. Malinga (none for 49 in 8), Vishwa Fernando (none for 32 in 6.2) and Dushmantha Chameera (none for 45 in 7) offered little in terms of control, forcing Upul Tharanga to slowly move his fielders away from single-saving positions. The trio also contributed to 12 of Sri Lanka's 14 wides thereby allowing easy dissipation of pressure.

That Dhoni didn't see the need to farm the strike over at any point in the chase allowed Bhuvneshwar to grow in confidence through the innings. By the end, he was slog sweeping Siriwardana for six over midwicket and rocking back on the backfoot to drive Dananjaya's leg break through extra cover. The partnership had it's moment of fortune too, after Dhoni was reprieved with the heavy zing bails refusing to dislodge despite the ball rolling back and hitting the base of the stumps with a thud after a failed Dhoni front-foot defence. He was on 30 then but more importantly, Bhuvneshwar was on 14 and still just about finding his way

But, for a long time in this nine-hour classic, this game seemed like another of disappointingly one-sided games that have so become the norm in the series. More so when Rohit shrugged off his Sri Lanka hoodoo with his fastest ODI fifty (off 43 balls). India were 109 for no-loss and heading home with room to spare before the first of the unthinkables happened. Siriwardana, the part-time left-arm spinner, denied Shikhar Dhawan his seventh successive 50+ score against Sri Lanka when he had the southpaw caught brilliantly by a diving Angelo Mathews at short fine-leg for 49. The other six, including the opening partnership breaker, came courtesy Dananjaya's wizardry.

Rohit missed a sweep and took with him the only available review. India tweaked their batting order to send KL Rahul and Kedar Jadhav at Nos. 3 and 4 only to see them cleaned up by Dananjaya, who between these two scalps also had Kohli fall to his mystery. An over later, a dumbfounded Hardik Pandya danced down the pitch and was stumped. The magic proved futile at the end as Dhoni took control of another chase with Sri Lanka struggling to back the youngster's efforts with the ball.

If it's some consolation, although Sri Lanka would pay no heed right now, two of the hosts' three new inductees for this game (Dananjaya and Milinda Siriwardana) so nearly contributed to a series-levelling win. The hosts though did their recent reputation of indulging in self-destructive tendencies little harm as they let slip another strong start from Niroshan Dickwella with their strange shot selection. Mendis and Mathews fell to the sweep while Tharanga poked awkwardly to slip.

After slipping to 121 for 5, Siriwardana scored a run-a-ball 58 in a 91-run stand with Chamara Kapugedara to take Sri Lanka closer to a 250-plus total. That they fell short of what could have been a potentially match-winning total was completely down Jasprit Bumrah's sensational final spell. The seamer, bowling his assortment of yorkers and slower deliveries, finished with 4 for 43 and Sri Lanka ended with 236 - a total that proved to be beyond their defence even after a dream spell from Dananjaya.

Brief scores: Sri Lanka 236/8 (Milinda Siriwardana 58, Chamara Kapugedara 40; Jasprit Bumrah 4-43, Yuzvendra Chahal 2-43) lost to India 231/7 (Rohit Sharma 54, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 53*, MS Dhoni 45*; Akila Dananjaya 6-54) by three wickets (D/L/S Method).

Samsung Just Launched The Successor To The Galaxy Note 7 With A Massive Price Tag!,"After scores of leaks, rumours, and lots of hype, Samsung finally launched its latest flagship yesterday, the Galaxy Note 8. The device is a thing of beauty with a gigantic display, rounded edges, and the S Pen stylus that‚Äôs a joy to use. But there‚Äôs a major problem that could hinder Samsung in certain markets.

Look but don't touch

We‚Äôre talking about the price of course, the Galaxy Note 8 starts at a base price of $930 (approximately Rs 60,000) in the US. That price is obviously expected to be higher once the device hits Indian shores, likely somewhere in the Rs 65,000 to Rs 70,000 region. The question is, is Samsung‚Äôs flagship worth it?

The Galaxy note 8 features a 6.3-inch QHD+ (1440x2960) Super AMOLED display, with a 12MP dual camera system on the rear and a 8MP f/1.7 selfie camera. Of those rear shooters, one is a f/1.7 wide angle lens, and the other is a f/2.4 telephoto lens. The device packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in the US, or a Exynos octa-core processor everywhere else, paired with 6GB of RAM and 64GB (US), 128GB, or 256GB of internal storage. It runs on a 3300mAh battery, and has USB Type-C, wireless charging, Bluetooth 5.0, and LTE support.

So, the question here is, do all of those features justify Samsung pricing the Galaxy Note 8 at Rs 60,000? Perhaps. But for most people, you're still going to have to either sell off your possessions or really tighten your budget for the next few months to afford this device. Unless you fancy paying off credit card bills for the next year that is.

With Samsung pricing their most expensive Android phone close to $1000, what does that have to tell us about the iPhone 8's price? Get ready for expensive flagship smartphones in the near future!

The perfect honeymoon and the agile stump master

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 12:44 AM Gokul Gopal in Kandy

Sadly for Dananjaya, his efforts went in vain a Dhoni's finishing prowess came to the fore and India unearthed a new batting hero in Bhuvneshwar. ¬© AFP

Dickwella vs Bumrah

In the first match, Niroshan Dickwella had scored a half-century but had also struggled against Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the initial stages. There were plenty of edges and plays and misses for the left-handed Sri Lankan opener, who was living dangerously. But having a fifty under one's belt can do wonders to a batsman's confidence. Barring an inside edge off the first delivery, off Bhuvneshwar, Dickwella was pretty much in control of his shots. A short-arm jab over mid-on earned him his first boundary and he also hammered a couple of sixes off Bumrah. But the shot of the day was his four off Bumrah that came in the fourth over. The batsman backed away and the bowler, identifying that, tried to cramp him for room. But Dickwewlla managed to execute a shot that would have made the likes of Brian Lara proud. It was just a punch off the back-foot with the bat perpendicular to the ground and the end result was the ball racing past point and rocketing to the fence. But his entertaining innings came to a premature end and it was Bumrah who had the last laugh in the contest. Dickwella again tried to back away and Bumrah followed him again but this time, foxed him with a slower delivery and had the batsman flick the ball tamely to square-leg.

The stump master

Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a wicketkeeper par excellence, especially when it comes to his stumpings. Be it keeping to the likes of Harbhajan Singh, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja or the latest bunch like Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, one thing that the bowlers are assured - if a batsman steps out and misses the ball - is a dependable entity behind the stumps. Only two wicketkeepers have effected more than 90 stumpings in ODIs and Dhoni is one of them. Today, he equalled Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara's record of most stumpings in ODI cricket. Dhanushka Gunathilaka stepped out of the crease in an attempt to take on Chahal. But so far down the wicket had he come that the batsman ended up yorking himself and missed the ball. Meanwhile, Dhoni appeared to be blind-sided a bit and fumbled with his first take. But he managed to regain control of the ball quickly and brought down the bails well in time to record number 99 on his wicketkeeping resume in the stumping section.

Mixed day for Pandya

The first ball that he bowled, when he was introduced into the attack at the start of the 11th over, was a short one that travelled well over the bowler's head. Luckily for him, the umpire did not signal a wide. But persisting with his short tactics, Pandya conceded two wides. Yet, his idea materialised when he managed to send back Tharanga with a full delivery after a few short ones. While that was a moment of joy for the Indian all-rounder, some disappointment followed. Having been struck for a four by Angelo Mathews in the 28th over, Pandya went down in pain, having some trouble with his left calf. After the physio attended to him, he was back on his feet and bowled the next ball, only to walk off the field soon after. Even when he was back on the field in the latter part of the first innings, Pandya was still struggling, his movements while fielding being hampered by cramps. Nevertheless, he was still diving around and trying to save runs for the team, although he didn't bowl another over in the day. When he would later come out to bat, Pandya got out for a duck for the first time in his career.

The same old story

In the first ODI, after a strong start, the Sri Lankan batsmen failed to consolidate, throwing away their wickets in a jiffy after attempting ill-advised shots like sweeps, reverse-sweeps and jumping down the track. It was no different in the second game too as their shot selection caused their downfall. While Dickwella was done in by some clever thinking from Bumrah, the ones that followed gifted their wickets away. While dancing down the wicket led to Gunathilaka's departure, Upul Tharanga seems to choose different ways to get out. Having fallen to a full-toss in the first game, the Lankan skipper played away from his body with no movement of his feet, a basic mistake that led to an edge to second slip. And then came out the sweep, to a full straight delivery from Chahal, causing Kusal Mendis to be trapped in front and the batsman also needlessly ended up depriving his team of their review. Mathews followed a short while later, failing in his attempt to execute a sweep to a full delivery from Axar Patel. The basics of playing straight, waiting for the ball, rotating the strike, etc. seemed to be lost on the Sri Lankan top-order batsmen before Milinda Siriwardana reminded them of that with a run-a-ball 58. But the damage was done already and the left-hander's knock only ensured that Sri Lanka bettered their first ODI efforts by 20 runs and batted their full quota of overs.

Unmatched efficiency from unsung heroes

During the course of the first innings, a few dark clouds passed over the Pallekele stadium, threatening to disrupt the match. The groundsmen, watching all the action by the sidelines, remained alert. Sometimes sitting down and watching the game with one eye above and sometimes standing up with their hands on the covers, waiting to swoop in at a hint of a rain drop, the groundsmen were going through their routine. And then during the innings break, a small drizzle began and in no time, the full force took over, covering the entire ground in a jiffy. They had to wait for a while to remove the covers - a slight but persistent drizzle putting things on hold - but once it stopped raining completely the groundsmen were just as efficient in removing the covers to let the players take centre stage again.

A bowler on the wane

There were two shots that stood out at the start of India's reply. The first one was a nonchalant flick off Rohit Sharma's bat which travelled over mid-wicket, and such was the timing that the ball cleared the fence with ease. The second was a full delivery which was carved away past the point fielder by Dhawan, again with supreme timing. At the receiving end on both occasions was Lasith Malinga, whose fortunes have been on the wane in recent times. It was an unimpressive first spell from the slingy pacer, who continued to leak runs as India got off to a good start yet again. In the first seven overs, six fours and a six were scored by the Indian openers, with Malinga alone conceding four fours and a maximum, going for 32 runs in his first four overs upfront. When he came back to bowl later in the innings, Malinga managed an economical over before straying all over the place, conceding three wides in an over.

Rohit ends a lean patch

Before this match, Rohit, in his last 10 innings in Sri Lanka, had reached double digits only once, which was a score of 11 seven years back. ""I have had some good times against Sri Lanka and at the same time I have had some terrible times against Sri Lanka, in 2012 which I clearly remember,"" Rohit had mentioned before the ODI series.Keen to make amends, having failed to do that in the opening ODI, Rohit went about his task steadily and free-flowingly as he always does. His innings was glittered with varied hues of shot-making. A flick for a six off Malinga, an audacious scoop shot off Dushmantha Chameera that went over the boundary and throwing his bat at one that again travelled over the fence, Rohit's three sixes had variety written all over. So too were his fours, be it punches to the off side, going down the ground, or a short-arm pull. These were some of the shots Rohit played to bring up his second ODI fifty in Sri Lanka in 23 games here. Although he fell soon after, he did manage to end his string of below-par performances in Sri Lanka and set a possible template going forward in this series.

A remarkable honeymoon

Virat Kohli wasn't even padded up and was seen having tea in the dressing room when Rohit made his way back after becoming Akila Dananjaya's first scalp of the day. Little would the captain or India have fathomed what would follow. KL Rahul came in at No. 3, and after Dhawan fell to Siriwardana - thanks to an acrobatic effort from Mathews - it was Kedar Jadhav who made it to the crease. And then followed a remarkable 18th over by Dananjaya. Jadhav failed to pick a wrong 'un, Kohli too couldn't read the bowler, as was the case with Rahul. All three witnessed their stumps being disturbed, off alternate deliveries in the same over. The bowler wasn't finished yet - Pandya came down the track, played down the wrong line and was out stumped as Dananjaya picked up his maiden fifer and went on to pick up his sixth with an off-spinning action, producing a slider to send back Axar. Six wickets when he should have been honeymooning elsewhere. Yes, that's right - he only got married last night. Here was a newly wed, joining the team's cause and triggering a collapse of epic proportions, leaving the opposition bamboozled with his mix of off-spin and wrist spin. Sadly for Dananjaya, his efforts went in vain as Dhoni's finishing prowess came to the fore and India unearthed a new batting hero in Bhuvneshwar.

"Rare Diseases: The National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases is a must: Advocate Ashok Aggarwal, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Social Jurist, New Delhi, talks on the national policy for the treatment of rare diseases . Edited excerpts:You see, in our country the problem is that there is no law about right of public healthcare and health is a state subject and no state has come up with a law. The problem is that today, no one in this country has the right to healthcare. With such a situation if we get a government policy, I think that will be a beginning that can lead to connecting the legislation, but if you don‚Äôt have even a policy then you cannot question government. Therefore, policy on rare diseases was must in the present circumstances when the states are not inclined to make any law and the central government is also not inclined to make the right to public healthcare a fundamental right or a legal right.You see this matter was taken up by the Delhi High Court in 2013 when the case of Mohammad Ahmed came and the High Court Judge was sensitive to this that he wanted to make sure that if some disease can be cured then one should not die for want of money. Ultimately, the High Court in 2013 passed an order saying that right to health is a right and directed the government to bear the expenses. At the same time, the High Court gave certain directions, guidelines that how can the funds be raised and how there is a need for a National Policy. In fact, the National Policy is an initiation taken by the Delhi High Court.In the policy, the government has covered all rare diseases. These diseases range from 5000 to 6000 in number but the cure is available only for a few. I hope that the government will give attention to that and whenever more treatments will be made available, I think the government will take care of them. For the time being, the central government has allocated Rs. 100 crore corpus as a beginning and they have assured that whatever money is required for the treatment, they will raise it by various sources. All ministries and all public undertakings are being taken into consideration by the government for helping in raising this fund.You see, I cannot make any comment on this as nothing is perfect. The High Court has shown its concern that the patient or his relatives are not harassed. The method for approaching the government or government approaching the patient should be very simple. I think the gravity of interest which the Honorable Judge of the High Court has shown will certainly remove any deficiency which will come to the notice in due course of time. For the time being, it is a great beginning.Presently also, in terms of the High Court orders, several patients of rare diseases are getting free treatment, either from AIIMS or ESIC. Similarly, any patient who is identified and require treatment, I hope and I am very certain that the Central Government will take care of, either through ESIC or by the hospitals or by any other method which they will determine.The High Court has already approved the policy and I think anytime it will be notified and the High Court has called Secretary of Health Ministry to demonstrate in the court itself on the next date of hearing as to how it will be implemented and what more we can put into the policy to see that the process should be so easy that the patient or his relatives are not harassed at all."

"Norms for medium-term PPAs for stressed coal plants next month, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The power ministry will next month unveil new norms for medium-term (5-7 years) power purchase agreement with an aim to revive commissioned stressed coal based capacities worth Rs 1.44 lakh crore.

The move will help nearly 12GW commissioned thermal power plants get the medium-term power purchase agreement (PPA) which is a prerequisite for getting coal linkage, a source said.

At present, out of the 40 GW stressed coal based power generation capacity, 28 plants of 24 GW worth Rs 1.44 lakh crore are commissioned. Nearly half of these capacities (12GW) do not have coal linkage because of no PPAs.

""The power ministry has drafted the guidelines for auction for procurement of power for medium term (5-7 years) for commissioned coal based thermal plants. The new norms will be notified sometime next month,"" the source said.

The source explained that these PPAs would have single component tariff. There would be no provision for fixed cost.

According to the ministry estimates, the states are buying power at variable cost of Rs 3 per unit excluding fixed cost. Since a large number of plants targeted by the ministry are pit head, these can easily supply power at a single component tariff of below Rs 3 per unit.

The source said it will be a win-win situation for the states, consumers, bankers and project developers. While the states and consumers will get affordable power, project developers and bankers would be able to run their stranded capacities.

The source said the bankers have already supported the new norms as it would help them explore options of hair cut and strategic debt restructuring for running these capacities.

Also, the combined efforts of SHAKTI (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India)and new norms for medium-term PPAs would help in revival of the 24 GW of capacities."

"NPPA may lose absolute power to fix drug prices under new policy, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government proposes to revamp the country‚Äôs drug pricing regulator, allowing it to set prices of only essential medicines.The latest draft proposals suggest amendments to the drug pricing policy and inducting advisory body of experts in a move to strengthen the regulatory body, but at the same time may take away its absolute power to fix drug prices in public interest.Last year, Niti Aayog , the health ministry and the Department of Pharmaceuticals ( DoP ) were engaged in discussions to dissolve NPPA in its current form and reallocate it within the department. This proposal did not materialise.NPPA presently functions as an autonomous body that regulates prices of medicines under the National List of Essential Medicines and also monitors the prices of those that are not on the list. DoP‚Äôs latest draft pharma policy suggested that NPPA can cap prices of only those drugs included in the NLEM. The NPPA should lay down and enforce price ceilings of ‚Äúselected medicines‚Äù and ensure that ‚Äúadequate quantities‚Äù of the drugs are available.‚ÄúNational List of Essential Medicines will remain the basis of the medicines to be brought under price regulation‚Ä¶ the Department of Pharmaceuticals will prepare the list of medicines for price regulation and transmit them to the NPPA for fixing the price ceilings,‚Äù according to the latest draft of the pharmaceuticals policy, a copy of which ET has seen.Appeals against NPPA‚Äôs decisions will lie with the government, while appeals against the government‚Äôs decisions will be decided by the judiciary.‚ÄúOn pricing, it seems to propose broad changes to the functions and processes of NPPA. The draft appears to impose greater oversight on NPPA such as review of all its decisions, which could mean greater say over NPPA‚Äôs ability to cap prices in public interest also,‚Äù said Malini Aisola, a member of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a civil society group. Some groups said the proposals would dilute the powers of NPPA.The draft may encourage profiteering if implemented as it proposes to weaken the powers of NPPA, Swadeshi Jagran Manch national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan told ET. The Manch is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It said the proposed provisions and amendments shift several important decisions to the Central government.The draft policy, circulated for stakeholder views, suggests amending the drug pricing policy and inducting an advisory body of experts to strengthen the regulatory body. It seeks to improve access to affordable medicines, reduce dependence on other countries including China for raw material, improve manufacturing quality and create an ecosystem to support innovative new drugs.One recommendation is to reorient the Drug (Prices Control) Order, 2013, which NPPA currently follows for its pricing decisions, to shift focus from price control to monitoring of drug prices, their availability and accessibility.The Department of Pharmaceuticals will be able to direct usage of emergency powers under Para 19 of the DPCO to regulate prices of patented medicines that are not under compulsory licensing.NPPA used powers under Para 19 on Wednesday to slash prices of knee implants by up to 69%, citing ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù as the devices were not on the list of essential medicines and hadn‚Äôt been notified for price control.‚ÄúLanguage of DPCO should be made more definitive. There should not be much scope for different interpretations,‚Äù according to the draft.Apart from civil society, industry and government representatives, the draft proposes that NPPA‚Äôs advisory body for pricing should consist of doctors, pharmacists and other experts. While NPPA won‚Äôt have to accept the recommendations of this body, it will be required to assign reasons in writing for modifying or rejecting them.Civil society groups such as AIDAN said they are studying the draft. ‚ÄúWhile on the one hand the draft has some positive initiatives to improve access to affordable medicines, in some instances it seems to push towards deregulation,‚Äù said Aisola.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch wrote to Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar on Wednesday, alleging that the Department of Pharmaceuticals is ‚Äúworking against‚Äù the stated objectives of the Prime Minister and the chemicals and fertilizers ministry."
"More effective way to treat HIV identified, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representative image

New York: Scientists have discovered a more effective way to treat people suffering from HIV whose bodies have built a resistance to drug 'cocktails' currently used to keep them healthy.

Researchers from University of South Carolina (USC) in the US identified a novel human protein variant that can be targeted to prevent the human immunodeficiency virus from harming HIV-positive individuals.

""Most HIV drugs target the virus but the virus is not stable, it always mutates - problematic because the virus can become resistant to effective drugs,"" said I-Chueh Huang, assistant professor at USC.

The new study focused on HIV-1, the most widespread version worldwide.

HIV can be classified into R5 and X4 viruses. R5 viruses are exclusively associated with primary infection, and X4 viruses emerge in later stages of HIV diseases in half of HIV carriers.

Detection of X4 is an indication that the patient's HIV infection has progressed to a very toxic state.

Researchers identified a novel variant within the previously identified family of proteins.

They nicknamed it ""Delta 20,"" an immune system protein that suppresses the most damaging HIV strains, X4, by preventing the virus from infecting cells.

This method differs from the more traditional method of targeting viruses that may eventually become resistant to specific medical therapies, researchers said.

""Much more research needs to be done, but we may have identified a new approach to treating acute HIV infection,"" Huang said.

""Our finding will not help develop a vaccine because the focus is on innate immunity rather than the virus,"" Huang said.

""Perhaps one day scientists will create medicine that, like 'HIV cocktails,' have to be taken indefinitely. But the new treatment may be more effective because it is harder for viruses to escape the body's defences,"" Huang added.

The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."

"Edulji lashes out at BCCI, labels it 'male chauvinist organisation'","SCATHING REMARKS ON WOMEN'S CRICKET

Edulji lashes out at BCCI, labels it 'male chauvinist organisation'

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 03:02 PM

Diana Edulji revealed the former BCCI chief N Srinivasan had explicitly expressed how much he was against the idea of women's cricket. ¬© AFP

Diana Edulji, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, lashed out at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), calling it a ""male chauvinist organisation"". Edulji alleged that the success of the Indian Women's team, that fell nine runs short in the 2017 ICC Women's World Cup finale at Lord's a month ago, and the growing popularity hasn't been ""accepted too well"" by some of the board members.

Edulji, along with India's World Cup stars Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, was a guest at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday (August 22).

""I've always been a BCCI basher, right from the day women's cricket came into the BCCI fold in 2006,"" Edulji said at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday. ""BCCI is a very male chauvinist organisation. They never wanted women to dictate terms or get into this thing. I was very vocal right from my playing days, from when I started,"" she added.

""Even now, I would still say that it is not yet well accepted within BCCI that women's cricket is doing well. It is very difficult for them (some BCCI members) to accept the fact that this team has done very well,"" Edulji elobrated.

Recalling her first meeting with the ousted BCCI president N Srinivasan after he took charge in 2011, Edulji said, ""When I went to congratulate him at the Wankhede Stadium, he said, 'if I had my way, I wouldn't let women's cricket happen'. He hates women's cricket.""

Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, who were among the outstanding performers during India's memorable World Cup run, said they were surprised yet humbled by the overwhelming reception upon their return home from England despite the lack of the trophy. Raut acknowledged the sudden growth in interest in women's sport and recalled how it was quite the opposite when she took up cricket as a career choice.

""There's so much passion for cricket within us that we don't ever think about getting tanned. There were many people in our society and some of my mother's friends who would keep saying, 'Isse ladki ki tarah thoda rehne ke liye sikhao. Ladki ke kaam sikhao' (Teach her to behave like girls, encourage her to learn what girls are expected to do). They used to ask my mother to teach me to dress up like a girl. My mother would then scold me. I would complain to my father and then they would end up arguing,"" the 27-year-old revealed.

""There are many parents who still think along those line.. You'll get dark if you stay under the sun for six hours. Who'll get married to you? I've seen today's parents only encourage their daughters to study and say that you'll have to get married at a fixed age and get settled."" Raut, however, encouraged young girls to chase their dreams. ""I believe if any girl likes playing, or if sport is her passion, then they should be allowed to play and be supported too,"" she said.

Vice-captain Harmanpreet, who captured the imagination of the youth with her blistering 171 not out to knock out defending champions Australia in the semifinal, stressed on the struggles she had to go through to play the game in her hometown Moga, in Punjab. ""When I was young I would have to beg the girls to play with me so that we could form a team of 11 players. Eventually, I would have to gather girls who were good at other sports. Cricket has become their No.1 priority now. When I started, there wasn't a single academy in Moga. My coach started one just for me. Now, there are three exclusively for women,"" Harmanpreet said.

While Edulji said it might be too early to introduce Women's IPL in India, Raut and Harmanpreet advocated for the need to have a domestic league of their own to tap the talent. ""I feel like even after all that's happened, there are a lot of changes that still need to be made for women's cricket. I hope we don't end up saying many years later that 'we also used to hit sixes during our time'. So, I feel if IPL starts now, then it's great,"" said Harmanpreet.

"Man Stabbed To Death In Broad Daylight In Delhi, Onlookers Didn't Help Him And Just Made Video","A man in his 20s has died of multiple wounds after he was stabbed by two attackers in west Delhi‚Äôs Khyala on Wednesday. The victim, identified as Akbar Ali was stabbed with knives multiple times on Tuesday allegedly after a fight over money.

Though over a 100 people had gathered there, no one came forward to help him despite his repeated cries for help. The two men who had stabbed him were arrested later.

While no eyewitnesses came forward to give their statement to the police, a 57-second video shot by a bystander showed the bleeding man lying on the road, a knife sticking out of his ribs on the right side.

In the video, people are seen asking the injured man, identified as Akbar Ali, for his home address. Ali mentions that he lives in B-Block, but doesn't give the complete address. He then asks for water.

""By the time a police team reached the spot, someone had taken Ali to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital,"" said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.

Ali succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday.

Two suspects, Mohd Shubhan and Mohd Afzal, were later arrested from the neighbourhood for the murder. Shubhan, a welder, and Afzal, a painter, told police that Ali also worked as a welder, but he extorted money from them. Cops found out that Ali was also a snatcher.

"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.‚ÄúThe reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,‚Äù Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. ‚ÄúThe only solution is our focus on improving execution.‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers‚Äô pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world‚Äôs largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma‚Äôs Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India‚Äôs pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma‚Äôs stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun‚Äôs consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun‚Äôs profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun‚Äôs U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG‚Äôs blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.‚ÄúGoing forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters‚Äù as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. ‚ÄúThe U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.‚ÄùAs prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company‚Äôs leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."
Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"Russia's Rosneft allocates four months of Venezuelan oil -traders, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Marianna Parraga

HOUSTON: Russian oil firm Rosneft has struck deals with several buyers for almost its entire quota of Venezuelan crude for the remainder of the year, traders told Reuters on Wednesday, the first time it has conducted such a large sale of the OPEC member's oil.

Rosneft, which is taking a growing volume of Venezuelan crude and products while extending credits to President Nicolas Maduro's government, previously had resold the barrels in the United States and Asia through trading firms, according to PDVSA's internal documents.

The new sales mechanism is similar to the one used by Andes Petroleum, a China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec joint venture, to sell its quota of Ecuadorian crude by awarding the barrels through annual or biannual tenders, one of the traders said.

It was not immediately clear which refiners agreed to buy the oil or the volume of the tender, but traders said the buyers included U.S. firms. Among the largest buyers of Venezuelan heavy crude in North America are Valero Energy Corp, Citgo Petroleum, Phillips 66, Chevron Corp and PBF Energy Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Rosneft, Chevron and Valero did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. refiners Phillips 66 and PBF Energy declined to comment on commercial arrangements.

Some of these refiners recently have struggled to purchase Venezuelan oil directly from PDVSA as banks based in the United States have refused to extend the letters of credit the buyers need to complete imports from Venezuela.

Rosneft's deliveries of Venezuelan oil will occur during September through December. The crude grades offered include diluted crude oil (DCO), a blend of extra heavy oil and heavy naphtha, according to the sources.

Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil since May have received some 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and refined products from Venezuela, according to the PDVSA's internal documents.

Venezuela's oil deliveries to the United States have declined in recent years amid falling production, commercial issues, and sanctions on Venezuelan officials. It has relied on deliveries to Russian oil firms to repay loans and swaps."
"Knee surgery: After cardiac stents, government now caps knee implants price, cuts prices by up to 69%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: After coronary stents, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has wielded its powers of price control on knee implants ‚Äî devices used to replace parts of the knee joints that are damaged. The difference this time is that the regulator has exercised its own emergency powers to do so, instead of waiting for the government to bring the devices under the National List of Essential Medicines as it did on stents.The drug pricing watchdog slashed the prices of total knee replacement systems and their individual components by as much as 69%, an NPPA notification issued on Wednesday evening showed.This decision is expected to lead to a saving of Rs 1,500 crore per year for the people of India, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar said. According to him, 1-1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures are done in India annually.Industry bodies representing manufacturers said they were reviewing the order and would take their suggestions to the regulator for its effective implementation.The price of total knee implants made of cobalt chromium has now been capped at Rs 54,720, down 65% from its average maximum retail price of Rs 1.58 lakh, data from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers showed. These are the most widely used complete knee implants, it said.Total knee implants made of special metals like titanium and oxidized zirconium can be priced at a maximum of Rs 76,600, or 69% lower than the original average MRP. High-flexibility implants have also seen a similar reduction in the maximum price to Rs 56,490. Revision implants, used in repeat procedures when the initial knee implant has failed, is capped 59% lower at Rs 1.14 lakh, down from an average of Rs 2.77 lakh.Special knee implants for cancer or tumours will follow the prices of revision knee implants, NPPA said.These prices are exclusive of goods and services tax, but take trade margins for manufacturers or importers, distributors and hospitals into account, NPPA said.The regulator's latest order specifically highlights the ceiling prices of each component used in a knee replacement procedure, such as femoral, tibial, insert and patellas. In most cases, the ceiling prices of these components have been set according to the materials used, but in the case of certain components, these have been fixed regardless of the materials used.NPPA's order comes around six months after it slashed the prices of coronary stents by up to 85%.Unlike stents, the government did not put knee implants on the essential medicines list. Usually, the Department of Pharmaceuticals notifies products for price control and NPPA caps the prices after the health ministry puts it on this list.Out of 1.5-2 crore patients who require arthroplasty interventions, only around a lakh are in a position to pay for the procedure every year, NPPA stated. Citing a World Health Organization bulletin from 2003, it said osteoarthritis could become the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. India is likely to be one of the leading countries of such immobilized citizens in terms of numbers.""As the public is aware, prices remain too high for devices across the board. We would like this to be the start for NPPA to systematically fix prices of all other devices on which data was collected in public interest,"" said Malini Aisola of patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN). ""The price reductions still need study and it will not be successful without a check on the hospital rates,"" she added.According to some knee implant manufacturers, the order has left a lot of issues unresolved without which the price cuts might not be possible. One of the companies that ET spoke to said a knee implant device has a number of components, and without fixing the prices of those components, it would be difficult to gauge the price cut.The Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD) is expected to meet the drug regulator asking for time in implementing these price cuts. The Medical Technology Association of India, another body that represents knee implant makers like Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew, said it is currently reviewing the order and will respond with suggestions to NPPA to ensure practicality of its decision.‚ÄúPrices are reasonable and we are with the government. We believe this price cap will help every person of the country who needs implants,‚Äù stated Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD."

SRK's Gorgeous Blue Villa In Dubai Will Not Be Taxed Despite Being For Rs 15 Crore. Here's Why,"Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan is one of the richest celebs in the world. And expectedly, he has properties across the globe, one of which is the stunning Dubai villa along the Palm beach.

It recently came under the radar for not being income taxed for so many years. However, the income-tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) has rejected the tax department's view that a villa in Dubai gifted to Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan a decade ago was a camouflage to evade income tax. The tribunal has held that the value of the villa cannot be treated as the actor's taxable income.

The villa had been gifted to Khan under a formal gift deed in 2007 after he obtained the RBI's approval.

I-T authorities were of the view that the donor, Nakheel PJSC, a Dubai-based company known for the famous Palm Projects, had gifted the villa as it was keen on using the actor's image and brand. The actor is a globally known figure and has endorsed various foreign brands for remuneration running into a few crores. Thus, the gift was seen as remuneration to Khan for utilising his brand image and in lieu of his stage performance at the company's annual day event. In light of this, the I-T authorities sought to tax the value of the villa as income in SRK's hands.

Twitter



During the assessment for the financial year 2007-08, I-T officials added the value of the villa ‚Äî Rs 17.85 crore ‚Äî to the income of Rs 126.3 crore declared by Khan in his I-T return. The actor would have had to pay I-T on this additional sum. At the first stage of appeal, the commissioner (appeals), agreed with the I-T authorities. Based on a valuation report, though, he reduced the addition to Rs 14.7 crore.

Twitter



Appealing before ITAT, Khan, through his counsel, said the chairman of the company, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, was his friend and thus wished to make the gift. He admitted to attending the annual day event but said he merely addressed the employees and did not perform on stage, which would have amounted to brand endorsement. On taxation of a gift in kind, ITAT pointed out that for the relevant financial year, gifts of immovable property made without any consideration were out of the tax ambit.

"Essar Oil: Rosneft deal signifies our ability to build assets: Prashant Ruia, Essar Group, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In an interview with ET Now's Vijay Iyer,, talks about the group's deal with Russia's Rosneft . Edited excerpts:Firstly, this is not so much about debt only. It is about the ability of the Essar Group to create an asset from the scratch. In 1995, we started Essar Oil . In fact, we did our first IPO back in 1995. At that time, the market cap or the market value of Essar Oil was about Rs 2,000 crore and now we have just announced the final price at which the deal will get concluded which is at about Rs 75 premium to the Rs 262 delisting price that keeps the equity value of the company at about Rs 50,000 crore. To us, this signifies our ability to build greenfield assets, create value and then be in a position to attract global investors who can then participate in the Indian growth story. We have done it before. We have done it in the telecom space when we initially brought in Hutchison and then it was Vodafone which is now Vodafone in India and in that we brought in Vodafone and the total value of their investment was about $18 billion but in two tranches and now we have done this.To me, this signifies who we are and what we are really good at. The debt repayment is a corollary for us. We have already been very open about it. Our total debt reduction is about Rs 70,000 crore of which nearly Rs 50,000 crore goes to the Indian banks and the rest goes to the international banks. In total, about Rs 36,000 crore of this is repaid and the rest gets transferred to the new shareholders. This is the single largest deleveraging ever done in Indian corporate history and this is also the first time that shareholders, retail shareholder, individual shareholders are getting rewarded nearly two years after the company has been delisted.Yes. This is the announcement we made on Tuesday. It took us a day to get for our advisors to come out with the final numbers and that is what we have done. And this provides about a 30% premium to what the delisting price was of Rs 262.The net outgo I think is about Rs 880 odd crore. This is over and above the Rs 3,000 odd crore which was given at the time of delisting.My father and my uncle.No, obviously the decision was taken some time back because we entered into an agreement with Rosneft and Trafigura on 15th of October of last year on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit. That was the time when the sale-purchase agreement was finally documented and obviously the decision was taken a little bit before that.As a group, our philosophy has always been to build assets from scratch, nurture them and take them to international scale and then look at opportunity to monetise them. As I said. we have done this before in telecom business, we are doing it now in our oil business. We believe that the value was right and we believe that the future growth and expansion which the company needs is best done with new shareholders and we are very happy that Rosneft and Trafigura have come in as our new shareholders and I am sure they will add significant growth to the company just like Vodafone has done to the telecom business in the last five-six years.Frankly, it is really not such a material issue, the consortium of Trafigura and UCP asked us to stay invested with 2% of their stake, we have done that and we will go with the consortium and do whatever they would like us to do because in any case, for us it is not a very material investment.The non-compete is for three years. We continue to be in the oil and gas business internationally with our Essar Oil UK refinery and we continue to be in India in the E&P, exploration and production business and the cold bed methane business which we have retained from Essar Oil.Those two continue but for refining and marketing in India there is a three years non-compete clause. As for the brand, we are very happy that Rosneft and Trafigura have elicited to retain the Essar brand on the entire retail network. We believe it is a strong brand. We believe the network has been built significantly over the last two, three years and they have also announced significant growth in the retail network going forward. How long they continue the brand is really up to them. That is a decision which they will have to arrive at and we are happy that they continue to utilise the brand and whatever brand fees were being paid earlier to Essar that basically continues.I would not want to categorise it like that. Yes, we have had a challenging period over the last two-three years principally because some of the contracts which we signed for natural resources like natural gas and coal got cancelled.Basically Essar Steel was affected by the cancellation of its natural gas which was its primary fuel or primary source as feedstock for the gas based sponge iron plant which we set up and that affected our production and that affected the company in a very material way.So those were the reasons but fine we went through a challenging period and now I am happy to say that our capital investment program is complete, those issues are largely behind us, coal is now-- the mines which got cancelled, coal is now available from alternate sources like Coal India etc and natural gas is now available from alternate sources which basically we are importing LNG.We have addressed those issues, we have completed our projects, we have ramped up capacities, we have completed overall capital investment programme of about Rs 1.2 lakh crore and now we are looking with this transaction also completed, we are looking forward to a much better and a much stronger future obviously with a de-levered balance sheet.I do not want to get too much into it because we are in a regulatory court process but our ability to invest and provide a strong resolution plan is significantly better now than before because of the significant deleveraging which has taken place on our balance sheet. So, we look forward to getting this process completed as quickly as possible, restructuring the company and moving ahead.Clearly Essar Oil has been a fantastic company which has grown and created significant value over the last two decades and that was the same with telecom.We as a group have focussed on creating value and if you take the telecom business which we exited, we had about 10x exit from the time we invested to the time we exited. Essar Oil has been about 4x exit with the market cap going up from 2000 to 50,000 over the last two decades. We see the same opportunity in the rest of our portfolio.It is not that some of these companies were also looking significantly lower values when the cycles were down. So telecom went through its own period of difficulty. The oil business has gone through a period of very low refining margins and difficulty in the 2010, 2011, 2012 period. At that time people did not see these kind of values.That is part of the process in a commodity infrastructure business where markets are moving up and down. So to answer the question -- we are extremely excited with the rest of the portfolio. We believe that significant value exists and we are going to invest and grow the rest of the portfolio to create that value going forward.Yes the capital cycle is pretty much completed, as I said the Rs 1.2 lakh crore. Some of the projects which were completed are just getting commissioned. So over the next two-three months and before the end of this year, it will be completed but the majority of the funds have already been invested. From an investment prospective, the capital cycle is largely completed and we are now looking at growth in terms of bringing all these assets and sweating these assets in the next few years and looking at brownfield expansions and brownfield growth as we go ahead. This includes the Essar Oil UK asset where we have invested close to $800 million since we acquired the asset to upgrade it, improve the environmental standards and safety standards and increase the efficiency of the asset.The group revenues in the current year after Essar Oil sale would be about $15 billion.In FY18 and we have not put a specific number to it but we are looking at growth from these numbers going forward.Principally the way we see it, the consolidation and monetisation programme is largely completed now. We are looking at growth going forward in our portfolio. We do not really see the need for further monetisation at this point of time in our portfolio.Yes exactly that is exactly what I was going to tell you. Nothing is planned at this point of time. As I said we need to get these businesses to mature a little bit more. We have just completed our capex cycle and then we will see what is the best course of action.So the group revenues are as I said around $15 billion in the current year and the group EBITDA we are expecting to be in the region of $2-2.5 billion for the whole year, for the financial year currently and then we will see where it goes in the future.Companies get into difficulty for different reasons but in India, at least in some of the sectors, some of the companies or the majority of the companies have got into difficulty not entirely because of their own decisions or not entirely because of their own actions. Some of the regulatory decisions which have been made in the last few years, principally in the last couple of years of the previous government and then not necessarily by the government but also by the courts did leave many of the sectors and many of the companies facing challenges which they could not have foreseen.Issues concerning cancellation of gas contracts, cancellation of coal linkages, cancellation of coal mines, cancellation of environment approvals on a retrospective basis, right of way concerns which face the right of the highway industry, were faced by many companies. Many of the companies need a restructuring. The current government has taken a lot of steps to set right many of these issues which have hurt the industry with policies which will ensure that these kind of things do not happen in the future.Plus, in the last few years, capital investment in these sectors has been fairly low and the demand continues to grow in India and so in the next few years with these issues behind us, with the restructuring getting resolved, many of these companies will see investment cycle will come back. But it might take another year or two before you will start seeing the full impact of that investment cycle for India.I am again talking only about the core sectors which we are involved in. On the other side, on the retail sector, on the retail side on the consumer side obviously there has been significant growth and those markets remain extremely strong as what the capital markets are reflecting.Some of the issues which saw NPAs was because of policies which were not clear. As I said, those have been corrected now and the new policies are in a transparent, public manner hopefully that will ensure that in the future if investments are made in these sectors, these problems are not faced by the investors coming forward.And to ensure that that is done in an open and transparent manner which will provide comfort both to the investors and to the banks because they have also been affected largely by things which they could not have foreseen and hopefully that will provide a much more conducive and a positive environment for all of us to invest because India is still at a very early stage. We are still about 20% of Chinese consumption and we are clearly on a growth trajectory which is now higher than even China and so next few years we hope that things will be significantly better.That is the biggest attraction for India and that is also the main attraction why Rosneft and Trafigura came to India.Well I am happy for their support. I am happy for all the support which the banks have provided us which has provided us the ability to build these world class assets and we have honoured our commitment. We made a decision two years back, we have honoured our commitment and we look forward to a strong future together.Well I do not know what more we can do but yes.Well I am not an expert to comment on this...I think relationships have to be managed. It could be between two professionals, it could be between a professional and an entrepreneur or it could be between a founder and a professional, it is the same. At the end of the day it comes down to relationships and ensuring that everybody is aligned in the interest of the company or in the interest of the group is ultimately what will ensure success. That has been the age old philosophy I am not telling you anything new.All companies have become extremely professional and the corporate governance standards which are being laid down in India today are amongst the highest anywhere in the world. We are all falling in line and are aligned to providing the highest levels of corporate standards for companies going forward."
The real luxury in life is doing nothing,"It‚Äôs pretty much a foregone conclusion that you‚Äôll brush your teeth tomorrow morning. You don‚Äôt squander precious mental space evaluating whether or not brushing your teeth is worth the opportunity cost of let‚Äôs say, another five minutes of sleep. The same is true for showering, going to the bathroom, grooming your nails and facial hair. We clean our homes with a myriad of dust-sucking devices and chemical concoctions, or hire people to do so more thoroughly than we can. We even make sure to wash the car every so often.

As a people, we seem to be pretty vigilant about physical hygiene. We clean and cream our bodies, and take them out for a walk, much like we do for our dogs. We do so robotically, without wasting time in evaluating questions like, ‚ÄúShould I take out the trash today?‚Äù Even if we don‚Äôt do it today, you can bet it‚Äôll be done before the week is out. Sadly, the same cannot be said for our mental hygiene. When was the last time you really cleaned the crevices of your mind?

And in this day and age, boy, do we have dirty minds. Between jobs, responsibilities at home, nights out, baby-talk and toddler tantrums, must-read blogs, email upkeep, spritely posts and timely tweets, we‚Äôve stuffed our minds with more content than it can hold. Our minds run a marathon a minute. We swallow countless videos, movies and entire seasons of television shows with abandon, and these stimulating stories stick to our soft and once-supple consciousness. It‚Äôs a more-more-more world and our mind‚Äôs had enough. Simply put, we are mentally obese.

And then we wonder why we can‚Äôt still our minds and find some semblance of peace. We read self-help manuals, eat more organic greens and practise various forms of sweat-inducing yoga. We buy softer clothes, sniff scented candles, wear noise-canceling headphones and track our daily step count. We run away to exotic islands and true stillness evades us even under the palms.

The ubiquitous sentence we‚Äôve all uttered, heard and repeated is ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired‚Äù. We keep going like that poor Energizer bunny, but deep inside we feel kind of exhausted. Even the pursuit of higher echelons of fun becomes somewhat tiring by the time you‚Äôre thirty-five. And if not by then, by forty-five, for sure. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù we start to wonder.

And this is precisely where meditation saved me. Some people meditate with a mantra from a Master, some listen to meditation music, some watch their breath until they can override mental chatter, while others go for a nature walk. Even big-shot billionaires meditate with requisite meditation apps on TV these days.

The result is the same ‚Äî in meditation, we do absolutely nothing for a few moments. We achieve nothing, we stop trying so damn hard. And unlike in sleep, we are restfully awake to witness the passage of time. We are completely present for ourselves ‚Äî for doing absolutely nothing with ourselves ‚Äî much like we make sure to be present to watch our children play soccer or perform in a school play.

In meditation, we become the witness. We become the one who watches patiently as time marches on, moving and twisting as it does. We don‚Äôt react or move an inch. We watch our thoughts go by like trains at a busy train station. We don‚Äôt hop on board. Like the statue of Buddha, we learn to embody peace and let go of past and future worries. We are the now. Like rock climbing, scuba diving, skiing, or even learning to read as children ‚Äî learning to meditate takes some level of dedication and practice.

It‚Äôs a skill worth acquiring as soon as humanly possible. Even a momentary brush with wakeful nothingness ‚Äî doing nothing, being nothing, wanting nothing, all while being there with the Self here and now ‚Äî is a deep-clean steam shower for our mind. It refreshes us considerably and reminds us that there is more to life than chasing more."

Infosys crisis: Are we soft on never-go-letters?,"Everybody and their auntie are having a go with their sharp stick at the Right Honourable N R Narayana Murthy. The man‚Äôs a kook, they say, putting a Chosen One on the Iron Throne and then treating him like a bekaar damaad. That NRN, once having decided (twice, actually) to walk into the sunset, is once again caught acting like a ‚Äòbenevolent well-wisher‚Äô from some Spartan I‚Äôm-not-Vijay Mallya getaway and pulling the strings till the puppet decides to walk away.

That Master Yoda is the one who needs to walk away ‚Äî and stay walked away ‚Äî has been the general consensus from the chorus line. I mean, who likes the younger generation to be brought in with moderate fanfare, and then have the same younger generation (slightly older by then) shunted, for, well, being young and stupid? Answer: India 2017.

Being stupid is what NRN has really been accusing Vishal Sikka, handpicked as MD-CEO in the summer of 2014, of. According to Murthy and his fellow Infytainers, Sikka is responsible for Infosys becoming a spluttering train. If Clark ‚ÄòNagavara Ramarao‚Äô Kent had not coaxed himself into bringing Murthyman out of retirement, the spluttering train was sure to become a train wreck, goes one theory.

But my heart, despite all the flak he‚Äôs facing, goes out to NRN. It‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt agree with his critics. Yes, Sikka‚Äôs Infosys ship isn‚Äôt the same Infosys raft that the Seven Samurai led by Murthy-san launched from the harbour in 1981. For starters, the software field had only a handful of players to contend with. Plus, the post-BPO world of technology has changed faster than Infy may have had.

Also, Infosys was really a startup before any startup invented the word ‚Äòstartup‚Äô. So, making the rules then was more fun than keeping the rules now. And despite the mantra about ‚ÄòLearning how to fail, learning from the failures‚Äô blahblahblah, Indians, especially India Inc, still don‚Äôt like rules being (seen to be) broken, and are loath to allow things to fail. Intervention is a constant nanny in the form of concerned ‚Äòelders‚Äô in the background, or pusillanimous gatekeepers in the front.

But let‚Äôs face it. Is Murthyman the only one who likes holding on to the reins even when he has passed them on? More importantly, is our culture not a wee bit bonkers when it comes to allowing‚Äòelders‚Äô to linger, and then meddle so that they can have their cake, eat it, and then complain about the icing too?

Amitabh Bachchan, thankfully, picks and chooses his roles better these days. But I remember a whole decade when toup√©e not in hand, he was offered roles ‚Äî which he accepted ‚Äî that fit him as snugly as a glove fits a goat. Even as an admirer of Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs cover drive, the less said about how he reached his 100th international century, courtesy the BCSCI (Board of Control for Sachin‚Äôs Cricket to Inspire), the better.

In politics, of course, we find the original trendsetters. Any politician saying that he or she will now make way for ‚Äònew blood‚Äô either has no clue about transfusion, or is making a strategic move. Let‚Äôs just say that in the Congress, this rule applies if your surname happens to be the same as Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs. A free hand given to aScindia or a Pilot or even a Singh is as plausible as the queen of England making way for her eldest son while she (and he) is still alive.

In the BJP government, the ‚Äòholding on to the reins‚Äô quality is marked by the quantum of policymaking-andbreaking powers ministers have in aShah-sprayed Modi government.

That could, perhaps, maybe, possibly explain the current disinterest in the impending Cabinet reshuffle. In regional parties, too, sharing responsibilities, or passing the pillow, down the ranks of Didis and the ghosts of Ammas is not just frowned upon, but proactively resisted as the recipe for ‚Äòchaos‚Äô.

We like our busybody taus the same way we extol our workaholics. So, if Murthyman is singled out as a demagogic Nerd-Uncle, it‚Äôs a bit rich.

In the world of films, the Lifetime Achievement Award is given to someone who has crossed his creative pinnacle and reached his creative tether. To drive the message home, this award simultaneously recognises his greatness as well as implores him to take a back seat, preferably of a bus and not a car.

In politics, with governorships and presidencies becoming increasingly political, something new is needed for the over(long)-ambitious. In business, the most anarchic of ‚Äòindustries‚Äô, we are yet to change how we treat our founders and family minders.

So, till then, before you can say hello to Cyrus the Great and Tata to Xerxes, be prepared for more NRNs not leaving the stage, whether sulking, kicking or squealing."
Mumbai's Vivek Lulla Arrested For Supplying Drugs To Bollywood A-Listers,"The anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of the police has revealed that it has busted a drug racket with the arrest of a 42-year-old Navi Mumbai resident who allegedly supplied drugs to Bollywood celebrities in the western suburbs.

Twitter

Acting on a tip-off that the accused, Vivek Lulla alias Vicky, was to deliver a consignment to an accomplice near the MMRDA grounds in Bandra, ANC officials laid a trap and arrested him. Nearly 56gm of mephedrone, also known as MD or meow meow, worth Rs 1.12 lakh was seized from him.

Lulla, who has been on the police radar for the last three months after a few Nigerians arrested for drug possession had identified him as the supplier, was booked under the NDPS Act and remanded in police custody, said deputy commissioner of police (ANC) Shivdeep Lande.

"Tata Power Group: Tata Power to monetise non-core assets to trim debt, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: To bring down its around Rs 49,000 crore gross debt, private utility Tata Power is planning to sell its non-core assets even as it continues to explore viable options to resolve issues pertaining to the financially crippled 4,000-mw Coastal Gujarat Power at Mundra.

""Our gross debt is Rs 48,816 crore. We are examining various debt reduction options including sale of non-core assets,"" Tata Power chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders at the 98th AGM here.

The gross debt to equity ratio currently stands at 3.3:1, he added.

He said the steep rise in global coal prices impacted the Gujarat plant and Tata Power is working on some resolution for solving the problems.

It can be noted the company had made a proposal some time back to sell the 51 per cent stake in the plant to to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam for a notional Re 1, to rescue itself from the debt-laden, loss-making business but the state government rejected the proposal.

The company also offered to operate the project subject to grant of the compensatory tariff to the company for the entire period of the PPA.

Though the company has PPA with the state electricity board it is not drawing power from the plant citing higher cost. The plant is running at a PLF of 70 per cent now.

""On the issue of resolution of the compensatory tariff for CGPL, we approached all courts of appeal and continues to explore viable options to address the issues by continuous engagement with the power procurers and lenders,"" Chandrasekaran said.

He said Tata Power has a natural hedge over the project because of the Indonesian coal mines.

""Nevertheless, we have made significant investments to the tune of close to $1.2 billion in the company. So we would like to solve this issue.

""Currently, two kinds of resolutions are possible--one with the regulators and procurers and other is we get cheaper coal, which doesn't seem to be so far working,"" he added.

Tata Power chief executive and managing director Anil Sardana said, ""We are willing to forgo 51 per cent of equity provided the procurers are ready to make good the under- recovery.

""We might give away about Rs 3,000 crore on equity, but what we stand to gain is every year an amount of Rs 1,000 -1,200 crore that the procurer will have to give us for the next 20 years. But they too have an advantage as they would get power for a cheaper rate.""

The chairman further said the company has planned a capex of Rs 3,000 crore for FY19 and is also working towards simplification of its structure.

""The company has over 90 subsidiaries and associate companies. We are working on a plan to simplify the corporate structure where feasible,"" he said.

The Tata Power Group has an operating capacity of 10,463 mw, 98 per cent of which is tied up to long term PPAs.

Its clean energy portfolio is 3,141 mw, or 30 per cent of the total capacity which the company plans to increase it to 40-45 per cent by 2022.

On the international front, the Zambian, South African and Georgian JVs have started commercial operations, totalling 530 mw."
"Renewable, Latest Renewable News, Energy News","In the latest sign of the squeeze, Siemens Gamesa last week said it would cut 600 staff, less than a month after it revealed third-quarter operating profit had dwindled by a fifth, partly due to India's shift to auctions from guaranteed tariffs."
What Supreme Court and AIMPLB obviously have in common: Male dominance,"After its long campaign for non-interference in Muslim personal law, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is in a quandary now. It will meet in Bhopal on September 10 to formalize future strategy, in response to the Supreme Court striking down instant triple talaq as violative of the fundamental right to equality.

This is amidst mounting criticism of its failure to take the leadership on reforming the Muslim community from within. It doesn‚Äôt help that the representation of women in the 301-member board is less than 8%. Actually women may have even lesser strength in the executive panel of the board. AIMPLB women members who took a position against triple talaq were reportedly sidelined or shown the door by the male-dominated religious body.

Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which was one of the six petitioners along with the valiant Shayara Bano, is convinced that AIMPLB itself will grow more sidelined as women become more informed and determined: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt trust them. They have been denying rights granted by the Quran and the Constitution to the Muslim women. If it was indeed relevant, women would not have felt the need to move court.‚Äù

If women had had greater representation on the AIMPLB board, it would have been more responsive to their concerns. This is a simple enough logic, and interestingly enough it applies as much to the Supreme Court that has put AIMPLB in such a quandary. Not only is only one of the 27 apex court judges today a woman, it has had a grand total of SIX women judges since Independence. The high courts boast 10% women judges, which is quite similar to the 8% women membership of AIMPLB!

Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Uday Umesh Lalit in setting aside talaq-e-biddat concluded, ‚ÄúThis form of talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it ‚Ä¶ It being manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of discrimination.‚Äù

On the TOI edit page today Arghya Sengupta draws attention to this strange hesitation of five male judges of the Supreme Court on a matter critical to the lives of women in India: ‚ÄúIt is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women‚Äôs rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women.‚Äù

A lady on the bench you can bet would have delved into discrimination."

Aim is to win both Tests: Shakib,"AUSTRALIA TOUR OF BANGLADESH, 2017

Aim is to win both Tests: Shakib

Atif Azam ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 07:02 PM

Shakib felt the conditions will make it tough for the Australians in the two-Test series. ¬© BCB

Sakib al Hasan believes that Bangladesh are capable of beating Australia by a big margin in the upcoming Test series. The hosts will take on Australia at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday in the two-Test series opener while the series concludes with the last game in Chittagong from September 4.

Sakib, who will be playing his 50th Test for Bangladesh, acknowledged he's excited and determined to make a mark. ""I think it is possible to win both Test matches,"" Sakib told reporters in Mirpur while pointing out his ambitions against the Aussies on Thursday (August 24). ""There is no reason why we can't do that.

""If you ask me about my own expectations then I would say with it would be to win both Tests.""

Shakib made his Test debut in 2007 but in the last decade has played just 49 Tests. He has established himself as a vital pillar in Bangladesh cricket in all formats. The allrounder, though, said he doesn't regret not getting more Tests.

""I don't have much regret in my life. I am very much happy with what has happened with me. I would feel much better if I could play more matches,"" he said. ""Those matches I have played and had a good performance, all are important to me.

""I would say the Test match against England in 2016 is the most memorable one. As my individual performance, I can remember my 92 runs against West Indies. Scoring 217 against New Zealand was a big achievement for me.""

Sakib will be joined by Tamim Iqbal to play 50 Test matches for Bangaldesh. Shakib went on to warn the visitors about Bangladesh's intentions and said the conditions won't make it easy for the Australians. ""They are one side who they have a culture to adapt in every condition in a quick span of time,"" Shakib pointed out. ""Although it will very tough considering there will be rain as well as heat but they will try to cope with it as they had done previously.

""We have to play our best cricket if we want to defeat them. We have to do well in every aspect if we want to win a Test match. We have to bat and bowl well. Whichever team they may send, they are a difficult opponent in every condition. They can cope with the conditions around the world very fast and no other team can do better than them.

""They are the strongest opponent for us although they are, for now, an inexperience side. They didn't perform well in India and Sri Lanka in recent times. I hope that they will continue the streak and we'll do well against them.""

Shakib felt having spinners, who know the conditions better, will help their cause. ""I think our spin attack is better than theirs,"" he said. ""Not in all conditions but in Bangladesh, we are better than them. Taijul and Miraz [Mehidy] have been bowling well for some time now. I believe they will do something fantastic in this series.""

Sakib added he's excited finally able to play a Test against Australia. ""It's exciting that I will be playing a Tes against Australia as I've played already played a few ODI's and T20s against them. It will be an experience and it is really thrilling,"" he said. ""Australia and England take Test matches differently from what others do and playing against such opponent is really a awe-inspiring experience.""

"Indian thrust on renewables will affect thermal projects: CEA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Overemphasis on renewable energy would result in reducing viability of coal-fired thermal power plants in India, adding to the massive non-performing assets (NPAs) of state-run lenders, Chief Economic Adviser ( CEA Arvind Subramanian said on Thursday.""Rapid changes in technology are promising to help realize the promise of renewables, which is an eminently desirable development. At the same time, these changes need to be seen in the context of India's current economic situation and its enormous endowments of coal, which is still a very cheap way of providing energy to hundreds of millions who are still energy-deprived,"" he said at the 16th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture here organised by The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ).Noting that both coal and renewable sources should be the focus of power generation, Subramanian said that ""for India today, the social cost of renewables is higher than that of thermal power, and it is highly unlikely for the converse to be true, at least for some time"".""Over-expansion, fuelled by the growth optimism of the mid-2000s, combined with stresses in the discoms and slowdown in the economy has led to a plummeting plant load factors, declining profitability, the spectre of large amounts of stranded power assets, and consequentially stranded coal assets as well.""All this can have a detrimental effect on the health of the banking sector, especially the public sector banks, in the country, which in turn can adversely impact the health of the Indian economy, already afflicted by the 'twin balance sheet' challenge,"" the CEA said.The declining viability of thermal power plants and the rising NPAs of state-run banks, which have lent to power companies ""seems a double whammy for the government,"" he said.For India, which is struggling to provide basic electricity to about 25 per cent of its population, coal will provide about 60 per cent of the country's power needs until 2030, he addedIndia's total renewable generation capacity has crossed 57 gigawatts (GW), with an increase of 24.5 per cent being registered in the last fiscal year.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

"In Case You Missed It, Here Are Some Of The Most Dramatic Pictures From The Solar Eclipse","The magnificent eclipse from yesterday has, for sure, left the entire world in awe. As the moon's shadow slowly took over areas that fall around Oregon and South Carolina, everyone began basking in the glorious eclipse, touted to be one of the harshest.

For over an hour and a half, everyone took a break from whatever they were doing and took it to the streets with their gears on. Millions got outside to watch this eclipse and even a million more witness it online, making it one of the most-watched in history.

nasa

The eclipse was partially visible across all 50 states, but it was the clearest from a 70-mile-wide sliver of 14 states. This eclipse was a totality, a rare event that hasn't happened since 1979 and a coast-to-coast eclipse for almost over a century.

PCB chairman confirms World XI tour in September

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 04:33 PM

While World XI is set to play a three-match T20 series in September, West Indies will play three T20Is in late November. ¬© Getty

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, put to rest all speculations regarding the World XI tour to Pakistan, confirming on Monday (August 21), a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in Lahore, starting September 10. A 15-member squad led by former Zimbabwe great Andy Flower will take part in a seven-day long camp in Dubai before heading to Lahore for the series. However, the bigger news is Windies is set to tour the cricket-starved nation for a three-match T20I series in Lahore in late November.

Sethi also stated that the three games against World XI will be played across four days, but refused to divulge the dates citing security reasons.

""CWI and PCB are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies play three T20I matches in Lahore in late November,"" read the statement. ""In September, October and November, we'll have the World XI, we'll have Sri Lankan team and then the West Indies (come play in Pakistan).

""We just hope that the security we've promised, we'll keep it up. Sri Lanka have said they'll come after the World XI, provided the security is fine. It will be fine, Punjab government has indicated that the preparation are in full swing. At the end of this month, ICC's security team is also arriving. So far all signals are good,"" Sethi added. He also stated that talks with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were still on over the number of games to be played.

While the Punjab Government approved 'Presidential level security' for the week-long World XI series in Lahore, Sethi expressed his desire to host a few games in the other cities too, notably Karachi. ""I have the desire to take some games out of Lahore and host them in Karachi, but everyone I speak to reject that idea. They tell me that we've succeeded in hosting something well in Lahore (PSL 2 final) so keep that going. First host the PSL in Karachi, then we will come there.""

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

""This is my objective. I had given myself a mission statement - to organise PSL, to bring it to Pakistan, to bring international cricket to Pakistan. Game development needs to be done, fund raising needs to be done - and all that we're going to do slowly. And I also want to try to professionalise PCB,"" Sethi said.
