"‚ÄòLook, I‚Äôm so secular!‚Äô The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‚Äòvirtue signalling‚Äô has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.‚Äù Chances are several people out there will scream ‚Äòcommunal! communal!‚Äô to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don‚Äôt. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don‚Äôt mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‚ÄòLook, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn‚Äôt that virtuous.‚Äô

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are ‚Äî so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, ‚ÄúAlthough we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).‚Äù Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‚Äòsexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else‚Äô because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women‚Äôs cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women‚Äôs cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don‚Äôt go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don‚Äôt answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today‚Äôs social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It‚Äôs noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."
Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

DU's Zero Cut-Off For Ph.D. Admissions For SC/ST Students Is Driving Everyone Up The Wall!,"So, for Ph.D. Mathematics, the qualifying marks is a big, round zero?!

Delhi University's recent cut-off list for SC/ST students for admissions in Ph.D. Mathematics lists zero as the ""minimum marks scored"". Well, it can get any minimum than this!

nyoooz

People are outraged. Rightly so. If this is what the fight, to have the reservation in India, has come to then anyone falling in the General category can simply take a hike.

How did the Department of Mathematics at DU even come up with this cut-off? Why does the OBC have to score an 84? Oh, let's not even heed the sound of the Unreserved's breaking hearts who have to score a 94 to qualify.

This is the interview schedule that is making everyone's blood boil.

Guard up: New Delhi must prepare for a long term Chinese strategy of containment,"With the Doklam standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at the India-China-Bhutan trijunction continuing, there are signs that the entire Line of Actual Control (LAC) will witness turbulent times ahead. On Tuesday Indian and Chinese troops pelted stones at each other at Ladakh after Chinese soldiers attempted to intrude into Indian territory. This comes after incursions by the Chinese side into a mutually agreed demilitarised zone at Barahoti, Uttarakhand, late last month. Experts believe that the Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army could be trying to occupy a border territory similar to Doklam as a face saver. With an important party congress of the Chinese Communist Party coming up later in the year, the ruling dispensation in Beijing needs to show it has prevailed over New Delhi.

This means that India has to be extra vigilant against Chinese designs, both at the LAC and elsewhere. Although full-scale armed conflict still remains unlikely, Beijing won‚Äôt hold back in unleashing psychological warfare and cyber bullying against New Delhi. The strident Chinese rhetoric on Doklam and incursions in other areas seem to be part of this strategy, which aims to defeat opponents without firing a bullet. New Delhi needs to be aware of this strategy of containing it ‚Äì whose overall objective can only be setting up a unipolar Asia where everyone is forced to kowtow to Chinese demands ‚Äì and come up with its own counter-measures. These must include shoring up its cyber defences.

In this context, the decision by the US to elevate its strategic consultations with India through a new 2-by-2 ministerial dialogue is welcome. Similarly, India is ramping up multi-sectoral engagement with Asean nations, many of whom have disputes with China. New Delhi should not hesitate to work with Tokyo, Djakarta, Hanoi, Taipei and other like-minded Asian capitals.

Finally, China‚Äôs biggest strategic vulnerability is its trade surplus with most nations aided by unfair import barriers imposed by Beijing, of which India has certainly been a victim. With Chinese-made products and components flooding the Indian market there are concerns regarding security and data leaks. New Delhi has done well to start a review of imports of Chinese IT products and electronics which could become tools for hacking and procuring sensitive information. Beijing surely has no moral ground to complain, and if it starts a trade war it will be on the losing side."
Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev‚Äôs kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, ‚ÄúYou (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.‚Äù Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki‚Äôs eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki‚Äôs eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, ‚ÄúYou have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them‚Äù. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.‚ÄúSo you take this son back,‚Äùhe told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‚Äòany of these sons can be the cause of great trouble‚Äô. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama‚Äôs job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God‚Äôs representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies ‚Äî lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion ‚Äî but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki‚Äôs womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna‚Äôs appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose ‚Äî of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon‚Äôs founder, insisted ‚Äî as all the great acharyas also insisted ‚Äî that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified. If you engage in these activities, you will further pollute yourself.We want to overcome these enemies; we do not want to give them strength.Every time you give in to meaningless rituals, you are giving the enemies within your mind, greater strength and longevity, and they will overcome you. Ultimately, Krishna killed Kamsa. He appeared in this world, directly, in his original personal transcendental form,5,000 years ago through his wonderful pastimes which are revealed in the Srimad Bhagvatam and the Puranas, through his teachings of Bhagwad Gita, through his holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna,Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

Virat Kohli Is Still Ruling The Roost As He Continues To Be The No. 1 ODI Batsman In The World,"Virat Kohli continued to be the world's top-ranked batsman in the latest ICC ODI rankings.

ap

Having 873 points in his kitty, Kohli will have a chance to increase the 12-point lead over second-placed Australian David Warner at the upcoming five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting in Dambulla on Sunday.

Other Indian batsmen in the top-15 are former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (12th), Shikhar Dhawan (13th) and vice-captain Rohit Sharma (14th).

However, no Indian bowler figure in the top-10 list. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (13th) is the lone Indian in top 15.

As for the ICC ODI Team Rankings, India are currently at number three and they would have to win the upcoming series at least by a 4-1 margin to ensure that they stay at that position, ahead of England.

afp

At 114 points, India, even if win the series 3-2, will slip to 113 points and behind England on decimal points.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will be eyeing the chance to seal direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 during the upcoming series.

The 1996 World Champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a place in the pinnacle 50-over competition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies.

The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30. Sri Lanka are placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies team, which has an unenviable task in its aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain direct qualification.

The bottom four sides on the ICC ODI Team Rankings will need to play a qualifying event, also featuring the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League.

afp

The top two teams from this event will get to play in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

Winning two matches will take Sri Lanka to 90 points, while the Windies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.

"After The Failure Of 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', Distributors Now Want SRK To Refund Money","With back to back losses and big releases flopping one after the other, Hindi Film industry is indeed going through a rough patch.

Massive flops include films like Salman‚Äôs Tubelight, Ranbir Kapoor, and Katrina Kaif‚Äôs Jagga Jasoos and now, Imtiaz Ali‚Äôs Jab Harry Met Sejal has joined the list. The film that was one of the most anticipated films of the year ended up proving to be one big disaster. Apart from the producers, NH Studioz too has suffered huge losses.

The studios had acquired the rights of Tubelight for Rs. 132 crores and Jab Harry Met Sejal for Rs. 80 crores and now that both the films have proved to be such disasters, the intensity of the losses are huge.

While Salman had set a great example by returning some amount to the distributors, a Bollywoodhungama report claims that the distributors have sent an SOS message to Shah Rukh Khan, and have asked them to follow the suit.

Viral Bhayani

According to the reports, they are now expecting a refund for the backbreaking losses since Shah Rukh Khan had made good profits from the pre-sale of All India Rights to NH Studioz, satellite, music, and digital rights.

Pinterest

Just to jog your memory a little, SRK had distributors of his 2015 film Dilwale when they had incurred losses and he had refunded close to Rs. 25 crores to cover up 50% losses to distributors of Dilwale.

And this wasn‚Äôt the first time SRK did so because, in 2001 and 2005, Shah Rukh Khan had refunded the individual distributors of his films Asoka (Eros) and Paheli (UTV) after they failed to perform at the box-office.

While no actor or producer is bounded to return money to distributors, our actors are definitely setting a great example.

Infosys‚Äôs driverless golf cart versus Google‚Äôs autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google‚Äôs fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google‚Äôs autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy‚Äôs Laboratories Ltd, which ‚Äúrather than simply copy Glaxo‚Äôs migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).‚Äù The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural ‚Äî software and hardware ‚Äî support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."
"By creative policy, not rigid rules","Is the central government wrong to mandate private participation in any metro rail project it part-finances? Metro-man E Sreedharan thinks so, emphatically. He can list a number of instances of failed private participation in India and abroad. Rigid rules on the nature of ownership of infrastructure projects do not make sense, whether for or against private participation. The Centre can limit its participation in a project put up for co-financing to a level it thinks fair, given the size of the population of the city the metro seeks to serve. Beyond that, how the concerned state or local government seeks to finance it is not the Centre‚Äôs business. Malayalis who work in West Asia have funded airports in Kerala on considerations other than financial returns. That said, it does not make sense to bar private investment in any kind of infrastructure.

The bulk of the trillions of dollars of global savings seeking profitable deployment anywhere secure comprises non-state funds. It makes eminent sense to draw them into creating much-needed new infrastructure in the developing world, whose economic returns would be significant. If commercial returns do not capture the full extent of economic returns in a particular project, deterring private investment, the government can remedy that in many ways.

An outright subsidy is one option. More desirable would be measures such as levying a carbon tax on petro-fuels and congestion charges on road use that would make the fares needed to make a metro commercially attractive seem perfectly acceptable in comparison with travel by road. Would this not be a big burden on the common man?

Cheap transport for the urban commuter ultimately subsidises the business that employs that commuter. If this subsidy is removed, the costs and revenues of the business would reconfigure, that is all. Clean transport would improve health and lower healthcare costs as well.

Simply mandating a private role in infrastructure would not work. Supplementary action is required to make it attractive for the private sector to invest in infrastructure. That calls for policy innovation, not diktat."

Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release ‚Äî to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour‚Äôs standards. Somehow ‚Äòcomfort zone‚Äô has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life‚Äôs journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‚Äòuntil a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.‚Äô Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‚ÄòI‚Äô,the soil into which it is buried is God ‚Äî the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected ‚Äî into us.‚ñ†

"9 Years Ago, Virat Kohli's Journey In International Cricket Began In Dambulla Vs Sri Lanka","August 18, 2008. It was the first ODI between India and Sri Lanka in Dambulla.

Virat Kohli was making his international debut and was already a star. Just six months ago he had led India to the Under-19 World Cup title and over the pastr year had been touted as the next big thing.

AFP

But for a person who would go on to lead the country, his debut was nothing great. The then 19 year-old made just 12 and India managed just 146. Sri Lanka would win by 8 wickets but Kohli would only emerge stronger.

He worked on his game, cemented his place in the side and eventually went on to become the leader in all formats.

AFP

The journey has been rough these 9 years and it is a raging fire inside him which keeps him going. Well the spark was lit way back in 2008 on that fateful day when he walked out to open the innings.

It all started on this very chair, this very date and this very ground. 9 years today with the Indian cricket team! So grateful. üôè @BCCI pic.twitter.com/23vEL1tO3K ‚Äî Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) August 18, 2017"
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week‚Äôs declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee‚Äôs book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose‚Äôs Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji‚Äôs hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji‚Äôs prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
Indian Railways is headed towards a bleak future,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a soft corner for Indian Railways. His early association with railways is well known. What is perhaps not widely known is that when he visits his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, he opts to stay in the Railway Guest House.

‚ÄúAs the Prime Minister, I can stay somewhere else but I prefer the Railway Guest House as it gives a feel of belonging,‚Äù he told a group of railway officials last year.

This sense of belonging, however, stops short of extending support for railways in one of its most challenging phases.

A look at a parliamentary standing committee report on railways, which was finalized by BJP‚Äôs Ganesh Singh, shows that railways may have a bleak future.

For long, railways has suffered on account of incoherent policies. The incoherence in policymaking remains intact in the Modi era too.

Freight remains the mainstay of railways‚Äô revenue. Within freight, coal is the most important commodity that is moved around the country.

According to the parliamentary standing committee report, on average railways runs up a cost of Rs 0.99 per 10 kilometers but charges its customers Rs 1.60. This surplus is used to cross-subsidize passenger traffic where the average cost is Rs 0.73 per 10 kilometers against a charge of Rs 0.36.

This economic model rests on railways‚Äô being able to protect its freight business.

Last year, railways‚Äô performance in freight business was below par. Not only is it pricing itself out of business in order to meet its obligations to transport passengers, recent changes in government policy have not helped.

This is where the incoherence which characterizes economic policy makes matters worse. Power plants, which are the main consumers of coal, are now encouraged to locate themselves close to coal mines to reduce their costs. It certainly makes sense from the standpoint of a power plant, but what does it do to the railways?

Here, another recent development harms railways.

After 93 years, the railway budget was merged with the main budget this year. One of the consequences, as pointed out in standing committee report, is that operating losses incurred by railways on strategic lines and lines in hilly, coastal and backward areas will not be reimbursed to them.

This is very odd. Railways will not be allowed to conduct operations that make sense from a commercial standpoint. That is fair enough if their role is seen as something that goes beyond narrow commercial considerations. This automatically means that government should reimburse them for some of their work. However, it appears that the government is disinclined to do so which makes for a bleak future.

Prime Minister Modi should therefore consider the following suggestion from the parliamentary standing committee:

‚ÄúSufficient gross budgetary support should be provided to railways every year keeping in view their various socio-economic commitments including strategic lines.‚Äù"

Increasing gulf in quality defines current health of Asian giants,"Sri Lanka will have to improve massively in order to challenge India later this year. ¬© AFP

Purely as a game, I sometimes try to do the old six word review of things. I attempted it for the series against Sri Lanka and came up with: Sri Lanka abysmal, India intimidating. It told me everything about the series and I had a word left! The home team was that bad.

Admittedly, India began overwhelming favourites but teams have visited the lovely island as favourites before and discovered opposition they sometimes hadn't anticipated. There were always, certainly in the last fifteen years, players who could take the game away from you. There were tough players, others with an air of mystery around them, some who played exotic shots and bowled at unique angles. This time there were none. It is not good for cricket because Sri Lanka has given us some very fine talents who inevitably resided within modest personalities.

It is easy therefore to belittle India's performance but that wouldn't be fair. You play the opposition you are provided and if there is a gulf between the two teams in ability, you make sure that is reflected in the scorecards. And sure it was. Each time, India racked up a lead in excess of 300, the margins of victory were the kind you would expect if a heavyweight boxer entered the ring with a middleweight. To that extent, India did what they could and while playing an opponent who hardly throws a punch back can lead to bad habits, India dominated like the better side is meant to.

Shikhar Dhawan made the most of the opportunity as did Cheteshwar Pujara. One punched with a smile, the other made incisions with narrowed eyes. And all the batsmen partook of the feast on offer. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up 17 wickets and scored runs fluently and until a headmasterly approach to the game took out Ravindra Jadeja, he had fun too. And if Hardik Pandya had been asked to choose a debut series, he couldn't have picked a better one. There is something about him and I hope it stays that way as fame envelops him. If you like fame too much it isn't your best companion as doubtlessly he will be told by wise heads. Kuldeep Yadav impressed too and the fact that batsmen don't seem to pick him means captains will always be tempted to pick him. India will have some tough choices to make in the days ahead.

If you are a cricket lover, it is difficult not to be carried away by the manner in which the ball leaves Mohammed Shami's hands and makes its journey to the batsman. The seam is upright and proud and the ball reaches the bat at a nippy pace. Shami probably bowled too little and admitted in an interview that he was the support bowler in these conditions. That may be understating things but I do hope he thinks he is Ashwin when the side tours more seam-friendly lands.

But for all that, the most dramatic performance for me came from a quiet man whose deeds even modern scoreboards haven't found ways to reflect. Wriddhiman Saha's wicket-keeping in the second Test was the performance of the series for me.

Sri Lanka come to India this winter and I hope they have more to offer. Karunaratne, Mendis, Mathews and Chandimal are far better players than they let themselves be at most times but it is the bowling they need to sort. Sandakan must play everytime but how do they replace Herath? I wish they can cajole a few more months out of fingers that have twirled so long because otherwise their batsmen will always have a mountain of runs in front of them.

The one-dayers will be more competitive but I'm afraid Test cricket needs to come to grips with the crisis that confronts it. Nobody came to watch and when one team looks like a juggernaut and the other a meek figure waiting to be run over, it doesn't bode well.

Rohit intends a ""behind the scene"" role as India's new ODI deputy

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:28 PM

The 30-year-old batsman expects a role very different to what he is used to as an IPL captain. ¬© Getty

Rohit Sharma, the India ODI team's newly-appointed vice-captain, said he was honoured to be named the deputy to Virat Kohli for the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. He also added that the role will be a little bit more backstage compared to what he does with the Mumbai Indians, where he is the captain.

""It is a huge honour to be appointed as the vice-captain,"" Rohit said after the team's optional practice session in Pallekele on Wednesday (August 16). ""Ten years ago, I was only thinking of playing for India. Being the vice-captain now feels really, really good. It's a kind of honour that whenever the opportunity comes - the first One-Dayer, when we come [play] on August 20 - there will be some sort of role that I will need to play, and I am looking forward to it. I am not thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment as of now. Yes, it will be a good opportunity for me to get on to the field.

""It's a different ball game completely. IPL and when you come and play international cricket, it is completely different. But again, the excitement and the energy level is the same. So yes, nothing changes too much. I am the vice-captain here, there I was the captain, so I was more in front. Here I have to play a little behind-the-scene role. But yes, I will be very excited to step on to the field as the vice-captain of the Indian team.""

Rohit was one of the three players who turned up for the optional practice session, alongside KL Rahul and Axar Patel. The opener was seen playing a number of sweeps and reverse-sweeps against the net bowlers. Rohit hinted that the shots were part of a plan to counter Lasith Malinga.

""Everyday is a learning day, today I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse-sweeps when someone like Malinga comes and bowls to you. It is something that the game demands these days. You got to be innovative and you got to play different kind of shots to get maximum results. You keep learning every day and I keep trying these things and learn about things I can do and things I cannot do. Every addition to your armoury is good and I am trying to see what I can add to my armoury. What better place than coming here and doing it; that's what training sessions are all about. Come here, improve your skills, and try and get better as a player,"" he added.

Speaking about India's opponents, Sri Lanka, Rohit said they were a dangerous side, as evidenced by their victory over India in the Champions Trophy, but added that India would look to stick to their strengths.

""I have no idea about the squad for this ODI series, but what they had in the Champions Trophy was a very good side. They beat us quite comfortably. So you know in One-Day cricket, they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing for the past few years. We got to stick to our strength.

""We have been playing good cricket. West Indies was good, Champions Trophy was good except for one day - but that can happen - but in the past two years, we have played some consistent cricket in the ODI format. As far as I am concerned, we need to look at what we need to do as a team and bring out the best on the field. That's what we did in the recent Test series. We just focused on what we need to do as a group and that has always been the talk. We need to focus on our ability and strengths,"" he said.

Processor Advancements Will Lead To Energy Crisis Unless We Find New Materials And Technologies,"Moore‚Äôs Law has long been a constant in computer technology. Postulated in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention, and that trend would continue.

That trend has led to a massive progress in microprocessors, giving us the computers, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices we know today, all much more powerful than top-end computers from the 1990s. But as these powerful devices become more widespread, the expectation is that electronics will eventually consume the entire planet‚Äôs energy budget within a couple of decades. The only way scientists see out of this is to develop a new material, one that can be used to develop processors while being more energy efficient.

Materials scientist Nicola Spaldin, of ETH Zurich, believes the answer lies in multiferroics. These are materials that have both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. A lot of processors and storage forms depend on magnetic properties that need to be manipulated with magnetic fields. Instead, multiferroics can have their magnetic poles changed using an electric field, making it that much more efficient.

‚ÄúReplacing the magnetic fields in our existing magnetism-based technologies with electric fields offers tremendous opportunity for energy savings, miniaturization, and efficiency,‚Äù she told MIT‚Äôs Technology Review.

A 128 Qubit quantum chip constructed by D-Wave Systems

Using multiferroics could eventually end our reliance on silicon transistors, thereby removing the restrictions of Moore‚Äôs Law. However, there are other possibilities for development as well. Quantum computing, for instance, makes use of quantum entanglement to produce computational devices orders of magnitude more powerful than current day processors. In addition, quantum communication is also currently impossible to spy on when sending a signal between two devices.

‚ÄúThe true breakthroughs that will change the course of history will not come from initiatives to improve existing materials or devices, or to advance technologies that have already been identified,‚Äù Spaldin says. ‚ÄúInstead, they will come from off-beat individuals or small teams of fundamental researchers pushing the boundaries of knowledge in directions for which there is not yet an application.‚Äù

Basically, we don‚Äôt need more research to perfect the technologies we already know, but instead need scientists to be exploring other ideas that haven‚Äôt even been considered yet."
5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. üåº A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy üë¶üíï A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It‚Äôs time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibeüí§ A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you‚Äôre a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you‚Äôre not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."
‚ÄòYou need to develop relationships across bureaucracy and with private sector to be trusted and effective in India‚Äô,"Rakesh Mohan, Distinguished Fellow at Brookings India, has been deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India and secretary in the ministry of finance. He is the editor of ‚ÄòIndia Transformed: 25 Years of Economic Reforms‚Äô and spoke to Sanjiv Shankaran on the debate around expat economists in Indian policymaking, RBI‚Äôs inflation targeting regime and economic reform processes:

You believe the push for change in India‚Äôs economy came from the bureaucracy and not academia. Why?

That is a remarkable feature of our reform process. In the early 1980s there was little call for change from Indian academics, except for the prescient book by Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai in the 1970s. It is interesting that much of the technocratic call for change came from within. There has been a very interesting interaction between regular IAS civil servants and long-serving economic advisers who have been lateral hires and who then served the government for 20-30 years. They then developed relationships with the rest of the bureaucracy and got trusted. Illustrious examples include IG Patel, Bimal Jalan, Manmohan Singh and Montek Ahluwalia who served many different governments.

How would you distinguish an earlier generation of technocrats hired laterally with the current generation?

They are bright, dedicated economists whether it is Kaushik Basu, Raghuram Rajan, Arvind Panagariya or Arvind Subramanian. They brought in new ideas. The issue that I would have is that it takes time for anyone to become effective in terms of getting to know the system, the issues and also all the personnel in government and outside. You need to develop relationships across bureaucracy and with the private sector as well to be trusted and to be effective.

On one hand, it is a great idea to get such people at the highest levels as advisers. But if they had come at a younger age and served the country for 25-30 years they would have been that much more effective. It seems to me that you need a combination of getting lateral hires who then work their way and contribute on a continuous basis, and others who come as senior advisers at the highest levels for temporary periods.

Didn‚Äôt the changeover to inflation targeting happen over an unusually short period in the Indian context?

Raghuram Rajan came (as RBI governor), appointed the Urjit Patel committee which recommended it, as did the FSLRC (Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Committee). The government then implemented it. It didn‚Äôt take very long. This was relatively easy to do. It was too technical a subject for public debate.

I don‚Äôt agree with inflation targeting as a monetary policy mechanism, not just in India but generally. There is one target, that is, inflation, and one instrument, the policy interest rate. It makes macroeconomics and understanding of macro economy and inflation too simplistic. It almost makes it a hydraulic system. It can also take your sight away from other things that may be happening in the economy. To my mind it also contaminates public discussion. Once there is a simple target and instrument, public discussion becomes about questions of will or won‚Äôt they [cut interest rates] as we observe in the frenzied media discussion before every monetary policy meeting now.

Was it any different in your time?

It was totally different. We were not inflation targeting. I think RBI under Governor Bimal Jalan had indeed made a significant innovation in articulating an explicit multiple indicator policy. The point is that given the way an economy works you have to look at a number of different variables at the same time, including growth and financial stability. Remember that this approach delivered low inflation from the mid-1990s till around 2008, along with high growth, financial development and financial stability.

Can economic change in India be only a gradual process?

The answer is yes and no. Look to the precursors of the 1991 reforms. There was a whole set of committees in the 1960s and 1970, particularly to do with the functioning of the licensing system, which were good at identifying problems in the functioning of the system, but they invariably ended up recommending further tightening rather than liberalising the malfunctioning system.

Also, the global backdrop of development thinking right upto the mid-1960s was to do with planning, import substitution etc. Today, when we think of examples of high growth we think of East Asia; in the 1950s it was socialist countries. We were completely, in that sense, consistent with the rest of the world.

The change in global thinking came in the late 1960s and 70s, starting with South Korea and Taiwan. We took much longer and started thinking of change only in the 1980s."

GOD‚ÄôS OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura‚Äôs alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.‚ÄúMonkeys.They are chashma chor ‚Äî spectacle stealing thieves,‚Äù he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.‚Äù We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna‚Äôs chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone ‚Äî holy men, devotees and tourists ‚Äî entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city‚Äôs Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister‚Äôs offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings ‚Äî temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh Lauds Akshay Kumar For Extending His Support To Indian Soldiers,"Home Minister Rajnath Singh has lauded Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar‚Äôs support for the Indian Army. Singh on Wednesday took to Twitter to share a video of Akshay. The actor was seen appealing to his fans and well-wishers to help martyrs‚Äô families in the video. ‚ÄúAkshay Kumarji your support to Bharat Ke Veer is commendable,‚Äù Singh said in the video-caption.

Twitter

In the over three-minutes long video Akshay said, ‚ÄúFriends yesterday we celebrated 70 years of our independence with great pride and honour. I want to ask you one thing -- did you celebrate the Independence Day along with people who fill you with pride and provide your security? Those who put their lives on the line to gift us this independence every year...‚Äù

Akshay Kumar ji your support to #BharatKeVeer is commendable. https://t.co/0hN47dcJQs ‚Äî Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) August 16, 2017

The Rustom actor added, ‚ÄúEveryday in news we hear at some place or the other our soldiers have given up their lives just to protect us.‚Äù

Akshay also requested his fans and followers to contribute for the soldiers of the Indian Army. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs our turn to do something for them. This year our Home Ministry has launched a website through which you can directly donate money to the families of the martyrs -- bharatkeveer.gov.in,‚Äù he said.

Twitter

The National Award-winner said that the website has already collected more than Rs 10 crore. ‚ÄúToday, on August 16, the website has photographs and details of 114 soldiers. Yesterday... Rajnathji asked us to appeal that we all help the families of these martyrs. I request you all that in the next six months we have to help the families of these 114 soldiers and remove their photos from the website,‚Äù he said.

"Germany, Nice, Orlando 'Lone Wolf' Attacks Are ISIS's Deadliest And Most Effective Weapons Yet","Yet another European city, this time Barcelona, has come under a terror attack. Again the Islamic State has claimed the responsibility for the attack. The attack has left 13 people dead while nearly a hundred others injured.

AFP

Once again, the attack involved a car, which ploughed onto unsuspecting holidaymakers in Barcelona, Spain. ISIS was soon to take responsibility for the attack, which had the markings of the jihadists.

The latest attack once again reiterated the success of the strategy ISIS had laid out in 2015 for Europe for 'potential jihadists'- carry out lone wolf attacks.

Lone Wolf

The term ""lone wolf"" is used by US law enforcement agencies and the media to refer to individuals undertaking violent acts of terrorism outside a command structure.

ABC News

‚ÄúOne-third have mental health problems and others had other stressors such as having lost their job. The ideology gives them a buffer from their other problems,‚Äù says Dr Paul Gill, an academic who has studied over 100 ‚Äúlone actor‚Äù terrorists.

Why lone wolves are dangerous and effective?

Simply because a lone wolf is not acting on anyone else's order or instructions there won't be a group involved in planning and executing the attack. This makes them to a great extend immune to scrutiny by intelligence agencies. It also increases the chances of their ""mission"" being successful.

Reuters

Weapons

Normally a lone wolf attack involves one man-heavily armed. This makes his target, most likely scenario- a crowded public place - more accessible for them. Most of the times the attacker will be armed with an assault rifle, suicide weast or a sharp weapon. IS which earlier this year issued a handbook for potential lone wolves had urged them to use vehicle as weapons. The attack in Nice even though no clear link with IS have been established so far bears the signature of the outfit's direction all over it.

Frequency

A study of 5,646 terrorist attacks around the world between 1968 and 2010 found that 72, or 1.3 percent of them, were committed by lone wolves. In recent decades, such attacks became more frequent in the U.S.

Reuters

The study was conducted before Islamic State leaders in 2014 began to urge followers to do whatever they could to kill citizens of nations fighting the group. A 2015 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. became more common after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Challenges in preventing lone wolf attacks

As mentioned earlier the biggest challenge for intelligence agencies is to identify potential lone wolves and to infiltrate their groups. Since most of the time it is one person acting alone, there could be very few hints on someone is preparing for an attack.

Reuters

Only traces of them are most of the times their social media interactions. Also since they may not be buying weapons in huge amount this too, in most of the cases go unnoticed. The use of cars/ trucks as weapons only add to the their lethal capability to inflict damage as until recently it was unimaginable to see everyday vehicles as weapons."

Why Skipping Breakfast Makes Your Child Undernourished,"If your child is in the habit of skipping breakfast regularly he or she may be falling well short of the daily required amounts of nutrients that are essential for their growth and development, claim the researchers of a recent study.

Reuters/representational image

The findings showed that 31.5 per cent of children who skipped breakfast did not meet even the lower recommended nutrient intake (LRNI) of iron.

While 19 per cent did not meet LRNI for calcium, 21.5 per cent did not meet lower levels of iodine and 7.3 per cent had a folate intake below their recommended nutrient intake level.

Reuters/representational image

On the other hand, children who ate breakfast every day were found to have higher daily intakes of key nutrients such as folate‚Äîimportant for the development of genetic material‚Äì, calcium, iron and iodine‚Äîkey in the development of thyroid function.

‚ÄúThis study provides evidence that breakfast is key for parents to ensure that their children are getting the nutrition they need,‚Äù said Gerda Pot, a lecturer at the King‚Äôs College London.

For the study, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, the team included 802 children aged from four to 10 years and 884 children aged 11 to 18 years.

Reuters/representational image

Breakfast was considered as consumption of over 100 calories between 6 and 9 a.m.

The study also showed that, in younger children (four to 10 years old), on days when breakfast was consumed, children had higher intakes of folate, calcium, vitamin C and iodine compared to their breakfast-skipping days.

Out of these same nutrients, for older children (11-18 years old) only calcium intakes were higher on breakfast-consuming days.

"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India‚Äôs high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM‚Äôs signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM‚Äôs housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India‚Äôs proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were ‚Äúcashless‚Äù. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone‚Äôs case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government‚Äôs bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state‚Äôs chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‚ÄòMob violence is unacceptable‚Äô (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."
5 Simple Ways To Help You Get Exactly What You Want In Bed,"It‚Äôs the weekend and you‚Äôre in the mood for some steamy sensual sex with your dream man or woman. The only problem is that as much you want things to come spontaneously rarely does your partner tune into your desires from the word go; especially if you guys are in the initial phases courtship.

universityprimetime.com

Phrases like ‚Äúcan you go down on me‚Äù or ‚Äúcan you squeeze me here‚Äù are often at the tips of your lips but seem so hard to let out‚Äîdisrupting that mind-blowing sex you so desire. Here are some ways your work around some of the most common reasons that might be blockading your path to fulfilling sex.

#1. Make sure you know what you want

Some of you may realise and some may not, but if you‚Äôre not sure what turns you on under the sheets either you‚Äôll be making the wrong request or end up never knowing what really excites you.

lmt-lss.com

What to do: Get curious about what you prefer by exploring your body by yourself. During your next sexual encounter try and figure out what feels or what you think feels more pleasurable by experimenting without holding back.

#2. Communication is the key even in the bedroom

The fact that you might upset your partner may be at the back of your mind but if you don‚Äôt communicate what you prefer in bed, how do you expect your partner to know?

medicalpress.es

What to do: Start with small compliments like ‚Äú I love it when you touch me there‚Äù in a sweet and straightforward tone and see how your partner responds. There‚Äôs more likelihood of you getting a better response so you can ask for bigger requests.

#3. Be his/her guide while you‚Äôre in the act

Some of us have our fantasies, fetishes, likes and dislikes well scripted in our mind. Use this information to your advantage by showing your partner what you like.

sexlovepizza.com

What to do: If you know that you like being touched in a certain area for instance either spell it out or guide his/her hand to area or spot you want to caress. Tell your partner what you want while you‚Äôre doing so to make your request even more specific.

#4. Use sensual video footage or erotica‚Äôs to build arousal

This is ideal for people who are not fans of physically or mentally expressing their desires since arousal starts in your brain anyway.

luaquebrada24x7.blogspot.in

What to do: Have your partner read an erotic scene from a movie/book or role-playing a character from a bondage, dominance, submission and masochism film (if you're kinky in the head) might be just what you need to spice things up.

#5. Never fake it if you want pleasure in the long run

You‚Äôve been faking an orgasm because you feel the need to please or not to hurt your partner somehow. Unfortunately, this may only get your partner to think that he or she has figured the secret code out and it may be hard to change correctly that behaviour.

femeia.ro

What to do: Be honest and first be frank about the fact that you faked it because you were too embarrassed to share your what you originally felt and then state what you really are into. If you don‚Äôt want to mention the fact that you‚Äôve been faking it you can try and squeeze in the fact that you would like to explore and experiment with new techniques. That should set the ball rolling."
How to kiss so that it leads to sex,"A kiss works as a precursor to sex. A hot, steamy, make-your-knees-weak, make-you-dissolve-like-Klimt‚Äôs-famed-The Kiss-painting kiss is the precursor to some oh-my-gawd-there-there-there-ooooooooooh kind of sex.

Without tantalising you further, here‚Äôs how to kiss so that he knows there‚Äôs going to be some seriously sizzling sex coming up next:



Be the initiator: There is nothing that turns a guy on more than a woman who takes control and has her way with him. Initiate the kiss by pressing your lips onto his and making him respond to you. While your lips get busy, let your hands rove over his body. And moan. You‚Äôll activate an arousal in milliseconds.



Open wide: Your goal is a long, wet French kiss, but tease him before you get there. Open your mouth gradually. Get him hot and bothered before you open wide and let his tongue in. Sit in his lap in cowgirl position, so you‚Äôre on top of him and he‚Äôs at your mercy. Kiss his lower lip and move to his upper before opening your mouth and letting your tongue meet his more-than-eager one.



Be aggressive (with your tongue): Let your tongue be in the thick of the action. Do all the talking by slipping it into his mouth and letting it roll over his, clockwise, then counter-clockwise. Play tongue hockey and tease him by withdrawing and starting over. Nibble on his lip, preferably the juicier, thicker one, before you slip your tongue in again. By now, all his signals will be green and he‚Äôll be raring to have rip-your-clothes-off, all-night-long sex.

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC,"BCCI VS COA

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:39 PM

The CoA is unhappy with the ouster of CEO Rahul Johri from the BCCI meeting ¬© AFP

In its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked for the removal of the current office bearers of the BCCI for the non-compliance of the court's orders to adopt the Lodha reforms. The CoA cited the court's January 2 ruling that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their BCCI posts, for the eviction of acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary.

""The Committee of Administrators submits that since the then President and Secretary of the BCCI had been removed because the BCCI failed to implement the reforms mandated by the Judgement despite a period of six months having passed, it is only fair that the current office bearers be treated in the same manner because a further period of six months have elapsed since the said office bearers submitted their undertakings and the reforms mandated by this Hon'ble Court have still not been implemented,"" the report stated.

The report has been submitted two days ahead of the July 18 hearing, wherein the three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud will reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership. Earlier in an SGM held on July 26, BCCI had decided to selectively adopt the Lodha reforms, leaving out five of them.

It was during the same SGM on July 26, when BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was asked to leave. The latest report by CoA, claims that the office-bearers deliberately misconstrued the SC order and ousted Johri from the SGM.

""After the attendance register was signed, the CEO and the other administrative staff including the legal team of the BCCI was asked to leave the meeting on the purported basis that the order dated July 24, 2017 passed by this hon'ble Court only permits office bearers to attend the same""

The CoA further wrote that this was a pre-planned and orchestrated move by the BCCI and explained the 'obvious' motive behind the same. ""The motivations of such a clever manoeuvre are fairly obvious. The presence of the CEO in the previous SGM held on June 26, 2017 had enabled the Comittee of Administrators to receive first-hand account of the proceedings and bring conduct of certain specific individuals to the attention of this Hon'ble Court. The absence of CEO from the July 26 SGM would make (and has made) that task very difficult.""

The CoA brought to SC's notice that the BCCI had failed to adopt a new fund disbursement policy which was formulated by Deloitte in line with the Lodha reforms. ""Adoption of the new fund disbursment policy by BCCI is one such reform aimed at ensuring proper allocation of funds to the State Associations based on need/requirement and with appropriate checks in place to ensure proper utlization and reporting by State associations.""

The report conveyed to the SC, BCCI's failure to appoint a new Ombudsman, despite the position being left vacant since September 2016 after the Justice (retd.) AP Shah stepped down. He had been roped in to address the conflict of interest issues prevalent within Indian cricket. The CoA also noted that the BCCI failed to adopt the new BCCI conflict of interest rules during the SGM in July, despite being handed the copy of the same through email more than a month prior to the meeting. Since the BCCI did not list new conflict of interest rules as one of the five reforms it was against, there was no justifiable reason for BCCI to not adopt the same.

Teenagers in danger: Blue Whale challenge exposes many socio-psychological vulnerabilities,"Technology is a mixed blessing. For children it can mean enriching new avenues of education as well as better entertainment. But the gadgetry that‚Äôs such a defining part of their life today also brings with it constantly morphing dangers, which are very difficult for parents to track 24√ó7. The Blue Whale Challenge, which has been linked to teenage deaths from Russia to America, is a peril that‚Äôs come to attention in India over the last month. The structure of this ‚Äògame‚Äô is that over 50 days the victim is given around 50 self-harm tasks, designed to culminate in suicide.

India‚Äôs IT ministry has now directed top internet platforms like Google and Facebook to remove all links to the online game. This is necessary, but will not go far enough to correct the social predicament that underlies why some children may participate in such deadly online games. For one, there will remain corners of the internet where such dangers will still lurk. Two, many young people were being pushed to suicide even before the existence of such games, for reasons society does not really understand, and it is easy to blame such games as the proximate cause when actual causation is much more nebulous. In that sense the urban legends circulating in Delhi and environs about someone chopping off women‚Äôs hair are a close analogy. They become ways of naming the state of collective insecurity and free-floating anxiety that we inhabit.

Pressure on young people today is enormous: they are confronted by a dysfunctional education system, support of joint families is gone, parents are overstretched by stresses of modern life. Among the solutions have to be better education as well as better parenting: Talk to the children, have a meaningful engagement with their life and, yes, pay attention to what they are up to online."
"Saira Banu Opens Up About Dilip Kumar's Closeness With His Sons Aamir, SRK And Salman Khan","Just a few days ago, pictures of Shah Rukh Khan visiting Dilip Kumar went viral on the internet. The pictures reflected the bond that Shah Rukh and Dilip Saab share. And Dilip Saab has had this warm bond not just with Shah Rukh but Aamir and Salman Khan too. In a recent interview with Mumbai Mirror, Saira Banu spoke at length about the recent meeting, when Shah Rukh came home. Recollecting how SRK came home and kissed Dilip Saab on forehead, she said,

""I even saw him chanting a dua under his breath and blowing it on Saab's face. He was there for Saab's 89th birthday too and sat close to us, holding his hand and mine.""

She went on to describe his first meeting with SRK decades ago when he had signed his first film, Dil Aashna Hai. She went to say,

""We went for the muhurat of the film too. Dilip Saab gave the ceremonial clap. I have always said that if we had a son, he might have looked like Shah Rukh.. Both he and saab are a lot alike and have similar hair, which is why I like to run my fingers through Shah Rukh Khan when we meet. This time he asked me, 'Aaaj aap mere baalon ko haath nahin laga rahi hain?' I was happy to.""

And she had the sweetest things to say about Aamir and Salman, who have always been very accessible.

""He goes out of his way to comply with such requests and is constantly in touch. So is family friend Salim Khan and his son Salman Khan. They often drop by on festivals and occasions like saab's birthday. Shah Rukh Khan has been the one who was difficult to reach over the past two three years. I pointed that out to him and he admitted that he has been shooting abroad, but promised to connect more often.""

Sangram Singh Launches A Wrestling Championship As He Too Looks To Make A Comeback On The Mat,"In a bid to promote and provide a platform for aspiring wrestlers from Tier 2 and Tier 3 Indian cities, wrestler Sangram Singh launched the KD Jadhav Memorial Kushti Championship in the national capital on August 18.

ap

The one-day event is slated to be held on September 15 at the Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi and will feature five bouts including Sangram headlining the championship, which is also being promoted as a tribute to independent India's first ever individual Olympic medallist KD Jadhav.

""When I read about KD Jadhav, I found out that he devoted his entire to the sport but eventually ended up living his life in anonymity. He didn't even get pension. So, I thought of doing something for the upcoming crop of younger generation of wrestlers. Every aspiring wrestler, particularly from the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, should get a platform to showcase their talent and further their respective careers,"" Sangram said during the event.

ap

Sangram, a former wrestler, is himself making a comeback to the mat and hopes that his initiative will help change the face of wrestling in India. The 32-year-old managed to pull off a star-studded event which was attended by India's lone individual Olympic gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra, Commonwealth gold medallist boxer Akhil Kumar and Olympian boxer Jitender Kumar.

Speaking at the occasion, Bindra said: ""I am delighted to see that a championship is being held as a tribute to KD Jadhav who holds an important and special place in our Olympic history. We shouldn't forget him and he should get the due for the services he did for the country. I must compliment Sangram for his efforts.""

Bindra, who is part of PM Narendra Modi's Olympic Task Force which has been put in place to prepare action plan for the next three Olympics, called for more opportunities to be given to athletes within the country to ensure a sustained career and increased level of completion. ""We must provide more and more opportunities for athletes at different levels. These things will help create an ecosystem for the athletes in India and we need more of such events and competitions in our country. We need to provide platforms for our athletes to help them prolong their careers. I think such initiatives are going to be very useful in that regard,"" he said.

ap

To make the event a success, the format has been tweaked to suit the TV audience. The wrestlers will grapple on a mat inside a ring in six rounds, each lasting three minutes. There will be a resting period of 45 seconds after each round.

Upcoming wrestlers such as Yudhistir, Lubhanshu, Sherpal, Himanshu, Shravab, Pratik, Ekta and Akansha will be aiming to make an impression. The organisers have roped in DD Sports as the official broadcaster and claim that the event will also be telecast live in 25 other countries.

An award night for honouring Indian wrestlers has also been planned on the following day of the championship which Sangram claims is first of its kind in the country. ""We will be giving 10 awards to the wrestlers on September 16. Nine of them are for those who have brought laurels to the nation and one will be for lifetime achievement,"" Sangram said.

SL name ODI squad; skipper Tharanga calls for support

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Tue, 15 Aug, 2017, 09:03 PM

Upul Tharanga urged the country to rally behind the team while stating that every team in each sport goes through a rough phase. ¬© AFP

In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's abysmal 3-0 Test series loss at the hands of the No. 1 ranked Test side India, ODI skipper Upul Tharanga called for the nation's support and urged the fans to rally behind the team in testing times as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match ODI series on Tuesday (August 15).

ODI Squad: Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando

With Asela Gunaratne yet to recover from the thumb injury he sustained during the first Test, the selectors have recalled allrounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana for the five-match series. While Perera was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe, Siriwardana's last appearance for the national side came in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in March-April this year.

Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who featured in the final ODI against Zimbabwe, has been given the axe alongside Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. In their place, the selectors have included Malinda Pushpakumara, who recently made his Test debut against India and young seamer Vishwa Fernando. Both Pushpakumara and Fernando are yet to make their debut in the 50-over format.

""Every team goes through a rough patch,"" skipper Tharanga said. ""This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.

Sri Lanka conceded 600+ totals in two of the three Tests and were asked to follow on in the last two games before succumbing to innings defeats. While the island nation weren't expected to topple the No. 1 ranked side during the series, the manner of defeat came across as rather baffling as their side kept slipping to newer depths every time. With the five-match ODI series and a lone T20I coming up, the skipper noted that every team had its share of lows and goes through a phase of transition before coming back on top.

""Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch. Obviously there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.""

The skipper also reposed faith in the limited-overs outfit and felt that they are well equipped to fare better against their opponents in the 50-over format of the game. ""Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.

""The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us.

""Yesterday despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too - so as the captain of the ODI & T20 teams, I want to appeal to each every one of you,"" concluded Tharanga.

Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, ‚ÄúIndia is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.‚Äù The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal ‚ÄúHindu haters‚Äù? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured ‚Äúinsults‚Äù like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of ‚Äúappeasement‚Äù of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted ‚Äúsecular‚Äù politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who‚Äôs the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal‚Äôs Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was ‚Äúpampered‚Äù and ‚Äúappeased‚Äù why doesn‚Äôt this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‚Äònationalism‚Äô.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today ‚Äì the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss ‚Äì are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."
Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri,"EXCLUSIVE

Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri

K Shriniwas Rao ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:44 AM

Irrespective of how much I may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. ¬© AFP

Given all the drama that surrounded the selection of the coach before they left for the tour of Sri Lanka late in July, a 3-0 series sweep like this one, wrapped up in just under eleven days, has once again brought the smiles back in the Indian camp. Ravi Shastri, back in a very familiar setting that he had helped put in place during his previous stint, is understandably elated. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Shastri talks about the road map ahead, his chemistry with the cricketers and his role going forward. Excerpts...

This was a first: A series sweep away from home. It should instil a good deal of aggression and positivity.

When was the last time that Sri Lanka were beaten like this at home? I'd like to wait and see how some other teams will cope against this same Sri Lankan team in the near future. But then, this is not about Sri Lanka, this is about the Indian team and the manner in which they've stamped their authority here. India's lowest score in this series (487) was still a 100-odd runs more than the best that Sri Lanka could manage throughout the three Tests. So, that should sum-up the total dominance, with the bat and ball.

What are the takeaways for the team after a performance like this?

Even if this team ends up losing a game, as long as they can walk out of the field with their heads held high, knowing that they gave their best, there's no problem whatsoever. A disciplined approach is what counts. For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik [Pandya] and one in the third game from [Mohammad] Shami, we've not faltered. How many catches did we drop throughout this series? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid. It's the effort that counts and in that, if we have to look at the bigger picture, we're taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.

The bowling unit has been coming together splendidly...

Bharath Arun has known these youngsters for such a long time now. Look at Kuldeep [Yadav], for instance. He's been tracking Kuldeep's growth from the Under-16 days. It's the same with some of the others he's worked with for a while now. So, in that sense, there's a sense of familiarity that's also helping. We've always seen Kuldeep as a guy with great potential but let's not go on harping about it. One step at a time. Not just the Test team, even [in] the ODIs, now that we have the likes of Jasprit [Bumrah] and Axar [Patel] coming in, they've all worked with Arun and I am keen to see things moving forward from here.

Hardik made a huge impression in the series...

Hardik may still be new to Test cricket but he's showing what a quick learner he is. As Virat [Kohli] said, he's been the biggest positive of this series. He was working on the cutters for the first time on the morning of the day's play with Arun and he didn't flinch once in going out and testing it the same day. That kind of confidence is what you need at this level.

He can add good balance to the attack if you only have to go in with two pacers...

Of course. But look at Shami and Yadav. They have been relentless. Look at the kind of surfaces that were on offer and these two continuously kept clocking between 141 and 145 kmph. To watch them in action on Day 2 of the game was very satisfying, knowing that these tracks hardly gave them any assistance.

And the fielding too... you've been quite focused on that front...

Oh yes. That's what I also talked about in my interview. When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding eleven in the world. The fittest of the lot and that's right up there in the list of priorities.

You really don't mind showering praise on individuals when you have to...

A few good words don't just make your day but they also give you the sense of belonging and confidence to take the next big step forward. A lot is spoken about coaching an international team. This team loves the pressure they face and the players see it as a challenge. Cynicism and negativity can kill all the joy. I'm not that kind of a guy. I look at the glass as being half-full.

And when there's enough trust and confidence in a healthy working relationship, things begin to look so much better from the outside.

Well, the trust is there. I can't speak for the time when I wasn't around, but what I can say with a sense of absolute belief is that nothing has changed between how things were during my last stint and now.

What is it about you and this Indian team that they have absolute faith in you?

Well, that is for the players to answer. I have a job to do and in my close to 35-year career as a cricketer and a commentator and the other roles that I've handled, I've always tried to give my best. All I can say is that the sense of trust comes from the players knowing that they have someone around who they can walk up to and discuss anything they want. If I really want to make lives difficult in order to get 100% commitment from the other guy, I can very well do that and everybody in this set-up knows what I'm talking about. Yet, at the same time, I don't believe in unnecessary interference. Everybody in this set-up has a responsibility carved out and come what may , that responsibility needs to be carried out to the best of the ability. My job is to ensure this is happening on a daily basis and outside of this, anything that needs to be done in the interest of the team.

A word on Wriddhiman Saha....

Saha has been excellent, be it his wicketkeeping, batting or catching. He had always been an unwavering guy in domestic cricket for years and that hard work is showing. He's grown so much in confidence and remember, he's walking into MS' [Dhoni] shoes. He's done phenomenally well to grow out of that shadow. The kind of 'keeping he came up with in this series - on the kind of surfaces that were on offer - makes him the No. 1 wicketkeeper in the world right now.

Batting seems to be the last of your worries...

To be honest, with a batting unit like this one, the last thing you'd do is lose sleep. The core is such a good one and I'm glad the way Shikhar [Dhawan] is timing the ball. He's got two big hundreds that have put him in the frame of mind that he loves to be in.

Cheteshwar [Pujara] has been batting like a dream and he's in a zone where he has set his targets going forward. And as if all of this wasn't enough, you saw a knock of a different kind here the other day. Hardik's century simply changed the course of an entire Test in less than an hour. We were thinking of going forward by 60 to 80 runs when the tail was batting and look where we ended. Five batsmen got a hundred in this series and close to 10 cricketers got 50-plus scores, which is a first in Test cricket for any team.

You keep insisting 'this is Virat's team' and you're just an extension. Can you elaborate?

I've always maintained this, not just now but even in my earlier stint that this is Virat's team. Prior to when he took over as captain, it was MS Dhoni's bunch and he nurtured some of the boys who've prospered today. The captain is the leader of the pack and the coach is an extension of that role, in the sense that it's the coach's responsibility to ensure that everything is in order for the team and its skipper to go and give their best. These are the principles I followed in my previous stint too. Irrespective of how much I or anyone else may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. Too much importance is given to other things, which is unnecessary. What matters is whether there's confidence and trust between all the individuals and that is my responsibility, to ensure there's enough of it.

There are some big Test series coming up next year, followed by the World Cup in 2019. Has the team sorted its priorities?

The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, we must realise that if India need to show their might in the game, achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle. Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it's Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year.

20 Hauntingly Beautiful Lines By Gulzar On Pain And Love That Speak Directly To Our Hearts!,"""Nostalgia is a sweet place for a poet and writer to be in""-Gulzar Saab

He believes in the power of nostalgia, heartbreaks, and pain. He has even explained that even though nostalgia is an indulgence; a distraction, one can't live in distraction for long.

Twitter

Gulzar Saab is one writer and poet who has managed to capture the fancy and hearts of people, where age is no bar. The way Gulzar Saab has penned down lyrics and nazms that manage to convey the pain, yearnings of a heart and grief, it's unmatchable.

BCCL

While a 15-year-old today loves to read Gulzar's poetry, a 25-year-old me still fancies and adores his Bollywood numbers. And the internet agrees.

May Gulzar saab keep writing till the end of this wretched world. ‚Äî Shakti Shetty (@Shakti_Shetty) August 18, 2017

No one like Gulzar Saab. Ever. I cannot think of any other lyricist who has had such an impact through his writing on my life. No one else. ‚Äî Vivek Tejuja (@vivekisms) August 18, 2017

Not many know that before he made his way with words, he used to work as a touch-up guy for cars in a garage. But life had some other plans for him and life since then has been like a roller-coaster that has only gone up.

He got his first big break with the film Bandini in 1963 as a lyricist. However, his passion and love for writing weren't supported by his family members. They didn't understand that writing could help him make a career but as 'Ziddi'' as he claims himself to be, today his Bollywood songs, poems and Nazms stay relevant and loved.

A rebel at heart, he used pen name Gulzar Deenvi and later shortened it to Gulzar. He ventured into films but when his film ‚ÄòHu Tu Tu‚Äô failed at the box office, he went into a major depression and that's when his daughter Meghna pulled him out of it. In that phase, Gulzar bounced back to life by giving life to his words.

His versatility is noticeably visible from his work. On one hand, he can pen down a love ode Kajra Re. , and on the other, it was him who wrote Oscar-winning Jai Ho with AR Rahman. While he can pull off a 'Ae Papad Wale Panga Na Le' from Makdee, he can write a love song that states, 'Dil sa joi, kameena nahi..'. He knows how to capture attention and hearts, with the right set of words.

Today, Gulzar Saab turn 82. Let's look back at his best poems, nazms, and lyrics that beautifully describe the pain of love and life. Read on.

People Don't Fear Hyenas In Ethiopia And This Man Called 'Hyena Man' Feeds Them From His Mouth,"Hyenas roam freely every night In the ancient walled city of Harar in eastern Ethiopia, seeking scraps of meat to drag to the nearby caves.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."
"After London & Paris Terror Attacks, Woman Manages To Miraculously Survive A Third In Barcelona","For 26-year-old Julia Monaco, life has been a roller-coaster ride in the past few months.

Monaco who hails from Melbourne, has been a victim of three terror attacks one after the other.

She was placed on lockdown on the Tube as three knifemen rampaged in London Bridge; was also caught up in Notre Dame the day a police officer was stabbed; and now she was locked in a shop as terrorists mowed down pedestrians in Barcelona.

In the attack at least 14 people were killed and over 110 injured after a van smashed into a group of pedestrians in the heart of the regional capital. Islamic State was quick to claim responsibility for the attack.

"At last, India gets genuinely serious about companies flouting mining and environment laws","By Himangshu Watts

The landmark judgement of the Supreme Court imposing penalties of an estimated Rs 25,000 crore on illegal mining merits serious reading by the entire corporate sector, and not just by those who extract mineral wealth.

Two aspects of the verdict stand out. First, the verdict takes environmental law enforcement by the Centre and the highest judicial authority to anew high, which is a very strong deterrent against such practices in the future. This strong message will protect the environment and clean up the poisonous air in cities more effectively than some outrageous, controversial and ill-conceived steps taken by various authorities in recent years.

Second, the court has ordered heavy expenditure for the welfare of tribal people in affected areas. This reinforces the GoI‚Äôs declared strategy of targeting and extracting ill-gotten wealth to help the poor, whether by demonetisation of high-value currency notes, or with the goods and services tax (GST).

A crucial aspect of the court case that needs to be highlighted is the fact that the mines ministry, after Piyush Goyal took charge of its affairs, dramatically changed the relatively lenient position that the previous government had taken in the matter of companies violating green laws applicable to the sector. In doing this, GoI showed its determination to resist strong pressures.

Conventionally, mining was deemed illegal only if ores were extracted without a mining lease. Under the mining law, the penalty was equal to the entire output from such an operation. However, once the lease was obtained, even if the mining operation ravaged forests, made the air unbreathable and degraded the environment to make thousands of crores, the penalty under the environment law was a laughable Rs 50,000. This built a very strong business case to start mining without waiting for green clearances.

The government argued before the Supreme Court in January that extracting minerals without the necessary green clearance should be deemed illegal not just under the environmental law but also under the mining law that imposes back-breaking penalties for default. The Supreme Court has upheld this view.

It‚Äôs Mine, Not Yours

This means that even if you have a mining lease, any extraction without forest and environment clearance is illegal and the state must recover the value of the entire output from the defaulter.

Further, the court has ordered that the hefty penalty must be used very transparently for the development of tribal areas where the mines are located. It has ordered that the ‚Äúvery large amounts‚Äù that will flow to Odisha after the verdict must be kept in a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To ensure that the funds are used for the benefits of tribal people in affected areas, it has asked the state‚Äôs chief secretary to file an affidavit stating the work done and audited accounts of the SPV.

For those who think they can make millions without caring for the environment, the court did not mince words. It delivered the message in the first paragraph of the judgement, ‚ÄúLessees‚Ä¶ in Odisha have rapaciously mined iron ore and manganese ore, apparently destroyed the environment and forests and perhaps caused untold misery to the tribals in the area.‚Äù Some steps taken to help the local people, the court said, seemed ‚Äúnot more than a drop in the ocean ‚Äîalso too little, too late‚Äù.

The stern words from the highest judicial authority in the country are abreath of fresh air in the otherwise polluted approach toward green issues some authorities have demonstrated in recent years.

On top of the hall of shame is the Delhi government‚Äôs ill-conceived oddeven scheme that banned half the cars in the city on alternate days, but had no problems with smoky and noisy diesel generators or smoke-spewing, overloaded trucks.

Then there was the ban on 10-yearold diesel cars, which were sold in full compliance of the prevailing emission norms and a declaration to customers that these cars will be legally allowed for 15 years. It didn‚Äôt matter to the authorities that a newer car that is not properly maintained will pollute the air much more. Or that the actual emission is more important than the age.

The problem with such steps is that it creates mass public ill-will towards the noble cause of environmental protection simply because some authority has caused severe hardship with steps that scientists know wouldn‚Äôt clean the air. Such orders actually damage the environment because they make it difficult for political authorities to protect the environment when the common man thinks he is being short-changed.

Green and Bear It

In contrast, the Supreme Court‚Äôs latest verdict on mining, and GoI‚Äôs submission early this year, is a concrete step that will help the environment, even as some mining companies have genuine grievances.

The mining industry fears the verdict will disrupt business and that some mines may shut down. There are some legitimate grouses. It takes ages to get environmental clearances. Often, land is not available for compensatory afforestation. At times, clearances are not renewed even if there is no change in mining operations or output.

Legitimate concerns must be addressed. But for the crooks who ravage the environment, the message from the Supreme Court and the government is clear: if abiding by the law means shutting down your business, so be it."
Chasing shadows: ‚ÄúNew India‚Äù is not compatible with the state playing moral police,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for a ‚Äúnew India‚Äù, a vision that would be impoverished if it is confined merely to building shiny roads, airports and power stations (Saudi Arabia is already there, but that‚Äôs not where new India wants to get to). It should incorporate changed mindsets as well, where citizens are empowered rather than seen as mere wards of the state. That, in turn, means that citizens are allowed to make their own choices as long as these do not impinge on the freedom of others, instead of the state and authorities appointed by it making all their decisions for them. Without such empowerment, new India is bound to fail.

Unfortunately, there are just too many instances of this principle being denied in practice. Contrary to the recommendations of a parliamentary panel, the government may not remove transgenders from the ambit of section 377 of IPC, when this section itself ought to be dropped as no government should dictate sexual choices made by consenting adults. This means, in effect, that transgenders have no sexual rights and their very existence is criminalised.

Likewise the nebulous meme of ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô, popularised by the Sangh Parivar, is often invoked by conservative parents when they want to stop their children from entering into interfaith marriages. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken up an alleged instance of ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô and discovered a ‚Äòpattern‚Äô in such cases, which in turn has persuaded an initially reluctant Supreme Court to order a probe. It is disturbing that if young men or women marry who they want they are subjected to such intervention and interdiction by the state, including by NIA which immediately raises the prospect of a terror link.

The apex court has suggested a connection between the alleged ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô case and the Blue Whale Challenge, indeed an apt analogy. There is grave reason to doubt the phenomenon of a rash of teen suicides allegedly linked to an online game (see accompanying oped), and stopping teen suicides by telling Facebook and Google not to provide a platform for Blue Whale is a bit like stopping terror by interdicting interfaith marriages (doing so, in fact, increases the probability of terror and communal violence by ghettoizing and putting up walls between communities). To the extent that NIA goes haring off after red herrings, it will blind itself to the next terror plot when it does unfold."
"The real military truth: On Doklam, stop saying the Chicken‚Äôs Neck area is vulnerable: it isn‚Äôt","The Doklam confrontation is not over by any means, and no one can say how it will turn out. As the two sides reinforce their positions, the portents are not good. In the meantime, India needs to stop overplaying the vulnerability of the Chicken‚Äôs Neck, the narrow corridor between north and northeastern India.

Indian commentary has identified the Chicken‚Äôs Neck as the driving concern behind New Delhi‚Äôs insistence that it must stand firm in Doklam. The Chicken‚Äôs Neck area is the area between Bhutan, China, Nepal and Sikkim in the north and Bangladesh to the south. At its narrowest, between Bangladesh and Nepal it is 14-17 km wide. Beyond this, it is about 200 km by 60 km in area. The strategic argument is that China could use Doklam to thrust through the Chumbi Valley to sever northern from northeastern India.

This is an extremely dubious thesis. It is about as credible as arguing that the Siachen Glacier is vital to the security of Kashmir and northwestern India. For one thing, Indian forces in the Doklam-Sikkim sector are superior to their PLA counterparts, a point that Indian experts never tire of repeating. India clearly has the advantage of the heights, numbers, and logistics. If so, a Chinese breakthrough here is highly unlikely.

But assuming that the PLA does get past our defences, a thrust from Doklam or from the trijunction of Bhutan, China and India will have to traverse 100-130 km of Indian territory, with Indian forces all round. Note that the PLA will have to negotiate winding Indian roads on which there is no place to hide. It cannot get its men and equipment off the road, and Indian long-range artillery, rockets and attack aircraft will pick them off in a ‚Äúturkey shoot‚Äù.

If the PLA gets to flatter land, it will be able to fan out. However, by the time it does this, Indian forces from both flanks will have massed. The Chinese may even be vulnerable in their rear, with the Indian army harrowing them from behind. Again, long-range artillery, rockets, and aircraft will have a field day.

Assuming that nevertheless Chinese forces make it to flatter ground and try to consolidate their positions, they will face an enormous logistical problem. Their supplies will have to come all the way from Tibet. In military parlance, India will have the ‚Äúinterior‚Äù supply lines which are much shorter while the Chinese will have the exterior lines going back to the Tibetan plateau. As a result, their logistics will be horribly exposed to Indian interdiction. The PLA forces in the Chicken‚Äôs Neck area will gradually be starved of supplies and will be destroyed or captured.

Another possibility is that the Chinese would try to take and hold this area with special forces that are parachuted behind Indian lines. Chinese special forces have grown and improved in capability over the past decade, but they are not much more than a short-operations force against paramilitary or insurgent opposition. Their ability to hold ground against regular military forces and expand their operations is extremely limited.

This then is the commonsense military truth. It is not clear why Indian analysts, including unnamed or retired military analysts, continue to propagate the myth that the Chicken‚Äôs Neck is vulnerable, but it does us no good to repeat this myth endlessly. Certainly, the PLA knows that a thrust here would be suicidal.

Having said that, there is one circumstance in which the Chicken‚Äôs Neck would be vulnerable: all-out war with China. In that case, India would be fighting desperately in many sectors, and it might not be able to defend the Chicken‚Äôs Neck sufficiently. If so, the Doklam road would be of little or no relevance since the entire border would be in flames and India‚Äôs military situation would be perilous across hundreds of kilometres."
108-kg Actress Refuses To Gain More Weight For TV Show,"Actress Anjali Anand, who currently weighs 108 kg, has refused to put on more weight for her role of an oversized girl in the upcoming TV show ""Dhhai Kilo Prem"".

Anjali, who is making her acting debut with the show, was asked by makers to put on more weight. However, she refused to do so.

""I have lived a very active life all this while. Being someone who loves to trek and cycle to maintain a steady weight, gaining too much weight is a big no-no. I am at 108 kg for the role and any more change might get difficult to reverse,"" Anjali said in a statement.

""Dhhai Kilo Prem"", which will be aired on Star Plus starting from April 3, is an unusual story of two imperfect individuals -- Deepika and Piyush (Meherzan Mazda).

Not only Anjali, even Meherzan has gained 16 kg weight for his role.

"Slash IUC, licence and spectrum fees","The telecom regulator‚Äôs proposal to bring down the Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) promises to both increase bad blood in the telecom sector and worsen its finances. The government must intervene to protect the consumer and the sector‚Äôs viability. IUC is the charge that an operator, in whose network a call originates, pays the operator in whose network the call terminates, for the service of receiving the call from the originating network and carrying it on to the called party. As compared to the old 2G days, the network usage per call is lower now when calls are converted into discrete packets that are sent over the network interspersed with packets of other calls and assorted data. This is the rationale for trimming IUC.

However, the cost of the network has gone up because of higher spectrum costs. A lower IUC would lower the cost of a call for the consumer, who, ultimately, bears the cost of the call. However, it would lower revenue for telcos. Now, for large networks such as Bharti and Vodafone, what one pays the other as IUC gets more or less offset by what it receives from it as IUC, since they have roughly the same number of subscribers.

Smaller networks pay out more as IUC to larger networks than what they receive as IUC. Apart from the decline in network usage due to packetisation of calls, two factors favour lower IUC. One, voice accounts for an ever-declining share of telecom revenue globally and net IUC receipts form a tiny fraction of this dwindling part of the business. Two, high IUC is anti-competitive, favouring incumbents against new entrants.

Telecom finances in the country have turned parlous with the aggressive entry of Reliance Jio and the government‚Äôs insistence on high spectrum fees, extracted by auctioning tiny chunks of spectrum. To prevent telco loans from adding to the banks‚Äô growing mountain of bad debt, the government must intervene. It can lower the steep revenue shares it collects as licence and spectrum usage fees, still pegged at the high rates set when spectrum was allotted along with the licence without separate upfront payment."
Why Walnuts May Be The Answer To Beat The Hunger Pangs You Face All Day Long,"Nuts and seeds have been touted as a staple to add to your diet for a while now. Walnuts, however, specifically have a significant role to play in your daily eating habits; especially if you‚Äôre looking to lose weight or curb your appetite.

corbis/Representational Image

A recent finding that was published online in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found out that consuming walnuts daily may activate an area in your brain which decreases hunger. According to researchers, walnuts are also thought to discourage overeating by promoting feelings of fullness.

Study's first author Olivia M Farr from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said that people often report feeling fuller after eating walnuts, but it was pretty surprising to see evidence of activity changing in the brain related to food cues, and by extension what people were eating and how hungry they feel.

SuperFoodsRx/Representational Image

To determine exactly how walnuts quell cravings, Farr and colleagues, in a study led by Christos Mantzoros, MD, DSc, PhD hc mult, director of the Human Nutrition Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe how consuming walnuts changes activity in the brain.

The scientists recruited 10 volunteers with obesity to live in BIDMC's Clinical Research Center (CRC) for two five-day sessions.

Livestrong/Representational Image

During one five-day session, the volunteers consumed daily smoothies containing 48 grams of walnuts.

During their other stay in the CRC, they received a walnut-free but nutritionally comparable placebo smoothie flavoured to taste exactly the same as the walnut-containing smoothie.

The order of the two sessions was random, meaning some participants would consume the walnuts first and others would consume the placebo first.

The findings revealed that when the participants were shown pictures of highly desirable foods, fMRI imaging revealed increased activity in a part of the brain called the right insula after participants had consumed the five-day walnut-rich diet compared to when they had not.

This area of the insula is likely involved in cognitive control and salience, meaning that participants were paying more attention to food choices and selecting the less desirable or healthier options over the highly desirable or less healthy options."

Inputs From IANS"
Falling in love once again at Kolkata‚Äôs Aanadi Cabin,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.

When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldn‚Äôt care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shiraz‚Äôs and the Nizam‚Äôs, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.

These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.

Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.

Let‚Äôs take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.

Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.

Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from ‚Äòit is overrated‚Äô to ‚Äòthe quality is not the same.‚Äô Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, ‚Äòits too touristy!‚Äô

Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.

At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.

I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a ‚Äòstory‚Äô. I‚Äôd been wanting to go there for a while but hadn‚Äôt been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.

It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, ‚Äúcan we chill a little bit more before the day starts?‚Äù.

We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.

The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.

As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.

Though the restaurant is called a ‚Äòcabin‚Äô, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didn‚Äôt actually have cabins in the past. ‚ÄòCabin‚Äô refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared ‚Äòcold drinks (sic)‚Äô is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?

There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when ‚Äòopen kitchens‚Äô were yet to be trendy.

The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of ‚Äòdistressed‚Äô look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.

We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory ‚Äòsalad‚Äô, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.

Was the Moughlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I haven‚Äôt had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.

What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture ‚Äì neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.

What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?

A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.

The paratha at Anadi didn‚Äôt have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.

The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then weren‚Äôt around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.

The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.

My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.

Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.

Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.

We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniska‚Äôs wife, Manishita, who didn‚Äôt want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!

Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."
Sarahah For Good: How A Chennai NGO Is Using The App To Raise Awareness On Child Sexual Abuse,"If you don't know what Sarahah is by now, we hope the rock you were living under will get an Internet connection soon. It's the latest social media fad that has captured everyone's imagination, which lets you post anonymous comments about the person's profile.

But here's the story of a small Chennai-based NGO that's using Sarahah's anonymity to drive awareness on child sexual abuse.

savethesmiles.sarahah.com is the page where organizers of the campaign are encouraging people to ask their child sexual abuse (CSA) related questions anonymously.

""We are working on this issue for almost a year, reaching out to every stakeholder for free awareness session,"" said Mr Sandhiyan Thilagavathy, founder of AWARE, the Chennai-based NGO which is running Mission Save The Smiles. Just to break the silence and ignorance among the people around this issue, Mr Thilagavathy and his team wanted to spread awareness on all available online platforms so as to reach more people.

REUTERS

And Sarahah seems to be the best medium to reach millennials and young people, seeing how popular it is among that audience right now. After using Sarahah for a week, ""Our entire team got the conviction that this platform can be very well used for learning and talking more about CSA,"" said Mr Thilagavathy.

""We understood that people hesitate to talk about it in open platforms and in person. Sarahah has an advantage of posting one‚Äôs query and experience anonymously and hence our team saw it as an excellent tool to initiate dialogue with silent survivors and vigilantes.""

While SaveTheSmiles was started as a movement to educate and empower children, parents and adults on prevention of child sexual abuse back on 19th of Nov, 2016 -- World Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse -- the Sarahah page was only launched on 15th of Aug, 2017.

SaveTheSmiles workshop underway at Madras Literary Society on July 1, 2017.

According to Mr Thilagavathy, the Sarahah page has received adequate response so far, with people asking questions around the topic of CSA without any restrictions, due to Sarahah's anonymity feature. Some of the comments the page has received are as follows:

""Hello.. First of all kudos to this idea.. My question is from when can we educate our children about good touch and bad touch and how do we go about it""

""I have details of pedophiles, I want them to be punished but I do not have the evidence, what to do?""

""If I give you details of a pervert, will you take action?""

Technology tools are playing an important role to fulfill SaveTheSmiles's mission in creating online awareness around CSA and engage in a candid conversation with online users. Mr Thilagavathy told us that his team of volunteers ""are already doing similar awareness through WhatsApp and Facebook where our subscribers will receive daily bytes on CSA content and ways to teach that topic to their kids.""

Mission #SaveTheSmiles team conducts awareness sessions on-the-ground to educate and empower people about CSA, by conducting workshops for children, teachers and volunteers, equipping and enabling them to understand the prevalence of CSA, and tips on how to prevent, process, report and handle cases. The team of volunteers learns a lot in the process, too.

""We seriously work on the feedback that we receive post our workshops and trainings,"" said Mr Thilagavathy. ""Positive feedback motivates us, while the negative ones push us more to improve our content. Through online campaign and awareness, the success stories that we have received from parents and teachers are the real motivation that boosts the team to do more.""

Did You Know That According To Science The Best Way To Drink Whiskey Is To Dilute It With Water?,"A religious whiskey drinker may insist having his drink on the rocks or with a dash of water added to it. Well, it turns out there‚Äôs good reason for that and it's one that now even science backs.

alkotraz.ru

Researchers at the Linnaeus University in Sweden carried out a test to examine how compounds such as guaiacol in whiskey moved around with the presence of water in it.

They concurred that adding water to your drink frees guaiacol from its entrapments and enhances its smell and taste!

The flavour in whiskey comes from the molecule called guaiacol, which is what gives whiskey its smoky, spicy and peaty flavour. It resembles other compounds such as vanillin (a compound that tastes like vanilla).

The study published in the journal Scientific Reports was conducted to simulate what happens to guaiacol in different concentrations of water.

Since water and ethanol don't mix that well drinks contain clusters of ethanol, which trap aromatic compounds such as guaiacol, hampering what the drink should ideally taste like.

Whisky is distilled at concentrations of alcohol above 59 percent. But whiskeys like Jack Daniels come bottled at a dilution of 40 to 45 percent where the ethanol and guaiacol accumulate at the surface.

shayorepublic.com

Diluting it to around 27 percent overall alcohol by adding a dash of water allows the guaiacol to ‚Äòaerosolize‚Äô and dispersed away from the surface, which allows the fragrant compounds to waft into your nose and keep your spirits high and holding on to your favourite drink!

Since the taste, smell and flavour of your drink go hand-in-hand and the fact that the right amount of water is what is needed to enhance the flavour, it makes you wonder why whiskey isn‚Äôt manufactured at lower concentrations?"

Yen for Lutyens: The old boy shows up in the least expected places üòú,"The British architect is celebrated in song and coveted in bungalow. Those drunk on nationalistic power clearly see no contradiction in desperately wanting to live in a colonial hangover. Some of the great unwashed who wash up in Parliament commit their own atrocities as tenants of these colonnaded gems, and, now, in the nightly battle hymn of the Republic, the bitterest grapes of wrath are roared at the ‚ÄòLutyens elitists‚Äô. Despite all this, Sir Edwin created a lasting legacy: architectural, social and, we thought, uniquely Indian.

No-ji, he was the go-to/must-have architect of the civilised world of the 1930s. His imprimatur is also on the cenotaph in London‚Äôs Whitehall, country seats in Britain, and the World War I cemeteries of Northern France. A couple of days ago, when the echoes of India at 70 resounded at his Kingsway aka Rajpath, we found him in ‚Äì Liverpool.

Actually, the city of the Beatles hadn‚Äôt seen him ‚Äòstanding there‚Äô for nearly a century. But now the ‚ÄòLutyens crypt‚Äô is the latest tourist attraction on Hope Street, the world‚Äôs only avenue with a cathedral at each end: the largest Anglican one in the UK, and the modernist Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King where a recent restoration project revealed Liverpool‚Äôs best-kept secret.

Sir Edwin Lutyens was commissioned to design a cathedral. In 1933, the foundation stone was laid, and the first stage, a crypt, was built. Then WWII put paid to every civilian activity, followed by the familiar story of inflation. The entire project was shelved. But the Catholics still wanted their cathedral. An Anglican architect won the competition, fulfilling the two criteria: it shouldn‚Äôt cost more than a million pounds and it had to be built in five years. Btw, the Anglican cathedral‚Äôs designer was Catholic, and it took 70 years.

The grand halls of Lutyens‚Äôs once-forgotten crypt house, apart from three tombs, the cathedral‚Äôs priceless treasury and historical exhibits. In the edifying blend of sacred and secular now common in the West, it‚Äôs also the venue of, et al, the annual beer festival.

What would make Sir Edwin turn in his own tomb? To be reviled as ‚Äòelitist‚Äô in India or, closer home, be glorified in ‚Äòa monument to the greatest building never built‚Äô?

"Blue whales and other folk tales: We, the middle class are as susceptible to urban legends as anyone else","It started last May, with a series of clickbaity stories on the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. They described the bizarre Blue Whale challenge as an online game that preyed on teens, with a moderator giving each participant a set of escalating challenges, eventually leading to suicide. The British tabloids ran with it next, and soon, solicitous police departments were warning parents. From Brazil to India, by now the Blue Whale story has been heard around the world.

And yet, hardly anyone has direct knowledge of the subculture. Forums discussing suicide are not alien to the internet, but there‚Äôs a fog of facts around the Blue Whale bogey. A 21-year-old Russian man called Philipp Budeikin was arrested for masterminding the game on the basis of one wild, braggy interview. Many of the first claims have been deflated. The estimated number of suicides has swung wildly, from 130 to ‚Äúat least 16‚Äù. In many countries, including Russia, the original story has been undercut, but to no avail.

The lurid appeal of Blue Whale is just too great, as is the number of media outlets prepared to swallow it whole, the array of experts willing to speculate without facts, the majority of adults convinced that kids are up to dumb, dangerous things, and malign forces roam the internet.

The journalist Anne Collier, who works on young people and digital safety, has tried to put Blue Whale in perspective. In Russia, tens of thousands of bots were found using those hashtags. There were a few seeming followers, and the rest looked it up out of curiosity, or were advertisers trying to promote something, and ‚Äúprofessionals testing technologies for information dissemination‚Äù.

Radio Free Europe tried to find suicides linked to Blue Whale, and came up empty. The fact-checking site Snopes went at it too, and found no conclusive evidence of Blue Whale, in specific, goading teens to suicide. Bulgaria‚Äôs Safer Internet Centre, which empirically studies teen digital behaviour, pointed out that given that Russia has among the highest teen suicides in the world anyway, it would be hard to prove that this weird internet subculture actually caused the deaths.

In other words, we‚Äôve all been had, and how. Even one teen death is one too many, but to get agitated about Blue Whale instead of noticing signs of mental trouble, is irresponsible. The danger with spreading such sensationalist stories about death cults and copycat suicides is always this: it triggers real tragedy, because a few vulnerable individuals get swept up in the contagion.

Look up stories about the ‚Äúsuicide town‚Äù of Bridgend, or the Slender Man meme about a tall thin supernatural killer that swept the US a few years ago. With Slender Man, what started as a tale told around a campfire became a networked horror story. Folklorists studied the scale and velocity of the myth, as people recounted the phenomenon, added their two-bit and their FOAF (friend-of-a-friend) accounts, shared creepy visuals as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù. Eventually, it led to a real stabbing.

Technology has always been blamed for driving teens round the bend. Decades ago, there was a similar moral panic around the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, which was blamed for suicide and demon worship. Violent videogames were held out as the reason for mass killings like Columbine. While excessive focus on anything, whether workaholism or exercise or Netflix, should be a sign of mental distress, that‚Äôs not to say that these activities cause the mental distress and its violent manifestations.

Of course, in India, even urban legends are divided by class. People like us deplored the ‚Äúmass hysteria‚Äù that drove folks in UP and Haryana to believe women‚Äôs braids were being chopped off by mysterious forces, even as we solemnly appealed to the grownups in government to tackle the ‚ÄúBlue Whale‚Äù problem. Even a presumably rational communist like Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Prime Minister Modi to do something, anything. The IT ministry declared the game ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and ordered social platforms to scour their content.

The whole point about a moral panic is not whether the story is true or false. The question is, what is the standard used to call it an ‚Äòepidemic‚Äô? One person, or ten, or hundred, or more? Usually, a small or stray ‚Äòactual‚Äô incident is made into a gripping narrative, one that stokes genuine social anxieties. Media may be a big part of these moral panics, where attention builds, peaks and then falls off just as suddenly. It‚Äôs happening with the braid chopping story, and will inevitably happen with Blue Whale too.

A moral panic is a dramatic production that involves several actors ‚Äî there‚Äôs always a ‚Äòfolk devil‚Äô or scapegoat (in this case, the internet), there are law enforcers, media, politicians and the public who all play their part. New technology often sets off moral panics ‚Äì from electricity to the telephone to social media, each new thing has made us freak out about the fraying social fabric.

And yet, no technology actually turns anyone‚Äôs head, it only makes it easier to do what they were doing anyway. Our protective posture towards young people, our sense of their suggestibility, guilt about not having given them enough attention, our discomfort with their growing autonomy, all combine to let us readily believe such ‚Äòtrends among the youth‚Äô stories.

Falling for such narratives is not a failing or an embarrassment, it‚Äôs the human default. But perhaps knowing that we are all suckers for a sensational story should make us a little humbler, a little less quick to judge others who do the same."

Bad politics behind endless project delays,"In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited the example of a railway line between Howrah and Champdanga in Bengal. It was decided in 1975 to put in broadgauge tracks in this 74-km stretch. Part of the project was completed ‚Äî the rest has been stuck for 42 years. Modi said his monthly reviews of projects have speeded up investment, completion and commissioning of new projects. It is welcome that some projects are getting completed in this fashion. Mere monitoring will not, however, help others get built.

Delays in executing projects do not really highlight the failure of Indians to strategically plan, manage and execute new projects. What it does underline, however, is the trait of overambitious politicians to allocate projects to suit particular constituencies, with scant regard about whether it is possible to execute them all in time.

An over-supply of announcements tends to spread resources like capital, manpower and managerial skills too thin on the ground for any one project. Delay follows. The solution is for politicians to refrain from throwing confetti-showers of projects, which are much more than the capacity of the public or private sector to execute, to impress voters.

Data from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) shows that the value of projects completed every quarter peaked in March 2016, five quarters ago. It has been falling, on average, since then. The last two quarters, from January to June 2017, have been especially bad. CMIE cites the lack of investment appetite and says most projects being finished now were proposed 10 years ago. The government should try to mitigate financial and other risks associated with investments to bring animal spirits back to the business of forming and executing new projects."
"‚ÄòDD breached constitutional boundaries. This is an attack on democracy, there is now an authoritarian system in India‚Äô","The Left Front has accused the central government of censorship, saying Doordarshan refused to broadcast the original version of Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar‚Äôs customary Independence Day speech in Agartala. DD has denied charges that it blocked coverage. It claims that its local station did broadcast Sarkar‚Äôs speech at 7pm on August 15. DD‚Äôs official note though did not refer to the original message that the Tripura CM recorded on August 12 ‚Äì to be broadcast on August 15 ‚Äì and later circulated by Tripura government‚Äôs information department. Manik Sarkar spoke to Rohit E David on the controversy, Centre-state relations and why he accuses the central government of censorship:

You have accused Doordarshan of breaching constitutional boundaries by refusing to broadcast your Independence Day speech in its original form? Do you see this as an insult to the office of the chief minister?

Yes, this is absolutely correct. They crossed constitutional boundaries. We live in a federal country. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi can address the people of the country, chief ministers can also do the same in their state. On Independence Day, they recorded the entire speech. Then suddenly, they asked us to reshape my speech. How dare they ask me to reshape my speech? They cannot dictate to me. This is an attack on democracy. This is thoroughly authoritarian.

This was not a regional function. It was a day when the nation‚Äôs introspection can be done. The central government is controlling everything. This is a very bad thing. They are not in a mood or position to tolerate any sort of dissent. What is this?

Doordarshan has certainly insulted the Tripura chief minister‚Äôs office. I have been elected by the people. I cannot suspend the Doordarshan and Prasar Bharati personnel in the state. Both the state-level organisations of the national broadcaster are being controlled by the national organisation. This sort of attitude is not acceptable at all.

What action are you planning to take in response to this action by Doordarshan?

I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on in India. According to me, action means to create awareness amongst the people about what has happened. I am doing exactly that.

In your official capacity, what has the state government done after this incident?

We have protested against my speech not being aired. I can‚Äôt say anything more at this moment.

Do you think this case reflects poorly on the cooperative federalism that PM Modi has spoken about?

Where is this cooperative federalism? Can anyone tell me in this country? Federalism means it is cooperative but that is not the case. The central government first removed the Planning Commission. When this organisation was there we had the scope of discussion between the Centre and state. Now, where do we go?

Everything has been transferred into the hands of Niti Aayog. Niti Aayog is only serving the agenda of corporates. What happened to National Development Council (NDC)? The fact is that not a single meeting of NDC has been called for by the central government. What has happened to the Inter-State Council? Why has there been only one meeting in the last three and a half years? In practice, there is nothing like the cooperative federalism that PM Modi has been talking about. There is now an authoritarian system in India.

But critics say you were talking about national political concerns in your speech rather than focusing on state-specific issues as chief minister.

Tripura is part and parcel of India. I was speaking at India‚Äôs national Independence Day. Without talking about national issues how can I deal with the state? This is an inseparable part of the country.

Are your saying that the individual freedoms of Indians are under constant attack under the present central government?

Today, minorities and Dalits are under attack. Their security has been shattered as never before. It is precisely these things that I had mentioned in the speech. If anyone opposes the government‚Äôs ideas, they will block it. This is not right.

India is a big country. We have our tradition. The people of India cannot be fooled or be bullied. I have full confidence in them. When the time comes they will take a stand, turn around and face any issue."

KJo conquered the small screen space with Koffee With Karan and what the world didn't see coming was animosity between them.

While there was no direct rivalry between both, what happened recently proves that things didn't go down too well with Simi.

Both the chat show hosts were present at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne in Australia albeit in different capacities.

KJo was present to host a masterclass on 'How to direct a big Bollywood dream,' Simi was invited to host the awards ceremony that took place towards the end. However, as soon as the festival concluded, Simi overheard KJo talking to IFFM's festival director about wanting to host the awards in 2018.

This clearly irked and rubbed Simi the wrong way and she took KJo's case by calling it another 'take over.'

Home-grown Nationalism,"

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. ‚ÄúShe was an audacious woman who could hold her own,‚Äù she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda ‚Äî who initiated her in brahmacharini vows ‚Äî Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‚ÄòNivedita,‚Äô one who has dedicated her life to God.‚ÄúShe was a remarkable person.I don‚Äôt think we have focused enough on her,‚Äùsays Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita‚Äôs life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master‚Äôs views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta‚Äôs Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta‚Äôs elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita‚Äôs 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.‚Äù Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.‚ÄúSwami Vivekananda had said that it‚Äôs not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It‚Äôs a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,‚Äù says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. ‚ÄúNivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,‚Äù elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.‚Äú She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission ‚Äî Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.‚Äù ‚ÄúHer nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India‚Äôs identity,‚Äù explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita‚Äôs sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. ‚ÄúPatriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it‚Äôs about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it‚Äôs not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.‚Äù In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms ‚Äî from her extensive travels across the country ‚Äî her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:‚ÄúIndia must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion ‚Äî the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.‚Äù Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.‚ÄúTradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it‚Äôs not about this and not that. It‚Äôs about inclusive Vedantic theory,‚Äù says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.‚ÄúOne had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.‚Äù

KL Rahul could be the answer to Team India‚Äôs long-term No.4 riddle,"By Chetan Narula

In the last season or so, India‚Äôs ODI record has wavered. They played just eight at home, all in preparation for the 2017 Champions Trophy, winning 5-3 against New Zealand and England. For what it‚Äôs worth, they did finish runners-up in the quadrennial event. And whatever plans the team management charted for that tournament worked ‚Äî barring Pakistan in the final, of course.

Yet they have to redraw the plans for the 2019 ODI World Cup and the team management has identified the wobbly No 4 spot as the weakest link. And with two years remaining, now is a good time to start working on it. ‚ÄúKL Rahul will bat at No 4 in the ODI series against Sri Lanka. He is too good a player to be left out of the playing eleven at this time,‚Äù said coach MSK Prasad this past week.

Rahul has climbed the charts very quickly in the last year or so, and has gained immense confidence from the dressing room in his abilities across formats. As such there are two ways to look at Prasad‚Äôs comments.

One, the Indian team has decided upon its opening combination for the near future. Rohit Sharma is steadfast at one end, while Shikhar Dhawan ‚Äî with three international hundreds (and another four half-centuries across formats) since June ‚Äî has bought himself more time.

And it is the continued inclusion of Ajinkya Rahane that confirms Rahul‚Äôs future batting spot. The latter had missed out on the New Zealand series last October due to a hamstring injury, and scored only 24 runs in three matches as he opened against England early this year. He was then unfit for the 2017 IPL and missed the Champions Trophy, both due to a shoulder injury. This resulted in Rahane being chosen as the back-up opener for the Champions Trophy.

Prasad was clear that Rahane would not be a middle-order choice as Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were picked. When Rahane opened in the Caribbean (as Rohit was rested), the debate was sealed ‚Äî he is no longer seen as a No 4 option. Second, Rahane came into the ODI side as an opener and it was the same line of thought ‚Äî that he was too good a player to be left out ‚Äî by then-skipper MS Dhoni that saw him shunted up and down the batting order over the years. The result has been an unstable No 4.

There is no denying that Rahul has climbed the charts with great efficiency, and whilst doing so, has shown a sense of adventurism in his game. When he burst onto the scene in 2014-15, he was seen as a compact opener for Test cricket. Over the next year or so, he added various dimensions ‚Äî mostly attacking stroke play ‚Äî to his game. The result was easy to see in the 2016 IPL ‚Äî he scored 397 runs in 12 innings at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 146.49.

The point is that he scored those runs batting in the middle-order and complementing the likes of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Rahul was afforded the opportunity to make his ODI debut thereafter and he scored 100*, 33 and 63* in his first three ODIs (albeit in Zimbabwe).

That was nearly 15 months ago, and much has changed since, including Rahul‚Äôs own improved ability to score runs.

There is no doubt that he merits a run in the ODI format and yet this move leaves room for doubt. Rahul moving down to No 4 will only be a repeat of the Rahane experiment.

It gives rise to further questions. How long will they persist with Rahul in the middle order if he is not successful? And what does this mean for Manish Pandey, who has been waiting for a way back into the ODI eleven since autumn last year?

It‚Äôs a coin toss for now. Heads, they win and Rahul solves India‚Äôs long-standing problems at the No 4 spot. Tails, they go back to the drawing board. At the least they have two years to figure it out."
Cristiano Ronaldo And Lionel Messi Join Forces As They Urge Others To Stand Up Against Fear After Barcelona Attack,"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi may be adversaries on the field but in the wake of a tragedy they have come together.

Saha's 'immeasurable' brilliance leaves the world gasping,"Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp with his wicketkeeping skills in the Colombo Test ¬© Getty

When pitches start to wither, when the bounce gets fickle, when a ball throws up dust on hitting the turf, it is the batsmen you worry about. ""Oooh"" we go when one takes off past the shoulder of the bat or hurtles through at ankle height. The spinner has a mischievous grin, the batsman the look of a condemned man.

You don't think too much about the wicketkeeper though. The byes that result from a wicked surface go against his name and if he keeps a clean sheet, it doesn't stare at you from a scorecard a fortnight later. And yet, as much as the batsman almost, he has to combat the surface. If the batsman is beaten, he lives another day, if the 'keeper is beaten, it is four byes and slip looks at short leg with a twisted smile and a raised eyebrow.

I thought of that over the last couple of days of the Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. Normally, the batsmen are on the guest list there. Hundreds are strewn around and if you are Mahela Jayawardene, you only count the runs after the mandatory hundred has appeared. But this track was different. It was powdery to start off and by the third morning, the ball was spitting and bouncing. By the fourth morning, the odd one was taking off almost vertically as Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews discovered.

And yet, every time the ball beat the bat, at varying heights, it found a comforting glove. Every time it acquired a mind of its own after pitching, it was arrested and returned to the bowler. There were no oohs and aahs, no exaggerated reactions, just a calm gather and a crouch for the next ball. Keeping was hazardous but Wriddhiman Saha made it look like just another balance-sheet to be put together and filed away.

I have very rarely seen wicket-keeping like this. Maybe Nayan Mongia standing up to Anil Kumble's rockets on a pitch of variable bounce. Maybe Syed Kirmani at his peak. Kiran More was good and MS Dhoni brought his own style to a difficult job and rarely had a bad day. But Saha, so understated, was a treat to watch. Only once in the second innings was he beaten and he would have needed a fisherman's net to catch that one. And when he caught Mathews off another Jadeja sortie that bombed the pitch, we gasped.

Jadeja was bowling in the high nineties, more than ten kmph faster than Ashwin who was going past the outside edge for fun himself, more than 15 kmph faster than Herath on average and a good 20 kmph quicker than the debutant Pushpakumara. When he felt like it, he crossed 100 kmph. After he faced the first ball, Mathews asked for an arm-guard because the first one hissed at him violently.

But Saha seemed unperturbed. Indeed, amusing as it seems, taking a DRS call seemed to fluster him more. He couldn't have known where the ball was headed and yet it seemed he did. In our commentary box, Vijay Dahiya, no mean 'keeper himself, was rejoicing. Ajay Jadeja wanted to make him the Man of the Match.

In time to come, there will be nothing to measure Saha's brilliance, no scorecard will be read in reverence, no highlights packages will be preserved, no accolades offered on awards nights.

But the eyes saw it. And left imprints behind. Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp in Colombo.

"Andy Rubin's Essential Smartphone Will Ship Within 7 Days, Taking Aim At Android Flagships!","The Essential Phone, a smartphone by Android co-founder Andy Rubin, was announced in May and originally scheduled to release in June, with few other competitors.

Unfortunately, the phone has been delayed and is now set to launch in one week, at the same time as the Galaxy Note 8, followed likely by the LG V30 and Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL the week after, as well as the upcoming iPhone 8 and more.

The Essential Phone features a QHD (2560x1312) edge-to-edge display, with rounded corners and ultra-narrow bezels in a titanium build. It has a dual rear camera system with a 13MP RGB sensors, and 13MP monochrome, as well as an 8MP front camera. The device packs a 2.45GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with a Adreno 540 GPU and 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB internal storage.

According to an email registered customers received from the company, the smartphone will ship within seven days, at a buy price of $699 (approximately Rs 44,800). Though some of the other offerings coming out soon may be more expensive than the Essential, they‚Äôre more powerful devices from tried and tested brands, as opposed to a startup. It all comes down to whether Essential‚Äôs camera and it‚Äôs touted accessories can carry it ahead of the pack."
"Who will save our children? Go beyond immediate causes and buck passing on Gorakhpur child deaths, fix systemic failures","Seventy child deaths on the eve of 70 years of Independence! The nation is shocked. Two doctors at the state-run BRD hospital were held responsible and removed by the Uttar Pradesh government. In its defence, the state government has been quoting statistics to prove that there has been a pattern of child deaths in Gorakhpur in August especially due to the long-standing problem of encephalitis ‚Äì and, by implication, that it cannot be held responsible with just five months in power.

While the callous corruption of these two doctors may have been the immediate cause of child deaths in this particular case, who do we hold responsible for the systematic pattern of child deaths in Gorakhpur, or in UP and the country at large? India has been the world‚Äôs largest contributor to all levels of child deaths since 1953 ‚Äì the first year for which we have Indian data available. Starting out with nearly 4.7 million deaths a year under the age of five years (U5), it took us almost three decades to bring them down to 4 million a year.

Between 1969 and 1979 China reduced U5 deaths by 2.4 million, the highest in a decade in any country in recorded history. The beginning of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) did accelerate the pace of progress in India, but China again outperformed us. As did our neighbours Maldives, Nepal and Bangladesh between 1990 and 2015, to achieve their MDG targets on child survival.

We did not achieve our MDG targets, despite having a lower U5 mortality rate than our neighbours in the pre-MDG era. Maldives actually recorded the highest decline in the rate not just in South Asia, but in the entire world during the MDG period. We could dismiss the achievements of our neighbours on the ground that they are small countries. But can‚Äôt we learn from their political commitment to child survival? Secondly, what about China, whose population size is still larger than ours, and whose GDP per capita was lower than ours until 1990?

I am sure someone will jump up to say ‚Äì China is an authoritarian country which can get things done, and is not diverse like us. Well, no one is like us as far as our commitment to child survival goes! Do we wish to continue with our uniqueness in this regard?

The story has been similar at lower levels of child survival as well. At the neonatal level (ie during first 28 days of birth), the Bimaru states accounted for 55% of all deaths in the country in 2011 ‚Äì UP (27%), MP and Bihar (10% each) and Rajasthan (8%) ‚Äì and 15% of the global burden. While China performed even better at this stage, with a 90% decline in number of neonatal deaths during the MDG period, we had 695,852 neonates dying in 2015 ‚Äì more than 7 times China‚Äôs.

Clearly, with efficient and equitable health systems and doctors ‚Äì particularly at the primary health care level ‚Äì many of these deaths could have been averted. However, as the UP CM himself argued, in an attempt to shift responsibility to individuals, lack of sanitation was the reason for recent child deaths in his constituency. According to one report, doctors at the BRD hospital claimed, perhaps in their own bid to deflect some responsibility, 70% of children affected by encephalitis who visited the hospital were malnourished.

Clearly, sanitation and nutrition are not responsibilities of hospitals and doctors ‚Äì although they can adopt measures to mitigate some of their impact ‚Äì and are influenced by people‚Äôs socioeconomic status, especially educational and economic status, as well as the efficacy and equity of municipalities and nutritional interventions of the government. While health systems and doctors are the immediate causes of child deaths, structural failures are responsible in the final run.

Is it the fault of parents that they are poor and illiterate ‚Äì or that their localities are not cleaned by the municipalities? To a degree, their own socioeconomic status could be. But even a libertarian like Milton Friedman argued for ‚Äòpaternalistic concern for children‚Äô and the ‚Äòfinancing of education‚Äô by the government on the grounds that holding parents responsible for children ‚Äòrests on expediency rather than principle‚Äô.

A state health officer in Lucknow told me in 2009 that poor people keep producing children and expect us to take care of them. Again, it is the economically and educationally weak who have more children. No matter how you approach the issue, the buck would ultimately stop at the state. Present governments have to accept their share of responsibility, but we as a nation and the Indian state since Independence are also responsible for the broader pattern of child deaths.

Social and systemic injustices have played their own set of roles. People are poor and uneducated because of both sorts of injustices. Confining ourselves to immediate medical causes is not going to take us far in addressing the systematic pattern of child deaths ‚Äì we will have to go way beyond. If it is true that people get the government they deserve, can we, on our part, pledge that we will only vote for candidates who put forth a concrete vision for saving our children ‚Äì the future of our nation ‚Äì and will not indulge in social injustices that perpetuate poverty and illiteracy?"

Narendra Modi‚Äôs black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi‚Äôs claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Demonetisation revealed Rs 3 lakh crore black money, says PM @narendramodi https://t.co/LtJmN0RgzE pic.twitter.com/j26ALppVor ‚Äî Times of India (@timesofindia) August 16, 2017

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi‚Äôs Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

iOS 11's Beta Version Has A 'Cop Lock' Feature That Lets You Quickly Deactivate Your Touch ID,"Apple seems to be paying attention to the rising instances of law enforcement agencies abusing their power in the US. The company is giving its users an old way to protect themselves. It is now adding a quick way to disable your Touch ID in iOS 11.

The new feature lets iPhone users tap the power button five times in quick succession to call emergency helplines. Take note, it doesn‚Äôt automatically dial for you. Instead, it brings up a quick menu where you can tap to dial, while also offering you the option to temporarily disable your Touch ID until you enter a passcode.

The new feature appeared in the latest beta version of iOS 11. Previously, you‚Äôd have to dive into your menu settings to disable our Touch ID. The new method is more discreet and faster to activate, both important points if you‚Äôre in a situation where you fear someone might try to force you to unlock your iPhone.

iOS 11 is a game-changer for Touch ID. Press power button rapidly 5 times and it opens the 2nd screen, but it also forces passphrase entry! pic.twitter.com/uvWbM04lyk ‚Äî Kia‚Äè‚òÜ (@alt_kia) August 17, 2017

See, if law enforcement agencies suspect you of a crime (whether you‚Äôre guilty or not), you might be intimidated into handing over your phone whether that‚Äôs legal or not. But an officer can‚Äôt stop you from tapping your power button, something you can do quickly and quietly the second you sense trouble. You wouldn‚Äôt even have to think twice because there‚Äôs a simple password to reactivate it.

Of course, the feature is even more useful considering Apple is expected to debut its iPhone 8 with face scanning instead of a Touch ID. There‚Äôs no way to stop a police officer from holding your phone up to your face, so it‚Äôs probably better to just have a way to deactivate it.

Of course, this is also a decent tactic to keep nosy parents and relationship partners out of your phone. Unless they know the activation password of course."

The never ending quest for Independence,"As India celebrated the 70th anniversary of Independence from foreign rule, a friend sent me a series of photographs taken in the flood-ravaged areas in the north east.

The pictures showed people ‚Äì men, women and children ‚Äì standing of the roofs of submerged houses, or standing waist-deep in floodwater. All the pictures had one thing in common: the people in them were, one and all, saluting the tricolour that rose, triumphantly, above the deluge.

Taken together, the pictures were an inspiring testimony to the spirit of Independence.

However, on the same day, the TOI carried a news report about Choudipur, a tiny village in UP, whose residents refused to join in the nationwide celebrations for Independence Day.

The reason? Seventy years after the country gained freedom, no development whatsoever has reached them.

The village is mired in abject poverty, cut off from the rest of the country as there are no roads worth the name to get to it. There is no electricity, and only four households in the village have indoor toilets. The great majority of the villagers have no option but to defecate in the open.

Places like Choudipur are obviously exceptions to the general progress that the country in its entirety has made since it gained freedom.

Longevity has significantly increased, both for men and women. Infant mortality has been greatly reduced. Diseases such as polio have been largely eradicated. Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of the abyss of extreme poverty.

But places like Choudipur serve to remind us that though we have indeed travelled a long way since our historic ‚Äòmidnight tryst with destiny‚Äô, we still have a long way to go.

According to varying estimates, anything between 25 per cent and 34 per cent of the country‚Äôs population still exists below the officially accepted poverty line.

Brutal oppression of dalits and other marginalised sections of society remains a national stigma, as do the crimes of violence against women which are an everyday occurrence.

Joblessness continues to grow, and not just among the uneducated or unskilled. According to a recent report, one out of every two MBAs is unemployed.

All this is not to downplay the great progress that the country has made in 70 years.

But while acknowledging and taking justifiable pride in the country‚Äôs many achievements ‚Äì as the flood-affected people in the photographs sent to me were shown to be doing ‚Äì we should also recognise the grim realities as represented by places like Choudipur, and the uncounted thousands of others like it.

Such recognition is necessary because it serves to remind us that Independence ‚Äì social, economic and political ‚Äì is not a destination, but a journey. It is a road we must continue to travel, not with cynicism or despair, but with determination and hope.

That‚Äôs the best salute that we can offer the tricolour of freedom."

"Foster competition: Instead of targeting Delhi‚Äôs private schools, improve government schools","In a bizarre proposal, the Delhi government has told the high court that it intends to take over the management of 449 private schools that have failed to refund excess fees. The schools were identified as defaulters by the court-appointed Justice Anil Dev committee. While excess fees being charged by private schools may be an issue, the Delhi government threatening to take over these schools is a throwback to the old India of the 1970s. In that sense, the capital‚Äôs ruling AAP dispensation appears to be left of even the Left in Indian politics.

It‚Äôs welcome that the Delhi government has made education reforms a key agenda. However, its statist approach hampers improvements. Going after private schools for charging excess fees can be politically projected as an anti-elite move. But it does little to address the main problem afflicting primary education ‚Äì lack of adequate number of quality government schools. There‚Äôs a huge demand-supply mismatch which results in parents fighting to get their children admitted in a handful of good private schools. If the Delhi government is serious about rising school fees, it should establish quality government schools that can attract students from all economic backgrounds.

This holds true for primary education across the country. According to a new study, between 2010-11 and 2015-16 student enrollment in government schools across 20 Indian states fell by 13 million while private schools gained 17.5 million new admissions. This shows a clear preference for private schooling and the corresponding poor standards of government schools. Solution to the rising fees problem lies in bridging this gap, not government taking over and running private schools to the ground. In the Delhi case, the high court questioned whether the state education department had even 50 trained officers to take over the 449 private schools in question. Instead of such ludicrous proposals, authorities would do well to improve quality and quantity of government schools."
26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you‚Äôve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with ‚Äúaddiction of online binge watching‚Äù.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn‚Äôt let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness. What is his caste you may ask? Pat comes the reply, he is an Indian. For him, the happiness of the people around him is more important than the caste he belongs to. Known for their strong stand to unite one and all, United Colors of Benetton strongly believe in the ideology of unity. In this video, they bring alive the incredible story of this man in Lucknow and exemplifies how we all can be #UnitedByFaith."

Junior players impress in Indian Hockey team‚Äôs Europe tour,"Indian Hockey team‚Äôs thrilling 4-3 win over Austria in the last match of their Europe tour brings good tidings for sports lovers. After a disappointing start to the tour with two consecutive losses, the team showed remarkable resilience to bounce back. The team won their last three encounters to finish on a winning note. Hockey India‚Äôs decision to blood younger players into the playing eleven seems to be slowly paying off.

The 18-member new look team had six players ‚Äì Gurjant Singh, varun Kumar, Armaan Qureshi, Dipsan Tirkey, Nilkanta Sharma and goalkeeper Suraj Karkera ‚Äì who made their international debut. India lost its first two matches against Olympic silver medallists ‚Äì Belgium but they could draw solace from the fact that the team comprised of nine players who were a part of the winning 2016 junior world cup team. The team had managed to impress with their defence but was found wanting in attack.

After making some changes, India took on Netherlands in the Robo Cup where they surprised the opposition team with their attacking skills. Gurjant scored his first international goal for the senior team with a reverse shot high into the net off a rebound. This is the most potent weapon in his armoury that is soon going to make Gurjant one of the most feared players in the opposition‚Äôs striking circle. Varun and Armaan too impressed with their skills, they alongwith Mandeep Singh have now added more depth to the Indian attack.

India‚Äôs consecutive wins against Netherlands are also significant because the Dutch had decimated the Germans 7-1 a week ago. In the final game against Austria, India led 3-1 at the start of the final quarter but frittered away the advantage. The score line read 3-3 with a minute to go and it was almost certain that the honours will be evenly divided. But India put up a spirited performance till the end resulting in Chinglensena‚Äôs deflection off a Gurjant cross-hit that found the back of the net with seconds to go in the match.

The investment on youth pays off for India as the team finish on a high in the tour of Europe.

One must commend Hockey India‚Äôs policy of giving exposure to young players which is crucial for the senior side‚Äôs aim of a podium-finish at the 2020 Olympic Games."

Australia recall Faulkner, Coulter-Nile for India tour

Australia have recalled all-rounder James Faulkner and pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile for their upcoming tour of India. While Faulkner makes his way back to the ODI squad, Coulter-Nile finds a place in squads of both the limited-overs formats. The T20I squad also includes uncapped left-arm pacer Jason Beherendorff, who averages 19.47 for his 53 scalps in 38 T20s.

Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc, meanwhile, continues his recovery from an injury to his right foot away from the game. The spearhead of Australia's bowling attack sustained the injury midway through Australia's Test tour of India early this year. He played the Champions Trophy but has been given more time to return to his best.

With the upcoming Ashes series in mind, Starc has not been included in Australia's two-Test tour of Bangladesh (starting from August 27) as well as the India tour.

Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley explained that that the fast bowler's recovery has been slower than expected: ""We have recently reviewed the progress of Mitchell's right foot injury and the healing process has been slower than we would have liked.""

""Consequently, in order to ensure his best possible preparation for the Ashes, he will be unavailable for the Tour of India and will continue his rehab in Australia with an aim to have him play for New South Wales in the domestic one-day cup.""

Australia are scheduled to play five ODIs and three T20Is in India during the months of September and October this year.

ODI squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood, Ashton Agar, Hilton Cartwright, Adam Zampa T20I squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Jason Behrendorff, Daniel Christian, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Glenn Maxwell, Tim Paine, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa

After constantly being laid low by injuries, Coulter-Nile found success while representing Kolkata Knight Riders during IPL 2017. The fast bowler, who bagged 15 wickets in eight games for KKR, is expected to make a big impression during the India tour. Cricket Australia selector Trevor Hohns talked up Coulter-Nile's return while also praising all-rounder Faulkner's familiarity with the sub-continent.

""Nathan brings raw pace to the side with good variation. It is great to see him back from injury and we are hopeful he will have a big impact in this series. ""James Faulkner is a solid One-Day campaigner and is very familiar with sub-continent conditions, coming off a very good tour of Sri Lanka last year. We hope that he will take his chance in returning to the one-day side,"" Hohns said.

Cricket Australia have also invested some amount of faith in Western Australia all-rounder Hilton Cartwright, picking him in both the squads. Cartwright, who made his Test debut for Australia earlier this year, comes with the reputation of being a big-hitter and is expected to slot into the shorter format with ease.

""Hilton is an aggressive striker of the ball and we think his game will be well suited to the transition to short-form cricket,"" Hohns opined.

While wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine has kept his T20I spot despite poor outings with the bat during the home series against Sri Lanka in February, all-rounder Daniel Christan braces himself for a return to the national side after more than three years.

Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now ¬© Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

‚Äò7 Sins of India‚Äô ‚Äì this Chinese video on Doklam is 70 kinds of funny,"Indian television news content is often criticized for being over the top. Moderators are criticized for their histrionics. The absence of reason is mourned, as is the resemblance of programming to government propaganda. But a new Xinhua video suggests that even in this game China has India beat.

Streamed on New China TV, the official YouTube channel of Xinhua news agency, which is the official press agency of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the video features a pulchritudinous female anchor throwing peculiar new light on the Doklam standoff, topped by a faux hirsute faux Indian making a fool of himself backed by a full supply of canned laughter.

The script is pretty hilarious actually. It‚Äôs not clear to me if the scriptwriters are really taking the mickey out of India or sort of subtly subverting their own scriptmasters as well.

I have recorded the script below, with the hope that in something like the august tradition of rap battles, someone out there is going to put together a classy rejoinder:

Anchor: It‚Äôs been two months since Indian troops illegally crossed the China-India boundary but so far India has shown no sign of withdrawal at all.

When the whole world is trying to wake India up from its impulse China‚Äôs realized it‚Äôs impossible to wake a guy who is pretending to be asleep.

Faux Indian: Nobody is blaming me because I‚Äôm asleeeeep. (Snoring)

Anchor: Fine fine ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs now take a look at what India has done during these two months which in a nutshell is regarded as the 7 Sins.

No 1: Trespassing

On June 18 Indian border troops carrying weapons and driving bulldozers illegally crossed the delimited boundary into the UNDISPUTED Chinese territory.

Yeah you heard it right, driving bulldozers straight into your house without even knocking at the door. What kind of neighbor would that be?

No 2: Violating bilateral convention

No 3: Trampling international law

You may think Doklam is a disputed area but the truth is both India and the international community have recognized the place as a part of China according to the 1890 convention between Great Britain and China relating to Sikkim and Tibet. And the thing is this exact convention is part of international law.

Didn‚Äôt your mama tell you never break the law!

No 4: Confusing and wrong

No 5: Putting blame on victim

This is kind of funny. India has been inventing various excuses to whitewash its illegal move. But first of all you‚Äôve got to make sure your excuses can hold water dude!

India‚Äôs argued that China‚Äôs building of roads would represent ‚Äúsignificant change of status quo ‚Ä¶ with serious security implications for India‚Äù. Would you go and take it up when your neighbor‚Äôs building a path in his garden?

Faux Indian: He‚Äôs building a path in his garden! I‚Äôm in DANGER!!

No 6: Hijacking small neighbor

Well this is most outrageous. We thought India would have been wiser after the first stupid excuse. But this time it attempted to justify its incursion in the name of ‚Äúprotecting Bhutan‚Äù.

Faux Indian: Don‚Äôt move ‚Äì this is Bhutan‚Äôs home. I‚Äôm here protecting it.

Faux Bhutanese: (with the faux Indian waving a knife at him) No not my home.

Anchor: The Bhutanese authorities have clearly told Chinese officials that Doklam is not Bhutanese territory and they are also confused by India‚Äôs behavior.

Well I‚Äôm just wondering, how does it feel shooting yourself in the foot?

No 7: Sticking to mistake knowingly

China has a strong will to solve the problem peacefully ‚Äì with the prerequisite of India‚Äôs withdrawal of course.

However India is so thick-skinned that it is on the one hand crying for talk but on the other hand refusing to withdraw.

Have you ever negotiated with a robber who had just broken into your home and refused to leave? (Nooo) You call 911 or just fight him back, right?

Faux Indian: Why call 911? Don‚Äôt you want to play house bro?

Anchor: If you really want to play, get out of my house first. (Shaking her finger)"

"Barcelona Attack: Spanish Police Gun Down Five Terror Suspects, Foiled 'Bomb Plot'","The Spanish security agencies have gunned down five terror suspects after a terror attack in the busy walkway in central Barcelona. Thirteen people were killed and 100 were injured, 15 of them seriously, in what authorities called a terror attack.

afp

""It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,"" Josep Lluis Trapero, a senior police official for Spain's Catalonia region told reporters late Thursday.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, saying in a statement on its Aamaq news agency that the attack was carried out by ""soldiers of the Islamic State"" in response to the extremist group's calls for followers to target countries participating in the coalition trying to drive it from Syria and Iraq.

afp

According to AP report, Catalan police said they shot and killed five suspects in a seaside resort town south of Barcelona in response to a terrorist attack. They also said six civilians were injured in Cambrils but didn't immediately say how. The force is working on the theory that the Cambrils suspects are linked to the Barcelona attack, as well as to a Wednesday night explosion in the town of Alcanar in which one person was killed.

afp

After the afternoon attack, Las Ramblas went into lockdown. Swarms of officers brandishing hand guns and automatic weapons launched a manhunt in the downtown district, ordering stores and cafes and public transport to shut down.

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‚Äònationalist‚Äô mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India‚Äôs ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism‚Äôs about freedom for the mind and democracy‚Äôs about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It‚Äôs time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar‚Äôs vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP‚Äôs madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don‚Äôt these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‚Äòsabka saath sabka vikas‚Äô in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‚Äògolf-playing Macaulayputra‚Äô, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities ‚Äì of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation ‚Äì feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn‚Äôt call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that‚Äôs why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler‚Äôs supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent‚Äôs ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That‚Äôs because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other‚Äôs shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It‚Äôs really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That‚Äôs why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament ‚Äì the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet ‚Äì the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism‚Äôs unobtrusive ‚Äòsoft power‚Äô, one that‚Äôs created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It‚Äôs time to change the goal of ‚ÄòHindu Rashtra‚Äô to the more inclusive ‚ÄòIndian Rashtra.‚Äô The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

"11 Reasons Why The Japanese Are Healthier, Fitter And Live Longer Than The Rest Of Us","It‚Äôs a question, which has been thrown around for quite some time now; how do the rice eating Japanese (including other countries in East Asia) stay healthier than the rest of the world?

hudsongrovepm.com

While health and fitness experts have been making outrages claims for some time now traditional practices and habits of Asian cultures is what makes them healthier than the rest. These are some the rules they live by:

They take unprocessed food out of the equation

enechange.jp

Several elementary schools in Japan serve mid-day meals that made from organically grown local foods, which leaves very little options for children to eat anything otherwise. Inculcating such healthy habits at home further changes their families mind set towards eating.

They choose rice over wheat

olagiatopaidi.gr

Studies suggest that rice intake is also associated with lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease while wheat flour increases it. It also typically free of gut irritants, phytic acid and lectins, which is useful since most people are gluten intolerant. They have it in moderation though since carbs like rice convert to sugar in your body and create sugar spikes, which can be dangerous especially if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic.

They use smaller plates, which results in smaller portion sizes

comorie.nifty.com

The Japanese curtail not just their food servings, but also the size of their plates. Use the side plates that you use to eat salads, and bread with to have your main meals, which are about four-to-six inches in diameter.

They eat fewer calories with every bite they take

iberitaupdate.blogspot.in

The idea is to combine a decent amount of foods that are lower in caloric density. For instance, typical Japanese meals include rice, a modest portion of meat or fish, and a couple of vegetable dishes. The idea is not to start preparing their cuisine but to include higher quantities of whole foods, and more fruits and vegetables, and cut down processed foods that have more ‚Äòcalories per bite‚Äô.

They snack mindfully

hellosehat.com

Teach your children to enjoy the treats and snacks, but in the right frequency and amount; like the Japanese who eat in smaller quantities and lesser frequencies. They exercise what is known as ‚Äòflexible restraint‚Äô when it comes to consuming unhealthy food.

They eat seafood every day

tourprom.ru

Apart from the protein and nutrition the biggest benefit you get from the daily consumption of seafood like fish. It keeps the level of omega 3 to omega 6 in check, which has an anti-inflammatory effect on your body, helping keep the prevalence of chronic disease at bay.

They‚Äôve made seaweed a staple in their diet

bbcgoodfood.com

A report from the U.N. states that Japan consumes about 1,00,000 tons of seaweed a year as they add it to their main meals as well as snack on it. A cup of seaweed packs anywhere between 2 to 9 grams of protein, more potassium than a banana and is also a natural source of iodine (much more reliable than adding it to salt), which is useful in regulating your thyroid.

They stack up on a lot of fermented food

kind-eats.com

Japanese cuisine is loaded with fermented foods such as miso, soy, natto, tempeh and soy sauce (of which an average person consumes 1.8 gallons per year!). Eating fermented food has several health benefits a couple of key ones being strengthening your immune system and easing digestion that you can get just by including a few servings a week.

Most of the tea they consume is green

limia.jp

Japan ranks amongst the top ten nations in the world that consume green tea as most of the tea they consume is green. Green tea is loaded with antioxidants, which helps boosts your defence against cancer. It also reduces your risk of heart disease and even increases cognitive function. A study also claims that citizens who drank 5 cups of green tea a day a 26 percent lower mortality rate.

They make physical activity a religious part of their daily activity

edition.cnn.com

The Japanese live a very active lifestyle since childhood. In fact, according to the World Health Organisation, more than 98 percent of Japanese children walk or bike to school. This statistic only proves that Japanese children probably get in the recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity just by going to school and back.

They maintained squatter-styled toilets

introvertjapan.com

Unlike other cultures and countries, including ours, the Japanese use toilets, which require you to get into a deep squat. Squatting while crapping has several benefits over using a western-style toilet, such as loosening and limbering up your limbs as well as emptying your bowels completely (50 seconds on an average) three times as fast as it would take you on a western toilet.

Their medical system relies heavily on prevention over cure

baomoi.com

While countries across the globe have adopted a medical system that‚Äôs quick to jump to using antacids, antibiotics and NSAIDs the Japanese still inculcate heavy use of their ancient medical systems that attempt to get to the root of the problem by using healthy habits, herbs and prevention practices. That‚Äôs why meditation, martial arts and other calming rituals that strike a balance between their mind, body and spirit are still an integral part of their culture."

How to help bankrupt realtor‚Äôs customers,"Insolvency proceedings against debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech have left over 30,000 home buyers in the lurch. They need more than state sympathy. Home buyers have been advised to file a claim with the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal. However, as unsecured claimants, home buyers have limited rights under the bankruptcy code. They are akin to customers who have placed orders and paid advances to a manufacturing company that goes under liquidation. In the pecking order of rights, the code allows the proceeds from the sale of assets to be distributed to secured lenders (read: banks), to pay off workmen‚Äôs dues for a period of 24 months before the liquidation commencement date, to pay wages and any unpaid dues owed to employees other than workmen, and to clear financial debts owed to unsecured creditors.

How can home buyers who have made payment in full or in part be given their homes? The assets now belong to the banks. If the liquidation proceeds are large enough to pay off secured creditors and employees and still have enough left over to repay home buyers their infructuous advances, well and good. Suppose that is not the case. What incentive do the banks or the IRP have to invest fresh funds to complete the construction of homes, payments for which have gone to the bankrupt firm and will not come to the new owner?

Why should banks part with assets that they have taken possession of under the law, to recover their unpaid dues? Bankers are unlikely to be moved by home buyers‚Äô tears: the CBI might raid them for causing an avoidable loss.

There is one way out: raise the floor area ratio for the project, build and sell additional homes to generate the funds needed to complete stalled construction."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man‚Ä¶ actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man‚Ä¶ wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: ‚ÄúThis is fine and all but ultimately useless. What‚Äôs the point of all this socialism? Wasn‚Äôt it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.‚Äù

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP‚Äôs martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
Blue Whale Strikes Again! Two Kerala Families Say Their Sons Committed Suicide After Playing The Game,"The deadly online challenge game, which is spreading like wildfire appears to have claimed more victim in India than what is already been reported. With the news about the deadly game making headlines now more and more people have come forward expressing doubts about the deaths of their family members.

Two new suspected cases of Blue Whale deaths have now surfaced from Kerala.

In the first case, the family of Manoj C Manu, a teenager from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram who committed suicide last month has now approached police claiming that they doubt the role of the game in his death.

In their complaint, the family said Manoj who was a class XI student had downloaded the game nine months ago and had been addicted to it since.

Manoj C Manu/ Facebook

His mother Anu told a Malayalam news channel that she had talked him out of it. But with the recent reports of the Blue Whale challenge, she said Manoj's behaviour was similar to those killed themselves playing the dare game.

She claimed that Manoj, who never used to go out alone had visited a beach by himself, jumped into a river despite not knowing how to swim and even used to visit a cemetery.

Manoj was found hanging at his home on July 26.

Police who had earlier registered a case of unnatural death said they will look into the possibility, but expressed doubts as Manoj had hung himself, whereas, in all the other reported cases of deaths or attempts to kill themselves, the gamers had jumped off buildings.

Another similar case has surfaced from Kannur, where an IIT student named Sawant killed himself last month.

According to Swanta's mother her son used to spent the whole night playing the game on his phone and frequently used to venture out from home at night only to return in the morning.

After he began hurting himself and inscribing letters on his body using a compass, Swant's family who thought he had mental issues had taken him for counselling.

He committed suicide last month by hanging himself.

While the links to the two deaths and the challenge game is yet to be established, this is not the first such report from Kerala. After it was reported that two teenagers ventured into a beach in Alappuzha under suspicious circumstances, the Kerala government had urged the central government to ban the game.

The Central government has already directed internet companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft to remove links to the game from their services.

So far, there is one confirmed case of Blue Whale death in India, a 14-year-old Mumbai boy who killed himself playing the game.

There have been a number of reports attempted suicides from many parts of the country since.

The Blue Whale is a challenge based game developed by some Russian programmers. It is said to be involving daily challenges for the gamers from daring to risky. Some of them include watching horror movies alone to hurting themselves.

In the 50th level, it is said that the participants are challenged to attempt suicide. In all the stages, the participant is asked to make a video of the challenge.

The administrator whom the player is in contact is said to emotionally blackmail the player to complete the challenge."
Narendra Modi‚Äôs Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of d√©j√† vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government‚Äôs apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India‚Äôs total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg ‚Äî Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government‚Äôs achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi‚Äôs intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015‚Äì16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016‚Äì17 as per reports.

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 ‚Äì a promise prominently mentioned in BJP‚Äôs 2014 manifesto."
Redefining party building: Amit Shah is leading BJP with courage of conviction,"On the evening of Narendra Modi‚Äôs swearing in as prime minister, Amit Shah was in the audience sitting next to a leader of a BJP ally. The alliance party leader informally enquired about Amit Shah‚Äôs chances of becoming party chief and said it would be a welcome development. Amit Shah politely remarked, tongue in cheek, that the latter‚Äôs joy may be short lived as in the event of his taking over, BJP may not part with so many seats. The ally leader was stumped by his candour.

Political scientist Rajni Kothari had famously defined what he termed the Congress system of party building. Pointing out the strength of Congress in the late seventies he rightly observed, ‚ÄúCongress is still, and is likely to be for a long time, the most organised political party in the country, with a nationwide following and considerable depth in the localities.‚Äù Ironically, today‚Äôs Congress seems to have squandered all that it had earned. And it is BJP that has emerged as the most organised party with pan-India following and presence in localities.

In fact, that rightly sums up the work of BJP chief Amit Shah. He has, through unrelenting efforts, converted the ‚Äònationwide following‚Äô of Prime Minister Narendra Modi into ‚Äòconsiderable depth in the localities‚Äô. For any objective political analyst, Shah‚Äôs work presents a case study of party building.

When Shah took over in August 2014, BJP was in power in just a handful of states. Today, it has its own chief ministers in 13 states and is a partner in another five states. Its membership has increased from three crores to 11 crores. It has the largest number of MLAs and MPs as well. Even in Rajya Sabha, BJP is now the top party. To have achieved this in a span of barely three years is unparalleled and historic.

Through his presidency, Shah has ensured that party cadre remain engaged in one meaningful activity after the other. In the past two years BJP has conducted thousands of training programmes involving over ten lakh party workers. Many of these trained human resources are now engaged in grassroots party work as vistaraks, with their eyes set on party consolidation at the booth level. Over 4000 workers, dedicating six months to a year away from the cosy comforts of their homes, are engaged in this all over the country.

Shah believes in setting an example through his own untiring efforts. During the last few months, he has spent over 60 days undertaking systematic organisational tours to states across the country. On these tours he interacts with all functionaries, seeks feedback from booth level workers, meets all elected representatives, breaks bread with artists and writers, listens to social media enthusiasts and engages in question-answer sessions, thereby establishing a powerful connect.

Shah richly deserves credit for institutionalising party functioning. He has established an integrated chain of party meetings. Its national executive meets every quarter followed by state, district and taluka executives, ensuring a seamless flow of message from the top and feedback from the ground. Also, from Policy Research to Party Literature and Good Governance to Party Programmes, he has created 19 party departments with a clear functional mandate.

Besides, he is out to change the very culture of party mobilisation. He wants party workers to be sensitive to the agonies of the underprivileged and aspirations of all. In order to further sensitise party workers, he has also asked party units to undertake some ten projects, three of which have a clear social content.

What is remarkable is his clear vision. He understands very well the importance of groundswell of goodwill, public trust and support earned by Modi. He knows these are the best of times to build upon this capital. Setting up well equipped party offices at every district with a library and e-library, containing rich collection of books, is a key item on his agenda.

Felicitating Shah on his Rajya Sabha election, Modi pointed out that to galvanise party organisation when the party is in power is extremely difficult. But difficulties have never deterred Shah. In his view ‚Äúelectoral success is important, but remember we are not an election winning machine. We are a party with a mission, a mission of reconstructing a great India.‚Äù"

Manipur shows how to improve health measures in the face of huge challenges,"The tragic events in Gorakhpur showed up India‚Äôs poor capability of meaningfully improving health outcomes of its citizens. But all recent news on the healthcare front has not been negative. Manipur, a state often torn apart by internal divisions, has provided a reason for optimism

The latest data on infant mortality rate showed that Manipur, along with Goa, recorded the lowest infant mortality rate in India. Goa is among India‚Äôs most developed states and one of the richest in terms of per capita income. Its impressive performance, therefore, does not come as a surprise. It is Manipur‚Äôs performance that is remarkable.

First, why is infant mortality rate (IMR) important? The following explanation by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention provides the answer.

‚ÄúThe death of a baby before his or her first birthday is called infant mortality. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths that occur for every 1,000 live births. This rate is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a nation, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants.‚Äù

A look at the data showed that Manipur‚Äôs IMR is 9, while Kerala, a benchmark for health indicators, had a mortality rate of 12.

The most impressive aspect of Manipur‚Äôs performance is that it has consistently lowered its IMR over the last three years, while some states have states such as Bihar or Uttarakhand have stagnated or slipped.

Manipur‚Äôs performance in IMR deserves a lot more attention and study. It is unique because it‚Äôs far better than its neighbor, Mizoram. This suggests that the cause for the impressive performance is state-specific rather than being broadly region-specific.

One explanation which has been offered in the past links the state‚Äôs performance to the status of women in society. According to this explanation, Manipur‚Äôs women have relatively more freedom and decision making powers which translates into better choices in this area.

Whatever the reasons, Manipur‚Äôs performance should inspire other states."
Is Corporate Governance a mere mirage,"The proposal for approval of appointment of Mr. Deepak Kapoor, former Chairman of Pricewaterhousecoopers India (pwc) as an Independent Director of Tata Steel had already come in from severe criticism from no less than Mr. J.N. Gupta, former Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Mr. Gupta was quoted saying that, ‚ÄúIn our advisory note, we have asked shareholders to reject either of the appointment as there seems to be a conflict of interest if both proposals go through at once. Kapoor will disqualify as an independent director under section 149(6) of the Companies Act, if PwC is appointed as its auditor.‚Äù Mr. Gupta, further said that both Kapoor and PwC‚Äôs appointments together ‚Äúdoes not reflect good governance practice by the Tatas.‚Äù The ‚Äúmere presence‚Äù of Kapoor on the board of Tata Steel ‚Äúmay have an adverse impact on the audit process and may give rise to ethical issues,‚Äù he had added.

Yet, the appointment of Mr. Deepak Kapoor was approved in the annual general meeting (AGM) of Tata Steel held on August 8, 2017. In the same AGM, the appointment of Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP (Audit firm) was also approved. Is it conceivable that TATAs, known for their high ‚Äúvalue systems‚Äù, grossly erred in making the two appointments ? The facts, unfortunately, suggest so.

As per the Notice of AGM, Mr. Kapoor met the criteria for independence as provided for in Section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 and had also given a declaration to that effect. Is it possible that Mr. Deepak Kapoor gave a wrong declaration to Tata Steel ?

The real question boils down to whether provisions of Section 149(6)(e)(ii) were violated. This section provides, amongst others, that an Independent Director shall mean such a person who, neither himself nor any of his relatives is or has been an employee or proprietor or a partner, in any of the three financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which he is proposed to be appointed of a firm of auditors or company secretaries in practice or cost auditors of the company or its holding, subsidiary or associate company. The intention behind this disqualification is extremely important and abundantly clear : no person, who or whose relatives were employed by the auditors of the company during the last 3 years could be appointed as its Independent Director. Cooling period of 3 years was stipulated to avoid any potential conflict of interest.

Before I analyse any further, I must put a caveat; the analysis is as per my understanding of the law, is meant purely for the larger public interest and is not in any way whatsoever meant to reflect on the competence or otherwise of any individual or entity involved. A technical correction must also be made. The Audit firm appointed in the AGM is not Pwc but Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP. The legal distinction needs to be appreciated.

Deepak Kapoor had been with Pwc India for 30 years and had initially served as an Audit partner. He went on to serve as the Chairman of Pwc India from 1st January 2011 upto 31 December 2016. Prior to this, he had served as the Managing Director of Pwc India for nearly 4 years since February 2007. The vital questions which arise are that what is Pwc India comprised of and what was Mr. Kapoor‚Äôs authority and control over its different constituents?

For the benefit of everyone, Pwc India refers to the network of a private limited company by the name of Pricewaterhousecoopers Private Limited (pwcpl) that renders Advisory services and more than 10-12 audit firms. All these supposedly separate legal entities use the same brand name, i.e., Pwc. It needs no emphasis that by being at the helm of affairs of Pwc India for nearly 12 years Mr. Deepak Kapoor had significant influence and control over the entire network including all the audit firms, including the one appointed as the Auditor of Tata Steel in the said AGM, although he was on the rolls of Pwcpl only.

SEBI‚Äôs regulations for Independent Directors are still wider. Even a material supplier, service provider, lessor or lessee to the company, irrespective of the value involved, is disqualified from being appointed as an Independent Director of the Company.

The intention of the lawmakers while formulating the law is invariably considered by the Courts to arrive at the right interpretation for any specific provision. The lawmakers probably thought that they have extensively and elaborately covered all situations that could result in conflict of interest. Apparently, they under-estimated or overlooked the ingenuity of some. What the Pwc India network stands for may not be known to all. However, Mr. Kapoor surely knew all about it. Did he make adequate and comprehensive disclosures to the Tata Steel Board ?

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 states, amongst others, that an Independent Director shall uphold ethical standards of integrity and probity, refrain from taking any action that would lead to loss of his independence, must immediately inform the Board where circumstances arise which would make him lose his independence and assist the company in implementing best corporate governance practices. How has Mr. Deepak Kapoor fared on these parameters is best left to be adjudged by the public and the Regulators.

The intention of the law makers and the spirit of the law is further reinforced in the Rules under the Act for the rotation of Auditors. The said rules clearly state that ‚Äúsame network‚Äù includes the firms operating or functioning hitherto or in future under the same brand name, trade name or common control.

It is abundantly clear from the above that Mr. Deepak Kapoor was ineligible for appointment as the Independent Director of Tata Steel.

Tata Steel‚Äôs Chairman, Mr. N Chandrasekaran, while defending Kapoor‚Äôs appointment, was quoted by the media saying that Kapoor will not be inducted into the audit committee till the cooling period is over. Was Mr. Chandrasekaran not briefed properly that the embargo on the appointment of Deepak Kapoor extended to the past 3 years and not even a year had expired !

Corporate governance is going beyond the letter and mandate of the law. Adherence to best practices should not only be claimed but be demonstrated. Did the venerable house of TATAs violate the letter and the spirit of the law on two counts ? Are these the standards of Corporate Governance that we can be proud of ? Will this not set a bad and dangerous precedent to the detriment of public interest ? Will SEBI ensure immediate remedial action ? Will we ever get the answers. But one thing is clear. Public some janti hai !"
Bullying madrasas to celebrate Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic,"Inbound VP Venkaiah Naidu has disagreed with outbound VP Hamid Ansari over ‚Äúa feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity‚Äù creeping in among the minorities in India. Naidu says this kind of talk is just political propaganda. He says ‚Äúcompared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due.‚Äù Perhaps the disagreement is over what exactly is ‚Äútheir due‚Äù. Selective food bans, anti-conversion and ghar wapsi crusades, vigilantism and ‚Äòbeef‚Äô lynchings?

Priti Gandhi, national executive member of the BJP Mahila Morcha, has a more aggressive challenge for Ansari: ‚ÄúFor 10 years my Hindu majority nation accepted you with open arms, placed you at the pinnacle of power and you still feel uneasy. Agenda kya hai?‚Äù Perhaps the agenda is educating the ‚ÄúHindu majority‚Äù about how its condescension is neither fair nor merited. How dare you expect minorities to act as supplicants or servile? Listen up your citizenship is not of a higher order.

In its very first year the Modi government had caused a great upset by declaring Christmas Day as Good Governance Day. This year it selected Good Friday as Digital India Day. It‚Äôs true that India‚Äôs religious calendar is very crowded but it‚Äôs also true that Diwali hasn‚Äôt been declared Ujjwala Bharat Diwas for which maybe all schools and government offices could stay open. Holi also remains a holiday. The discrimination is manifest.

And now even Independence Day is being sullied. In Uttar Pradesh state-aided madrassas have been told to submit video footage of Independence Day functions to minority welfare officers in all districts of the state. Going back to Ansari‚Äôs point, surely this kind of blatant targeting is cause for ‚Äúa feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity‚Äù among the minorities. The show of distrust can hardly engender trust.

BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has said with a tellingly raw crudeness, ‚ÄúAt a time when the spectre of radical Islam is a threat to the community, Muslims should welcome the move rather than place religion over nation. Respect for national symbols is non-negotiable.‚Äù This is such a shamelessly majoritarian party line. Telling Muslims what they should feel (grateful). Setting ‚Äúnon-negotiable‚Äù conditions for their Indianness. And of course using the spectre of radical Islam to try to push the minority into a meek corner. But bullying someone into celebrating Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic. It kind of rubs in an absence of freedoms. And that is sound reason for ‚Äúa feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity‚Äù."

Vaghela‚Äôs exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I‚Äôll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat‚Äôs culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela‚Äôs exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That‚Äôs not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva‚Äôs supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‚ÄòIndians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva‚Äô.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‚Äòstrongmen‚Äô type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh‚Äôs CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi‚Äôs criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party‚Äôs leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won‚Äôt and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‚ÄòRam Janmabhoomi‚Äô). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‚ÄòUniform Civil Code‚Äô). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‚ÄòArticle 370‚Äô).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‚Äòcattle slaughter ban‚Äô). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don‚Äôt stand for something, you‚Äôll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."

Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India‚Äôs current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country‚Äôs stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers‚Äô productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."
Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here‚Äôs How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let‚Äôs learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let‚Äôs say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here‚Äôs how you can too:

The I-Can‚Äôt-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it‚Äôs with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it‚Äôs got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it‚Äôs got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what‚Äôs on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don‚Äôt vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that‚Äôs etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn‚Äôt? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera ‚Äì one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

OPPO F3

NASA Predicts That A 4 Kilometer Wide Asteroid Will Zip Past Earth On 1 September,"Asteroids are whizzing past Earth all the time, though they don‚Äôt come too close to hitting us. NASA has now predicted another fly by the incident to occur next month, but it‚Äôs slightly different.

For one thing, the space agency is saying the rock that‚Äôll hurtle past us is the largest near-Earth object (NEO) we‚Äôve seen since we began tracking them 20 years ago.

Measuring 4.4 km across, asteroid Florence, as it‚Äôs called, is more than large enough to cause massive destruction, were it to hit Earth. Even the 20 m wide Chelyabinsk meteorite that made contact in 2013 wrought havoc, and any object larger than 1 km impacting Earth could cause a global extinction. And NASA has tracked over 880 such NEOs in our vicinity.

But, though asteroid Florence is about making its closest pass of Earth at a distance of 7 million km, the space agency there‚Äôs no chance of a collision anytime in the next 500 years.

‚ÄúWhile many known asteroids have passed by closer to Earth than Florence will on September 1, all of those were estimated to be smaller,‚Äù says Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). ‚ÄúFlorence is the largest asteroid to pass by our planet this close since the NASA program to detect and track near-Earth asteroids began.‚Äù

The rock will zip past our planet on September 1, and will be visible to small telescopes for a few nights from late August to early September.

""It is a blessing in disguise for both Pujara and Ashwin because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year"" - MSK Prasad ¬© Getty

Ravichandran Ashwin, the spearhead of the Indian attack, is set to play for the Division 2 County side Worcestershire for the rest of the Championship season. He is expected to make his County debut against Gloucestershire at New Road in Division Two on August 28. Australia fast bowler John Hastings, who represents Worcestershire in the County circuit, was ruled out of the remainder of the season with a foot injury, and Ashwin slots in as a replacement for him.

""Ravi is a fantastic international cricketer who is currently in terrific form with his game,"" Steve Rhodes, the County's Director of Cricket, said.

""He is ranked in the top three as a bowler in Test cricket, is a wonderful all-rounder who can bat six and scores hundreds in Test cricket.

""It is unlucky for John Hastings with his injury but Ravi is a wonderful cricketer for us to have at a crucial point in our season.

""It is a really important last few games for the club and to have someone of his ilk and class and quality is a huge boost for the Club. The good thing about Ravi is he has been successful on all types of pitches in all sorts of different continents. He is a class bowler who will bowl well here,"" Rhodes added.

The off-spinner, with 292 Test wickets to his name, hasn't yet played domestic cricket in England. However, the ace spinner has now received the green signal from the board to represent Worcestershire in County cricket after the selectors decided to rest him for the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

Worcestershire still have four Division 2 matches left during the County season. So the veteran all-rounder could miss out on the upcoming ODI series against Australia scheduled to start on September 17 as he looks to acclimatise to the English conditions ahead of the Test series against England next year.

Meanwhile, Chesteshwar Pujara is also set to return to the Second Division County side, Nottinghamshire. The middle-order batsman has already scored 232 runs at an average of 44.60 for the County side this season. After playing the first half of the season, he was called up for national duty for the just-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka.

Both Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire are eyeing a promotion to Division One. Nottinghamshire have 184 points from 10 matches and are placed at the top of the table. On the other hand, Worcestershire have slotted in at second position with 149 points. Worcestershire last played in Division One in 2015 when they were relegated after ending the season as the bottom-placed team with 151 points.

""It is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year,"" MSK Prasad, the chairman of selectors said.

""It is always good to play and get that first hand feel of the conditions. From a selection point of view they have been rested first and then they have been given consent by the BCCI to go and play county cricket,"" he added.

Ashwin, in all likelihood, will play against his Indian team-mate, Pujara, when the Midlands County take on Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on September 5. Worcestershire are also slated to play against Leicestershire and Durham.

Nawab of Pataudi sr. (33 matches), Kapil Dev and Zaheer Khan (16 matches) are some of the famous Indian cricketers who have played for Worcestershire. Zaheer, the wily seamer, had a successful time at Worcestershire, bagging 78 first-class wickets for the County.

There were also reports that experienced pacer Ishant Sharma too was to ply his trade in England, turning out for Warwickshire. The fast bowler, however, clarified on Twitter that he hasn't penned a contract with any County side. Warwickshire also have Jeetan Patel as their foreign player and were unlikely to sign up Ishant.

Contrary to the news rounds through various sites, have not signed Warwickshire or any other county. ‚Äî Ishant Sharma (@ImIshant) August 14, 2017

Chawla joins Ranji champions Gujarat for 2017-18 season

""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move"" - Chawla ¬© Getty

Piyush Chawla has ended his long-term association with Uttar Pradesh cricket in order to represent Gujarat in the upcoming first-class season, the legspinner confirmed to Sportstar. ""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move,"" Chawla said on Wednesday (August 16).

Chawla, who picked up 226 wickets in 80 first-class matches for UP over a period of almost 12 years, will now bolster the defending champions' bowling line-up which already consists the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and RP Singh, who also made the same move two years ago. It is to be noted that Chawla featured in only two Ranji games last season after getting sidelined for a major period with an injury.

The 28-year-old made his Test debut for India way back in 2006 but has since then managed to add only two more caps with his last appearance in the format coming almost five years back. With the BCCI reverting to the home-away format for the Ranji this season, the legspinner has observed the lack of help for spinners from the surfaces in UP as the main reason behind his move. ""The kind of wickets you get in the Western region which has a red soil layering help the spinners better,"" Chawla pointed out.

""When I play in Uttar Pradesh, the wickets are either seaming tracks or flat ones. That's how the weather is. So, it was time to make a move to a state where I can bowl much better and get wickets.""

Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel had a role to play in the move, according to Chawla's own admission. ""A couple of years ago, when UP toured Gujarat for a match, I saw the wicket was a turner, and it was helping the spinners,"" he recalled. ""So I had told Parthiv, 'If I ever think of making a move, please keep your options open for me.'

""Last year, I only played a couple of matches for UP as I was injured. I couldn't play much, and only participated in one-dayers and T20s, because in the second game of the Ranji Trophy itself, I was injured. So, this year I was mulling a change. I spoke to Parthiv and told him about my plans. He and the officials at the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) were happy with the move. I am thankful to them that they welcomed me,"" he added.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers,"By Neeraj Kaushal

Steve Jobs, it is said, advised President Barack Obama that colleges in the US should staple green cards to the diplomas of graduating foreigners. Bill Gates made a similar recommendation in an article in The New York Times sometime back. Alas, President Donald Trump is unlikely to heed their advice. But the Indian government should.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges. India is more deficient in skilled workers, relative to its needs, than almost any major country. The most recent Manpower Talent Shortage Survey reported that almost two-thirds of Indian employers surveyed experienced difficulties in finding workers with required skills.

Expat‚Äôs Got Talent

The only other country where employers reported greater difficulties in finding required skills was Japan whose working-age population has been shrinking for a quarter century. Meanwhile, India is awaiting a demographic dividend, which requires substantial investments in education and training.

Let immigration policy not be an obstacle in attracting talent. It is likely that the welcome mat to foreign students will not immediately attract many from East Asia, Southeast Asia or Latin America. Our neighbours ‚ÄîBangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka ‚Äîwill be the most immediate source of talent. We should offer to give residency permits to graduating foreign students and skilled workers, including those from South Asia.

For security reasons, Pakistani students may have to be kept out. But we have the potential to make India a highly attractive place of learning and work to the most talented students from Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Initiatives to proactively recruit the best PhDs, Indian or foreign, in Indian universities would make them more attractive to foreign students.

We get a large number of African students, who prefer India to the US or Europe. They find Indian universities academically strong without being prohibitively expensive. But they face racism and discrimination simply account of the colour of their skin. The best of Africa are as good as the best of anywhere in the world. We have the potential to attract the best from Africa, train them for Indian needs, offer them permanent residency and a path to citizenship.

In western countries, a substantial proportion of scientists and skilled professionals are foreign-born. Switzerland tops the list with 57% of the scientists, working and studying, in the country being foreigners, according to the GlobSci Survey of 2011. The corresponding figure is 46% in Canada, 45% in Australia, 38% in the US, 33% in Britain, 23% in Germany, and 17% in France. The proportion of foreign scientists working or studying in India, in comparison, is negligible: less than 1%.

Critics would argue that liberal immigration of foreign talent would adversely affect Indian skilled workers. In 2000, similar sentiments sent domestic politics in Germany on fire with the ‚ÄòKinder statt Inder‚Äô (Children not Indians) slogan in response to the government‚Äôs policy to allow foreign-born computer specialists. Talent shortages continued, and five years later, the German government announced an even more liberal immigration policy.

Critics might also say that India has its own millions to educate. Why should it use its resources on foreigners? International scientists, professionals and entrepreneurs make the rich world rich. If India wants to get rich, it needs to create policies and build institutions that attract foreign talent to supplement its skill requirements. China also has its millions to educate. But it has recognised the importance of mobile foreign talent.

Going for the Skill

Its leaders openly acknowledge that the biggest obstacle to future growth in China is talent. For this reason, it has been aggressively wooing foreign talent and sending its own youth to acquire state-of-the art skills abroad. In 2008, the Chinese government announced the ‚Äòthousand-talents‚Äô programme.

Highly talented research scientists and entrepreneurs are lured to this programme from around the world. It has launched a China Green Card, a permit for permanent residency, for certain groups of skilled foreigners and Chinese expats in Shanghai and Beijing.

The contribution of foreigners in raising innovative potential and economic prosperity is most visible in the US, where one of every five doctors is foreign-born, as are two of every five medical scientists, one of every five computer specialists, one of every six persons in engineering or science occupations, one of every four astronomers, physicists, chemical and material scientists, and one of every six biological scientists.

Since 1990, academics associated with US institutions and universities have won close to 65% of all Nobel prizes in chemistry, medicine, economics and physics. But less than half of the recipients were born in the US. Many European countries have been trying, rather unsuccessfully, to compete with the US for foreign talent. This is an opportune moment for these countries to roll out the welcome mat to foreign talent.

Foreign students who feel harassed by the US Department of Homeland Security could move to other countries with more liberal immigration regimes. India should join the race and offer easy residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges.

Such a progressive, growth-oriented immigration policy goes well with the philosophy of ‚ÄòVasudhaiva kutumbakam‚Äô (the world is one family) laid out in the Upanishads.

Government must develop its ‚Äòhuman capital‚Äô akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here‚Äôs another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you‚Äôre in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‚Äògovernment capital‚Äô (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks ‚Äî including the policymakers ‚Äî must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind ‚Äî at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations ‚Äî prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn‚Äôt specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government‚Äôs business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one‚Äôs own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‚Äòown‚Äô its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI‚Äôs service, become ‚Äòhuman capital architects‚Äô by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.
