Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
"Bill Gates Invests In A Startup That Grows Meat In A Lab, Trying To Solve The World Food Crisis","Bill Gates has joined forced with Cargill Inc, one of the world’s largest agriculture corporations, and other major business, to invest in technology that endeavours to develop meat from self-producing animal cells.

Consumers are demanding more and more protein that’s less reliant on food, grazing land, and water than livestock, and the coalition believes the answer lies with San Francisco-based startup Memphis Meats.

Memphis Meats produces beef chicken, and duck meat directly from grown animal cells, completely bypassing the need to raise and slaughter poultry and cattle. The startup recently raised $17 million in funding from investors like Cargill, the world’s richest man Gates, and billionaire Richard Branson.

“I’m thrilled to have invested in Memphis Meats,” Branson said in an email in response to questions from Bloomberg News. “I believe that in 30 years or so we will no longer need to kill any animals and that all meat will either be clean or plant-based, taste the same and also be much healthier for everyone.”

The move is a response to increasing demand for meat that is organic, and more sustainable than current systems, as well as doesn’t involve cruelty to animals “The world loves to eat meat, and it is core to many of our cultures and traditions,” co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats Uma Valeti said in the statement. “The way conventional meat is produced today creates challenges for the environment, animal welfare and human health. These are problems that everyone wants to solve.”

Memphis Meats has so far raised a total of $22 million in funding.

Spare the taxpayer: Recapitalisation of public sector banks needs to come with governance reforms,"Financial results of public sector banks for April-June quarter show that they remain fragile. Collectively, they made a loss when their private sector peers turned in profits. This performance was not a one-off. Three years ago, a Reserve Bank of India committee concluded that government as shareholder has suffered negative returns over decades. If this situation prevails in public sector banking, a commercial endeavour, it is because successive governments are able to pass on losses to taxpayers. This cannot continue any longer.

NDA has promised to recapitalise its loss making banks and merge some of the weaker ones with sound banks. This is inadequate to deal with a systemic problem where banks flounder once every decade. Recapitalisation, therefore, must be accompanied by deeper banking reforms or else hapless taxpayers will soon be presented with another bailout bill. The primary cause for the current state of affairs is government’s majority stake in banks. This forces public sector banks to deal with an additional regulatory layer in the form of the finance ministry. This also leads to attendant problems such as banking heads with too short a tenure, low pay scales and fear of multiple investigators scrutinising commercial decisions in hope of unearthing ‘corruption’. A commercial enterprise cannot be run this way.

Around 17 years ago in an earlier NDA government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha proposed lowering government’s stake to 33% which would have removed some constraints public sector bankers work under. This would have provided bankers space to be more nimble and take timely decisions. It is time for current finance minister Arun Jaitley to actualise his predecessor’s plan. The government should also allow banks to rework their recruitment practices and pay scales as they need to attract the best talent in the job market."
Seeing rail safety as a systemic factor,"Yet another rail accident points to the pressing need to revisit the issue of safety from an organisational perspective. As former General Manager Sarabjit Arjan Singh said on this page (February 11, 2017), the Railways must move away from inquiring into the chain of events that led to an accident to identifying what, in the structure and functioning of the organisation, led to decisions that produced the accident. Human error is identified as the culprit in most inquiries. But why do Railway humans err repeatedly in this disastrous fashion? Does the Railways specialise in recruiting bad apples?

In the recent Utkal Express derailment, the tracks under repair were not closed for traffic, and the train was allowed to speed along. In the Kaifiyat Express accident, a dumper was left on the tracks. A culture of safety is conspicuous by its absence. Once the Railways operate more trains than the tracks can handle, complete with the capacity reduction that accompanies periodic track repairs, its minders are constantly called upon to make trade-offs between safety and making the trains run on time. Block off traffic, so that the track can be repaired thoroughly, or do a hasty job of the repair so as to spare Railways the flak for late trains? If someone gets the trade-off wrong, it is easy to send him off on leave or premature retirement. But what of the decision to allocate less money to extending track capacity and more to running new trains, while the overall budget for investment stands constrained because of the fear of raising fares? There is little point in fixing blame on some individuals.

Just as sending a hundred satellites into space makes India’s brand value rise, frequent rail accidents dent it too. It is in everyone’s interest to overhaul the culture of the Railways to make safety an integral part of all decisions."
Uttarakhand Assembly Elections 2017,
What Supreme Court and AIMPLB obviously have in common: Male dominance,"After its long campaign for non-interference in Muslim personal law, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is in a quandary now. It will meet in Bhopal on September 10 to formalize future strategy, in response to the Supreme Court striking down instant triple talaq as violative of the fundamental right to equality.

This is amidst mounting criticism of its failure to take the leadership on reforming the Muslim community from within. It doesn’t help that the representation of women in the 301-member board is less than 8%. Actually women may have even lesser strength in the executive panel of the board. AIMPLB women members who took a position against triple talaq were reportedly sidelined or shown the door by the male-dominated religious body.

Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which was one of the six petitioners along with the valiant Shayara Bano, is convinced that AIMPLB itself will grow more sidelined as women become more informed and determined: “We don’t trust them. They have been denying rights granted by the Quran and the Constitution to the Muslim women. If it was indeed relevant, women would not have felt the need to move court.”

If women had had greater representation on the AIMPLB board, it would have been more responsive to their concerns. This is a simple enough logic, and interestingly enough it applies as much to the Supreme Court that has put AIMPLB in such a quandary. Not only is only one of the 27 apex court judges today a woman, it has had a grand total of SIX women judges since Independence. The high courts boast 10% women judges, which is quite similar to the 8% women membership of AIMPLB!

Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Uday Umesh Lalit in setting aside talaq-e-biddat concluded, “This form of talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it … It being manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of discrimination.”

On the TOI edit page today Arghya Sengupta draws attention to this strange hesitation of five male judges of the Supreme Court on a matter critical to the lives of women in India: “It is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women’s rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women.”

A lady on the bench you can bet would have delved into discrimination."

Will India shake off its grand delusions?,"‘Tis the season for chest-thumping. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unquestionably on top of the heap. But what a heap it is. Over the past couple of weeks, quite a bit of nasty triumphalism has been on display. Such eruptions need a trigger, and a handy one was provided by the departing remarks of Vice-President Hamid Ansari.

The amount of opprobrium heaped on Ansari was astonishing and disproportionate. Just two weeks before Ansari’s retirement, President Pranab Mukherjee, in his own farewell speech, had said India’s soul resides in pluralism and tolerance. “We may argue, we may agree or we may not agree. But we cannot deny the essential prevalence of multiplicity of opinion. Otherwise, a fundamental character of our thought process will wither away.” Mukherjee also spoke of the rising tide of violence: “At the heart of this violence is darkness, fear and mistrust.”

These are stark and unambiguous statements, but they did not draw the kind of vitriol that Ansari’s “sense of insecurity” remark did. In the days since, the BJP’s op-ed writers have weighed in with what can be charitably described as selective intellectualism. This is happening alongside a continual re-telling of history. Both strands converged in a column by the BJP’s national general secretary Ram Madhav titled ‘Coming Full Circle at 70’.

Madhav wrote about the “genius of our country, which is rooted in its religio-social institutions like state, family, caste, guru and festival”, and went on to rubbish Jawaharlal Nehru’s leadership after independence, comparing him unfavourably with strongmen like David Ben-Gurion in Israel, Mao Zedong in China and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey.

Quoting from a sharp exchange of letters in 1945 between Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru over ‘native wisdom’ and village life as the centrepiece in new India. Nehru was peddling his colonial masters’ views, Madhav said. He ignored the fact that the two men may have differed, but were extraordinarily close – Gandhi did not disavow Nehru as the best choice to lead independent India or waver from naming Nehru his political heir.

Nehru may have been westernised, but he certainly had deep connections with rural India, travelling often into the countryside from his 20s. In the first years after independence, he wrestled with food scarcities, a better deal for farmers, and the abolition of the zamindari system so the share-cropper would get to till his own land. “For the Congress the agrarian question was the dominating social issue and much time had been given to its study and the formulation of policy,” Nehru wrote in The Discovery of India. Twelve years later, the then prime minister wrote to a chief minister: “I would repeat that the keystone of our planning is agricultural production. We can never have surpluses for industrial growth unless these come from agriculture.”

Ironically, to underline his point Madhav quoted a Western writer. “The liberal unease is palpable. Their plight is best described by Edward Luce in his book through a less-used Greek word demophobia — fear of the mob. The mob, humble people of the country, are behind Modi. They are finally at ease with a government that looks and sounds familiar. They are enjoying it,” Madhav wrote.

Madhav is being disingenuous. Luce has used ‘demophobia’ in his new book The Retreat of Western Liberalism to highlight the anxiety of the elites in western democracies. In a recent interview on Vox.com, Luce says that the United States and Britain are more vulnerable to populism because of their triumphalist and complacent stand on their economic and political models, “so it’s not a surprise that wealthier people in the West, who are doing better than they’ve ever done before, are feeling way more demophobic”.

When there was dismay at his apparent endorsement of vigilantism, Madhav responded that he had meant the humble masses, “not the mob in conventional sense”.

In another celebration of cultural nationalism, Delhi University professor Rakesh Sinha criticised Ansari’s ‘binary’ view of majority and minority and noted: “From 2014 onwards, there has been a marked consolidation of saffron politics as India’s political executive is completely Congress-mukt — the offices of president, vice president and prime minister are held by RSS men.”

He quoted Tajamul Hussain, a lawyer and member of the Constituent Assembly, as saying there had never been a tyranny of the majority in India. True – but that was because the subcontinent had allowed itself to be ruled by tiny minorities – the Mughals and the British – for four centuries. In the Assembly, Hussain fought long and hard against a proposal to set aside reserved constituencies for Muslims. This was understandable – he was the only Shia among 31 Muslim representatives from the provinces. On 26 May 1949, for example, Hussain argued that no ‘speck of separatism’ ought to be permitted in the new Indian constitution: “Other minorities will also be encouraged to demand it. Minority within a minority must be logically entitled to it and thus, far from adding and aiding unity, it will only serve to promote separatism and create sectional strife, leading to untold religious, social and political complications.”

The makers of our constitution decided wisely in the end against constituencies reserved for minority religions. That has stood us in good stead. The same Nehru who is now being air-brushed out of our history and political discourse said in the Constituent Assembly on August 14, 1947, hours before independence: “At a time when we are on the threshold of freedom, we should remember that India does not belong to any one party or group of people or caste. It does not belong to the followers of any particular religion. It is the country of all, of every religion and creed. We have repeatedly defined the type of freedom we desire. In the first resolution, which I moved earlier, it has been said that our freedom is to be shared equally by every Indian. All Indians shall have equal rights, and each one of them is to partake equally in that freedom.”

Seventy years after independence, we are still struggling with many of the fundamental questions the Constituent Assembly grappled with. We have still not fulfilled Article 44 in our Directive Principles of State Policy: “The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.” Bigotry and bias still stalk our land. But we deceive ourselves that we are an egalitarian democracy. I remembered Adi Shankaracharya, the genius who in his very brief life (788-820 CE) cemented Advaita philosophy and sanatana dharma (eternal duties) and wrote numerous treatises while criss-crossing India. In his Maya Panchakam (five verses on delusion) the refrain is: “Aghatita ghatana patiyasi maya” (that is the unique effect produced by deceptive delusion). When will we emerge from our delusions?"

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

OPPO F3

Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of déjà vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government’s apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India’s total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government’s achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi’s intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015–16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016–17 as per reports.

farmers suicide in India: Over 12,000 farmer suicides per year, Centre tells Supreme Court #MyNewIndia https://t.co/pY5mXmI9BU — काकावाणी (@AliSohrab007) August 13, 2017

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 – a promise prominently mentioned in BJP’s 2014 manifesto."
"Court Sets A Precedent, Asks Govt To Confiscate Ram Rahim's Property To Compensate For Destruction Of Public Property. Bravo","The conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Insan has unleashed a spree of violence in Panchkula as 28 people have reportedly died till the last reports came in with over 250 injured. Massive clashes started between police, security forces and Dera supporters soon after the news of Ram Rahim's conviction broke out. Media persons were also attacks and their OB vans were also damaged.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has taken the cognizance of the violence and has asked the Haryana government to use weapon or force, if required, to tackle the situation arising out of the CBI court verdict in the rape case against the Dera head. The court has also said that total loss incurred in the violence will be recovered from the Dera.

The bench will hear the matter further tomorrow, Additional Solicitor General of India Satya Pal Jain said. The full bench comprising acting Chief Justice S Singh Saron, Justice Avneesh Jhingan and Justice Surya Kant was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a Panchkula resident raising law and order concerns as over 1.5 lakh people have reportedly entered the district despite prohibitory orders.

The court ordered that ""in case people indulge in causing loss to the properties, the process will be videographed and total loss will be recovered from the dera,"" Jain said.

Police initially found it difficult to control the mob and army's help was sought near 5 pm in the evening with 600 soldiers being deployed in Panchkula. Ram Rahim will be sentenced on Monday and was flown out of Panchkula in a government helicopter, to Rohtak's Sunaria Jail.

The capital too couldn't remain unscathed from the violence in the neighbouring state and nine incident of arson was reported in Delhi. Police said that two buses were torched in northeast Delhi's Loni Chowk and Jyoti Nagar, allegedly by Dera Sacha Sauda supporters where as two coaches of Rewa Express were set on fire at Anand Vihar railway station.

According to the Delhi fire service, reports of arson also came in from various parts of the national capital, including Anand Vihar, Khayala, Jahangirpuri and Badarpur areas.

150 have been reported injured.

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh as well as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have appealed to the citizens, particularly supporters of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, to maintain peace in the wake of the Dera Sacha Sauda chief's conviction in a rape case.

"Founders keepers? Infosys badly hit by internal turbulence, must find a way out in tough environment","The irony of Vishal Sikka’s departure from Infosys is hard to miss. Sikka bravely led the Indian IT industry charge against unpredictable global headwinds in the form of protectionism and disruptive technological changes. But internal turbulence within Infosys proved too difficult to negotiate. When NR Narayana Murthy and the other founder-promoters exited Infosys’s board in 2014, it was hailed as a talismanic moment for corporate governance. After all, it’s not often that Indian promoters turn over their companies to professional managers. Having decided to let go, Murthy should have resisted the temptation to interfere.

Ultimately, Infosys’s stock and Murthy’s reputation took a beating. Sikka was brought in after slowing revenue growth from outsourcing, high attrition rate, and top-level exits dimmed the aura that Murthy and co-promoters assiduously built up over two decades. If the Murthy era focussed on paring down costs to maximise labour arbitrage, Sikka loosened purse strings and utilised cash reserves to fund overseas acquisitions and offer very generous salary and severance packages. Murthy took offence to these changes in corporate culture forcing the Infosys board to play a delicate balancing act between shareholders and its chief executive.

But that restraint ended with the board’s statement accusing Murthy of a “misguided campaign”. After such acrimony Infosys may not attract a top-notch technology leader from outside. Sikka placed his bets on artificial intelligence, automation and cloud computation to improve productivity and sustain Infosys’s edge. This strategy demands a CEO focussed on technology and innovation. The Elon Musks come at a high premium but offer the hope of creating new business and employment opportunities to offset the job losses from AI and automation. Murthy must take a page out of Bill Gates’s playbook. He must allow Infosys to reinvent itself in a changing business and technology environment."

GoI to prove it can keep your secrets,"By Nishit Dhruva & Khushboo Shah

The Supreme Court declaring privacy as a fundamental right is in consonance with the Right to Freedom. Privacy is a part of individual liberty and no person shall be deprived of privacy without due process of law.

At the same time, however, the Right to Privacy will have its own limitations and it can’t be an absolute right in itself. A person has the right to determine what sort of information about them is collected, and how that information is used.

The first task for the authorities will be to interpret and fine-tune all the domains where the issue of privacy is involved. Second, a robust mechanism must be created to ensure this fundamental right is ensured to each one of us. The first task will take care of the ambiguities in the rules, while the second will address the loopholes.

Privacy cannot have an inclusive definition till we list out the dos and don’ts.

The biggest implication of the judgement will be on the Aadhaar row, which a five-member bench will now try to solve in the broad light of Thursday’s verdict. The Centre now has to convince the Supreme Court that forcing citizens to give a sample of their fingerprints and their iris scan does not violate privacy. The biometric information shared during the process of obtaining an Aadhaar card — which includes not just the fingerprints but also a retina scan — could become the next big problem of ‘stolen identity’.

While banks are still struggling against security breaches over credit card usage despite implementing state-of-the-art cyber security measures, GoI has to prove itself to be capable of handling the security of such confidential data and being able to maintain confidentiality. The next crucial area is online privacy. In the light of today’s verdict, internet users can protect their privacy by taking actions that prevent the collection of information. Protecting personally identifiable information is important for preventing identity theft.

As far as social media policies and practices are concerned, it has been a suo motu disclosure when someone uploads a video, makes a comment, shares his location or an article. They are never forced to do so. With the new technological developments, the issue of data sovereignty — the practice of subjecting information to the jurisdiction of data privacy laws on the basis of geographical boundaries — may act as a chink in the right to privacy verdict armour.

Today, data is moving seamlessly across globe, with no ownership over its storage. Unless explicitly specified, Indian IT laws are not applicable to data stored outside India and data intermediaries can claim immunity by exploiting this loophole. This judgement will also leave an impact on India’s ambitious path to evolve as a complete digital economy. The question now is how much personal information can be stored, processed and used by both government and private parties.

The right to privacy, being an intrinsic right under Article 21 of the Constitution that provides the right to life and personal liberty, must have penal provisions in place for its violations. When the right to privacy relates to cyber crimes, the Information and Technology Amendment Act, 2008, separately deals with provisions with regard to penalties and compensations.

An important concern relates to the modernising of penal laws in many countries that exist prior to the advent of computers. On the one hand, existing laws have to change to cope with computer-related fraud such as hacking, malicious falsification and erasure of data, software theft and software attacks, and on the other, a new legislation is also necessary to ensure data protection and piracy.

Kavita Devi Sweats It Out Everyday To Realise Her Dream And The Wrestler's Determination Shall Leave You In Awe,"Kavita Devi is expected to set the wrestling world on fire. In June she became the first Indian woman to take part in the WWE tryouts in Dubai.

A former power lifter, she has always had a key knack for the sport, and has the backing of no less than the Great Khali.

Twitter

However, nothing comes without a price and she admits that it is this realisation of a childhood dream which motivates her to sweat it out everyday.

""It is my childhood dream to wrestle and now I cannot stop so I keep pushing forward,"" she said in an exclusive interview to Indiatimes.

""I always wanted to do something different, this was my passion. So when I got my chance I did not hesitate,"" she added.

Unlike most sportspersons, the lady does not have any particular inspiration when it came to taking up wrestling as a sport. For her it was simply watching on TV and getting attracted to the way things were done.

PTI

""No one in particular inspired me, whatever I aw on TV motivated me to do what I did. Always thought if I got a chance I would make it count, but never thought I would come to WWE.""

But the 2016 South Asian Games medal winner is quick to admit that everyone in her family supported the decision.

""There was no opposition, everyone supported me in my decision. Be it friends, family or relatives, people were very encouraging.""

It was a lovely experience for her to represent India on the big stage and she loved the people she met and got to interact with a lot of wrestlers.

But for now, she is certainly on the right track.

Keep it Kavita! You are an inspiration and may more victories come your way as you look to bring glory to the country."

‘In India-China standoff all sides know that going beyond point of no return will cost everyone and destroy all our dreams’,"As China becomes more aggressive in its external posture, the India-China standoff in Doklam is being watched closely across the Asean region. Thailand’s ambassador to India Chutintorn Gongsakdi spoke to Jiby J Kattakayam about how the border confrontation in Bhutan is being perceived in the wider region, India’s Act East policy and why, despite ancient civilisational linkages, it has taken 70 years of Indo-Thai diplomatic ties for trade and cultural exchanges to enter a higher trajectory:

Does the Indo-China standoff in Doklam on the eastern front worry Asean?

It is a standoff where all sides know that going beyond a point of no return is going to cost everyone and is going to destroy all our respective dreams. I believe that people have the good sense to not go beyond a standoff. Coming from an economics background, it does not make any sense to me for any of these flashpoints to explode.

How do you see the atoll-building activities of China in the South China Sea?

We always like to see countries resolving issues on the negotiating table. It is difficult to have black and white outcomes in border issues, but it has been shown in the past that we can live and work amicably and in the spirit of good neighbourliness. It is not in anyone’s interest in the region or outside for potential flashpoints to explode. People have tested each other, but have not come to blows.

Where is the India-Myanmar-Thailand tri-lateral highway at?

While maritime and air connectivity are important, the highway has great symbolism. The political leadership is visualising our people driving and visiting each other by road. Some road stretches still need improvement. Customs and immigration quarantine facilities still need upgrading. I have been to the border. Trucks queue on the road, taking up valuable space and time. As things stand, the borders cannot support the trade we are visualising.

The highway can also connect India to Laos and Cambodia as well. Border posts and truck stops in Europe and in some parts of Asean are like mini cities. Once the highway is ready we cannot have all these trucks parked along the road creating huge roadblocks.

How are Thailand’s relations with China evolving?

We are a small country. We maintain good relations with all the players in the region. We have a longstanding and strategic relationship with the US. We have a long and close friendship with China. India is a more recent player. The relationship with India has more potential to develop. The relationship with China has developed over the years. As nations grow and find their own place in the global stage, the relationship will also reflect that. Our position is to maintain friendly relations with all and to see them play an appropriate and balancing role in the region.

In the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business index, why is Thailand at 46 and India at 130?

One factor is Centre-state relationships. With GST, India will improve its rank massively next year because it unifies markets. We are unifying the Asean market as well. India is a good example of a government responding to people’s needs through reforms and not protectionism. The other problem which everyone has is corruption. Some Thai businesses ended their investments because of corruption and local people of influence.

We recently had a particularly bad experience with one Indian state. We haven’t given up on that state. The evolving nature of India is such that we do not give up on the country, or a state, but we will return when the state is more ready. We also advise Thai investors to have a local partner. It makes it easier to adapt to local business culture. While there is competition between Indian states, it is important to choose the right state where the chief minister has the attitude and willingness to help business.

How is Indo-Thai trade progressing?

Indo-Thai trade is doing well. It stands at around $7-8 billion per year which appears satisfactory. However, it can improve to $20 billion considering India’s and Asean’s massive markets. Thailand should be seen by India in the context of the Asean market of 600 plus million people. In this context, any country in Asean is a staging point for the whole Asean market.

I find our economies neatly complimenting each other. Manufacturing is our strength and is of interest to India. At the same time, Thailand needs services and information technology where India is ahead. I keep pointing out to Thai stakeholders that India is an emerging power. So my time in India is spent 40% on marketing Asean, 50% on marketing India and 10% on marketing Thailand, because when I am marketing Asean and India, I am serving my country’s interests."
Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

A look into the role of the Port Chairman,"“The chairman of the ports should not merely be involved in the management of a port,” said Amitabh Kant CEO of Niti Aayog. He was speaking during a workshop on ‘Accelerating Sagarmala Implementation, organised by the Ministry of Shipping. He should also be involved in boosting exports, he said. Has the time come for a relook in the traditional role of the Chairman of the Major port of India?

If India were to scale up its exports and reach out to global markets, the ports should not only be linked with the sprawling manufacturing units that have come up around the port, but also be capable of handling non core activities of manufacturing.

Currently the brief of the chairman of a Major port in India is primarily to manage the port and oversee maritime activities that fall within his province. However a number of minor ports or private ports have come up along the peninsular region. The areas around these ports, in Mundra for instance, have expanded industrially, so much so that a considerable volume of exports is generated from these areas. Conversely a substantial volume of imports pass through these ports for the industries around it.

The southeast asian countries had consistently clocked a GDP growth of 10% for a considerable period of time. Much of their development could be ascribed to their policy of port led Industrialisation. The emphasis was on exports to reach the global markets. The domestic consumption alone was not enough to propel the country over the crest to sustain an impressive GDP growth.

In Shanghai and other ports in China, the port manager does not limit his role as its manager. He is responsible for industrialization, manufacturing and export of commodities that take place in the outlying areas around the port. In Shanghai the port Chairman looks upon himself as the man changing China, said Kant.

China has a lower container exporting cost than India, due to proximity of industrialized zone to the port area. The presence of major manufacturing and industrial zones in coastal regions developed as part of the Port-Led Policy of the government.

In Hong Kong, the entire process of production of an item to be exported takes place within the port area. Packaging, labelling, sorting- all the activities take place in the port area. Likewise in the case of re export, the item was imported, value added and then re exported -all activities were done within the port area.

For the first time the ambitious Sagarmala project has Port led Industrialisation, as one of the pillars underpinning its implementation. The programme envisages 14 Coastal Economic Zones. SEZ is being planned at the largest port in India, JNPT. Smart Port Industrial cities are under development at Kandla and Paradip. The port should be the hub, the nerve centre for the entire process of manufacturing activity.

Likewise in the hintertland regions, the Container Freight Stations (CFS) should take on more comprehensive role rather than being mere custodians of the cargo. The CFSs should be bigger in area that could take on the peripheral activities of manufacturing.

All these developments call for an expanded role for the Chairmen of the port or CFS. The time has come to review/amend their functions as administrators to take on a more broader role that would significantly contribute to India’s trade."
One Football Agent Has Some Stern Advice For Lionel Messi,"Lionel Messi is yet to sign the new contract which keeps him in Barcelona til 2021.

AFP

Meanwhile, football agent Mino Raiola wants Messi to leave the club and prove that he can be great anywhere.

""A player like Messi must try another experience with a different club and prove how great he is,"" Raiola said via Marca.

AFP

Messi currently has scored the most goals for Barca. He has won 29 trophies which include eight La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns.

However the man has never played anywhere else. So is it time to expand one's horizons? This agent certainly seems to think so and he could have a point.

Whether or not Messi heeds the advice remains to be seen."
Worship Is Work,"Does God favour those who attend to their work in factories and offices, or those who sit for long in puja, wonder UMA RAM and K S RAM



Afavourite home-assignment for pupils in schools till some decades ago was to write an essay on ‘Work is Worship’. The teacher made the task easy by describing the contours of the essay:True worship lies in doing work.We should work hard.We should not waste time in idle (idol?) worship.She almost suggested that God favours those who bend their backs and attend to their work in the factories and offices,rather than those who sit for long in puja. Few of us (including the teachers who set the assignment) ever suspected the politics that went into this seemingly simple exercise. Few of us could have suspected that it was part of the Macaulian manipulation of education in India that aimed to produce an army of ever-ready servants for the government. In a land known for sedentary ways of life revolving around stretched pujas and innumerable special days for festive duty and special service, such spiritual re-engineering was necessary for developing human resources to uphold the Raj. There is probably nothing in our scriptures or in the scriptures of any major religion anywhere to support the idea that work is worship. In fact, there is good evidence to suggest the opposite: that worship is work in the real sense.Krishna describes this in his discourse on action and inaction.



‘He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action truly sees, he tells Arjuna. Sarva’rambha parityaga, renouncement of all initiatives is declared a virtue in one who is coursing ahead on the spiritual highway. Let life unfold itself and do with disinterested diligence the tasks that such unfolding presents for you. Religion began as magic.It,in fact, continues to be so. An incense stick waved around a symbol of godhead is essentially an act of waving the magic wand for a good day ahead.The day unfolds the will of God. Work presents itself and it is perfectly in order to perform it to the best of one’s ability as service in the will of God.To initiate work, or to avoid the task that has presented itself before you would mean meddling with God’s action plan. He knows, we don’t.To surrender to his action plan is true work. Work, as we understand it, is the elaborate, tedious striving to secure livelihood. Our ancients realised that there can be another way of securing it. This is through symbolic action, a kind of magic, better understood as worship. The Karma Kanda in the Vedas is essentially a manual of magic to help achieve life’s purposes. Creation itself is magic. In the Book of Genesis, God sees darkness and says, let it be day, and it was day. To say is to do.Worship is a mild simulation of such magic.Worship is not counter to work.Worship is work.To learn this is to learn the art of living. The real challenge, though, lies in understanding worship.Worship can be self-defeating if it is fruit-centric. One can be damned by getting one’s prayers answered. Rabindranath Tagore thanks God for the blessing of frustrating his prayers time and again. True worship lies in joyous surrender to the will of God.



Again, it is important to know as to who is the object of worship. Hinduism is often criticised for entertaining numberless demigods. What is missed is that there exists a great unity among this seeming diversity. All services reach the One God. But the results are according to the intermediate demigod to whom the service was directed. The message is clear:focus on the Ultimate One God, even as you worship and propitiate a demigod. Worship need not always be physical. Ideal worship is mental, whether accompanied by physical acts or not. And, a subtle instruction is that worship is not for one’s own pleasure but for the pleasure of God.And it is an incessant engagement, not a fixed hour ritual.The comfort God promises to such an unwavering devotee — nitya’bhiyukta — is: ‘Securing your mundane well-being is my concern — yoga’kshemam vahamyaham.’

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
Stokes ton lifts England to 258,"WINDIES TOUR OF ENGLAND 2017

Stokes ton lifts England to 258

• Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 11:26 PM Rob Johnston in Leeds

Stokes scored 100 to help England post a total that keeps them in the game. © Getty

Despite bowling England out and losing just one wicket in a tricky spell before the close, it was a day of what might have been for Windies. England were dismissed for just 258 on a good pitch but two dropped catches, one off Joe Root and one off Ben Stokes, cost the visitors 142 runs. Had those chances been taken, it would have been a quite brilliant day for the tourists.

As it was, it was still pretty good. Both Kemar Roach and Shannon Gabriel bowled their hearts out and ended up with four wickets apiece. Roach may be slower than what he was three years ago but he displayed plenty of accuracy and skill here while Gabriel bowled quickly throughout. Jason Holder bowled better than at Edgbaston and England generally found it tough going. Pilloried after their performance in the first Test, this was a bowling effort full of vigour, determination and no little skill.

That the home side managed to get as many runs as they did was due in large part to a half-century from Root and a fine hundred from Stokes, his sixth in Tests. Despite being dropped on nine, a relatively straightforward chance off Roach at second slip by Kraigg Brathwaite, Stokes, who came in at 71 for 4, demonstrated much of the responsibility he has increasingly displayed this summer. He got England to a score which at least keeps them in the game.

Stokes played some classy shots and was particularly strong driving through the on and off-sides. After tea, with England six down, he counter-attacked, scoring 55 runs off 63 balls to move to his hundred. He was dismissed feathering an attempted hook shot off Gabriel to the keeper for a round 100 having been dropped off Roach, again, on 98 by Gabriel himself at mid-off. It was about as easy a chance as you will see, arriving meekly at chest height.

The Headingley pitch was on the slow side but offered little seam movement for the fast bowlers and was blameless in England's demise. After winning the toss and deciding to bat, Root will have wanted to ease the concerns that remain with England's batting but they found themselves, as so often in recent times, losing early wickets. First to go was Alastair Cook who was caught at slip by Kyle Hope for 11 off Gabriel, fencing at a lively ball just outside off-stump.

Tom Westley, yet to convince at number three, was gone soon after as Roach tailed a full ball back in to the right hander who drove across it, missed and was LBW for three. It is becoming a familiar dismissal and something opposition teams will hone in on. Opener Mark Stoneman had battled hard for 47 balls without ever looking settled at the crease and was soon caught behind off Roach for 19, inside edging a loose drive.

That was 37 for 3 and it could have been 44 for 4 had Keiran Powell been able to hold a simple chance at first slip off Root when he was on eight. Gabriel, who maintained good pace throughout the day, was the unlucky bowler, his exasperation clear. England got to lunch without further alarm but Windies had been impressively consistent. Roach conceded just 21 runs in a nine over spell with the new ball and Holder bowled four maidens in his first six overs.

Shortly after lunch, Dawid Malan, another with much to prove, drove loosely at Holder, who had just come round the wicket, and played on for eight. At that stage, England were 71 for 4 and the three players with most to prove, Stoneman, Westley and Malan, were all back in the pavilion. England are seemingly no closer to solving their batting issues ahead of the Ashes.

The pivotal moment of the day, Brathwaite's drop of Stokes, came soon after when the all-rounder had nine. It was the hardest one of Windies' four drops but still should have been taken to the fielder's right. Had it been, England would have been 100 for 5 and well against it. As it was, Stokes was able to move his way through the gears. He scored 91 off the next 93 balls he faced.

Root played with increasing authority too, hitting leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo, recalled to Windies team, through the leg-side crisply and paddle sweeping both him and Roston Chase for boundaries. Root moved passed 50 and in doing so made it twelve consecutive Tests in which he had scored at least a half-century dating back to Dhaka in October. It equals the record set by South Africa's AB de Villiers.

Another attempted sweep was Root's downfall, though, when he top-edged Bishoo to Jermaine Blackwood at slip for 59. It elicited an annoyed swish of the bat from England's captain, frustration that was no doubt compounded when Jonny Bairstow fell soon after, well caught by Holder at third slip off Gabriel for three. Despite a partnership of 68 between Stokes and Moeen Ali, England were bowled out for 258, losing their last three wickets for no runs.

There was a little over an hour left when England's innings finished and despite the best endeavours of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, Windies got to the close just one wicket down. It was a difficult spell with the floodlights on and although Powell was caught behind off Anderson, the visitors ended the day more or less intact on 17-1. There is much work ahead tomorrow but this was much, much better from Windies.

Brief scores: England 258 (Ben Stokes 100; Shanon Gabriel 4-51, Kemar Roach 4-71) lead Windies 19/1 (James Anderson 1-5) by 239 runs.

The victim, identified as Akbar Ali was stabbed with knives multiple times on Tuesday allegedly after a fight over money.

Though over a 100 people had gathered there, no one came forward to help him despite his repeated cries for help. The two men who had stabbed him were arrested later.

While no eyewitnesses came forward to give their statement to the police, a 57-second video shot by a bystander showed the bleeding man lying on the road, a knife sticking out of his ribs on the right side.

In the video, people are seen asking the injured man, identified as Akbar Ali, for his home address. Ali mentions that he lives in B-Block, but doesn't give the complete address. He then asks for water.

""By the time a police team reached the spot, someone had taken Ali to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital,"" said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.

Ali succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday.

Two suspects, Mohd Shubhan and Mohd Afzal, were later arrested from the neighbourhood for the murder. Shubhan, a welder, and Afzal, a painter, told police that Ali also worked as a welder, but he extorted money from them. Cops found out that Ali was also a snatcher.

"Celebs Welcome SC's Judgement On Right To Privacy, Say It's Now Time To Talk About Section 377","In a major boost to individual freedom, the Supreme Court on Thursday declared that right to privacy was a fundamental right and protected as an intrinsic part of life and personal liberty and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.

From Kamal Haasan to Onir, Dia Mirza to Sridhar Rangayan, many celebrities took to social media to welcome the Supreme Court’s judgment declaring the Right to Privacy a fundamental right.

While most of them are happy with the ruling, celebrities now want the court to rethink Section 377, which criminalises gay sex.

Here is a round up of celebrities reaction to the ruling-

Shab director Onir, who has always been vocal about sexuality and LGBTQ issues, also asked the apex court to look into Section 377. “Landmark judgment by Supreme Court after Triple Talaq Verdict.

Right To Privacy -- fundamental right under the Constitution. Lets talk 377,” posted Onir, whose film My Brother Nikhil dealt with AIDS and gay-related issues.

Filmmaker and gay rights activist Sridhar Rangayan said it is “a big day for the LGBTQ community in India”.

“I am truly overwhelmed by the Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy, and the parts of the judgment which specifically mention that sexual orientation should be a guaranteed right under the Constitution,” said Rangayan, who hosts the Kashish LGBTQ Mumbai Film Festival.

“This is a big day for the LGBTQ community in India who have been fighting for their rights for over two decades. This verdict vindicates our appeal for equal rights as citizens of India. I feel truly happy and free,” he added.

In 2009, the Delhi High Court had ruled that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was unconstitutional. But in December 2013, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict.

Actress Dia Mirza got patriotic with her tweet as she said this is “one of the many reasons why I love my country! Hail democracy”.

Actors Ranvir Shorey and Annup Sonii also welcomed the judgment.

TV personality Raghu Ram, who was last seen on the silver screen in Tees Maar Khan, became a fan of the apex court after the verdict. “I’m a fan of the Supreme Court all over again! Two landmark judgments in three days! Killing it, Right To Privacy, Triple Talaq.”

Why Trump is right on Pakistan and Afghanistan,"On Monday night, the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, asked Pakistan to knock it off. He vociferously declared that America’s future involvement in Afghanistan will be result-based and not time-based. A timetable for withdrawal was not even mentioned as Trump announced his Afghanistan strategy, which deserves the praise of being one of the best policies designed by the White House. Let´s be clear: Obama´s strategy of “surge and exit by 2014” was a disaster. If you tell the terrorists that you are going to leave, they will wait till you leave.

Afghanistan is viewed as America´s longest war, now in its 16th year. Trump´s speech is bad news for Taliban supporters and those elements in the military in Pakistan, which for a very long time have been allowed to get away with their attempt to play the double game of verbally supporting the war on terror and simultaneously supporting Islamic terrorist groups like the Haqqani network.

The most important conclusion to be drawn after listening to Trump´s announcement is the recognition of the fact that abandoning Afghanistan is not the solution, even though he may have hinted at that during his election campaign. More important than this approach to Afghanistan is his clear statement with regard to Pakistan. Unlike Barack Obama, Trump has decided to directly address the issue of Pakistan´s double game in his address to the nation. He unequivocally condemned Pakistan´s support for Taliban and the Haqqani network while simultaneously receiving large-scale military assistance from US.

Since the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, Pakistan has received billions of dollars in aid from USA alone. But in the future that aid will be directly linked to Pakistan´s willingness to cut its support for the jihadi groups that have killed scores of American soldiers in the past.

What one could hope is that further sanctions would be applied directly to those sections of the Pakistani military and intelligence services which play a direct and indirect role in the clandestine support for the jihadi groups. Pakistan has a difficult case to prove as Osama Bin Laden was caught and killed in Abottabad close to a military garrison. Here the European Union could also co-operate with US and impose travel bans on top military generals who make life miserable for people on the south Asian continent while basking in the sun on the beautiful beaches of Europe and America. No holiday for them if they are caught red-handed.

Lastly, there is no reason to fear the Chinese influence in Pakistan. Pakistan is well aware of the consequences of choosing China over America. Pakistani generals and the elite in Pakistan would rather send their children to US and Europe for further studies than to China.

If Pakistan and India co-operate and see Afghanistan as a territory to be developed and not as an area of contention and competition, much of the conflict in the region can be reduced.

India, Pakistan and Afghanistan can become a strong economic zone, where growth and development would mean improvement of the standard of living for all of its citizens. But it requires a willingness to accept a reconciliation process and give the power back to the common man. The common man in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan does not want war. He wants co-operation.

Trump finally got America’s policy on South Asia right. The million-dollar question is if he will be allowed to walk the talk. Since the time of Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan, India has been voicing its concern. It kept warning Washington that Bin Laden was in Pakistan and of its double game. The big question is: Will India now trust America? The proof of the pudding is in the eating. If America keeps its promise of demanding closure of all terrorist networks, also those affecting India, then the demand put on India of further engagement with Afghanistan will be seen as positive.

America also needs to put pressure on Europe to get straight with China, which is trying to fill in the gap in Pakistan and doing roaring business in Europe. When it comes to South Asia, America has finally got its policy right. The same cannot be said of the European Union."

"Good time to join the dots, cross the T’s","By Karan Singh

We are on the cusp of a broad-based consolidation wave in Indian business. One has only to read the headlines to grasp the heightened level of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity across sectors. These big-ticket deals are driven by emerging opportunities and led by dominant players who are reshaping the industry structure within their sectors.

In telecom, the number of service providers has fallen from more than 10 to 4-5. The most recent merger proposed between Vodafone and Idea will create an entity with a combined enterprise value of an eye-popping $23 billion, making it the largest telecom company in India. Among old-economy companies, UltraTech Cement closed its $2.4-billion acquisition of Jaypee Group’s cement assets. Even the relatively young e-commerce sector has been reduced to a two-horse race between Flipkart and Amazon.

The last financial year saw a record level of M&A deals, valued at $66.2 billion. This year promises to be even bigger. Incidentally, a majority of 2017 acquisitions have been domestic, rather than cross-border, deals.

What is driving this surge? And what lessons do these deals offer for corporates? There are four broad triggers behind the heightened action.

Industry disruption: A prime example is of Reliance Jio, which compelled other telcos to respond so that they could remain viable and improve their market position — with a focus on increasing access to spectrum, retaining customers and weeding out duplicate costs to protect their operating economics.

Distressed assets: Distressed assets are allowing stronger players to improve their strategic positions cost-effectively, as in the cement and power industries. Jaypee, for instance, has had to sell its cement assets to pare down its debt.

Regulatory changes: Regulatory changes and moves such as consolidation of banks, notably the merger of the State Bank of India (SBI) and its associate banks, are the next big trigger.

Overseas assets: Availability of reasonably priced overseas assets allows Indian players to solidify and expand their global strategic aspirations. They are doing this smartly by accessing cheaper overseas financing and benefiting from richer Indian multiples. Motherson Sumi’s acquisition of PKC Group, the Finnish maker of automotive wiring systems, is a case in point.

These trends also indicate that the market is starting to mature. Companies are preparing to take advantage of the next chapter of growth and positioning themselves to capture a share of future profit pools.

However, those considering M&A should weigh the following factors. cess. First, periods of turbulence are crucibles of both opportunity and risk, offering a chance to reshuffle decks. Bain data from the US suggests that during such periods, there is potential for companies to move up or down two quartiles in terms of market position. And for those changes to endure. Although the possible rewards are great for strong companies, weak players can make big mistakes: if not handled strategically or not well-executed, M&A actions may create lasting casualties.

Second, acquisitions that improve strategic leadership, undertaken by companies performing well, have higher odds of success. So, what are the economic rules for profit-making in the industry? Is it about being scale-driven (global, national or regional)? Or is it about share position in premium categories (consumer products), or access to proprietary assets, or resources that drive value creation?

Third, successful M&A deals are usually carried out by serial acquirers with a repeatable model, not by companies that make big bets infrequently. M&A moves by companies that have a weak core can also be disastrous.

Fourth, diligence and integration are both critical in ensuring suc-cess. To avoid getting caught up in deal fever and overbidding, companies need to establish a clear and strategic deal thesis and test it objectively during diligence. During integration, it is vital to follow the money and focus heavily on the key value drivers of the deal. It is equally important to customise the integration approach depending on company size and whether it is a scale or scope deal.

Finally, the importance of noregret moves cannot be overemphasised. These include reassessment of strategy and rules of the game as industry dynamics change; a focus on strengthening customer loyalty and differentiation as competitive intensity increases; and, from a defensive point of view, a focus on achieving the highest level of cost efficiency.

A superabundance of capital will contribute to the trend, with corporate and financial investors sitting on significant dry powder they can deploy. Armed with an understanding of today’s M&A landscape, companies can leverage the unfolding opportunity for strategic boldness, and for forging a new path to economic leadership.

Can Yogi do more for electricity than gau raksha?,"Uttar Pradesh has long been one of the worst administered states. Children’s deaths in Gorakhpur recently hogged the headlines, but are hardly new. Ex-bureaucrat V Ramani has unearthed an RTI response showing that between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2011, 31,791 children were admitted to the Gorakhpur hospital, and no less than 3,745 died, 1,311 of encephalitis. Half the qualified medical posts and 40% of nursing posts were vacant. Similar problems afflict every sector in UP.

Like many predecessors, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to overhaul governance. During a recent visit to Lucknow, two senior bureaucrats told me the Yogi was more serious than any chief minister for decades, and was not simply a Hindutva fanatic. Yet UP’s history has long been one of broken promises and dismal outcomes. Poor governance is deeply embedded, and will resist overhaul.

There are some green shoots. One of the most difficult areas to reform in any state is electricity. Huge subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers have plunged most state electricity boards deep into the red. Chief ministers need to bite the bullet and push through major tariff hikes and reductions in theft.

The Yogi has bitten the bullet. The state has proposed tariff hikes of up to 360% for different categories of rural and urban domestic consumers, the average hike being 22.6%. Industry rates have not been raised at all — the state wants to attract industry, and its rates are already high. This is the very opposite of the populism typical of a new chief minister.

Can UP follow the Gujarat model? There, companies in generation, transmission and distribution all show profits. As Chief Minister, Modi cracked down on power theft, raised tariffs, metered and supplied power to almost all villages, and bifurcated electric feeders to villages. This enabled him to supply 24×7 power for domestic use and six hours per day for agricultural pumps.

Profitable industrial and commercial consumers account for 52% of consumption in Gujarat, against only 30% in UP, which cannot therefore depend on cross-subsidies from industry for farmers. It currently loses Rs 2.07 on every unit of power supplied. Apart from subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers, power theft and corruption are rampant. The state’s Aggregate Commercial and Technical (ACT) losses average 31% across its distribution companies. The Yogi seeks to slash this to 23% in a year, a huge challenge.

Technical losses in transmission should not exceed 8-9% of supply. Anything more represents theft and corruption. ACT loss is a whopping 60% in Meerut, where politically powerful vote banks and industries have long siphoned off power in collusion with corrupt electricity officials.

Checking theft requires strong police support. But police stations in UP are under-staffed and fully occupied with major crimes and public order. They have no time or staff to check electricity theft: unfilled vacancies for constables exceed one lakh.

Yogi’s radical reform proposal is to create one new police station in every district dedicated to checking electricity theft. That can be a game changer. A senior official says, “This is the first government in my time to say we should go after all thieves without exceptions or mercy.” Brave words, but implementation has never been the state’s strong point.

Following court orders, exams are being held to hire one lakh constables. These will be based largely on objective questions in a written exam, not school marks, since cheating is so rampant that school marks mean nothing.

The state’s ‘Electricity For All’ scheme aims to electrify every household by October 2018. That means doubling the current number of connections: an additional 1.12 crore rural and 15 lakh urban consumers are to be covered. Up to 10 lakh diesel gensets of farmers will also be converted to electricity. The Yogi claims rural power supply is up from 12 to 18 hours per day. Grassroots reports suggest substantial improvement though not to the extent claimed. Critics, including buffalo traders and meat processors, say the Yogi is keener on cow protection than electricity.

Officials claim that in four months, the BJP government has metered 3.25 lakh unmetered connections, and provided 12.5 lakh new connections. They say in the April-June quarter, electricity supply rose 18% while revenue jumped 30%, reflecting better collection.

Will this be sustained? Will the BJP resist the temptation to waive rural electricity dues when the next election approaches? Is the Yogi serious enough, and bureaucracy honest and efficient enough, to stop power theft and collect bills? Let’s see. The Yogi’s power reforms have started well, but have miles to go."
Time to play the Trump card in Afghanistan,"US President Donald Trump’s recognition that India has an important role to play in Afghanistan is welcome.

Washington has signalled its willingness to end its deference to Pakistan’s sensitivities about India’s involvement in Afghanistan. New Delhi must devise a plan, based on India’s interests and one that will ensure peace, stability and progress in the region.

There has been a growing realisation in the US that Pakistan has consistently played a double game. Islamabad has successfully extracted concessions and aid from the US as a partner in the war on terror, and at the same time, it has continued to provide substantial support, including safe haven, to terrorists.

Beginning from the closing months of the Clinton administration, Washington has increasingly leaned on and called out Pakistan. What sets apart Trump’s calling out of Pakistan supporting terrorists is that it is more unequivocal than that of his predecessors.

Given President Trump’s track record, it remains to be seen if he and his administration will stay the course and follow through with concrete action. There is much that the US can do to curtail Pakistan’s continued assistance to terrorists.

Washington needs to follow its talk with action. India needs to seize this moment. Pakistan will not give up its efforts to block a greater role for India in Afghanistan; it is already unsettled by New Delhi’s $1-billion investment.

Washington needs to follow up with necessary action to translate Trump’s words into reality. At the same time, India needs to work out its interests and those of the region to map out its participation in Afghanistan.

New Delhi must seize the opportunity accorded by Trump’s calling out of Pakistan for its support of terror groups. Trump’s Afghanistan and South Asia policy gives India an opening, it is for New Delhi to fashion it."
Make laws on data protection and privacy swiftly,"The old order changeth yielding place to new, concluded Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, one of the nine members of the Supreme Court bench which unanimously ruled that individual privacy is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The ruling, even if silent, will have an impact on Aadhaar, the unique identification number used by the government to disburse money for welfare schemes.

Is Aadhaar compatible or not with the Right to Privacy? That’s something another bench of the Supreme Court will rule on. Instead of waiting for the next ruling, the government should enact laws on data protection and privacy. Thats a message from the apex court as well.

Justice Kaul, in fact, mildly rapped the government for dilly dallying on the Privacy Bill in 2005. Seven years later, a group of experts appointed by the Planning Commission and steered by AP Shah gave its report on privacy. But its recommendations remained on paper.

In the course of the hearing the government informed the SC about its decision to set up the BN Srikrishna panel to identify key data protection issues in India and recommend ways to address them. No one can quibble with the government’s position that the digital economy must grow, and in parallel the personal data of citizens must be secure and protected. So there is hope! said Justice Kaul.

The Chief Justice of India also concurred with the view that data protection is indeed “a complex exercise which needs to be undertaken by the state after a careful balancing of privacy concerns and legitimate state interests, including public benefit arising from scientific and historical research based on data collected and processed.”

It makes sense for India to take a page from the European Union that has stringent laws to protect a citizen’s data. “The European Union Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data may provide useful guidance in this regard. The State must ensure that information is not used without the consent of users and that it is used for the purpose and to the extent it was disclosed”.

The SC ruling says that the concerns expressed (by privacy advocates) on the possibility of the State infringing the right to privacy can be met by the test suggested for limiting the discretion of the State. One, the action must be sanctioned by law. Two, the proposed action must be necessary in a democratic society for a legitimate aim. Three, the extent of such interference must be proportionate to the need for such interference and most important there must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such interference.

Interestingly, the EU regulation also recognises what is called “right to be forgotten”. This comes into force if, say, a person, does not wish that his personal data should be stored or processed as it has no relevance, is incorrect and serves no legitimate interest. But there are checks on exercising this right as well.

The SC’s observation on the need to have a law data protection is timely and useful. The ball is now in the government’s court."

Faf du Plessis to lead World XI in 3 T20Is in Pakistan

The World XI side that will tour Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in September, will be led by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, PCB chief Najam Sethi announced in a press conference on Thursday (August 24). The first two T20Is of the Independence Cup will be played on September 12 and 13, and the final game will be played on September 15, in Lahore.

The squad boasts of as many as five South Africa players, namely Hashim Amla, David Miller, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir, apart from skipper du Plessis himself. The star-studded 14-member squad will feature three Australians too - George Bailey, Ben Cutting and wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine. Darren Sammy, who was a part of the Pakistan Super League 2 Final, will lead the West Indian representation alongside Samuel Badree.

There is one player each from England, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, in Paul Collingwood, Tamim Iqbal, Thisara Perera and Grant Elliott respectively. The only countries which do not have a representation in the World XI squad are India, and Zimbabwe. Andy Flower was appointed coach of the touring side previously.

""I am honored to have been appointed as the captain of such a diverse, attractive and well balanced side. Like most of the players, I look forward to my maiden tour of Lahore and play my part in the safe and gradual resumption of international cricket in Pakistan,"" du Plessis said on the momentous occasion.

""All the members of the squad have complete faith in the assessment and judgement of the security experts who have assured that there will be no compromise on the safety and security of all those involved in the series. As professionals, we are being paid to play in the series but the bottom line is that if we don't feel safe, no amount of money can get us there. In this background, we will land in Lahore with nothing except cricket on our minds.

""In my career, I have featured in some very exciting matches against Pakistan but to play in Pakistan in front of its passionate supporters, will be a unique experience which I cannot wait to explain. As a player I understand the importance of playing in front of home crowds and that is something I am sure that Pakistani players will relish,"" du Plessis added.

The PCB chairman, who has been in the public eye for his constant attempts to bring international cricket to Pakistan, looked a relieved man at the press conference but didn't conceal the enormity of the efforts that they had to put in to get as close to this. ""From putting this World XI together to getting people on board, to pull in 1.2 billion dollars to put in place the requisite security plans for the security agents and officials to visit our country and assess the arrangements, all of this would not have been possible without the relentless support of Giles Clarke,"" Sethi said.

""You would know that he also heads the Pakistan Task Force unit. We are indebted to Mr. Clarke for the great effort he has put in bringing all of this together for all of us. I thank him for his support, and I know the whole of Pakistan is thankful to him too.

""The three-member security cell will arrive in the first week of September. We just finalised it over a conversation today. They will oversee all the arrangements and will discuss it with the Punjab government. Following this, the team would arrive and we get started with the series,"" he further added.

""I must confess this was a difficult project to take up. All of us wanted to make this happen but there were so many elements involved, you need assistance from the government, administration, police, rangers, army, and FICA is involved too. Getting them on board was the most difficult task. There were a lot of issues and we worked steadily towards resolving all of them. There were financial challenges too.

""See, there are only 15 odd days remaining now, and today, we have received the names of the players. Broadcasters wanted the names of the players for the rights to be sold, you can assume the challenges involved.

""Now my next challenge is to host cricket in Karachi. I have received numerous calls asking for the same, from the governor, media and so many others. That truly is my next objective. As of date, the foreign players and the security experts are not ready for it. We will look to take PSL to Karachi, once that is staged successfully, the roads to more cricket there would open up,"" Sethi noted.

Pakistan are also due to host Sri Lanka and West Indies, after the conclusion of the three-T20I series against World XI. The Windies are expected to visit Pakistan some time in late November for a three-match T20I series.

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

David Richardson, the ICC chief executive, said that the governing body is making every effort to ensure international cricket returns to Pakistan.

""The ICC wants to see regular international cricket being played safely in all its Member countries and the World XI playing Pakistan in Lahore next month is a step towards that for the PCB.

""The PCB's plans for the tour will include comprehensive security arrangements for the safety and security of the players, officials, media and spectators. As such, the ICC is fully supportive of these games. That said, all the stakeholders will remain vigilant and re-evaluate the situation if required.

""We are optimistic that this will be the next step in a steady and safe return of international cricket to Pakistan,"" he added.

What the players and coach said:

Hashim Amla: I am looking forward to the trip to Pakistan. The rehabilitation of my shoulder is progressing well and I am confident of being fit for the matches.""

Andy Flower: ""I have visited Pakistan in 1993, 1996 and 1998 with the Zimbabwe cricket team. I have enjoyed all my previous tours of Pakistan and look forward to returning to Lahore next month. All the players are satisfied and comfortable with the security arrangements that will be put in place for the series and are happy to be a part of the first step towards the safe return of international cricket in Pakistan.

""We now look forward to playing some exciting cricket, so that we can entertain the Lahore crowd who have waited long enough to see local as well as international stars live in their backyard.""

Sarfraz Ahmed: ""I am really excited to see the World XI team coming to Pakistan and I keenly look forward to play in front of a committed crowd who support us. I can assure all Pakistani cricket fans that we have missed playing in front of them, like they have missed watching us live in action.

""But this wait is about to end and I am sure better times lie ahead for all of us. I am confident that through this tour of World XI, the global cricket community, including players, media and visitors will get a better understanding and perception of Pakistan, which is a peace loving and extremely hospitable nation.

""I would like to congratulate PCB and ICC for making this tour happen and I look forward to some exciting matches in front of a packed Gaddafi stadium. I am confident that following the success of these matches, Pakistan will not only host regular international series but at all international cricket centres as well.""

Tamim Iqbal: ""Secondly I think representing the World XI is a big mater and I am really proud of that. I think ten cricketing nations are like a family. To bring back cricket in Pakistan someone have to take the initiative and so I think it is a wonderful opportunity by arranging such an event. It should have started at some time and it is wonderful thing that we are the first one to take the steps. If it had happened earlier it would have been better.""

"‘Right to privacy now includes all your choices: where you live, whom you marry, your sexual orientation’","Arvind Datar is a senior advocate in the Supreme Court of India and represented one of the petitioners in the landmark Justice KS Puttaswamy and Others vs Union of India case, which resulted in a nine-member constitutional bench of the apex court ruling to elevate the right to privacy to a fundamental right under the Constitution. Datar spoke after the historic judgment to Nalin Mehta on the implications of this case for Indian jurisprudence, how it will change the life of the average citizen and the implications for Aadhaar:

How big a leap is this judgment to make privacy a fundamental right in the context of a long history of previous judicial rulings on this issue?

It is an extremely important judgment because it lays to rest any doubts about whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right. In 1954 and 1962 the court just made passing observations on privacy. It wasn’t a core issue at all. This has laid to rest any kind of controversy on the issue of privacy.

Secondly, in the Aadhaar case suddenly the Union of India took a position that there was no right to privacy as a fundamental right. From 1975 there are at least 25-30 judgments which have said that there is a right to privacy.

The government’s stand was surprising because the entire world has recognised the right to privacy. There is a universal declaration of human rights and so many other provisions that contradict the government’s stand. Now the right to privacy has not only been linked to the right to life and liberty, the judges have gone much further and said that it permeates Part 3 of the Constitution. So it is an overarching right. They have said that the right to privacy also includes all your decisional choices: where you live, what you do, whom you marry, who are your partners, your sexual orientation. All that is protected. It has consequences on several other factors including Section 377. For example, the right to privacy can now be traced to the right to religion and your religious practices also. It is a very important landmark from that viewpoint.

How will this judgment impact the ongoing legal case in the Supreme Court on Aadhaar?

It will definitively have some impact on the Aadhaar case but to what extent, I don’t know. The point is that the Supreme Court had said there is no absolute right to privacy. It can be balanced for public interest. To what extent Aadhaar is in the public interest is the question.

Secondly, the judges have also emphasised the need for data protection and said that data can be shared only if there is a compelling need of the state in the public interest. All this raises interesting debates on where you draw the line.

In terms of the private sector and privacy protections, what will be the impediments on implementation?

We do not know ultimately how this will pan out. That is why SC has said the Srikrishna committee’s recommendations are important on data protection laws. In many cases, with private companies you part with data on a consensual basis because you get some benefits. All your critical data is private but when you want an insurance policy you have to part with some data. In these contractual cases, for some benefits it becomes necessary to part with data. That point has to be considered ultimately.

What impact will this judgment have on IndiaStack, the backend system of APIs that allows government, businesses, startups and developers to utilise digital transactions for cashless and paperless services?

All this has been left to the Srikrishna committee. In consultation with stakeholders they will have to decide how much private data players can share, how much they cannot share, how much is consensual, how much is not – all this has to be discussed.

You were also involved in the income tax case on PAN and Aadhaar cards where the court gave an adverse verdict. How will this verdict affect that issue?

I do not know. On the Aadhaar and income tax case, our contention was Aadhaar is meant for subsidies. If you have been an income tax assessee for several years, what is the purpose in saying that if I don’t give my Aadhaar number you will invalidate my PAN card or bank account? Definitely, you don’t want unauthorised people to get government subsidies, but the objection is that you were making Aadhaar necessary for almost everything, even hall tickets for Class XII exams. That is what we were saying is wrong."

Mika Singh Draws Severe Flak For Wishing Gurmeet Ram Rahim Good Luck Before The Rape Verdict!,"Dera Sacha Sauda chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, has been convicted in a 2002 rape case, by a CBI Special Court in Panchkula, Haryana today. The self-acclaimed Godman has been found guilty in the rape case where two women disciples accused of repeated rape.

After he was convicted in the rape case, 50-year-old Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been moved to a jail in Ambala, said lawyers at the Panchkula court.

While the situation is going intense in several regions of Punjab including Panchkula, singer Mika Singh has courted another controversy.

Mika's tweet for MSG, wishing him good luck before the case hasn't gone down too well and has left people outraging for supporting a rapist.

"Inside, outside: Underwear has come out of the closet and become designer ‘inner wear’ 😜","The young man and the young woman make a perfect couple: young, good looking, and beautifully built. You can tell just how beautifully built they are because they’re appearing in full public view dressed only in their undergarments.

They aren’t actually there in person, of course. They are models appearing on a large publicity hoarding which is advertising a brand of underclothing made by a world-famous designer.

The message that the hoarding sends out is loud and clear: underwear has come out of the closet of unmentionable subjects and literally become the talk of the town having been renamed ‘inner wear’.

The redesignation says it all. The ‘under’ in underwear has connotations of something inferior, or undesirable, as in ‘underdog’ or ‘under the weather’. ‘Inner’, as in inner wear, denotes exclusivity and desirable intimacy, as in ‘inner group’.

Yesterday’s underwear – which came in all shades of vanilla white which gradually changed colour through repeated washing to grubby grey – consisted of jhangiyas (shortened to jangs) and bunyans (also known as gunjees) for men, and knickers (also known as panties) and ‘bodices’ for women.

In the lingerie section of the New Market in what was then called Calcutta, hoarse voiced salesmen would follow women shoppers, furtively muttering ‘Boddis, boddis, 34A, 36B, 38C’ much to the embarrassed consternation of those so accosted, particularly if they happened to be accompanied by male members of their family or circle of acquaintance.

There is nothing furtive about today’s unisex inner wear. Indeed, inner wear – which comes in a dazzling array of colours which would put a rainbow to shame – is to be flaunted, as it is in the ad hoardings and kiosks that dot the cityscape.

At this rate, it might not be long before increasingly eye-catching inner wear becomes outer wear, to be worn not inside but outside our exterior clothes.

In fact, it’s already been done. Remember the guy in the cape and the red jangs worn outside his blue body suit? Didn’t he look Super, Man?"
"Time for UCC: If unifying India is Modi’s mantra, uniform civil code with minority backing will transform Indian society","The Supreme Court judgment outlawing instant triple talaq was a landmark decision but it also highlights difficulties faced by judges in resolving thorny issues that overlap between civil matters and personal laws. Justices Nariman, Lalit and Joseph took the stand that triple talaq is not integral to the practice of Islam and isn’t protected by Article 25(1) safeguarding religious freedoms. But Justice Joseph disagreed with the Nariman-Lalit view that a colonial-era legislation surrendering “marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq” to personal law regulated triple talaq, and hence must be tested against Article 14 guaranteeing equal protection of the law.

Instead Justice Joseph, like Justices Khehar and Nazeer, reaffirmed that the law applicable to Muslims “shall only be their personal law namely Shariat” and then proceeded to ascertain whether triple talaq was sanctioned by Quran. But should judges be forced into laboured interpretations of religious laws in matters like marriage that fall within the domain of civil law? All three judgments on triple talaq conducted their own inquiries into Muslim laws, on essentially theological issues, and arrived at different interpretations.

For women coping with marital, divorce, inheritance and alimony disputes, vacuum in the statute on grounds of primacy of personal laws is a gross violation of Article 14. Justices Khehar and Nazeer, with qualified support from Justice Joseph, implored Parliament to extend the codification of laws, “an issue of paramount importance”, to Muslims too. But codification of personal laws will not end discrimination if the personal law is fundamentally discriminatory. Even the Hindu codes still have provisions that favour men over women. A Uniform Civil Code (UCC) would bring clarity, cut through the messiness necessitated by dealing with abstruse theological matters, and actualise Article 14’s promise of equality.

But UCC seems tough to achieve in today’s fractious political climate. To bring it closer, every party must drop the selective secularism it currently practises and move towards genuine secularism. This responsibility falls especially heavily on BJP and NDA as they are politically dominant in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is best placed in decades to take the initiative. He has parliamentary backing and his party manifesto promised a UCC if elected. But Modi must first win minority backing by propounding an inclusive agenda in all walks of public life. After GST on the economic front, UCC is the ultimate measure to “unify” Indian society."
राशि से जानें असल में कौन सा प्राणी है आपकी आत्मा,
Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."
Infosys’s driverless golf cart versus Google’s autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google’s autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, which “rather than simply copy Glaxo’s migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).” The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural — software and hardware — support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."

A Guy Connected His Smartband Online & People Gave Him An Electric Shock 755 Times In 20 Mins!,"Humanity's renowned for routinely indulging in crazy behaviour, and the Internet has of coursed made erring on the side of crazy only too easy, I'm afraid.

This smart wristband is designed to give you an electric shock!

So it is no surprise that when one guy connected his smart wristband online, asking people to mildly electrocute him, that he got what he was asking for. Several times over!

So, i’m wearing a bracelet that zaps you with an electric shock. I can have people remotely activate it. Try it out: https://t.co/ud7yR3wl6E — Kevin Adult Man (@Kevin_Raposo) August 24, 2017

Surely, Kevin Raposo, 24-year-old tech writer knew what he was getting into. Yesteday, he decided to have some fun and posted an activation link for his electric shock-delivering smartband to Twitter. Something that he was wearing around his right wrist. The Internet duly obliged by zapping him over 755 times in just 20 minutes!

How did this happen?

The smart wristband that Kevin was wearing is called the Zap from a company named Pavlok, who design these smartbands to deliver mild electric shocks as a behavioural design method to break people's bad habits.

After his initial Twitter post, Raposo later tweeted out two videos of him getting zapped by people who discovered his ""activation link"" on Twitter -- think of the activation link like a remote button which when pressed gave Kevin an electric shock through his smart wristband.

In the video, you can see the lightning bolt logo of Kevin's smartband light up every time someone shocked him over the Internet.

Charge that Narayana Murthy forced CEO Vishal Sikka to resign is a lie,"By Vallabh Bhanshali

Walk away I did, but it did not mean a walk over/

Targets hiding behind the non-target/

I prefer speaking to Keeping quiet /

When will my countrymen learn to speak up

*******

These are the words that came to mind when I imagined what it must be to be in Mr Narayana Murthy’s shoes…

Omkar, I walked away. Not once. That cannot mean a walk over, allowing a walk over what was built painstakingly.

I spoke up and kept speaking up, not because I am a founder or that along with my wonderful colleagues a part of large block of voting power. I spoke up because if I noticed something remiss as a shareholder it had to be pointed out for everyone’s good. Those who take criticism and respond positively benefit immensely whereas a critic has little to gain. On the contrary, he is prone to be judged cantankerous as I have been. Worse, in both a tragic and comic manner, my motives have been questioned and I am being dictated to walk away!

All the same I must speak up. I must choose my words and target thoughtfully. One should be fair and open to admission of a mistake in doing so. These are some of the principles that I keep in mind and that also went into communication and governance policy at Infosys. In a way these were some of the pillars that held Infosys aloft.

It is obvious that the corporate governance code at Infosys wasn’t built in a day. Building it required thought, imagination and belief in fairness. The rules of governance were made as a matter of faith in them and not for instant benefits or cover ups. They were built around one simple realization, viz. when multiple constituencies are involved winning and sustaining their trust was paramount and that was possible only by transparency and exercising acute diligence.

It also required that we subjected ourselves to greater questioning, in the immediate term losing business secrets and other limitations. These restrictions did not deter us from writing in the first annual report after we became a public company that ‘ we will always be transparent and we think transparency is a competitive advantage’. Not many people understood the implication of what we said. Over time we were proven right as reflected in the growing confidence of customers, employees and shareholders.

We kept adding layers to transparency. We added the practice of giving half yearly results, quarterly results, audited results, interim balance sheet and so on much before it became law to do so. All based on the same principle that let others judge us based on data and not on certification, self or paid ones.

We did not stop there. We thought even if Indian companies did not practice it or the regulation did not require it, we thought it appropriate to give guidance so that a small investor or broker who did not have the wherewithal to do deep analysis could invest or divest based on it. Of course, our guidance had to be credible, more so in terms of downside protection.

When Sarbanes Oxley code was introduced in the US demanding that the listed companies come clean and a window of period was provided for the same we would become the first company to file ‘No change in disclosure’ statement. It was a proud moment for us and for India.

A lot of these facts are well known or are a part of Infosys legend but I felt compelled to mention by way of background to what I have to say.

I must expose the mis-statements made in utterly poor taste in the context of Vishal Sikka’s resignation as CEO of Infosys.

I thought it was patent that constant comments and questioning of governance based on public data or on a whistleblower’s report,

were targeted at the Board or its leadership. These questions cannot be targeted at the CEO. They were always targeted at the Board and or its leadership. The CEO has to be enterprising and in that process, can make a mistake. It is and was the Board’s job to keep him both motivated and discreet. The Board has to lay and enforce its guidelines in a dynamic manner.

Thomas Jefferson said in the context of democracy ‘that it is only when the government is afraid of the people and not the other way around that Democracy can be said to be successful’. The words could not fit better to a board managed company. The CEO must be bold but not so bold that he dictates the board and lays the rules of governance. It is the board that should not let that happen.

Unfortunately, this is what seems to have happened at Infosys. Amongst numerous examples of this let me take just one.

In 2016 the CEO announced goals for 2020, rather abruptly, which were ambitious by all accounts and naturally, had to be abandoned. It is strange that the while the Board has raised a finger at my motives it completely failed to question the motive or the meat of that abrupt move. What lay along that garden path and where was it leading to, should have been the most natural questions. It didn’t need great professional skepticism but the Board simply let that happen. In retrospect, everyone can see why was that announced made and what lay along that path. Equally facile and naive was the Board’s announcement of abandonment of those goals! Slightest questioning would have avoided the great embarrassment to the company, a company that met or came close to its guidance for a number of years. When track record of this kind was being trampled on, at least to the discerning, it became clear that grave weaknesses were being institutionalized.

Infosys came back from crises in 2001 and 2008 strongly because there was a sense of trust and fairness in warp and weft of the company and the crisis galvanized them into both unity and strength. Companies with weak governance and unfair practices find it difficult to survive crisis. A dam that cannot hold a flood back is a bigger curse than the flood itself. Its test lies only when a flood arises.

If I could clearly see that eventuality I had a choice to keep quiet. I could persuade myself that I had walked out voluntarily and I should treat Infosys as a closed chapter bearing its progress and distress with equanimity. It was easy but that is not me. I knew I could be misunderstood as wanting to come back or impose my nominee as the CEO. What a travesty! Someone who walked out no sooner a CEO was found with billions of dollars in the company would not do so to come back at the drop of a hat! I am old, have my own tragedies but sane enough.

I have pondered on the accusations being made against me for forcing Vishal to resign. It is a lie. It is the Board, rather its leadership that did it. The Board failed to enforce good practices and went around seeking endorsement from paid agencies instead of dealing in data and letting the world judge for itself. That is all that I demanded. It was the Infosys practice and at least some of the current directors have been party to such situations and disclosures. But that was not to be. Its attempts to strengthen itself ended in a ludicrous situation of having multiple people holding posts with the suffix chairman!

The need for a large company to have a strong CEO is unquestioned. But good governance, the fountainhead of a company, and a workforce motivated and comforted by a pervasive sense of fairness are even more important. If the board governance improves I have no doubt that the deep-rooted culture and competence of Infosys will restore its glory.

The public reactions are not lost on me. They anguish me. Not because the market capitalization has gone down. It is not the affronts to me. It is much worse. It is the deep-rooted culture of bearing what is not right, particularly in India, that is the sore point. Democracy, a company or for that matter any relationship can become and remain strong only when people have the courage to speak up. Speak up in a fair and persistent manner. Those who prefer to suffer losses than speak up are destined to do so.

At my age, I don’t know how long I will be able to speak up. My misfortune that I will die without seeing Indians having learned to speak up. Financial fortunes vanish like the privy purses of the kings when you don’t have the wherewithal to protest and protest in time.

I have restrained myself in my statement by stating the obvious to but that may have been lost to the less clued in. Lost in the din of falling share price and the statements by those hiding behind Vishal who portrayed himself to be my victim. He was never my target.

DU's Zero Cut-Off For Ph.D. Admissions For SC/ST Students Is Driving Everyone Up The Wall!,"So, for Ph.D. Mathematics, the qualifying marks is a big, round zero?!

Delhi University's recent cut-off list for SC/ST students for admissions in Ph.D. Mathematics lists zero as the ""minimum marks scored"". Well, it can get any minimum than this!

People are outraged. Rightly so. If this is what the fight, to have the reservation in India, has come to then anyone falling in the General category can simply take a hike.

How did the Department of Mathematics at DU even come up with this cut-off? Why does the OBC have to score an 84? Oh, let's not even heed the sound of the Unreserved's breaking hearts who have to score a 94 to qualify.

This is the interview schedule that is making everyone's blood boil.

Thinning of hair

It all starts from head to toe, the brain first tries to send the signals from the point that is closest to it, i.e. our hair. Unlike the common loss of hair strands, you’ll find you hairline thinning and losing out hair in chunks. Some or the other part of your scalp will lose its hold on the hair and would start showing up. That’s your first signs."
Placebo As Real Remedy,"Your attitude, lifestyle, mental balance and emotional harmony are the best placebos, writes MUKUL SHARMA



Although mentioned in this column earlier, but to reiterate in a revised context, Norman Cousins was a distinguished editor of the Saturday Review for the better part of 40 years, author, professor, political activist and world peace advocate. During the course of his long career he won several accolades including the United Nations Peace Medal, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and Pope John XXIII’s personal medallion. In 1964, however, his life took an unimaginable turn which was to ultimately make him far more famous — and controversial at times too — than he could ever arguably have been otherwise. After returning from a trip to the former USSR, he fell ill and was diagnosed as suffering from a suddenonset case of the crippling connective tissue disease which is also referred to as a collagen disease. Experts at more advanced clinics confirmed this and added a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as well.He was told he had one chance in 500 to survive and given a few months to live, at that. Now Cousins who dabbled in biochemistry and behavioural medicine from time to time read and discovered that both his disease and the medicines were apparently depleting his body of vitamin C, among other things.



He decided to develop his own recovery programme. Accordingly he did three things. One, he got out of hospital against the advice of his doctors and checked himself into a hotel suite nearby; two, he started watching huge amounts of comedy films like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Candid Camera; and, three, he began taking daily megadoses of vitamin C — way above the recommended dosages and in life-threatening proportions. But within six months he was back on his feet, and within two years he was able to return to his full-time job at the Saturday Review. He chronicled his experiences in the best-selling 1979 book Anatomy Of An Illness As Perceived By The Patient. When Cousins had a heart attack 15 years following his earlier illness,he wondered whether it would be possible to recover from two life-threatening conditions in one lifetime, but he was determined that he could. As he was brought into the hospital on a stretcher following the attack, he sat up and said, “Gentlemen, I want you to know that you’re looking at the darnedest healing machine that’s ever been wheeled into this hospital.” Once again Cousins recovered fully and wrote The Healing Heart: Antidotes To Panic And Helplessness.



He finally died in 1990, ten years after his first heart attack, sixteen years after his collagen illness, and twenty-six years after his doctors first diagnosed heart disease. So what’s the new context we’re talking about here now? Well, since Norman Cousins’time it has been unequivocally demonstrated by experiment after experiment that taking hefty outsized doses of vitamin C could have had no effect whatsoever on ankylosing spondylitis.And though laughter can help boost the immune system, it can’t possibly do so to such a ridiculous extent. The incredible effects had to be the result of the placebo effect where if the patient sincerely believes in the efficacy of a surreptitiously administered fake medicine — it still works. When Cousins was later confronted by this scientific evidence, he simply said that given another similar health problem, he would do exactly the same even if he knew it was a nonfunctional medication. Turns out he wasn’t wrong. Recent research at the Harvard Medical School has shown that even when people know they’re getting a fake medication — like being told upfront that it’s a placebo — they get better nonetheless and actually prefer it over what physicians would normally prescribe. It seems one’s attitude, lifestyle, outlook,mental balance and emotional harmony make the best placebo of them all.Yoga teachers and Zen masters have been saying the same thing all along.¦"

Is The Possibility Of A Hybrid Flu Pandemic A Reality? Here’s What You Need To Know,"Flu viruses have been a global threat in modern history ever since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 killed 40-50 million worldwide and infected at least 500 million. And now recent history continues to see the evolution of swine flu into different strains.

holahola

The 2009 swine flu pandemic saw the demise of over 200,000 people worldwide; marking another monumental unprecedented death toll due to a flu virus. India itself has already recorded 1,094 swine flu-related deaths this year.

healthshlok.com

Flu pandemics such as these from the past have shown us that different strains can mix and evolve into new strains of viruses that we have not had answers to. As we face another strain of an avian Influenza Virus (H7N9) that inflicted China not too long ago, scientists are taking matters into their own hands by testing for new viruses that can cause havoc to prepare themselves for the worst.

dailystar.co.uk

One such landmark study mixed a bird flu virus and a human flu virus giving birth to a hybrid flu virus as published in the journal Science.

Why is this important?

ftwonline.co.za

The study was conducted in an effort to understand how bird flu viruses naturally mix with mammal-infected viruses that are present in livestock who act as a host, which then trigger human pandemics.

What strains of viruses did the researchers mix?

mintmochamusings.com

The researchers mixed the deadly ‘swine flu’ virus (H1N1) and a subtype of the ‘influenza A’ virus (H5N1) a bird flu virus to check the potency of the resultant virus.

What is the motive behind creating such a virus?

The researchers claim they are conducting these tests to help develop preventative vaccines for future to avoid pandemic breakouts. Lord May of Oxford, a former government chief scientist and past president of the Royal Society told the Independent UK, “They claim they are doing this to help develop vaccines and such like. In fact, the real reason is that they are driven by blind ambition with no common sense whatsoever”.

What was the outcome of the experiment?

vanguardngr.com

They came up with a total of 127 virus combos; some of which were able to spread through the air. The researchers were trying to emulate a realistic scenario where animals such as pigs get infected with a strain of the virus. The bird flu viruses that were made airborne were able to inflict mammals, including human beings.

Is safe to run such an experiment?

wsau.com

The study was conducted in a laboratory with the second highest security levels in order to ensure that there are no accidental escapes. However, May claimed, “The record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring. They are taking it upon themselves to create human-to-human transmission of very dangerous viruses. It’s appallingly irresponsible.”

So how dangerous is such a virus then?

vustug-info.ru

Since the experiment proved that the bird flu virus (H5N1) was able to mix with the swine flu (H1N1) virus to create a strain that can infect human beings, it doesn’t hurt to pay caution to the wind. Professor Simon Wain-Hobson, an eminent virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said it is likely that some or all of these hybrids could pass easily between humans and possess some or all of the highly lethal characteristics of H5N1 bird-flu, as reported in the Independent UK. “We don’t know the pathogenicity [lethality] in man and hopefully we will never know,” added Hobson.

The result of the experiment still remains unclear, however.

sulnews.com.br

“It’s a fabulous piece of virology by the Chinese group and it’s very impressive, but they haven’t been thinking clearly about what they are doing. It’s very worrying,” added Professor Wain-Hobson said. “The virological basis of this work is not strong. It is of no use for vaccine development and the benefit in terms of surveillance for new flu viruses is oversold”.

Virologist Dr Vladimir Blinov had predicted next hybrid flu (swine flu and bird flu) after one that appeared in 1957, the H2N2 that took 2 million lives, can come from CHINA this year in a report by Daily Star.

Signs that show he’s in it just for sex,"The first few dates with that cute guy you had been crushing on forever on might have been the best, and he may have been as charming as they come. But what if the charismatic guy you think you know is with you only casually? Watch out for these five red flags that show the guy you’ve been dating is in it only for sex.







He’s mostly only available late at night

This one is a classic sign of a booty-caller. He will be MIA the whole day, and in the night, when you’re just about to snuggle inside your warm blanket, he texts you asking you to come over. If this happens once in a blue moon it’s still fine, but if he makes a habit of it, girl, you need to open your eyes.





He doesn’t introduce you to his friends

It’s not uncommon for couples to not introduce their partners to their friends immediately, but if you believe that he hasn’t even told anyone about you, that’s a little red flag peeping out right there. Additionally, if he asks you to not tell any of your friends about you guys, it’s time to RUN!





He makes it difficult for you to stay over

He calls you over for a quickie, but you’re never allowed to stay the night. He will try every tactic in the book to wash his hands off you, citing reasons like he’s got work to do, has to wake up super-duper early in the morning, even corny stuff like ‘babe, if you stay over we’ll never get a wink of sleep all night’.





He takes hours to respond to your texts

We don’t believe in replying to texts within three seconds of receiving them, but when you can see that the guy is online but isn’t replying to you, it’s obvious to find it fishy. Moreover, if the guy hardly ever texts you, and when he does, it’s only to ask for nudies, well then, why are you still with him?





He only compliments your looks

In the beginning, it will make you feel super-sexy and desirable, but soon enough, the way he admires only your appearance will start getting to you. There’s a world of a difference between guys who only find you hot, as opposed to guys who think you’re as smart and funny as you are hot and pretty."

Bhuvneshwar's Test-like innings helps India script dramatic turnaround,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Bhuvneshwar's Test-like innings helps India script dramatic turnaround

• Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 04:18 AM Gokul Gopal in Kandy

Sri Lanka restricted to 236, two century stands, another in the line of Indian victories and a 2-0 lead - just reading this line would seem like it was just one more day of routine work for Virat Kohli's side in what has been a one-sided series so far. But a closer inspection of the scorecard would reveal it was anything but that on Thursday (August 24). Going strong at 109 for no loss, with Rohit Sharma ending his lean patch in Sri Lanka, it appeared like India were on course towards a facile win. Along came Akila Dananjaya, a 23-year-old who got married only the previous day, but joining the team instead of contemplating on the honeymoon destination, finding a place in the XI and then going on to turn the match on its head.

Introduced into the attack at the start of the 12th over, following a century opening stand, Dananjaya had different plans as he bamboozled the Indian batsmen to reduce the visitors to 131 for 7. His contributions in the collapse that occurred were six wickets, including that of Kedar Jadhav, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul - in the same over - though, wouldn't go on to take another wicket, neither would Sri Lanka, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni the finisher came to the fore and Bhuvneshwar Kumar turned out to be a batting hero.

When Bhuvneshwar came in to bat in the 22nd over, Dananjaya was set to bowl his last ball of his sixth over. Like most batsmen before him, he too received a googly first up, but managed to negate it to live another over. The danger, though, was imminent as here was bowler against whom the top-order batsmen had no clue - whether he was bowling leg-breaks, googlies, off-breaks or sliders - India's batting was in a confused state. Bhuvneshwar too found it tough initially to read the bowler, but managed to hang around and support Dhoni in adding another twist to the tale that was the second ODI.

""I had a plan against him. Basically he is an offspinner but he was also bowling leg-spinners and googlies so it was a surprise for us. When I went in I just wanted to play him as a (bowler who delivers) wrong ones or the googlies which he was bringing in to me. And whatever was going away from me I wasn't really worried about that. Whatever wickets he took that was on the googly, the incoming delivery, so my plan was to counter his incoming deliveries. Initially it was a bit difficult to read him from the hand but later on when I played him for 10-15 balls I could read his variations from the hand,"" said Bhuvneshwar at the post-match press conference.

In an extended spell, Dananjaya bowled two more overs - which made it eight straight overs for him - but Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar kept him at arm's length and began a fightback that ensured India's tryst with experiments did not blow on their face. After the end of the opening stand, it was Rahul and not Kohli who walked out to bat. The Indian skipper pushed himself down the order after another wicket went down, sending Kedar Jadhav in at No. 4. The shuffle and Indian batsmen's struggles to pick the young spinner left the visiting side facing the prospect of suffering their first defeat on this Sri Lanka tour.

But India found a new contributor in Bhuvneshwar, who came up with a match-winning 53 and played a prominent role in an unbeaten eighth wicket stand worth 100 runs with Dhoni. When the two came together, the immediate need was to arrest the slide and build a partnership. The boundaries, therefore, dried up and the strike rates of the batsmen weren't ones usually associated with limited-overs cricket. Dhoni, during his stay for an unbeaten 45 off 68 deliveries, scored only one four while Bhuvneshwar took the more aggressive route. But that would only come later in the partnership, which was initially about damage control.

""It was a little surprising because we had a very good opening partnership,"" Bhuvneshwar said about the top-order collapse. ""Then 3-4 wickets fell quickly so it was a bit of a panic situation for us, we were thinking 'okay what has happened here'. But when I went in to bat, MS [Dhoni] told me to play my natural game like I play in Test cricket. Don't take any pressure as we had a lot of overs at that time and we knew if we played them out we would chase easily. So when I went in there wasn't any pressure really because I knew there is nothing to lose in this situation as we were already seven down. I was just thinking that I can play and that I have to support MS as much as I can. And that's what I tried to do,"" added Bhuvneshwar, describing his intentions during his partnership with Dhoni.

Crediting the batting coach for helping him enhance his skills, Bhuvneshwar, who considers himself as player shaped in the Test mould as far as his batting skills are concerned, said the task at hand was similar to playing out a session in the five-day format.

""Thanks to Sanjay Bangar, he has been working really hard with me. Test cricket is different, one day cricket is different but this situation was as good as Test cricket because (it was like) having to go through a session. When I went in, that was thing that went through my mind so the good thing was that the situation was totally familiar. Whenever I go into the nets, Bangar helps me to counter those things like I have to go through the last session of a Test. So it was same kind of situation and that was a bit familiar for me,"" Bhuvneshwar explained.

""I never thought in my dreams that I would score fifty in one dayers... not fifty but a match-winning knock because one-day is a kind of format which doesn't suit my batting. I am not the kind of batsman who can hit big sixes. But that kind of situation was perfect for me because it was totally a Test match situation. When I went in MS said the same thing, 'play the way you play in Test matches'. I didn't want to do anything different. Just wanted to play all those overs.""

Having suffered a few collapses in the last couple of months, including the ICC Champions Trophy final against Pakistan and the ODI against Windies in Antigua, this victory would come as a huge sigh of relief for the Indian team. And it was all thanks to Bhuvneshwar's solid application with the bat and Dhoni's unyielding essay that they managed to overcome a scare and script a turnaround.

Why Men Are More Likely To Be In A Grumpy Mood At Around 2pm In The Afternoon!,"As a guy, you’re prone to be a little a grumpy in the afternoon as compared to in the morning or evening hours. Not because we assume so because science says so!

cementmarketing.com

A recent study claims that men find their mood most slumped at around 2 pm in the afternoon!

Scientists from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia came up with this conclusion after taking the brain scans of men during various times of the day.

yamuzhchina.ru

The reason the researchers stated was due to of the activation of the reward-processing brain regions of the brain at different times of the day.

The findings showed that activation of a reward-processing region of the brain peaks in the morning and evening and dips at 2 p.m.

For the study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the team compared activation of the brain's reward system in young men during a gambling task at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.

trend.ge

They found that activation in the left putamen was lowest in the early afternoon. This finding may parallel the drop in alertness people tend to feel in mid-afternoon, the researchers said.

""While the left putamen had the greatest activation at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., it had significantly lowered activation at 2 p.m.,"" Jamie Byrne from the varsity was quoted as saying to Daily Mail.

""The left putamen is particularly responsive to unexpected rewards, so our data suggest that the brain's reward centres might be primed to expect rewards in the early afternoon and be surprised when they appear at the start and end of the day,"" Byrne added.

Fear to tread: Should the travel advisory for every place on earth be ‘Don’t’?,"Only the date line changes. Exactly a week ago, London, Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Delhi, Islamabad respectfully made way for Barcelona. ‘Mowing down tourists is the new normal’ despaired the Evening Standard while Londoners sat transfixed to the too- familiar photograph of a bloodied avenue. Las Ramblas, the very metaphor of hedonism, had been bustling with carefree crowds when a van emerged like a bat out of hell – driven with a fervour linked to the promise of heaven. The next Monday, a bomb alert evacuated the same stretch.

East and West have met in terror. True, each had had enough of its own, but now it’s of a common genre. What demons – or angels – drive 22-year-olds to get behind a wheel and ram coldly into unsuspecting strangers? And how alert can we be when jihad comes via such everyday objects as a van, kitchen knife – or the tiffin box bombs of Mumbai and Delhi.

This column swells from my time on the Ramblas, my awe over something as civilised as a 1.2 km thoroughfare dedicated to pedestrians, leaving vehicles to fend for themselves on its margins. My first encounter with this incredible boulevard came at an international AIDS conference in 2002. It was where India’s HIV-afflicted finally found their voice, and through which a flamboyant Shatrughan Sinha swaggered as health minister. So the many stories to be filed kept me away from Las Ramblas’s tireless blandishments. But my hotel was right on it, and i went to bed with riffs of laughter and the weeping of violins. In the morning when i walked to catch my tube, it lay exhausted from its multiple orgasms.

Two other visits allowed a more touristy appreciation. Of the Ramblas’s gilded ‘statue’ men, the segueing of the world’s accents, the flowers, food and baubles, the eccentric Gaudi architecture just off it, and suave Hispanics seducing over La Riojas or returning from a late-late concert, the men in long formal skirts (you read that right).

Now in London, my two always-must-dos are also stained by recent attacks: the Borough market and Westminster bridge. But the crowds still mill undaunted. It’s the most effective thumbed-nose to terror. Or so they say.

De Villiers gives up ODI captaincy; available to play all three formats

South African batsman AB de Villiers has stepped down as the captain of the One-Day International side with immediate effect. With so much speculation surrounding his Test future, de Villiers also made it clear on Wednesday (August 23) that he will be available to play in all three formats of the game from late September when South Africa begin their home season.

He last led South Africa in ODIs during the Champions Trophy in May-June, which ended in major disappointment as the side couldn't even make it past the Group Stages. Following the tournament, he had to fill in temporarily for Faf du Plessis as the T20I skipper for the series against England.

Making the announcement through a video released on his app, de Villiers felt that it was time for someone else to take over the role. He also pulled his weight behind Faf du Plessis, who has done a good job leading the Test and T20I teams.

Looking forward to a great summer #ProteaFire pic.twitter.com/yojybIrvjZ — AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) August 23, 2017

""Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I've informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,"" de Villiers said. ""It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for somebody else to lead the ODI team forward.""

There has been a lot of speculation and even disappointment among fans, about him opting out of Test matches. It has led to much concern over his future in the longest format of the game. De Villiers last played a Test in January 2016, against England, and has since been unavailable due to either injury or workload concerns. Addressing those doubts, de Villiers completely dismissed suggestions that he was putting himself before the team.

""A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,"" de Villiers stated. ""Over the past year or so, I've tried to manage my commitments. I've felt mentally and physically tired. Playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll. Together with Cricket South Africa, we've tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say that I'm picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas and even to suggest I'm somehow putting myself before the team. This is simply not true. Playing for South Africa is and will always be the greatest privilege of my life.

""Following this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived. I want to get back on the field and I have assured the national selectors that I'll be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly. But I'll be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.""

South Africa's next assignment is against Bangladesh, when they come touring in late September. The tour begins with a two-Test series, followed by three ODIs and two T20Is.

New rail boss? Cabinet reshuffle to improve efficacy of ministries is in order,"After two train accidents in five days – the Khatauli incident on August 19 that killed 23 people was followed by the August 23 derailment of the Kaifiyat Express in Auraiya district that injured 74 – railway minister Suresh Prabhu has offered to quit his post. It’s clear now that a deep rot exists in railways operations that is preventing the mass mover’s modernisation. Unlike his predecessors, Prabhu made a good beginning by not announcing new trains. His focus has been on managing long-term finance of the railways, sprucing up hygiene and passenger amenities, and upgrading platforms and stations. However, he could not do much by way of operational reforms as he was unable to handle the stubborn railway bureaucracy and resolve inter-departmental feuds.

While a final call on Prabhu’s resignation offer is yet to be taken, government would do well to effect a Cabinet reshuffle at this juncture. True, government has done a good job in articulating big policies. But implementation continues to lag behind. Looking ahead at the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, government needs ministers who will deliver on the ground. It needs to ensure big welfare schemes reach intended beneficiaries. Otherwise, the vision-delivery mismatch could prove electorally costly.

In this respect, government needs to choose ministers on the basis of merit, not political or caste considerations. This is particularly important because there will be pressure to grant ministries to new ally JD(U) and BJP leaders from states going to polls. However, agreeing to this won’t help government turn things around. Besides, there is ample scope to merge related ministries and capture synergies. Needless bifurcation such as between skill development and human resource development dilutes focus. Similarly, ministries of power, coal, mines and new and renewable energy can all be merged. It’s time for government to cut flab and make ministries leaner and more effective."
The Best Way Out,"Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape, the problems will continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life, says MARGUERITE THEOPHIL



Sometimes, it feels easier to avoid a problem or challenge — or even an opportunity that has no guaranteed positive outcome. You distract yourself, make excuses, procrastinate; do anything but enter the situation. There are times when this is simply self-preservation; nothing too wrong there — but often it keeps you from entering a space that will help you learn and grow or keeps you stuck in a place that diminishes you. Sometimes,though,you are thrown into just such a situation, ready or not. You struggle, going through most stages of what is called the ‘grief cycle’, an extended form of this being the stages of shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression — but you stop short of the last two: testing (of realistic options and solutions) and acceptance. This is because often acceptance does not mean the end of things; it is the beginning of moving into spaces, into decisions, into unfamiliar ways of being you would rather not move into. Such an attitude and the corresponding behaviours are often referred to as escapism. Escapism is when you try to avoid something. Some escape by excessive sleeping, shopping, eating, playing or inordinate time spent online. Some drown themselves in work; or alcohol or drugs. We all know people who stay in jobs or abusive marriages only because they are afraid of failure in pursuing what they love, or because they are not sure if there is another better someone elsewhere.People who avoid challenges because they are afraid of possible pain and suffering; who avoid healing their past because they are reminded of their deepest sorrows;who avoid confronting issues because they think they have no strength to face them.



‘Better the devil we know…’ they say sadly. Rather than ease your pain and suffering, this attitude prolongs and sometimes deepens them. At times people think the solution is to bury them or numb themselves to their effects — but the issue and its effects just stay dormant, silently growing until the day it will all resurface. Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape from, your issues will not miraculously disappear.They continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life — getting stuck again and again in similar situations and contexts, thinking the same things,feeling the same emotions,doing the same things, linking up with similar people. Looping patterns require conscious intervention in order to break out of them.And the best and most wise advice for these times — though not that easy to follow — is:‘The best way out is through.’ An old teaching story comes to mind: Once upon a time, there was a tortoise on a ship, and the ship sank in the middle of the ocean.The tortoise made it to a bit of land surrounded by water on all sides except for one. The strip of barren land led up to a high, steep, craggy mountain. To avoid starving to death, the tortoise decided to climb to the top,hoping that he would be able to cross, and find something to eat on the other side. You would know this would take a long, long time; not only was the terrain daunting — this is a tortoise we are talking about! When he finally got to the snow-covered summit he was freezing cold, and then a blizzard started.



He just managed to make out a narrow pathway leading down the other side of the mountain and made his way towards it. But ahead on the path was a big monster that wouldn’t stop shouting, ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ This sound and his fear almost killed the tortoise; all he wanted to do was hide his head inside his shell. But, looking around him, he noticed many other animals of all sizes lying there, frozen to death. He summoned up all his courage to move down the path towards the monster.The closer the tortoise got, the more the monster changed its shape. Then, when he was almost upon it, the tortoise realised that what he had thought was a monster, was only a great pile of rocks, what he thought were dead frozen animals were other smaller rocks. As for the ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ — the tortoise realised this was just the sound of the wind blowing through a small cave. He made his slow but determined way to the greenery that he could see ahead. Remember, in the process of working through your issues, you don’t always win quickly. Sometimes you may make some progress, only to slide back later.



Sometimes, you get beaten back down almost immediately, particularly if it involves dealing with something you have been struggling with for a long time. Don’t be afraid of asking for help or guidance; admitting you need help does not make you weak, it makes you strong.You might need help and support of others, professionals or loved ones, to ‘hang in there’, but ultimately, it is your journey. Yet being convinced that the best way out is through, you find out that as long as you keep going, as long as you keep confronting your issues, as long as you keep fighting, as long as you confront your fears, as long as you know that the way out lies through and beyond all this — you become stronger and stronger, and find a way to conquer the mess.

11 Heartwarming Instances Which Prove That Humanity Trumps Every Religion & Caste,"Indians always get smitten by the momentous consequences of secularism in our country. Amid the murmur and babble that goes around validating the comeuppance of those asserting within religion, society, and groups, lies a society that's bonded.

We have instances where altercations between two people have led to communal unrest, where a word-war has lead to haggling of family members or mob lynching and where a 'rapist' from a different community is seen as community agenda.

But who is to say that India is a land of diversity and this multifariousness thrives in every part of the nation. We have people from Sikh community who have gone over and beyond their code of conduct to help distraught people, we have Hindus assisting Muslims during Ramadan and Muslim men risking their lives to save victims or Muslim women who have been making Shiva Lingas for 17 years.

Here we have curated a list of some instances that validate the bond of love Indians share and swear by.

Pooriben Leuwa, an 85-year-old Hindu woman has been fasting during Ramzan for the past 34 years, says that she and her Muslim friends ""share a faith called love"".

""For the past two years I have not been keeping well,"" Pooriben said. ""My family and my doctor have allowed me just three Rozas this year - 27th, 28th and 29th. But I argue with them every day to allow me to observe the entire 40 days.""

Must you remember Hafiz Junaid, a 16-years-old who was killed because he was carrying beef, you'd retrieve just how excruciating and troublesome his death was.



In the wake of Junaid’s lynching, people from his village Khandwali, in Ballabhgarh, have decided not to celebrate Eid and sport black armbands while offering Namaz, marking a silent protest. The village sarpanch said that Eid would not be a splendid event this time. Their decision has found resonance with a large section of people from all communities across the country, who have copied the gesture to express solidarity with Muslims.

More than 64 people died during the floods that took Gujarat by storm. In this time of death and destruction, some 3,500 Muslims from Dhanera, Deesa, Palanpur and nearby villages trooped into the aid of the town, cleaning places of worship and residents alike, after water started receding slowly.

After the currency ban took the entire nation by storm, a lot of people lost their lives out of tension, and some became ill, just waiting for their turn to come.

Baby Taimur Is All Set To Star In Mommy Kareena's Upcoming Film And We Just Can't Keep Calm!,"Bollywood's eternal Pooh AKA Kareena Kapoor Khan is one of the most popular actresses but in no way is her baby Taimur behind. If we talk about the popularity meter on the internet, Taimur definitely is way ahead of Mommy Kareena. All it takes is just one adorable picture and it breaks the internet for days.

Kareena is gearing up for her comeback in films with Rhea Kapoor's Veerey Di Wedding and if latest reports are to be believed, Taimur Ali Khan might have at least one shot in the film.

Viral Bhayani

Kareena's pregnancy was one of the reasons why there had to be some plot twists in the film and the team zeroed down on adding Kareena's pregnancy angle in the film and that's how Taimur will also become a part of the project.

A Deccan Chronicle report quotes a source saying,

“They are working it into the script. Taimur will make an appearance in Veere De Wedding. He is the star on the set. He will be the star of Veere De Wedding as well.""

"Let’s talk about discrimination: Supreme Court outlawing triple talaq was no surprise, it should have gone further","There is something naturally perverse about a husband being given the right to annul his marriage unilaterally by merely uttering the word ‘talaq’ thrice. It does not require an Islamic cleric or a constitutional scholar to find this practice abhorrent, discriminatory and disrespectful of women. It was thus little surprise that the Supreme Court outlawed instant triple talaq, a judgment hailed for empowering women in their struggle for gender equality.

But that is unfortunately where praise for the judgment must begin and end. Scarcely has a judgment with such a progressive outcome been underpinned by such regressive reasoning. The dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Khehar and Justice Nazeer considers triple talaq, despite being discriminatory, to be protected by freedom of religion in the Constitution. To offset this result, they recommend legislation by Parliament on this issue and before such legislation, prevent Muslim husbands from pronouncing triple talaq.

Justices Nariman and Lalit, in their majority view, consider Sharia law to have been statutorily incorporated by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. Given that all laws enacted by the legislature have to be in conformity with the Constitution, they hold Section 2 of the Act, to the extent that it enforces triple talaq, to be arbitrary. Justice Kurian, the swing vote, agrees with the conclusion of the majority that triple talaq is invalid. However he comes to this conclusion not on constitutional grounds, but pursuant to an ecclesiastical finding that triple talaq has no basis in the Quran.

The dissenting opinion is surely astonishing. If personal law can be constitutionally protected, then it is commonsensical that such personal law can also be challenged on constitutional grounds. Further, if it is constitutionally protected, neither can a Muslim husband be disallowed from exercising his fundamental right to pronounce triple talaq nor can Parliament be expected to come up with a law that says otherwise.

On the contrary Justice Kurian’s swing vote holds, arguably correctly, that instant triple talaq is against the tenets of the Quran and consequently not part of Sharia law. Given it is not part of Sharia law, he considers it outlawed by the Act and hence invalid. To resolve the matter at hand, this is sufficient. However, as an approach to resolving knotty questions of personal law, this enquiry would require judges to delve deep into religious texts to ascertain their true meaning.

The hazards of such an exercise are well-known to the judiciary from what followed in the aftermath of the Shah Bano judgment (1985). Sacrificing constitutional adjudication at the altar of religious pontification from the Bench is an unwitting dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution.

In contrast, a more conscious dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution takes place in the majority opinion of Justices Nariman and Lalit. By holding that the Court has the power to strike down parliamentary legislation as arbitrary under Article 14, it has converted a question of the rights of Muslim women into a contest for one-upmanship with Parliament. This is not what a landmark judgment for gender equality looks like – on the contrary its express silence on the core question of discrimination, speaks louder than its words.

Even when it has spoken – to partially outlaw Section 2 of the Act as arbitrary – it is conceptually flawed. Its finding compounds a conceptual misadventure that began with Justice Bhagwati’s view in Royappa (1973). Royappa held that governmental action could be challenged as arbitrary under Article 14 because the right to equality, enshrined in Article 14 mandated the rule of law, which was the antithesis of arbitrary state action.

Two examples demonstrate why bringing arbitrariness in through the backdoor of equality in Article 14 was faulty. If all spectrum licenses are cancelled with inadequate reasons by the state it is arbitrary, but hardly an act of inequality; conversely if universities have different rules for men and women in the interest of safety, the rules are unequal, but hardly arbitrary. Simply put, equality and arbitrariness are not the same thing.

Using arbitrariness as a sword to scythe through parliamentary legislation, risks the danger of collapsing the whole of the Constitution into one article. If Article 14 means arbitrariness and arbitrariness means nothing but the rule of law, then simply replacing the mass of provisions with Article 14 should do. This result means that the Damocles’ sword of a free-floating judicial determination of arbitrariness now hangs over every parliamentary and state legislation in this country.

In terms of upsetting separation of powers and arrogating powers to itself, this judgment trumps even the NJAC case. Politicians in a celebratory mood would be well-served to recognise that the Constitution is no longer supreme, the judges are.

In the final analysis, it is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women’s rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women. On a matter critical to the lives of women in India, when five male judges of the Supreme Court rule on arcane questions of constitutional and ecclesiastical law instead of calling out personal laws as discriminatory, one knows that even if a victory has been achieved, the battle for gender equality will continue to remain a long and hard one."
"Trump’s Afghanistan strategy, if followed through, opens a window of opportunity for India","Donald Trump’s gut instinct had said something else, but the demands of the Oval Office prompted him to deliver a “presidential” South Asia strategy. If it is followed through it can have wide-ranging implications for the region. Most important, it gives India a small opportunity to reshape the region and its role in the larger Asian geopolitics.

The good: US understands Pakistan is the problem, and for the first time we saw language on Pakistan that we would have liked to see a decade ago, both from Trump as well as Tillerson. For the second time since 9/11, Pakistan appears to be at a “with-us-or-against-us” moment.

Even more important, US apparently no longer believes, as generations of Pak-hugging Americans did, that Pakistan can be incentivised towards better behaviour if India could be kept out of Afghanistan or more lenient on Kashmir. Not that long ago, US was asking India how many consulates we had in Afghanistan, asking us to “do less”. Thankfully Osama bin Laden, Mullah Mansour and a host of other terror notables chillin’ out in Pakistan contributed to a change of heart, at least among the generals if not in Foggy Bottom.

The new strategy, as Tillerson clarified, will focus on not allowing Taliban/ al-Qaida to win, or the US to “lose”. Through that deliciously vague strategy, Washington is signalling they now “have the watches and they have the time”, opening up the space for a whole range of options to be exercised on Af-Pak in the coming months from drones to economic sanctions, CT operations, etc. Nobody knows the winning combination, but the generals who have skin in the game, McMaster, Mattis and Kelly, may do what they have always wanted to. By not releasing troop numbers, they have allowed themselves a degree of flexibility while keeping political pressure at bay.

On the ground, the situation is dire. The alphabet soup of terror groups from al-Qaida to Haqqanis, Taliban and LeT are not distinct entities, as Bill Roggio points out, they are closer today than they have ever been. It’s not for nothing that Sirajuddin Haqqani is the deputy chief of Taliban, and Haqqanis have been close to al-Qaida just as LeT, which was born in Kunar, is close to Taliban. In some areas Taliban have even worked together with Islamic State.

Afghanistan has got one more shot at getting things right. Ashraf Ghani’s dysfunctional government has to get its act together as well. Apart from building infrastructure India can play a role here, to beat some sense into the feuding boys – Ghani and Abdullah – with Hamid Karzai on spoiler alert.

Yes, India can invest a lot more in Afghanistan. More infrastructure, more development projects will undoubtedly follow after the Indian government completes its own Af-Pak review, which was waiting for the US one. But India cannot deliver governance. It’s an issue India has always skirted around, but it needs to be addressed.

India has an opportunity to work with both Russia and Iran to revive the spirit of the 90s, when all three faced a common enemy. In fact, the speech gives India an opening – the stabilisation of Afghanistan should be seen within the larger regional matrix involving China, Iran and Russia, all of whom can play negative roles as Russia and Iran show. This is not in India’s interest, and India needs to work harder to offset US-Russia, US-Iran hostility.

Neither Trump’s speech nor Tillerson’s reading of the riot act to Pakistan’s foreign minister in the coming days will change Pakistan’s behaviour or strategy substantively, or, for that matter Taliban/al-Qaida’s – yesterday’s suicide attack in Lashkargah showed the enormity of the problem. Pakistan will bank on China to offset the pressure the Americans will undoubtedly exert, and hope their nukes will do the rest. Pakistan will continue to bet on the US giving up before they do. Which is possible, and Indians will be watching out for US/Trump giving up before Pakistan/Taliban.

As for re-hyphenation with Pakistan, India remains the world’s biggest “hyphenator”, so don’t lose too much sleep over it. Instead, we should reflect on this unexpected window of opportunity and make the most of it before things start going south, as they inevitably will."

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
SRK's Gorgeous Blue Villa In Dubai Will Not Be Taxed Despite Being For Rs 15 Crore. Here's Why,"Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan is one of the richest celebs in the world. And expectedly, he has properties across the globe, one of which is the stunning Dubai villa along the Palm beach.

It recently came under the radar for not being income taxed for so many years. However, the income-tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) has rejected the tax department's view that a villa in Dubai gifted to Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan a decade ago was a camouflage to evade income tax. The tribunal has held that the value of the villa cannot be treated as the actor's taxable income.

The villa had been gifted to Khan under a formal gift deed in 2007 after he obtained the RBI's approval.

I-T authorities were of the view that the donor, Nakheel PJSC, a Dubai-based company known for the famous Palm Projects, had gifted the villa as it was keen on using the actor's image and brand. The actor is a globally known figure and has endorsed various foreign brands for remuneration running into a few crores. Thus, the gift was seen as remuneration to Khan for utilising his brand image and in lieu of his stage performance at the company's annual day event. In light of this, the I-T authorities sought to tax the value of the villa as income in SRK's hands.

Twitter



During the assessment for the financial year 2007-08, I-T officials added the value of the villa — Rs 17.85 crore — to the income of Rs 126.3 crore declared by Khan in his I-T return. The actor would have had to pay I-T on this additional sum. At the first stage of appeal, the commissioner (appeals), agreed with the I-T authorities. Based on a valuation report, though, he reduced the addition to Rs 14.7 crore.

Twitter



Appealing before ITAT, Khan, through his counsel, said the chairman of the company, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, was his friend and thus wished to make the gift. He admitted to attending the annual day event but said he merely addressed the employees and did not perform on stage, which would have amounted to brand endorsement. On taxation of a gift in kind, ITAT pointed out that for the relevant financial year, gifts of immovable property made without any consideration were out of the tax ambit.

Momentous judgment: Locating privacy in the Constitution upholds civil liberties in a digitally networked era,"The 9-0 Supreme Court judgment pronouncing right to privacy as a fundamental right intrinsic to the right to life and personal liberty protected by Article 21 is a great victory for the Indian citizen. That the Constitution does not specifically mention privacy has been held against privacy as a right. But it can nevertheless be derived from Article 21, as well as the Preamble to the Constitution which upholds the dignity of the individual. Without the right to privacy there is no defence against an Orwellian surveillance state, or against data and identity theft and misuse.

Previous SC judgments had mixed views on recognising privacy as a fundamental right. The recognition that it needed a larger nine-judge bench to settle the matter conclusively led us to yesterday’s momentous judgment. We live in a time when technology allows the state to conceive an Aadhaar database that can uniquely identify a billion plus residents, where private corporations with and without consent amass vast storehouses of personal data, and arms of the state and vigilante forces use the power of law and lawlessness to intrude into homes in search of beef, homosexual persons, and even witches.

Justice Chandrachud, writing for three more judges, describes privacy as the “constitutional core of human dignity” protecting “heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture”. In delineating three zones – intimate, private and public – where privacy operates, his judgment offers lawmakers clarity on how privacy expectations vary. The other judgments also affirmed that privacy is a “core freedom” while leaving the scope and changing nature of privacy restrictions for case-by-case appraisal. In a changing technological landscape, this is the correct approach. Nevertheless, the verdict has wide implications.

The December 2013 SC judgment that re-criminalised homosexuality and rejected privacy claims of LGBT community comes under question. The Union government, which opposed privacy as a fundamental right, must now convince SC that collection of biometric data and Aadhaar use in welfare schemes and weeding out fraudulent PAN cards serve legitimate public purposes. The judgment reiterates that privacy is not absolute and balance must be struck between individual interests and legitimate aims like national security, criminal investigations, encouraging innovation and preventing leakages. But the tendency to wrest ownership of data away from individuals and expand Aadhaar to every conceivable arena must now surmount the privacy check. Governments, corporations and individuals must fall in line."

An inalienable privacy right: Supreme Court puts constitutional check to creeping majoritarianism of our times,"It’s been a historic week in the Supreme Court. On Tuesday a divided five judge Constitutional Bench of the Court declared triple talaq unconstitutional – a verdict that the Union government argued for and welcomed. On Thursday, a unanimous nine judge Constitutional Bench declared that all persons in India have an inalienable fundamental right to privacy. The Union government precipitated the formation of a nine judge Bench and argued vehemently that no such right existed.

As things turned out Chief Justice Khehar, who retires this weekend, will do so with the satisfaction that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed its commitment to protect fundamental rights with a resolute 9-0 verdict. While the court was unanimous it still took 547 pages to spell out its position. While Justice Chandrachud carried three other judges with him, five judges concurred but wrote separate opinions.

So the court delivered six separate opinions and decoding the plurality to ascertain the majority view on several points of law is likely to engage lawyers, law students and legal academics well after Chief Justice Khehar has retired. I will present here the key findings of the court and indicate where there are different views on these issues.

All judges agree that privacy is a fundamental right in the Constitution. Justice Chelameswar makes it clear that while the text of the Constitution does not expressly provide for such a right it may be implied from the phrase ‘personal liberty’ in Article 21. Justice Chandrachud and others go further to locate this privacy right in a holistic reading of Article 14, 19 and 21. Justice Nariman is very precise in locating the three dimensions of privacy in three different configurations of constitutional articles: privacy of the physical body in Article 19(1)(d) and (e) and Article 21; informational privacy in Article 21 and privacy as personal choice and autonomy in Articles 19(1) (a) to (c) and Articles 20(3), 21 and 25.

While such a listing may appear to be legal arcania, this is evidence of the depth of the court’s commitment to the protection of the scope and content of the privacy right. When legislation is challenged for a privacy violation it’s constitutional provenance that will determine its relative priority to other constitutional values as well as the exceptions and limitations to the right.

The scope of the privacy right varies between the various opinions. Justices Chandrachud and Nariman sketch out a fully developed privacy right that protects individual data and information from state and non-state actors, personal autonomy and intimate personal choices as well as the protection of personal dignity wherever that may be infringed. Together they form a majority view on the scope of the privacy right.

They also agree that model of constitutional interpretation and conclusions reached in the infamous ADM Jabalpur emergency detention case needs to be expressly overruled so that such view may not be resurrected in Indian constitutional law and politics. They were at pains to clarify that such a privacy right was not the obsession of the wealthy and privileged – an expression of post-materialist values – but was at the core of the protection of the autonomy and dignity of the poorest citizen of this country. They understood privacy to be a foundational value – the core of a liberal Constitution – on which the constitutional values of dignity, fraternity and liberty could be achieved.

The rhetorical and legal force of these conclusions would leave most observers curious about the radiating effects of this opinion. What does this decision mean for the Aadhaar case and the Koushal case which was discussed in oral arguments? While the judges did not decisively rule on the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar law and remanded the case back to the Constitutional Bench set up for this purpose, at least four judges took a view that would shake the constitutional defence of Aadhaar.

Justice Chandrachud, who spoke for four judges, was clear that the only limitations that could be imposed on privacy were on national security, criminal enforcement and welfare distribution grounds. While the tenor of Justice Nariman’s views would raise similar doubts on the constitutional validity of Aadhaar he did not express this unequivocally.

At least six judges took the view that the privacy right protected individual choices and autonomy on intimate personal choices. Justices Chandrachud and Kaul expressly referred to the Koushal case and were clear that the case was wrong to the extent that it did not pay adequate attention to the privacy right. Justice Nariman’s endorsement of the core value of personal autonomy and choice to be the foundation of all constitutional rights and values leaves little manoeuvring room for the five judge bench that will review this case shortly.

Justice Khehar inherited a court that was locked in two simultaneous battles: with the executive over judicial appointments and its hostile approach to constitutional litigation represented by the previous belligerent Attorney General. Secondly, there was an unresolved internal battle over the collegium process with dissension and dysfunction. With the decision in KS Puttaswamy, Justice Misra will receive a court that has rebuffed executive government belligerence and resolved internal dissension to the extent that Justice Chelameswar and Justice Khehar both endorse a robust constitutional right to privacy. It will now be his turn to protect the court and guide it through the creeping majoritarianism of our times."

Dananjaya's near wedding gift to Sri Lanka,"COUNTRY FIRST

Dananjaya's near wedding gift to Sri Lanka

• Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 01:25 AM Rex Clementine in Kandy

For good measure, Sri Lanka had been thoroughly outplayed by India in the ongoing bilateral series even before the scene shifted to Pallekele for the second of the five-match ODI leg. The hosts had been whitewashed 3-0 in the Tests and suffered a heavy defeat in the first ODI in Dambulla by nine wickets. Along expected lines, India took a 2-0 lead on Thursday (August 24), but it needed a remarkable comeback as MS Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar added an unbroken 100-run stand for the eighth wicket after India had slipped to 131 for 7.

Young Akila Dananjaya so nearly disturbed the established order and won the game for the hosts. The off-spinner was introduced to the attack in the 12th over and turned the game upside down, finishing with career-best figures of 6 for 54.

Dananjaya had tied the knot less than 24 hours before the game at his hometown in Moartuwa (some 150 kilometers from Kandy) to childhood sweetheart Nethalie Tekshini. But instead of going on the honeymoon; he was back in the team hotel in Kandy that night ahead of the second ODI.

""Dananjaya left for Moratuwa for his wedding on Tuesday from Kandy. He was back in the team hotel by 11:30 PM on Wednesday night. His wife came along as well to the team hotel and we are very happy with the performance he came up with "" Sri Lanka's Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha told Cricbuzz.

Sri Lanka's veteran spinner Rangana Herath was the witness at Dananjaya's wedding. Although none of his current team-mates were present, most other Sri Lankan cricketers, including spinner Ajantha Mendis, had been in attendance.

Daananjaya's bride was present at the ground to witness her husband winning the Man of the Match despite Sri Lanka ending up second best on the day. The 24-year-old had taken four wickets in the last game he played - against Zimbabwe in Hambantota - and was expected to play the opening fixture against India in Dambulla. But the Sri Lankans opted for the left-arm wrist spin of Lakshan Sandakan instead as he had enjoyed a decent outing in the final Test at Pallekele.

Dananjaya first rose to prominence when Mahela Jayawardene and Graham Ford picked him from nowhere for Sri Lanka's World T20 campaign at home in 2012. He had impressed the then Sri Lankan management as a net bowler and they wanted him fast tracked to the senior side despite not having played any first class cricket.

On Thursday, with his bowling, Dhananjaya became a soothing balm for thousands of Sri Lankan fans, who have endured several humiliating defeats in the year. He ended the 109-run opening wicket stand between Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan when Rohit was trapped leg before wicket for 54 in the 16th over. The batsman went onto review the decision unsuccessfully.

In his next over, he was all over the Indians. Kedar Jadhav, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul were foxed by the wrong-un and lost their stumps as the tourists inexplicably fell to 119 for 5 as Sri Lanka seized the initiative.

He completed his maiden five-wicket haul in the next over when Hardik Pandya came down the track, but the googly went through bat pad and settled in Niroshan Dickwella's gloves, allowing for a simple stumping.

Dhananjaya wasn't finished yet, as he trapped Axar Patel leg before wicket with a ball that went straight on to reduce India to 131 for 7. Captain Upul Tharanga held back two of his overs, a move that added to his own over-rate woes (Sri Lanka were behind the rate and could see their captain fined) and released the pressure on India and allowed Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar to orchestrate the heist.

The spotlight remained on the Dananjaya even if all the celebratory noise came from the adjoining dressing room. It was a truly memorable bowling effort, but for Sri Lanka, it was another case of so near, yet so far.

Why missionary is the best position ever,"Getting all adventurous and acrobatic while trying out new positions for some mind-blowing sex is fun for sure. But the age-old missionary is a tried-and-tested formula that can never go wrong and always guarantees fulfilling sex no matter how vanilla it sounds. We give you four reasons that confirms missionary to be the best sex position ever.

It is easy

It’s simple and anybody can try and get it right in one go, be it a beginner or a pro. You don’t need any special skills or knowledge to amp up the kink factor. All that’s needed to turn up the heat is a lot of intimacy and the urge to pleasure each other as much as possible.

It is romantic

Missionary is a classic position that spells romanticism to the tee. It gives you ample opportunities to kiss, embrace and look into each other's eyes apart from, obviously, great sex. Intimacy reaches a whole new level as he gets inside you with full gusto and the two of you hold on to each other as you reach climax. It sure can’t get steamier.

It is comfortable

No special skills are required while having sex the missionary way and there are no possibilities of any discomfort. It doesn’t require bending and twisting and no matter how wild either of you are in bed, missionary sex scores high on the comfort factor.

It is customisable

A bit of tweaking here and there can add a lot of variations to the regular position. Lock his legs or bend your knees as he enters you for a deeper penetration. A bit of extra grinding and rolling from his end would be just perfect to help you both inch towards the Big O."
Mamata Does It Again: Prohibiting Durga idol immersions on Muharram neither helps security nor ensures communal harmony,"In a re-run of last year, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has ordered that no Durga idol immersions will take place on Muharram which falls on October 1, a day after Bijoya Dashami. Idol immersions will resume from October 2 thereafter and continue till October 4. Mamata has justified this decision on security grounds, saying that it is necessary to facilitate Muharram processions and prevent clashes between Hindus and Muslims. She had passed similar orders last year which were challenged in the Calcutta high court on grounds of minority appeasement. However, it’s also true that small communal clashes did take place last year across various districts of Bengal when Muharram and celebrations for Durga Puja overlapped.

There’s no denying that Mamata’s order is upsetting a significant section of the Hindu population in Bengal. Durga Puja is the biggest festival for Bengalis. If in future Muharram were to fall bang in the middle of the four-day festivities, would Mamata call a halt to all celebrations? The state government is responsible for security for all. It should ensure both Durga Puja rituals and Muharram processions are carried out smoothly. By being hypersensitive about Muharram, Mamata herself is stirring up the communal cauldron.

On the security front, she is actually increasing the risk of clashes by imposing a moratorium on Durga idol immersions on Muharram. For, such a moratorium is bound to rub Hindus in Bengal the wrong way, creating an atmosphere of resentment. And communal clashes are much more likely to take place when people are resentful. Hence, Mamata’s order fails on the security logic. This leaves one to conclude that Mamata is doing all this to appease the minority vote bank. And that gives an opening to BJP which is looking to make inroads in Bengal on the strength of Hindu grievances.

Let’s put things into perspective. Muharram is essentially observed by Shia Muslims. And Shia Muslims are a minority in Bengal. According to some estimates, there are only one lakh Shias in the entire state. Hence, managing Muharram processions shouldn’t be such a big deal. However, in making it a big deal Mamata is fanning the flames of communalism. She must remember that she is the chief minister of all peoples in Bengal and guard against the appearance of favouritism no matter how well-intentioned her decisions are."
Bengaluru FC Just Defeated A North Korean Football Team,"Have you ever heard of a team called April 25? Well, it is one of the most successful teams in North Korea. This team was named after the Military Foundation Day and belongs to the Korean People's Army.

And the team has been beaten by India's Bengaluru FC 3-0 in the first leg of the AFC inter-zone semi-final match.

Star striker Sunil Chhetri was among the goal-getters. He led the charge with a 32nd minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match in front of the cheering home crowd at Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

BCCL

Heavy rains lashed the stadium an hour into the game and both the teams played under reduced visibility. Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty kick after Udanta was brought down by the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area. Chhetri stepped up and sent his shot at the center, which beat Ri Kang, who dived to his right.

Bengaluru scored their second goal through Udanta as the winger sprinted from the vacant right flank into the box and sent a superb left footer into the North Korean net.

Lenny Rodrigues completed the route as he sent the ball past Kang who was blinded by the splash of water on his face. Chhetri broke away and ran almost 50 yards to cut in and deliver the cross from the left to Lenny who made no mistake.

Chhetri missed a chance to score his second goal in the 42nd minute after Kang, who was off the line, managed to get a finger of a the Indian striker’s shot for a corner. April 25 also had their chance in 23rd minute as Ri Hyong Jin sent an accurate freekick but An Song Il’s header hit the crossbar and the ball rebounded back into play.

They also missed an opportunity coming their way to reduce the margin in the 71st minute as Kwon Ch sent a grounded cross but An Il Bom could not connect it properly.

Soon after the half-time break, April 25 got into their act, but the smartness of the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the situation. Kim Yu Song had beaten three Bengaluru men and was going for a shot from an angle into the goal in 49th minute but Sandhu denied him.

A couple of minutes back too, Gurpreet had done well to send the ball out of danger after Kim Jong Chol had flicked to An Il Bom, who sent a cross across the goal with all the defenders falling short of pace to get hold of it.

Bengaluru FC will now travel to Pyongyang on September 13 for the second leg match.

"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India’s freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat – today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected – political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians’ narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department’s 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations – which included Nathuram Godse’s Hindu Rashtra Sena – viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn’t ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province’s chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh’s decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government’s delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police’s fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar’s participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year’s rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh’s anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, “Of late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation’s activities.”

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman’s query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh’s mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh’s growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had “infiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes”. It further stated “the organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.”

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government’s real intention: “the holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.” Subsequently, the Sangh’s training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh’s weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists’ privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation’s history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."

To preserve pacers BCCI cuts down on Ranji schedule,"INDIA DOMESTIC

To preserve pacers BCCI cuts down on Ranji schedule

Gaurav Gupta • Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 08:12 AM

""Most importantly, this format will help us manage the workload of the bowlers, particularly the pacers"" - said a source in the Board © Getty

Early last year, batting great Virender Sehwag had suggested to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that the gap between games in domestic cricket, especially the Ranji Trophy, needed to be reduced in order to lessen the heavy workload on the fast bowlers, who tend to suffer injuries or suffer a drop in pace by the end of the gruelling season.

That suggestion seems to have finally been accepted by the various committees of the Board (technical & Tours & Fixtures committee) while chalking out the schedule of the forthcoming Ranji season. As per the Ranji Trophy schedule for 2017-18, a copy of which is in the possession of this paper, each team will now play two games less (six overall) in the league stage. The reason being that for the forthcoming season, the Board has divided the 28 domestic teams into four groups - A, B, C & D, comprising seven sides each.

Since the 2012-13 season, a domestic side was required to play eight games in the league stage in the Ranji Trophy as the Board had divided 27 teams into three groups (A, B & C) which meant that each pool had nine teams.

""Seven teams in each group will balance the tournament nicely, unlike the previous format (10+10+9). Most importantly, this format will help us manage the workload of the bowlers, particularly the pacers, in a better way. Keeping Sehwag's suggestion in mind, this time we've consciously kept a four-day gap between all games in the Ranji Trophy.

""This will help the bowlers recover well for the next game. Earlier, a bowler from a Ranji-winning team would end up bowling in 12 games within a few months. That workload has been reduced by two games,"" said a source in the Board.

As per the new format, two teams from each of the four groups will advance to the quarterfinals, unlike the previous system, which saw three teams advancing from the A & B groups (comprising the top-ranked, elite teams), and two teams from the C group (comprising the lower ranked, plate teams). With all the groups now looking balanced, the new format should thus eliminate the possibility of a team making the knockouts from a relatively weaker group.

As per the schedule, the tournament will begin from October 6. The Ranji knockouts will begin with the quarterfinals from December 7-11, the semifinals from December 17-21, and the final from December 29-January 2. The Irani Cup will be held from January 11-15. The limited overs leg of the domestic season begins with the T20 Mushtaq Ali Trophy zonals.

Ranji matches to be telecast from start:

Unlike the last season, Star Sports, the official broadcaster of all BCCI tournaments, will telecast one game in the Ranji Trophy from the first round. Due to India's packed international schedule at home, only the Ranji knockouts were telecast live last season.

New One-day tournament at U-23 level:

With an aim to give exposure to youngsters in limited overs cricket, the BCCI has introduced a domestic one-day tournament for Under-23 cricketers from this season.

The idea was suggested by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) some time back. For now, it will be called the Col. CK Nayudu Trophy, the same name as its three-day version. With the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand in January in sight, the board has decided to schedule the one-day competition (Vinoo Mankad Trophy) ahead of the Cooch Behar Trophy.

"In 2008, A Match Was Stopped As The World Celebrated Sachin Tendulkar Becoming Test Cricket's Highest Run Getter","October 17, 2008 was a historical day in Test cricket history. Sachin Tendulkar went past Brian Lara to become the player with most runs in the format.

It happened during the 2nd Test vs Australia in Mohali. When he came out to bat, he needed 15. On 13, he guided Peter Siddle into the gap for 3 runs and that was a record.

AFP

More than the feat itself, it was what followed that showed how much Sachin meant to the Indian fans.

The match had to be held up for an hour as fireworks went up in the air. The crowd stood up to applaud and every Australian player shook his hand.

Play was interrupted for almost 5 minutes and eventually it did resume but not before the world had taken notice of the feat.

Sachin went on to make 88, and India ultimately won the game by 320 runs to lead the 4-match series 1-0. But these day remains one of the most significant ones in his illustrious career of 24 years."
Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"Samsung Galaxy Note's Near $1,000 Price Tag Means Premium Phones Are Getting More Expensive!","When Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 8 this past Wednesday, I was experiencing a pretty wide range of emotions. On the one hand, it looks great and holds promise. On the other hand, it’s ungodly expensive.

The base version of the device (64GB internal storage) is priced at $930 in the US, or approximately Rs 60,000. Prices are usually higher in India as well because local manufacturing isn’t really as far along as it should be. That means we could expect a price tag of between Rs 65,000 to Rs 70,000.

Additionally, it seems the 64GB version will not be available anywhere outside the US. If that’s true, we’re only going to have the 128GB and 256GB versions to choose from. That jacks up the base price even more, possibly even close to Rs 80,000 and over. If you think that’s way too expensive for a smartphone, no matter how great it may be, you have a point. However, Samsung doesn’t necessarily agree with you.

You can’t be serious, right?

What’s important to consider here is why Samsung, a company that’s still feeling the after effects of a disastrous Note 7 launch, thinks it’s okay to slap an uber premium price tag on their phablet.

Firstly, based on hardware alone, there’s precedent for a Rs 50,000 price tag. It’s not ideal for everyone, but it’s been done before. However, there's also a certain amount of brand loyalty with regards to Samsung, despite past blunders, not to mention the exclusivity a high price tag brings. To add to that, the smartphone market is changing.

A few years ago, the influx of budget smartphones from Chinese brands toppled the market, creating a new range of upper moderate buyer, the kind that wants the best features possible without breaking the bank. Since then, a clear demarcation has formed for smartphone manufacturers. Mid-range smartphone are no longer good enough. To make a profit, brands have to either cram every feature imaginable into a budget device that can reap rewards with pure sales numbers, or instead turn to the premium buyers, willing to shell out extra dough for luxury devices.

Look at the recent launches we’ve seen. The 32GB iPhone 7 launched in India at a price of Rs 60,000, going up to about Rs 92,000 for higher models. The Samsung Galaxy S8 also started off at a Rs 58,000 base price, and the comparable HTC U11 also launched at Rs 52,000, one of the lower price tags in this range. All of these flagship prices are significantly higher than, say, the OnePlus 2. Billed the ‘Flagship Killer’ when it launched in 2015, because of its high-end specifications, it launched in India for a paltry Rs 25,000. And those numbers have gone up ever since. Even the OnePlus 5 from two months ago launched at Rs 33,000, and that’s the new “affordable” range a step above budget 4G devices. Basically, if you want a cheap phone, you’re going to have to go last-gen.

Does the Galaxy Note 8 fall into that premium category? There’s no way to know for sure without experiencing the device for a while, especially getting a feel for how its dual cameras perform. If they can equal or best those of at least the likes of Google Pixel 2, iPhone 7 Plus, if not the incoming iPhone 8, it might be a strong contender. But in the meantime, Samsung is aware that it’s still not regained the trust of buyers who were burned by the disastrous Note 7. They’re currently offering discounts on the Note 8 for owners of the Note 7 in the US, and it’s likely those exchange offers will trickle down to India as well. If that’s the case, you won’t be paying the full market price on the flashy new flagship, so it’s bound to make it look more attractive.

It gets worse

But however the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 eventually turns out, it's pricing is a good indication that Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 will also be priced over the $1,000 mark, and there's evidence that Apple doesn't drop iPhone prices nearly as steeply as Android OEMs do. And will the next round of Google Pixel 2 and XL smartphones follow suit?

What we're saying is, it's time to tighten your belts and start saving money, as premium flagship phones are only going to cost more in the coming months."

Implications of right to privacy go well beyond privacy,"The Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling that individual privacy is indeed a fundamental right subject to reasonable restrictions has led to celebrations across the country. But there is more to the landmark judgement that just privacy and the court has also provided a ray of hope for India’s LGBT community. This comes after the court refused to decriminalise Section 377 of Indian Penal Code which relates to consensual sex among adult homosexual men in 2013.

Page 124 of the judgement reads, “Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.”

SC’s verdict on #RightToPrivacy: Here is what the judges said https://t.co/0dBqc5O216 pic.twitter.com/Nlqv9GROKB — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 24, 2017

Similarly page 404 mentions, “As case law, both in the U.S. and India show, this concept has travelled far from the mere right to be let alone to recognition of a large number of privacy interests, which apart from privacy of one’s home and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures have been extended to protecting an individual’s interests in making vital personal choices such as the right to abort a foetus; rights of same sex couples- including the right to marry; rights as to procreation, contraception, general family relationships, child rearing, education, data protection, etc. This argument again need not detain us any further and is rejected.”

Privacy a fundamental right subject to reasonable restrictions: Government https://t.co/DeNznw203P pic.twitter.com/5vA52aqQhE — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 24, 2017

The government was hoping that a favourable verdict would help it extend Aadhaar to all essential services and even link it to some voluntary services as well. This had led to widespread criticism that the government was trying to completely monitor every individual through this move thereby violating privacy. The setback for the government could now be two-fold. Firstly the court had clarified that the right to privacy is not vague and amorphous as the government believes. Secondly, it recognises privacy interests as well."
Kachoris are the star of this Jaipur matinee,"Always take a break to smell the roses when on the road

I had gone to Jaipur recently. The itinerary of my trip– land at the airport, drive off to a far off resort for a workshop, leave a day or two later, head back to the airport and fly home without stopping in the city – is one that those who belong to the corporate world can relate to. I do not live the agency life anymore but I had gone to conduct a social media session at a corporate do that time.

My first trip to Jaipur had a similar plot. I had gone to conduct a training course for the market research agency I worked for back then. Neither of these trips had allowed me to spend much time in the city.

Thankfully, I made a trip in between the two where I had actually stayed in Jaipur proper. I had gone to conduct market research focus groups for an automobile client. When done with day’s work, I would head out with my team members to eat and finally had a gala time at Jaipur.

I thought that it would be a shame if I couldn’t go back to any of those wonderful places to eat this time around. So I played around with my schedule. This ensured that I could make a quick stop in the city before I headed off to the resort. I realized though that I could go only to one eatery given the very little time in hand.

Luckily, I didn’t have to think twice while choosing which one this would be. The answer was obvious. Rawat Mishthan Bhandar.

The pull of Jaipur’s Rawat Mishthan Bhandar

Rawat Mishthan Bhandar is a 45-year-old Jaipur legend. The family that runs it had set up their first sweet-shop, bearing the same name, 120 years back in Jodhpur. Both outlets are favourites with locals in the their respective cities today. In Jaipur, it is located in an area called Sindhi Camp. Everyone knows where it is. Even the driver who had come to pick me up at the airport, and who was unsure of how to reach the hotel he was supposed to take me to, knew it. You don’t need GPS to reach Rawat’s when in Jaipur.

The Rawat outlet at Jaipur is huge by Mumbai standards. It is a sweet shop as the ‘misthan bhandar’ in the name makes it clear. You will get techni-coloured mava (reduced milk) and ghee based sweets here as well as their versions of chhena based ‘Bengali’ sweets. What it is most famous for among sweets, is the gargantuan, honeycomb shaped, north Indian favourite of ghevar. This is a bit too over the top for me to be honest. You get western pastries too here now. Eggless of course. Also on offer are soft drinks and lassis and then savoury treats such as namkeens and samosas. It’s the sort of place that you would never want your diabetologist or cardiologist to know that you have visited.

Introducing the alu piyaz kachori

Rawat’s is often referred to colloquially as Rawat Kachori in Jaipur and there is a reason for that. This is in deference to its flagship dish, the ‘alu piyaz kachori’, you see.

I had fallen in love with this Rajasthani delight the first time I had it at Rawat’s. Those familiar with the marvels of the piyaz kachori here will not be surprised by this. You can’t after all, go wrong with the combination of a well seasoned, deep fried maida (refined flour) crust, nestled in which lies the most heady and hypnotizing mix of mashed potato and fried bits of finely chopped onion, which is seasoned with a mix of house spices, bedecked with flecks of red chilli powder, a touch of garlic and a hint of tanginess. Eat the alu piyaz kachoris when made fresh and you will realize why I go back to Rawat Mishthan Bhandar every time I visit Jaipur. This is a love affair one can never forget. I have had the piyaz kachoris from Rawat’s, brought to me by well meaning friends to Mumbai. I didn’t have the heart to tell them that it just does not taste the same.

The alu piyzaz kachori is not the only snack that the Rawat Mishthan Bhandar is famous for. Its mirchi bhaaji, a big green chilli pepper enrobed in a spiced potato masala mash, coated with besan (chickpea four) and deep fried, has its fans. I like it too but it is like the rest of the star cast in an Amitabh Bachchan mega starrer from the 70s if you know what I mean. There is the mava kachori too, where the kachori is stuffed with sweetened mava (reduced milk). My younger brother doesn’t play favourites and loves both the mava and the peyaz kachori when he goes to Rawat. I would happily give him my share of the mava kachori if we were to ever go there together.

The truth is that it is the piyaz kachori of Rawat Mishthan Bhandar that rocks my boat and draws me back to Jaipur again and again.

Of course, Rawat is not the only place where you get the piyaz ka kachori. I have seen street carts piled with piyaz kachoris tucked away in the by-lanes of Jaipur. Till some kind soul leads to me one of these and changes my mind about kachoris, Rawat’s works well for me.

The alu piyaz kachor is common to cities such as Jodhpur, Udaipur and Ajmer in Rajasthan too I am told and not just Jaipur. Ajmer is also famous for something called kadhi kachori which sounds bewitching and which I would love to try.

First day, first show

My recent visit made me realize that I was not alone in my love for the piyaz kachori of Rawat Mishthan Bhandar. Let me tell you what happened that day.

I had reached the shop at 4.30 pm. I went to Rawat’s straight from the airport. I walked in to the refreshingly air-conditioned sweet shop, went to the cash counter and placed an order for a couple of kachoris, one for me and one for the driver, and a couple of lassis too. Our destination was another hour and a half away I had been told so I thought that we should tank up for it.

I got my coupons at the cash counter and ambled towards the other end of the shop where the kachoris were to be collected. I was told that I would have to wait a bit as a fresh batch was on the way. I waited patiently, sipped on my lassi, updated my social media channels on my phone.

Then I suddenly heard a buzz around me which seemed to get more manic by the minute. I looked up from my mobile and saw that everyone in the shop was heading towards me. Rushing in fact. “What did I do,” I wondered.

Then I saw that they just walked past me and went to the counter behind me instead. There were piles of ghewars stacked behind the counter. This is where the kachoris were to be given I had been told.

It turned out that workers had just come in from the kitchen bearing trays of alu piyaz kachori. The stampede to the counter was to greet them. Everyone took out their coupons and waved them frantically. This was no longer the place for civil niceties. No prisoners were to be taken in the quest to reach the kachoris. It didn’t matter who you were. It was each man for himself. There were all sorts of folks in the crowds…locals in the know, corporate executives visiting Jaipur whose colleagues had sent them here, a young girl from out of town who wanted to pick a couple of kachoris to eat in the long distance train taking her back home home, a last memory of the city. The driver of a ‘seth’ who had come to pick 20 boxes of peyaz kachori got the same treatment as someone with a palms outstretched hopefully to pick just one. We were all equals at the darbar of the alu peyaz kachori.

The scene brought back memories of back home in Mumbai and the crowds that appear when the ‘Badhsahs of Bollywood’, Salman Khan or Shahrukh Khan, step out to give darshan at their Bandstand houses.

I finally managed to get hold of an alu piyaz kachori, took a bite of it and reveled in its mystic magic. That’s when it struck me that unlike matinee idols who are human after all and have a limited shelf life life, the appeal of the alu piyaz kachori of Rawat Mishtan Bhandar is truly timeless.

"A Company Is Paying Hackers $500,000 For Exploits To Spy On WhatsApp And Signal Users","Just how much do you care about your privacy? Would you spend a few hundred on an antivirus or VPN? Well, a company is ready to pay $500,000 to hackers able to breach your online privacy.

Zerodium, a Washington DC-based company that specializes in acquiring and reselling zero-day exploits is now looking to take a piece out of WhatsApp and Signal. The company is offering some serious moolah to any hackers who prove they can infiltrate and spy on users of the popular smartphone messaging apps.

On Wednesday, Zerodium put a $500,000 cash prize up for grabs, for whoever can provide tools that allow remote code execution and local privilege escalation for the two apps. Basically, the company is looking for a way hackers could get into your device without your knowledge.

“Zerodium pays premium bounties and rewards to security researchers to acquire their original and previously unreported zero-day research affecting major operating systems, software, and devices,” the company said on its website. “While the majority of existing bug bounty programs accept almost any kind of vulnerabilities and [proof of concepts] but pay very low rewards, at Zerodium we focus on high-risk vulnerabilities with fully functional exploits, and we pay the highest rewards on the market.”

Zerodium won’t specify who its customers are, but their website speaks louder than any other statements.

“Zerodium customers are major corporations in defense, technology, and finance, in need of advanced zero-day protection, as well as government organizations in need of specific and tailored cybersecurity capabilities.”

Unfortunately, that raises some uncomfortable questions, particularly since these zero day exploits have been used to spy on journalists and political dissidents in the past. Just last year a human rights activist in the UAE was spied on using an iPhone exploit.

The only silver lining here is that the Signal and WhatsApp exploits being sought are at the top of Zerodium’s price list, meaning they’re hard to come by if at all, and they’re also not compromised just yet."

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

Over one lakh supporters of Dera Chief have gathered in Panchkula and Chandigarh literally bringing the two towns to a halt. Now, since Dera Chief has been convicted, the large scale of violence across the three states is also a possibility.

Rape conviction invokes punishment up to seven years, therefore, it will be seen, how many years of the sentence will be given to Dera Chief.

How to wear smoky eyes in the day,"Reinvented smoky eyes are very in right now. And of course the first thing we wanted to change about this staple look, was the restriction to when it can be worn. We give our own spin to the trend, and show you how to wear it even during the day."
15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

The umpires deemed it retaliation for Tigers starter Michael Fulmer hitting Gary Sanchez after Sanchez had gone yard yet again. Joe Girardi was ejected and after the dust settled, Aroldis Chapman was called in to resume the game.

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
These Two Comedians Talking About Financial Terminologies Will Leave You In Splits,"PARTNER

There are some people who are great with anything finance; be it their taxes or any financial terms they know it all. But then there are some who can hardly tell you the difference between a market cap or a normal cap. And if you fall in the second category then we have something really funny and interesting stored for you.

These two comedians from comic series- The Wolves Of Wall Street- by ET Money will enlighten you with their pearls of wisdom. After they realized they aren’t earning enough from their stand up shows, they decided to take up the task of advising people about financial terms in the most amusing ways and the result is just hilarious. Here’s what they have to say."
Your personal data is yours & nobody else’s,"Raise a toast to nine judges of the Supreme Court (SC) who have said your right to privacy is fundamental, ranking right up there with rights to life and freedom of expression. Privacy as a fundamental right probably didn’t matter much in 1954, when the first anti-privacy judgement was delivered. It matters now, when companies like Alphabet (owner of Google), Microsoft, online retailers, Facebook and Twitter can snoop into your finances, links with family and friends, mails and opinions.

The SC order implies that your data belongs to you, not to companies or regimes. Big Brother regimes try to manipulate every thought and action of their citizens. The latter descend into a Stalinist hell of self-censorship, paranoia, spying and snitching on each other. In 1952, the Soviets worked out a telephone-based system that allowed a group of people involved in launching rockets and missiles, to communicate across vast distances via a phone network. This was the ancestor of the internet.

Fast forward to 2012, when Russia drew up its Internet Blacklist. Apparently, this was to protect children from harmful content, curb drug use and other evils. That was the fudge. Soon, it expanded to include sites ‘inciting hatred’, ‘suspected extremism’ and ‘deviant behaviour’ including gay relationships. By August 2014, a ‘Bloggers’ Law’ came into force, where all Wi-Fi and chat-room operators had to collect users’ data, verify their passports and store them. Social media was controlled by a complex thingummy called Deep Packet Inspection.

In July 2016, Russia passed the Yarovskya Law, forcing telecom operators to record and store all conversation, message and internet traffic for six months. This November, a new law will ban all software and websites that try to go around Russian filters. Phrases like ‘Caucasus’, ‘Crimea’ and ‘Ukraine’ are taboo; Bitcoin has been blocked recently.

All this operates under the System of Operational Investigative Measures (Sorm), which reports to the FSB, successor of the KGB. Sorm arm-twists telecom and hardware companies to allow snooping. It also mandates inspection, arrest and shutdown without warrants.

On September 20, 1987, the first email was sent out from a primitive system in China. It said, ‘Across the Great Wall, we can reach every corner in the world.’ What irony. In less than 15 years, a system called the Great Firewall (GFW) controlled all online traffic. In 2003, GFW spawned Golden Shield to monitor and censor content. All backbone providers are owned by the communist state.

Before it walked out of China, Google agreed to block searches on phrases like ‘Tiananmen’ or ‘democracy’. Companies like Yahoo and Microsoft have bowed to all strictures of Beijing. Ironically, almost all the hardware that runs Beijing’s spying machinery is outsourced from US companies like Cisco Systems.

Whistleblower Robert Snowden showed how the US’ National Security Agency (NSA) spiced up its mandate to track terror by spying on US citizens, as well as those from friendly nations. Snowden’s revelations implied that once data is centralised by the State, it is easier for online crooks to steal vast chunks of information. Financial information ‘dumps’ are sold on the Dark Internet, and used to hack into personal accounts or bank systems to steal cash.

In the last three years, India has lurched towards large-scale data snooping. Its primary vector is the Aadhaar ID number and card. The original idea was to stop subsidy leakage. It is now mandatory to have an Aadhaar number to file tax returns and open new bank accounts, enlarging the scope of financial fraud. Infants in Anganwadi crèches now need Aadhaar to get a midday meal. Never mind media reports that suggest that the Aadhaar system is about as secure as a sieve.

Petitions to rein in Aadhaar begged the question whether your data was yours or whether companies and governments could filch it. On Thursday, the Supreme Court made your right to privacy, including personal information, a fundamental right. We might yet pull back from the abyss."
Fashion Diaries: Here’s Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one’s fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone’s going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it’s a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

Google Is Smartly Using A Medical Quiz In Search Result Cards To Help Diagnose Depression Query,"Most people who suffer from depression never get the help they need, sometimes because they don’t even know what they’re dealing with is a medical condition and not just “the blues”.

Now, Google is determined to increase the number of depression sufferers worldwide who get help.

Starting today, it’s offering a professionally-backed anonymous questionnaire online, that lets you know if you show depression markers.

Validated by medical professionals, the quiz shows up on the results page when you search for information about depression. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it can let you know whether you should seek a professional consult. More importantly, it raises awareness of the condition and encourages viewers to seek help.

The questionnaire looks to achieve similar results to other companies’ initiatives; Facebook is testing a neural network that could detect suicidal tendencies from posts and comments, while Instagram recently began offering support to users when friends report worrisome posts..

"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys — starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka’s resignation on August 18 — need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I’ve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India’s boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect — one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal’s remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn’t end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company’s board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company’s website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn’t, as you didn’t in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here’s my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys’ share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn’t end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka’s pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal’s task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don’t I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren’t needed.

Omkar

"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."
Got A Stiff Neck Due To Your Bad Posture? Try ‘Pilates For Text Necks’ For Relief,"There was a time when neck and spine injuries were commonplace in sport—where undue stress on these muscle groups was a considered a part and parcel of the game.

chiropractorfortlauderdaleflorida.com

But in a world where we spent most of our waking hours hunched over smartphones and desk jobs, neck and spine injuries or postural imbalances have become as much a part of our lives as it is for sportspersons.

Kimberly Fielding the creator and director of a class called “Pilates for Text Necks” in New York City has taken it upon herself to address this situation.

Fielding states that repetitive gazing into your screens puts a lot of strain on your neck and spine, giving birth to a condition called ‘Text Neck’!





“Instead of the cervical spine going inward, the curve can be a little bit different, and it causes nerve pain and herniation and different muscle tension headaches, different things that really can reduce the quality of life,” states Fielding.

She created the class when she noticed several clients of hers coming in with a forward head posture, which means that the head and neck are stretched forward and not aligned properly over the spine.

The class uses various exercises to release tension in the upper body well as strengthen the back and neck muscles. =

“It’s a little uncomfortable, but it’s because those muscles a lot of times are so weak from being overstretched and being in this other position,” Fielding said.

The class also focuses on breathing and posture

Holding your phone a period of time in a certain position, for instance, is a quick fix that Fielding recommends. It helps fix the gaze into a more natural horizontal position.

“You can see the eye line change right away, so the gaze is horizontal and they are very aligned,” says Fielding.

One of the students, Yasmin Venable, states that “I used to carry a lot of tension, especially in my upper arms and have like this, ugh feeling and now I feel like, I have a neck now.”

Sri Lanka recall Chandimal, Thirimanne after Tharanga ban

Rex Clementine • Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 05:19 PM

Sri Lanka have called up Test captain Dinesh Chandimal and top-order batsman Lahiru Thirimanne to the ODI squad after skipper Upul Tharanga received a two-match ban from the ICC for a slow over rate offence during the second match of the ongoing series against India on Thursday (August 24) at Pallekele.

Sri Lanka were found three overs short by Match Referee Andy Pycroft after India completed a sensational come-from-behind win after being 131 for 7 in the chase of 231. Tharanga has previously served a similar two-match suspension during the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 after Sri Lanka were found guilty of slow over rate during their tournament opener against South Africa.

Cricbuzz understands Sri Lanka also will miss the services of opener Danushka Gunathilaka after he hurt his shoulder while fielding. He is unlikely to be available for the next two games. Thirimanne is expected to open batting while Chandimal will take up the No. 4 position.

Sri Lanka's selectors, who met in Kandy to name the interim captain in the absence of Tharanga, appointed middle order batsman Chamara Kapugedera in that role for the third and fourth ODI.

Sri Lanka trail the five-match series 0-2.

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

Timorous Windies stride out to avoid embarrassment and series loss,"WEST INDIES TOUR OF ENGLAND, 2017

Timorous Windies stride out to avoid embarrassment and series loss

• Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 08:43 PM Rob Johnston in Headingley

Jason Holder will need to inspire his boys ahead of the second Test, failing which they could face another embarrassing defeat. © Getty

""It was totally embarrassing.""

That was the great Curtly Ambrose's reaction to West Indies' defeat by an innings and 209 runs inside three days of the first Test at Edgbaston last week. The tourists lost 19 wickets on the third day which compounded an abject failure with the ball and in the field during England's first innings. In body language and spirit, they looked disinterested. Inexperienced they may be, but West Indies were inexcusably poor.

Given the tourists' abysmal performance in Birmingham, there is a real fear for their prospects in the remaining two matches of the series. A win in the second Test at Headingley, beginning on Friday (August 25), is perhaps unlikely but an improved performance is a must if simply to restore some pride in the battered West Indian team. They can take heart from their victory over Pakistan in Barbados in April which followed a similarly chastening defeat in the previous match in Jamaica.

If there is any hope for an improved performance, it is that West Indies are probably not as bad as they showed in the first Test. In Kraigg Brathwaite, Jermaine Blackwood, who scored an impressive half-century at Edgbaston, and Kemar Roach, there is proven Test match talent and there is promise too in Shai Hope and Roston Chase. With the genuinely quick Shannon Gabriel set to return to the side, the missing aggression that Ambrose said was sorely lacking from the visitors' display at Edgbaston, should be evident too.

West Indies coach Stuart Law and the young captain Jason Holder have had a job on their hands to raise the morale of their team in the lead up to the game and there has not been much time for them to do so. According to Law, the squad have had some honest sessions since their Birmingham defeat but he may be worried that Holder struggled to rouse any sort of reaction from his men at Edgbaston. He also erred tactically in a number of areas including not taking the new ball straightaway on the first evening when the lights were on. The captain surely needs to lift his game.

Unusually, England will probably want to see some improvement from their opponents too. With an Ashes series looming and a number of untried players at Test level in their side, a more demanding workout in Leeds will be just what the doctor ordered. Mark Stoneman, a debutant at Edgbaston, got an excellent delivery from Roach in England's first innings and will want a longer stay in this Test to show what he can do. So too will Tom Westley who suffered another dismissal playing across his front pad in Birmingham.

Headingley has not been a happy hunting ground for England of late which may give the visitors hope. England have won just two of their last seven Tests at the venue although they beat Sri Lanka comfortably last year and thrashed West Indies on their last tour in 2012. Then, England won the Headingley Test by an innings and 283 runs in the face of a similar hapless performance by the men from the Caribbean to the one last week. West Indies, and maybe England, will hope history doesn't repeat itself.

When: Friday, August 25, 2017. 11 AM Local Time

Where: Headingley, Leeds

What to expect: Headingley traditionally favours the seam bowlers and with plenty of wet weather in the build up to this match, there could be some grass left on the pitch for them to exploit. A Mohammad Amir-inspired Essex bowled Yorkshire out here twice inside two days, a couple of weeks ago. The forecast for the match is mixed with some rain forecast on a couple of the days and some sun on others.

Team News:

England:

At some point in the next two Tests, England would have looked to give both all-rounder Chris Woakes and legspinner Mason Crane a game ahead of the Ashes tour and that they did by handing Woakes a return, by replacing Toby Roland-Jones.

Probable XI:

Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (c), Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson

West Indies:

Fast bowler Shannon Gabriel should return to the side following an injury lay-off and will add much needed pace and aggression to the West Indian attack. There may also be a place for legspinner Devendra Bishoo who was surprisingly left out at Edgbaston. Miguel Cummins and Alzzari Joseph are the two bowlers most at risk from the last Test. Despite the brittleness of the West Indian batting, there is little depth in that part of their squad, although 20 year-old Shimron Hetmyer, who captained West Indies Under-19s to a World Cup win in 2016, could come in at the top of the order.

Probable XI: Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich (wk), Jason Holder (c), Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo/Miguel Cummins

Did you know?

Joe Root is one fifty away from equaling AB de Villiers's record of scoring 50-plus in 12 successive Tests.

The last time Windies played at Headingley (in 2007), they faced their heaviest Test defeat - by innings & 283 runs. They were bowled out for 141 & 146 and in comparison Kevin Pietersen alone scored 226 for England.

James Anderson is eight short of becoming the sixth bowler to take 500 Test wickets.

How An Anonymous Letter By A Sadhvi 15 Years Ago Exposed Gurmeet Ram Rahim,"After the Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh 'Insaan' was convicted by a special CBI court in Panchkula, the followers of the Dera chief went on a rampage, committing arson and destroying public property.

While his empire had been protected for a long time, a letter which was written in 2002 by a Sadhvi, written in Hindi, exposed Dera’s reputation as he was taken into custody.

riot police gather on the day of court hearing for dera chief: bccl

In the letter written by the sadhvi that she addressed to the then-PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other top investigative authorities of the country. The investigation went on for 15 long years, initiated by the High Court. The court took a notice of the matter before any other authorities, which resulted to the conviction of Dera’s chief.

The letter written by the anonymous Sadhvi said that she was a resident of Punjab and an arts graduate. The CBI, after the beginning of the investigation, had a hard time tracing her. They finally managed to get two victims in order to file a chargesheet in 2007. These two victims had allegedly left Dera after they were exploited physically.

She was told by Ram Rahim she was his property, and that he could kill her and said her family has intense faith in him and would never dare to go against it.

bccl

The letter states that in the past there have been “hundreds of girls” with her in the Dera who have been continuously being subjected to, and are also “being raped by the Chief of Dera - Maharaj Ram Rahim. further stated that she along with other 40-45 girls was serving the Dera and had become a sadhvi due to her parents’ aspirations. About two years after she became a sadhvi, she was called into the ‘gufa’ (cave) of Ram Rahim, his residence where he was watching television with a revolver along his side.

In the second page of the letter, the Sadhvi claims that she was told by Ram Rahim she was his property. And that he could kill her and said her family has intense faith in him and would never dare to go against it.

The sadhvi’s letter claims that she was threatened and raped by Ram Rahim repeatedly. She also wrote that she was shattered and then it became known to her that there have been other women as well who have been victims of sexual exploitation, and there will be after her as well.

She has also mentioned that a girl from Sangrur was threatened with guns by ‘sevadaars’ of the dera after she shared her plight in her neighbourhood after leaving the dera

bccl

In the last page of the letter, the sadhvi has described the plight of many girls becoming a part of the dera despite being well educated. She said that they lead a life in hell due to the superstitious nature and blind faith of their family members. She has also mentioned that a girl from Sangrur was threatened with guns by ‘sevadaars’ of the dera after she shared her plight in her neighbourhood after leaving the dera. The letter concludes seeking intervention of the then-PM and courts, but she could not share any of her details as it would have invited trouble for herself and her family.

The real luxury in life is doing nothing,"It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that you’ll brush your teeth tomorrow morning. You don’t squander precious mental space evaluating whether or not brushing your teeth is worth the opportunity cost of let’s say, another five minutes of sleep. The same is true for showering, going to the bathroom, grooming your nails and facial hair. We clean our homes with a myriad of dust-sucking devices and chemical concoctions, or hire people to do so more thoroughly than we can. We even make sure to wash the car every so often.

As a people, we seem to be pretty vigilant about physical hygiene. We clean and cream our bodies, and take them out for a walk, much like we do for our dogs. We do so robotically, without wasting time in evaluating questions like, “Should I take out the trash today?” Even if we don’t do it today, you can bet it’ll be done before the week is out. Sadly, the same cannot be said for our mental hygiene. When was the last time you really cleaned the crevices of your mind?

And in this day and age, boy, do we have dirty minds. Between jobs, responsibilities at home, nights out, baby-talk and toddler tantrums, must-read blogs, email upkeep, spritely posts and timely tweets, we’ve stuffed our minds with more content than it can hold. Our minds run a marathon a minute. We swallow countless videos, movies and entire seasons of television shows with abandon, and these stimulating stories stick to our soft and once-supple consciousness. It’s a more-more-more world and our mind’s had enough. Simply put, we are mentally obese.

And then we wonder why we can’t still our minds and find some semblance of peace. We read self-help manuals, eat more organic greens and practise various forms of sweat-inducing yoga. We buy softer clothes, sniff scented candles, wear noise-canceling headphones and track our daily step count. We run away to exotic islands and true stillness evades us even under the palms.

The ubiquitous sentence we’ve all uttered, heard and repeated is — “I’m so tired”. We keep going like that poor Energizer bunny, but deep inside we feel kind of exhausted. Even the pursuit of higher echelons of fun becomes somewhat tiring by the time you’re thirty-five. And if not by then, by forty-five, for sure. “What’s the point?” we start to wonder.

And this is precisely where meditation saved me. Some people meditate with a mantra from a Master, some listen to meditation music, some watch their breath until they can override mental chatter, while others go for a nature walk. Even big-shot billionaires meditate with requisite meditation apps on TV these days.

The result is the same — in meditation, we do absolutely nothing for a few moments. We achieve nothing, we stop trying so damn hard. And unlike in sleep, we are restfully awake to witness the passage of time. We are completely present for ourselves — for doing absolutely nothing with ourselves — much like we make sure to be present to watch our children play soccer or perform in a school play.

In meditation, we become the witness. We become the one who watches patiently as time marches on, moving and twisting as it does. We don’t react or move an inch. We watch our thoughts go by like trains at a busy train station. We don’t hop on board. Like the statue of Buddha, we learn to embody peace and let go of past and future worries. We are the now. Like rock climbing, scuba diving, skiing, or even learning to read as children — learning to meditate takes some level of dedication and practice.

It’s a skill worth acquiring as soon as humanly possible. Even a momentary brush with wakeful nothingness — doing nothing, being nothing, wanting nothing, all while being there with the Self here and now — is a deep-clean steam shower for our mind. It refreshes us considerably and reminds us that there is more to life than chasing more."
Afghanistan Star Rashid Khan Gets Hilarious Marriage Proposal During A Cricket Match In The Caribbean,"Rashid Khan is the best bowler Afghanistan have ever had. He also had a great time in the Indian Premier League with Sunrisers Hyderabad. His fan following is undoubtedly on the rise. But some fans go overboard while cheering for their favourite sportstar.

Currently, Khan is the cynosure of all eyes.

While he was playing a match in the Caribbean Premier League, a girl sent out a marriage proposal from the stands and it was hilarious. We have to wait and watch whether he'll respond to her proposal or not.

Khan is currently playing for the Guyana Amazon Warriors and has picked up as many as eight wickets in seven games.

Aadhaar & Privacy: Like Dal and Roti,"It is welcome that a nine-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court has unanimously determined that the right to privacy is a fundamental right implicit in the Constitution, taking the Preamble and the fundamental rights spelled out in Part III separately and together. This puts paid to conflicting interpretations arising from differing observations on the subject in a number of past judgments by smaller benches.

The five-member bench hearing petitions against Aadhaar has a clear answer to existential doubts about the right to privacy. The Attorney General who told the Court the right to privacy is not a fundamental right now stands corrected. But does this mean that the ground has been laid for throwing India’s unique identity project out of the window? Far from it. Fundamental rights are precious but not unconditional. Article 15 guarantees against discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, etc. Yet, it is followed up with the qualification that this does not mean the state cannot carry out affirmative action. This qualification immediately applies to Article 14’s guarantee of equal treatment of all citizens by the state. Article 19 (1) (a) offers the right to free speech, but that is subject to considerations of national security, morality, public order, decency, friendly relations with foreign states. Similar considerations circumscribe Article 19(1) (b), which offers the right to assemble without arms. Freedom of conscience under Article 25 is subject to morality, public order and health, besides other fundamental rights.

Article 21, which offers the right to life and liberty, and is one of the principal fonts of the right to privacy, can be constrained by the due process of law. If the Aadhaar law is found to contain due process, the fundamental right to privacy can coexist with Aadhaar, with far more comfort than, say, what Nitish Kumar found, first in a Modi-led NDA and, later, in the company of Lalu Prasad.

As Justice Sanjay Kishen Kaul says explicitly, breaching individual privacy would be perfectly justified in a number of cases ranging from the statistical to the epidemiological. One man’s credit history is his private business, you might think. But a credit score requires his credit history to be ranked alongside the credit history of others. Such a comparative ranking calls for credit information of individuals to be gathered by a rating agency, invading the privacy of all borrowers. For trading off this bit of privacy, society gets in return a huge benefit: more security for the savings that banks lend out and lower rates of interest for borrowers with a good credit history.

Aadhaar offers the promise of superior expenditure control and avoidance of welfare expenditure being cornered by the undeserving and the unscrupulous. It enables the migrant poor to establish identity wherever they are. But this benefit cannot justify any laxity in securing vital personal information gathered for Aadhaar.

The privacy judgment call for follow-up protective legislation on two counts. One, to regulate the conduct of the state when it breaches individual privacy and infringes on personal liberty. In many civilised states, such a breach calls for a prior court order, obtained on grounds of national security or something else, and parliamentary oversight of what was done with that permission to snoop. India must enact a law to delineate how, to what extent and to what end the state can breach the right to privacy and to hold those who do so to account, preferably by testifying to a committee of Parliament. Two, India needs a data protection law, to regulate the use of individual data by non-state agencies, to give individuals some degree of control over their data and to harmonise India’s data protection regime with those of other major jurisdictions. Such harmonisation can win international commitments for reciprocal protection of other nationals’ data, allowing for a rich harvest of data-based economic activity, ranging from analytics to artificial intelligence, making use of and providing jobs to India’s huge pool of young talent.

It would make sense to institute a controller of data protection with the mandate to ensure that individual data is not put to any use that brings harm to the data-subject, or to others. But the contours of a data protection regime are the subject of a debate different from the one settled by the SC as to whether privacy is a fundamental right."

Sohail Khan named in Pakistan squad for World XI series

Pakistan Cricket Board announced a 16-member squad for the three Twenty20 Internationals against World XI, on Friday (August 25).

Sarfaraz Ahmed will lead the side that includes youngsters like Fahim Ashraf, Ruman Raees, Usman Shinwari and Aamer Yamin. Fast bowler Sohail Khan, who last made an appearance for the national team in October 2016, has also been included in the squad.

Sarfraz Ahmed (C, wk), Fakhar Zaman, Ahmed Shehzad, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Umer Amin, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Hassan Ali, Amir Yamin, Mohammad Amir, Rumman Raees, Usman Shinwari, Sohail Khan.

While Ashraf, Raees and Yamin have played One-Day Internationals for Pakistan, Shinwari has featured in two T20Is, against Sri Lanka, in 2013. Sohail last played a T20I in 2011 against Zimbabwe in Harare. Allrounder Umar Amin too finds a place in the side after impressive performances in the List A matches, including two centuries - 111 and 156 - in last four games.

The notable omissions from the squad include Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Kamran Akmal and Wahab Riaz.

""The team has been selected keeping in mind the conditions and the recent performances of some players in the domestic and international tours. The players' consists of a combination of the fine blend of youth and senior players,"" Inzamam ul Haq, the chief selector, said.

""It would be good for the young players to get a chance to play on the home ground and perform in front of the local public.""

The board had recalled all Pakistan players from the ongoing County Championships and Caribbean Premier League for a fitness test before announcing the squad. The players, though, were allowed to return soon after.

The World XI side, led by Faf du Plessis, will play three T20Is in Lahore on September 12, 13 and 15.

The World XI series will mark the return of international cricket in Pakistan. They are also due to host Sri Lanka and Windies, after the conclusion of the World XI series. The Windies are expected to visit Pakistan sometime in late November for a three-match T20I series.

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan (they played three unofficial ODIs against Pakistan A). The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

Here's The Tentative Contestant List For Bigg Boss 11 & It Has A Lot Of Interesting Names!,"Indian reality shows come and go but the only one, people wait with bated breaths every single season, is the very popular Bigg Boss. One of the primary reasons, Indian audiences get glued to the show is because of Salman Khan and the other major reason is all the fights, sacndals and controversies we get to see between the housemates.

Youtube/screengrab

The brand new season Bigg Boss 11 is all set to make its debut. Salman Khan, who was unsure of hosting it for the sixth time, gave in yet again for this show. The actor released the teaser of the show, making us all yelp in joy!

And with the promos running on-air, speculations for the contestants have begun as well. While some reports are mentioning there might be a mix of common and celebrities like the last season, some are suggesting it's celebrity based only.

Here's taking a look at 11 such celebrity contestants who have been approached and they have reportedly given their nod!

1. Dhinchak Pooja

Well, no prizes for guessing why she has been approached. The singer shot to fame with her rap songs, Daaru Daaru and Selfie Maine Le Li Aaj and became an internet sensation. Since she has never been seen giving interviews to the media, people are looking forward to seeing her on the show. Somehow, she reminds us of Lokesh.

2. Nia Sharma

A body full of bruises..but barely any that hurts only coz u took them with pleasure🙋 #kkk8 A post shared by Nia Sharma (@niasharma90) on Jun 12, 2017 at 9:23am PDT

Jamai Raja fame actress Nia Sharma was on cloud nine when she became the third sexiest Asian woman. She beat a plethora of the most stunning actresses including Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif. Ever since then, she has been raising temperatures with her bikini photo-shoots and her Khatron Ke Khiladi show. It will be exciting to see what she brings to the show with her sexiness.

3. Riya Sen

🦄🦋 A post shared by Riya Sen Dev Varma (@riyasendv) on Jun 29, 2017 at 3:15am PDT

Big things come in small sizes and this is exactly the case with Riya Sen. The actress secretly got married to her long time boyfriend recently but she was controversy's favourite child for the longest time. The most controversial episode in her life was when her MMS clip with actor Ashmit Patel was allegedly leaked. She was also spotted hitting on a girl and kissing her during a party which became headlines.

The makers of Bigg Boss 11 have approached her.

She was the famous Angoori devi from the show Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai. After gaining fame from the same, Shilpa un-timely quit the show without giving notice to the makers. Later, she held a press conference claiming the producers had not paid her. She also filed a FIR against Sanjay Kohli, the producer of her last show Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai, accusing him of sexual harassment.

We all know her as Anjali from SRK-Kajol starrer Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. After her debut as a child artist in Bollywood, she arrived back in fame with Student Of The Year and since then she has appeared in many reality shows including Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa (2013), Nach Baliye (2015) and Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi. There is a strong buzz of her joining the show too.

7. Honey Singh

Twitter

We haven't seen him in a long long time. After his crackling music videos and hit songs, Honey Singh just suddenly vanished into oblivion. While some suspected his fight with SRK during the world tour led to his hiding, others say he got into drugs and has been in rehab since then. The singer has not sung for more than a year and people are curious to know about what really happened with him during this span.

Honey Singh still has loyal fans who are eagerly waiting for his comeback. The makers have got in touch with the 'once upon a time superstar'.

8. Bobby Deol

He was last seen in Singh Saab The Great in 2013 but came back into the news after he performed at the club as a DJ and played Gupt songs. It was so bad that people were asking for a refund. Although he opened up about being conned, Bobby became an internet sensation. There are chances he will talk about his personal life and controversies on the show.



9. Nikitin Dheer

He's the famous Tangballi from SRK starrer Chennai Express. Son of Pankaj Dheer and husband of KratikaNikitinan can spill the beans about the film and TV industry.

10 Achint Kaur

She is best known for playing the antagonists Mandira and Pallavi in Ekta Kapoor's Indian soap operas Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii. She has been associated with television since 1994 and it will be interesting to see how she is in her real life.

According to report in India Forums, “Sumit has been approached as a wild card entrant and not a fresh participant which is said to be holding the actor back from joining the show.”"

Edulji lashes out at BCCI, labels it 'male chauvinist organisation'

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 03:02 PM

Diana Edulji revealed the former BCCI chief N Srinivasan had explicitly expressed how much he was against the idea of women's cricket. © AFP

Diana Edulji, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, lashed out at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), calling it a ""male chauvinist organisation"". Edulji alleged that the success of the Indian Women's team, that fell nine runs short in the 2017 ICC Women's World Cup finale at Lord's a month ago, and the growing popularity hasn't been ""accepted too well"" by some of the board members.

Edulji, along with India's World Cup stars Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, was a guest at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday (August 22).

""I've always been a BCCI basher, right from the day women's cricket came into the BCCI fold in 2006,"" Edulji said at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday. ""BCCI is a very male chauvinist organisation. They never wanted women to dictate terms or get into this thing. I was very vocal right from my playing days, from when I started,"" she added.

""Even now, I would still say that it is not yet well accepted within BCCI that women's cricket is doing well. It is very difficult for them (some BCCI members) to accept the fact that this team has done very well,"" Edulji elobrated.

Recalling her first meeting with the ousted BCCI president N Srinivasan after he took charge in 2011, Edulji said, ""When I went to congratulate him at the Wankhede Stadium, he said, 'if I had my way, I wouldn't let women's cricket happen'. He hates women's cricket.""

Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, who were among the outstanding performers during India's memorable World Cup run, said they were surprised yet humbled by the overwhelming reception upon their return home from England despite the lack of the trophy. Raut acknowledged the sudden growth in interest in women's sport and recalled how it was quite the opposite when she took up cricket as a career choice.

""There's so much passion for cricket within us that we don't ever think about getting tanned. There were many people in our society and some of my mother's friends who would keep saying, 'Isse ladki ki tarah thoda rehne ke liye sikhao. Ladki ke kaam sikhao' (Teach her to behave like girls, encourage her to learn what girls are expected to do). They used to ask my mother to teach me to dress up like a girl. My mother would then scold me. I would complain to my father and then they would end up arguing,"" the 27-year-old revealed.

""There are many parents who still think along those line.. You'll get dark if you stay under the sun for six hours. Who'll get married to you? I've seen today's parents only encourage their daughters to study and say that you'll have to get married at a fixed age and get settled."" Raut, however, encouraged young girls to chase their dreams. ""I believe if any girl likes playing, or if sport is her passion, then they should be allowed to play and be supported too,"" she said.

Vice-captain Harmanpreet, who captured the imagination of the youth with her blistering 171 not out to knock out defending champions Australia in the semifinal, stressed on the struggles she had to go through to play the game in her hometown Moga, in Punjab. ""When I was young I would have to beg the girls to play with me so that we could form a team of 11 players. Eventually, I would have to gather girls who were good at other sports. Cricket has become their No.1 priority now. When I started, there wasn't a single academy in Moga. My coach started one just for me. Now, there are three exclusively for women,"" Harmanpreet said.

While Edulji said it might be too early to introduce Women's IPL in India, Raut and Harmanpreet advocated for the need to have a domestic league of their own to tap the talent. ""I feel like even after all that's happened, there are a lot of changes that still need to be made for women's cricket. I hope we don't end up saying many years later that 'we also used to hit sixes during our time'. So, I feel if IPL starts now, then it's great,"" said Harmanpreet.

Don’t allow Pakistan to get away with false promises now,"By G Parthasarathy

Indians and Afghans went ballistic with joy and Pakistan fretted and fumed after President Trump spelt out his “path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia”. Trump minced no words about Pakistan-sponsored terrorism saying: “Today, 20 US designated foreign terrorist organisations are active in Pakistan and Afghanistan— the highest concentration in the world. For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence and terror”. He added: “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations (like) the Taliban”. He signalled a number of changes in US—Afghanistan policies, warning that it was time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to ”civilization, order and to peace”.

It is clear that the heat is going to be turned on Pakistan by the Americans. The US Congress is proposing to enact a legislation to progressively reduce/cut off economic and military aid and supplies to Pakistan. America’s allies, notably UK, Germany, and Japan will supplement the American effort.

The US will also be enhancing its military presence in Afghanistan. The proposed US Congressional Legislation requires the administration to deny economic and military assistance to Pakistan, if it does not mend its ways.

Trump has indicated that while it “may be possible” to have a political settlement with ”elements in the Taliban”, this can take place only after it ends violence.Secretary of State Tillerson has stated: “This entire effort is intended to put pressure to have the Taliban understand that you will not win a battlefield victory and we may not win one, but neither will you”.

He added: “At some point in time, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end”. Tillerson also made it clear that the US could revoke the status of “Major Non-NATO ally” that Pakistan enjoys, clearing the way for stringent restrictions on arms supplies and economic assistance. It is now evident that the US intends to link arms and economic assistance to Pakistan ending support for terrorism in Afghanistan, through the Taliban and Haqqani network. It is also possible that US drone strike on the Pakistan -based, ISI supported Taliban and its leadership will be stepped up.

How will Pakistan react to these new US policies? Rawalpindi will protest loudly at US policies. The message will be quietly sent to the US that if it turns the squeeze too much, Pakistan will be forced to deny use of its soil to American military supplies and aid to Afghanistan. The aim will be to force the US to cool off on sanctions, by holding out promises of Taliban good behaviour, in the event of the US agreeing to continue economic and military assistance. This is something, which India and Afghanistan should ensure does not happen. There will substantial pressure on the US to agree to an early resumption of “unconditional dialogue” with the Taliban. This should, however, remain conditional on a verifiable end to Pakistan support for cross-border terrorism. China has already made noises of support for Pakistan.

Beijing has made it clear that it will back Pakistan on its position regarding a role for the Taliban, which equates the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Trump has made it clear that India remains a “strategic partner” not just in South Asia, but across the entire “Indo-Pacific” region. The old hyphenation between India and Pakistan has been eroded, but India has to be careful on this score. We also need to bear in mind that Russia, Iran and China have close contacts with the Taliban. Economic cooperation and military training for Afghanistan has to be quickly stepped up.

MS Dhoni Once Again Proves He Is The Cool Head In A Crisis And That's Why Team India Still Need Him,"Consider the situation. India have slipped from 109/0 to 131/7 and you are batting with the tail. Still 100 runs needed but the asking rate is not that high. What would you do?

Well one man chose to put his head down and grind it out. He had seen his teammates perish to rash strokes as they tried to hit out for no reason. That man was MS Dhoni.

In the 2nd ODI vs Sri Lanka it seemed the hosts would level the series after Virat Kohli's men squandered a good start to lose 7 wickets for 22 runs. But Dhoni had other ideas.

AFP

Even as Bhuvneshwar Kumar grew in confidence to hit his maiden fifty and dominate the 100-run stand for the 8th wicket, Dhoni kept calm at the other.

He took no risks for none were needed, he recognised the need of the hour and slowly accumulated the runs. The man made 45 not out in 68 balls and had hit just one boundary.

India won by 3 wickets and now lead the series 2-0. One more victory gives them the series.

Dhoni once again proved that he is the cool head in times of crisis. With his form under the scanner in every game since he gave up the captaincy, he knows he is being judged for each move he makes. Behind the stumps he is still one of the quickest and is one of the fittest players in the world at the moment.

AFP

With the bat he has played some good knocks over the past 8 months. Dhoni's 45* was not his most entertaining one, but it was not meant to be. His job was to take us home and he did just that.

Even as doubts rise if he will or should be around till 2019, one thing is for certain. The flair or the intensity in his game has not dropped. He may not be the same player he was even five years ago, but the fire still rages which makes him a dangerous customer whether he is taking guard or sizing up the opposition from behind the stumps."
A Riot Of Vegetables,"The vibrant colours of vegetables bring out the artist in me. It makes me internally happy, French chef ALAIN PASSARD says to RANJENI A SINGH



Till the year 2000, he cooked meat. Then began his love affair with vegetables,thanks to the garden he created in 2001. Since then, French chef Alain Passard has been dishing out vegetarian fare, with each plate turning out as a piece de resistance. Just like an artist who contemplates his palette before he paints the first stroke on the canvas, Passard takes a long look at the colours of vegetables — “a mauve, yellow, a marbly white, celadon green, a pearly orange,” to quote him — for inspiration before getting into the technical aspects of cooking.And when he is not cooking, Passard is sculpting crabs and hedgehogs in bronze or making collages. The three Michelin star chef,known as the greatest vegetarian cook in the world,says,“When I saw the vegetables in the garden, I wanted to change professions, to renew my senses,change my hand. It wasn’t so much killing animals that made me change but the excitement of travelling on a different kind of fabric.”He says that nature,too,does not like the same routine — that is why she created seasons and seasonal vegetables to fire the imagination and you can,therefore,cook up something new every day. About his relationship with his garden, Passard says,“They definitely make me a better chef.



It’s made my cuisine better, and gives value to farmers, because a garden is a playground for culinary creation.”To not let refrigeration or any such thing meddle with the natural flavour of the vegetables, his lovingly tendered vegetables are transported from his garden — located in the Eure and the Sarthe regions of France — to his kitchen in Paris, in time to make meals. And when the vegetables of a particular season are over, the produce of the next season takes over. Such is his love for vegetables that his restaurant,Arpege, also sells organically grown vegetable baskets every morning.Six gardeners work at the vegetable garden in Fille sur Sarthe.Three people look after the vegetable garden in Bois-Giroult.The latest one,the garden of Porteaux, located opposite the Mont St Michel bay, has its own orchard. For the wellbeing of the gardens as well as the earth, there are two donkeys, two foals, as well as cows, chickens, and a goat that live there.Call it total communion with nature! Passard is proud of his prized possession: His vegetable garden. And he declares on his website,“I grow my own vegetables to be able to tell a story from the grain to the plate…and to be able to combine the chef ’s touch with that of the gardener,two passionate professions.Through these gardens, I have trusted nature with my creativity;it is nature that dictates my actions. The most beautiful cookery book was written by nature itself.”



The shift from meat to vegetables has changed his perspective.“Spiritually, it brought me a lot of happiness.I reconnected with painting thanks to the immeasurable amount of colours that vegetables can offer, and this gave me a completely new perspective on what being a chef means.It helped me realise that cooking vegetables was more artistic,” says Passard and adds, “I think it’s very personal. For me, there are different kinds of cooks: one that will nourish his inspiration through colours and seasons, the shapes and colours of vegetables, and one who doesn’t have that sensitivity and who will inevitably see his cuisine as a job, not as a passion, and a source of creativity.” He likes to listen to what is cooking, hearing the subtleness of the crackling,for he says, the sound of tomatoes cooking isn’t the same as the sound of beetroot cooking. “Taste is a combination of two or three flavours and it is linked to textures,and what gets on the plate is strong,yet delicate.” Does he agree with eastern wisdom that says,‘You are what you eat’? He prefers to change the maxim to ‘You eat what you want’.“That says even more about a person, because it is a personal choice. By eating what you want, you accept your tastes, and through the effort you put into it, you can know whether you like the art of the table or not,” says the chef. Is food all about cooking up a great dish and savouring it,or is it something more? “Of course! Cooking and savouring are decisive steps, but before they can even begin to exist, you have to think.Think about what it is you want, who you would like to share it with, what techniques and touches will you use? It all revolves around your senses, and they are moments you linger and long for,moments you cherish and that lead up to cooking, then serving. It’s such a sensitive space, so large....” And in this celebration of food, the family plays a key role. Passard believes that family meals are the richest of these moments.“You share dishes,ideas,a moment where you discuss your past,your future, because a family bond is timeless. It’s an opportunity to connect through classical dishes that everyone identifies with”. (Alain Passard interacted via email).

7 Indian Godmen Who Thought They Were Indomitable Until The Law Caught Up With Them!,"Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of spiritual sect Dera Sacha Sauda has been declared guilty in a rape case by a special CBI court in Panchkula.

Facebook/Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan

According to reports, the victim, who is a former follower, accused Ram Rahim Singh of repeatedly raping her inside the Dera campus near Sirsa in Haryana.

The head of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect also has two murder charges against him, one for allegedly killing journalist Ram Chander Chatrapati in 2001, and the other for killing sect manager Ranjit Singh in July 2002

The incident took place in 1999. An FIR was registered in 2002, however the Dera chief and the management of the sect have denied the allegations all throughout. Following the verdict, curfews have been imposed in several areas of the city and across the state of Punjab.

Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India’s current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country’s stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers’ productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a “development” prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."
Class VIII Student Poisons Her Classmate With Mosquito Repellent For Scoring More Marks,"A class 8 student from Bhopal allegedly poisoned her classmate by mixing mosquito repellent in her water bottle, apparently envious of her for securing higher marks in exams.

The accused girl later allegedly tried to commit suicide, fearing police inquiry into the incident, and was stated to be serious.

She put the liquid mosquito repellent into the water bottle of her classmate on Monday at their private school in Bhopal. Later, the victim drank water from her bottle following which she complained of uneasiness and started vomiting.

The girl was later taken to a hospital where she is undergoing treatment and is reported to be stable, Civil Lines police station in-charge Bhupendra Singh said.

""Both the girls, aged around 13-14, study in the same class. After drinking water from her bottle, the victim suspected something unusual and told her friend that the water smelt like mosquito repellent. After she began to feel uneasy, the school administration informed her parents, who took her to a hospital,"" Singh said.

""In the CCTV footage of the classroom, the accused girl was seen pouring the mosquito repellent into her classmate's water bottle and then hiding it inside the bag of another student,"" Singh said.

Meanwhile, the accused allegedly tried to end her life by consuming mosquito repellent at her house on Tuesday, as she feared a police inquiry into the incident, he said.

Cancer Patients Who Turn To Alternative Medicine Are 2.5 Times More Likely To Die!,"Cancer is terrifying enough to deal; from chemotherapy to the unending list of medication it is a harrowing experience for any cancer patient. Non-invasive therapies offer a cure minus the unpleasant side effects of treatments like radiotherapy in the long run.

vicare.vn

Although it is tempting to choose unconventional treatments over conventional ones you do so at your own risk. The primary reason why they are called ‘alternative’ is that they aren’t proven yet and are at best advised to be used alongside conventional medicine.

A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reveals that you are more likely to die if you turn away from conventional medication and retreat to alternative therapies.

The researchers from Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, led by lead scientist Skyler Johnson told AFP that people who choose alternative cures for common cancers are up to five times more likely to die compared to those opting for conventional treatments.

scoopnest.com

Here’s are the key highlights the study revealed:

-The risk of death five years after diagnosis was highest for 5.6 times higher for breast cancer and 4.6 times for colon cancer.

-Lung cancer patients who spurned surgery, radiation or chemotherapy in favour of herbs and vitamin, homoeopathy, special diets or other unorthodox therapies were more than twice as likely to die over the same period.

-Five-year survival rates for prostate cancer remained high—around 90 percent —for both conventional and alternative treatments. ""Prostate cancer usually grows very slowly in the early stages so few people die,"" Johnson explained by email.

-Faced with poor prognoses or painful courses of chemotherapy, which can cause severe nausea and weakness, many cancer patients place their faith in a wide range of treatments dismissed by most medical doctors as useless at best.

grandtour.ru

Researchers led by Johnson identified 281 people in the United States with the four most common types of cancer—breast, prostate, lung and colon—who turned towards one or more of these unproven treatments when diagnosed.

The team compared their health outcomes with those of 560 other cancer patients of comparable age, also taking into account race and different health factors.

On average, the first group were 2.5 times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis.

""For several reasons, I believe this may be an underestimate,"" Johnson told AFP.

To begin with, the data only covered only initial treatment, which means that some of the patients who first sought out alternative cures may have switched to standard treatments as their disease progressed, thus prolonging their lives.

ayurvedagokarna.com

It is also likely, he added, that the non-conventional medicine cohort was healthier, younger and had higher income and education—attributes that translate into better survival rates.

""We don't know the exact number of people that make the decision to pursue alternative medicine instead of conventional cancer treatment,"" Johnson said.

The researchers hope that this information helps patients make an informed decision while discussing the type of cancer treatments they need for survival and not blindly fall for the miracle cancer cures promised by multi-billion dollar businesses."
Sorry Guys! Dhinchak Pooja Clarifies That She Has Not Been Approached For Bigg Boss Season 11,"Youtube sensation and India's very first cringe pop star (yes, sadly so) Dhinchak Pooja is all over the internet. From memes to gifs, she is one hot property on the internet.

Twitter

While people continue to mock and troll her, everyone was pretty excited when reports claimed that dhinchak Pooja will be seen in Salman Khan's popular reality show Bigg Boss.

Dhinchak Pooja, who has sung songs that include ‘Selfie Maine Leli Aaj’, ‘Daaru’, ‘Dilon Ka Shooter’ and ‘Bapu Dede Thoda Cash’ has more than 30 million followers on Youtube. She is one of the most talked about people on the internet this year and that's why everyone was curious and excited to know the real person.

But here is a buzz-killer. In a recent live chat with DNA, she confirmed that she has not been approached for Salman Khan' Bigg Boss.

Twitter

In the interview, she said, ”Nahi Aisa Kuch Nahi Hai” (There’s nothing like that). And she didn't appear excited with the idea of it. When she was quizzed whether she wanted to take part in that, she said, “Dekhenge, Sochenge” (Will see. Will think about it).

Considering the fan-following of Dhinchak Pooja, we are sure this news will break a lot of hearts.

Is our criminal justice delivery system finally becoming tech-savvy?,"The federalisation, centralisation, or unification – call it what you may – of the country, despite all the divisive political rhetoric and polarising acts, is proceeding on multiple tracks as we speak. The assumption of power by a majority government in 2014 gave impetus to this process. The successful rollout of GST best exemplifies this. There is talk of bringing more entries on the state list to the concurrent list to create centralized processes that ensure economies of scale, uniformity, and “nationalist” outlook. Suddenly, even the Uniform Civil Code looks possible. No less in import and impact is the launch of the Digital Police Project under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) database. This is despite police being a subject in the State List of the Constitution and many states suspecting that CCTNS was a Union ploy to annex their police powers. But good sense prevailed and the imperative of cyber networking progressed, albeit at a slow pace.

CCTNS now allows citizens to register FIRs online, a landmark move which saves complainants, especially those grievously wronged or injured, the suffering and trauma of visiting police stations. In one stroke it inverts the colonial legacy that made the police station an object of fear and resentment and makes it just another public service which citizens can avail of from any location. The Kerala Police admitted as much when it categorized certain police stations as “Jan Maitri” police stations were citizens are guaranteed to receive exemplary courtesy and service from police officers. Feudal tendencies like prostrating before the daroga to plead for registering an FIR now give way to an e-mail alerting the daroga that an FIR has already been lodged without His Majesty’s permission.

The CCTNS will also offer seven other important services in 34 States relating to person and address verification. Verification of employees, tenants, nurses, seeking permission for hosting public events, tracking lost and found articles, and following up on vehicle theft can now take place through CCTNS without mandatory visits to the police station. The home ministry also claimed that police verification of passport applications will also proceed online. Taken together all these measures are convenient and save time for citizens and cops. CCTNS will hopefully ensure foolproof verification of criminal antecedents. This is an important step which can help net repeat offenders like the Uber taxi driver Shiv Kumar Yadav who raped a 27-year-old woman executive and was a suspect in another rape case.

At the launch, Union home minister Rajnath Singh said the CCTNS portal will provide investigators with a complete history of any criminal from anywhere across the country. Often police forces struggle to identify inter-state criminal networks or criminals who ensure that they do not repeat a crime in the same police station precincts to prevent police officers from creating a pattern of crimes. Rajnath also claimed that steps were being taken to integrate different organs of the criminal justice delivery system like the police, courts, prisons, prosecution, forensic laboratories, and juvenile homes through the CCTNS.

This can help significantly expedite trials. Currently, when court issues warrants and summons these are executed through the police. But until the next date of hearing judges and magistrates have no idea whether the summons/warrants have been executed. Often when they return without being executed, hearings become infructuous and have to be adjourned. The case with forensic labs is no different. Trial court judges and police wait inordinately long periods for testing of samples and return of results. A centralized system that can help judicial and police staff monitor progress and demand expedited disposal will help. Equally important is the integration of prisons with courts and police stations. A central system that can coordinate prisoner information, dates of their hearing, number of days, months and years they have lived in prison under trial, or under sentence makes for progressive reform and may help address the unacceptable fact that two-thirds of our prisons are choked by long incarcerated under-trials.

It is important to free police personnel from needless paper work and help them focus on their law and order and crime detection tasks. The CCTNS is not just a digital initiative but can turn around the image of police forces if it meets the vision enunciated by Rajnath Singh. It is important that the data is jealously guarded, does not fall into the hands of hackers, and does not violate the privacy of suspected criminals. While I am not certain whether the colonial legacy of the police force will retreat with digital initiatives like CCTNS such modernisation is always welcome."

Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it’s a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there’s one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it’s Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India.

Not Everything Green Is Natural Or Herbal. Watch Akshay Kumar Reveal True Ayurveda,"PARTNER

Bollywood’s torch bearer of fitness and a humble activist, Akshay Kumar believes in talking about anything and everything that is relevant to the masses. From educating people about fitness and self-defense to promoting the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, he has done it all. And once again, Akshay is back with an important message for his fans.

An avid user of Ayurvedic products, Akshay truly believes that Ayurveda is the answer to most of the modern lifestyle problems that we face. Using natural remedies have always been a part of our culture and is the way to go for him. But with the rising trend of using natural products, a number of ayurvedic products have cropped up in the market and not all of them are made using pure ayurvedic means.

In a new commercial for Lever Ayush, Akshay goes all out to point out the naïve ways in which we categorize ayurvedic products like skin care creams, soaps, and toothpaste. He points out that not every product that has a green packing or leaves on its packaging are essentially products made of Ayurveda. In a bid to educate us about the Sahi Ayurveda, Akshay talks about Lever Ayush that makes a range of Ayurvedic products using original, time tested ingredient and recipes from ancient ayurvedic texts and granthas. Lever Ayush brings alive ayurvedic recipes from over 5000 years to help solve modern-day beauty problems with their skin care, hair care, oral care products and soaps. Watch the video to know more!"
