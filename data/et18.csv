"Knee implants: Claims of superiority by ‘new and improved’ brands of knee implants have little basis: NPPA, Health News, ET HealthWorld","(File Photo used for representation only.)

NEW DELHI: Claims of superiority by ‘new and improved’ brands of knee implants over existing ones have little basis, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has concluded after examining studies published in international medical journals and consulting orthopaedic surgeons.Based on this, it feels that there is a “need to sensitize patients about limitations of these hyped technologies” and to moderate their prices – typically much higher than those for older, established implants. This emerges from the minutes of the NPPA ’s deliberations into price fixation for knee implants.It has decided to request the Indian Orthopaedic Association , Indian Medical Association and Association of Healthcare Providers (India) to sensitize orthopaedic surgeons not to push so called ‘new technologies’ with unproven claims of superiority over standard implants. The authority noted that even where patients could afford to pay the extra cost, they ought to be briefed about both the benefits and limitations of the ‘latest’ technology in comparison with the established one.One study of five widely used device technologies, including two ‘innovative’ knee implants - high flexion knee replacement and gender specific knee replacement -- concluded that none of the innovations improved functional or patient-reported outcomes.The study based on data collected from pre-market application and mandated post-market studies at the US Food and Drug Administration noted that existing devices may be safer to use in total hip or knee replacement. “Improved regulation and professional society oversight are necessary to prevent patients from being further exposed to these and future innovations introduced without proper evidence of improved clinical efficacy and safety,” stated the study published in the British Medical Journal in 2014.The NPPA examined the various types of implants based on their construction material, application and other technological aspects as the authority knew from its earlier experience with price capping for cardiac stents that hospitals, industry and surgeons would raise the issue of ‘new generation technology’ when it came to fixing a ceiling price.The NPPA noted that companies were promoting ‘high flexion knee’ implants in India claiming they have higher flexibility in day-to-day active life and sitting postures required for performing several religious and cultural practices. However, an analysis of trials suggested that “no clinically relevant or statistically significant improvement was obtained in flexion with the high flex prostheses”.“These high flexions are being sold in India at a premium in spite of the fact that its clinical long term superiority is not yet established even after a period of 20 years,” observed the NPPA.The NPPA also looked into the comparative merits of knee implants made from alloys of cobalt chromium, titanium and zirconium. The Authority found that the oldest, most widely used and clinically proven technology is implants made from alloy of cobalt-chromium (CoCr). CoCr’s limitation it that it releases tiny particles (metal ions) in the body which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.However, titanium alloy which has superior biocompatibility and enhanced erosion resistance, was found to have poor shear strength and resistance to wear. And though oxidised zirconium was shown to have less wear and tear compared to CoCr, there were a larger proportion of revision surgeries to replace or compensate for failed implants with oxidised zirconium than with CoCr.The NPPA also noted that studies and senior surgeons had found that the claimed clinical edge of un-cemented implants was yet to be established."

"Chief of Taiwan gas supplier CPC resigns after power blackout, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","TAIPEI: The chairman of Taiwan gas supplier CPC Corp resigned on Friday, three days after a power blackout hit businesses and homes across the island, affecting nearly seven million households.

The resignation of Chairman Chen Chin-te, announced at a company news conference, comes after the island's minister for economics affairs, Chih-Kung Lee, stepped down.

Chen said the CPC Corp had investigated the blackout and shared findings with the government this week, pointing out directions for reform. Details of the findings could be made public later, Chen said.

Chen emphasised the company would need to work on ensuring routine protection and maintenance work was implemented according to plan.

""As so many people were impacted by this, I wanted to deeply express CPC Corp's apologies to the people, and of course as chairman, I have to accept responsibility,"" Chen said.

The power outage was caused by ""structural problems"" and human error involving the replacement of equipment, which ultimately affected the operations of a state-owned Taiwan Power Co power plant, state-owned gas supplier CPC Corp said this week.

The government said on Wednesday it was investigating the blackout on the heavily industrialized island amid sweltering heat. Officials said a task force would be set up to investigate the cause.

Tech companies reported little impact to operations, though some companies, such as ChipMOS Technologies, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, and electronics manufacturer Foxconn, said they were affected.

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co , the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a major Apple supplier, said it experienced a power outage at its Tucheng facilities, but had back-up generators on site, according to a statement sent to Reuters late on Thursday."
"After The Failure Of 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', Distributors Now Want SRK To Refund Money","With back to back losses and big releases flopping one after the other, Hindi Film industry is indeed going through a rough patch.

Massive flops include films like Salman’s Tubelight, Ranbir Kapoor, and Katrina Kaif’s Jagga Jasoos and now, Imtiaz Ali’s Jab Harry Met Sejal has joined the list. The film that was one of the most anticipated films of the year ended up proving to be one big disaster. Apart from the producers, NH Studioz too has suffered huge losses.

The studios had acquired the rights of Tubelight for Rs. 132 crores and Jab Harry Met Sejal for Rs. 80 crores and now that both the films have proved to be such disasters, the intensity of the losses are huge.

While Salman had set a great example by returning some amount to the distributors, a Bollywoodhungama report claims that the distributors have sent an SOS message to Shah Rukh Khan, and have asked them to follow the suit.

Viral Bhayani

According to the reports, they are now expecting a refund for the backbreaking losses since Shah Rukh Khan had made good profits from the pre-sale of All India Rights to NH Studioz, satellite, music, and digital rights.

Pinterest

Just to jog your memory a little, SRK had distributors of his 2015 film Dilwale when they had incurred losses and he had refunded close to Rs. 25 crores to cover up 50% losses to distributors of Dilwale.

And this wasn’t the first time SRK did so because, in 2001 and 2005, Shah Rukh Khan had refunded the individual distributors of his films Asoka (Eros) and Paheli (UTV) after they failed to perform at the box-office.

While no actor or producer is bounded to return money to distributors, our actors are definitely setting a great example.

"England vs Windies, 1st Test, West Indies tour of England, 2017","Stumps, day 2: An almost perfect day for England was washed away towards the end by rain. The timing of the declaration at the fall of Cook's wicket was perfect. And the Windies batsmen were all at sea against the likes of Anderson and Broad. But Hope and Powell braved the odds and are still standing their ground. If the ball continues to move, the ground beneath will veil into a mass of quick sand sucking them into miseries. But Windies would hope to come out with a stomach for a fight. The major bone of contention - the weather - is expected to be cloudy all day long. Tadaa!

The farewell note from Rob for the day reads: England will be happy to have moved the game along today despite the rain and Cook's double century has put them well in command. West Indies battled gamely against Broad and Anderson in tricky conditions late on and showed more skill and fight than they had with the ball. England are still well on top, though.

The dreadful has occured. It is stumps on day 2! The rains aren't going to relent and the umpires decided to call it a day. It would be an early start. Yes, you got me right. This being a day/night encounter, it would be an early start at 1:30pm local (6:00pm IST) and they can play on till 10:00pm local (2:30am IST).

19:55 Local Time, 18:55 GMT, 00:25 IST: England did test the Windies' batsmen in the little session between post tea and pre rain. Both the batsmen had some nervy moments and played a few shots on an alternating basis. But the ball seemed to be dominating the bat for it to make a rare occasion in this Test. The English unit would be disappointed to go off as the conditions favored the bowlers to go on and bowl their hearts out. It would be very interesting to see how the game pans out if we get more play today. The latest they need to start is by 9:00pm local. And if they do, they can go on till 10:00pm.

Rob has discouragement in his words when he says: The clouds are set in and it's raining quite hard now. I'd say the chances of much more play are very slim.

19:30 Local Time, 18:30 GMT, 00:00 IST: The two umpires having a confab. The end result is they are going off! The hover cover is being dragged in. Rain was expected and it has come down to no one's surprise. The umbrellas are going up in the stands. The rains getting a bit heavier as well as the groundsmen get about their business. We will keep you updated.

15.6 Broad to Kyle Hope, no run, a moment of thought into that leave outside off as Kyle Hope thought of playing at it for a second before letting it go

15.5 Broad to K Powell, 1 run, bends the ball in from round the wicket and the batsman clips the ball away by getting his willow ahead of his pads. A bit wide of mid-on for a single

The rains have arrived. The players are staying on for the moment being."

"Columbia Clinic launched at Embassy TechVillage in Bengaluru, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Bangalore: Over the last two decades there has been an alarming rise in cardiovascular disease , diabetes, hypertension, asthma and respiratory diseases and cancers in India, especially among the urban population. According to statistics, every year, roughly 5.8 million Indians die from heart and lung diseases, stroke, cancer and diabetes. Around 50.8 million population are affected by diabetes alone, as per WHO records. Another 15 per cent suffers from arthritis, as per statistics.Today several organizations have realized how non-communicable diseases can plague the future of the country, unless proactive measures are taken. Keeping the health and wellness of their employees in mind, many organizations today, are tying-up with corporate hospitals to set up clinics within their campuses, so that health of employees go uncompromised without wasting vital productive hours cueing up at city hospitals and clinics far away from offices.In a similar initiative, Embassy TechVillage , Marathalli Outer Ring Road has tied-up with Columbia Asia Hospitals to set-up Columbia Clinic within the campus. This single floor clinic with 650 square feet area is equipped with all basic facilities including health consultation, pharmacy, lab sample collection, treatment room and nursing care.“The clinic will cater to the health requirements of 18,000 professionals from companies including Wells Fargo, Cisco, Sony, LG and Flipkart. In this corporate set-up, employees can walk-in anytime during clinic hours. With this, we aim to provide high quality patient care and spread awareness about lifestyle related chronic diseases through regular health sessions at the campus,” said Sujit Paul , Vice President – Operations - Clinics, Pharmacy, MedSupply, Physiotherapy, Columbia Asia Hospitals.A medical officer will be available at the clinic during the day and consultation with specialists can be done with prior appointment. The clinic will be functional between 8 am and 8 pm on weekdays and between 8 am and 2 pm on Saturdays.Speaking about the benefits of having Columbia Clinic within Embassy TechVillage, Mike Holland, CEO, Embassy Office Parks, said, “Embassy strives to provide our 175+ corporate occupiers world class business ecosystems.

Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
"If You're Worried About Figuring Out All The New iOS 11 Features, Apple's Got You Covered","Apple is set to release the latest version of its smartphone and tablet operating system sometime next month. And while iOS 11 is still being beta tested, the company wants users to be ready when the update drops.

To do this, Apple has uploaded a series of tutorial videos on its YouTube channel, teaching users how to use some of the new features incoming on the iPad

The first video showcases the new iPad Dock, including how to drag and drop files across apps open in the window. The next focuses on the Files app, the iOS equivalent of any standard Android File Manager app. It’s a little late to the party sure, but we’re never going to say no to a feature that lets you dive into your smartphone’s storage.

There are also videos on multitasking, scanning and signing documents with the iPad, using the Apple Pencil, as well as multi touch features.

If you’re not particularly good with new technology but still want to stay updated, Apple’s videos are a great way to tell all about what you may have missed in the news. Each video is about a minute long, with a quick explainer of how to work the new features.

And if you already know how all of this is done, or you’re pretty sure you can figure it out yourself, think of it as an easy way to pass the buck when you’re parents want you to teach them."

The never ending quest for Independence,"As India celebrated the 70th anniversary of Independence from foreign rule, a friend sent me a series of photographs taken in the flood-ravaged areas in the north east.

The pictures showed people – men, women and children – standing of the roofs of submerged houses, or standing waist-deep in floodwater. All the pictures had one thing in common: the people in them were, one and all, saluting the tricolour that rose, triumphantly, above the deluge.

Taken together, the pictures were an inspiring testimony to the spirit of Independence.

However, on the same day, the TOI carried a news report about Choudipur, a tiny village in UP, whose residents refused to join in the nationwide celebrations for Independence Day.

The reason? Seventy years after the country gained freedom, no development whatsoever has reached them.

The village is mired in abject poverty, cut off from the rest of the country as there are no roads worth the name to get to it. There is no electricity, and only four households in the village have indoor toilets. The great majority of the villagers have no option but to defecate in the open.

Places like Choudipur are obviously exceptions to the general progress that the country in its entirety has made since it gained freedom.

Longevity has significantly increased, both for men and women. Infant mortality has been greatly reduced. Diseases such as polio have been largely eradicated. Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of the abyss of extreme poverty.

But places like Choudipur serve to remind us that though we have indeed travelled a long way since our historic ‘midnight tryst with destiny’, we still have a long way to go.

According to varying estimates, anything between 25 per cent and 34 per cent of the country’s population still exists below the officially accepted poverty line.

Brutal oppression of dalits and other marginalised sections of society remains a national stigma, as do the crimes of violence against women which are an everyday occurrence.

Joblessness continues to grow, and not just among the uneducated or unskilled. According to a recent report, one out of every two MBAs is unemployed.

All this is not to downplay the great progress that the country has made in 70 years.

But while acknowledging and taking justifiable pride in the country’s many achievements – as the flood-affected people in the photographs sent to me were shown to be doing – we should also recognise the grim realities as represented by places like Choudipur, and the uncounted thousands of others like it.

Such recognition is necessary because it serves to remind us that Independence – social, economic and political – is not a destination, but a journey. It is a road we must continue to travel, not with cynicism or despair, but with determination and hope.

That’s the best salute that we can offer the tricolour of freedom."
"11 Reasons Why The Japanese Are Healthier, Fitter And Live Longer Than The Rest Of Us","It’s a question, which has been thrown around for quite some time now; how do the rice eating Japanese (including other countries in East Asia) stay healthier than the rest of the world?

hudsongrovepm.com

While health and fitness experts have been making outrages claims for some time now traditional practices and habits of Asian cultures is what makes them healthier than the rest. These are some the rules they live by:

They take unprocessed food out of the equation

enechange.jp

Several elementary schools in Japan serve mid-day meals that made from organically grown local foods, which leaves very little options for children to eat anything otherwise. Inculcating such healthy habits at home further changes their families mind set towards eating.

They choose rice over wheat

olagiatopaidi.gr

Studies suggest that rice intake is also associated with lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease while wheat flour increases it. It also typically free of gut irritants, phytic acid and lectins, which is useful since most people are gluten intolerant. They have it in moderation though since carbs like rice convert to sugar in your body and create sugar spikes, which can be dangerous especially if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic.

They use smaller plates, which results in smaller portion sizes

comorie.nifty.com

The Japanese curtail not just their food servings, but also the size of their plates. Use the side plates that you use to eat salads, and bread with to have your main meals, which are about four-to-six inches in diameter.

They eat fewer calories with every bite they take

iberitaupdate.blogspot.in

The idea is to combine a decent amount of foods that are lower in caloric density. For instance, typical Japanese meals include rice, a modest portion of meat or fish, and a couple of vegetable dishes. The idea is not to start preparing their cuisine but to include higher quantities of whole foods, and more fruits and vegetables, and cut down processed foods that have more ‘calories per bite’.

They snack mindfully

hellosehat.com

Teach your children to enjoy the treats and snacks, but in the right frequency and amount; like the Japanese who eat in smaller quantities and lesser frequencies. They exercise what is known as ‘flexible restraint’ when it comes to consuming unhealthy food.

They eat seafood every day

tourprom.ru

Apart from the protein and nutrition the biggest benefit you get from the daily consumption of seafood like fish. It keeps the level of omega 3 to omega 6 in check, which has an anti-inflammatory effect on your body, helping keep the prevalence of chronic disease at bay.

They’ve made seaweed a staple in their diet

bbcgoodfood.com

A report from the U.N. states that Japan consumes about 1,00,000 tons of seaweed a year as they add it to their main meals as well as snack on it. A cup of seaweed packs anywhere between 2 to 9 grams of protein, more potassium than a banana and is also a natural source of iodine (much more reliable than adding it to salt), which is useful in regulating your thyroid.

They stack up on a lot of fermented food

kind-eats.com

Japanese cuisine is loaded with fermented foods such as miso, soy, natto, tempeh and soy sauce (of which an average person consumes 1.8 gallons per year!). Eating fermented food has several health benefits a couple of key ones being strengthening your immune system and easing digestion that you can get just by including a few servings a week.

Most of the tea they consume is green

limia.jp

Japan ranks amongst the top ten nations in the world that consume green tea as most of the tea they consume is green. Green tea is loaded with antioxidants, which helps boosts your defence against cancer. It also reduces your risk of heart disease and even increases cognitive function. A study also claims that citizens who drank 5 cups of green tea a day a 26 percent lower mortality rate.

They make physical activity a religious part of their daily activity

The Japanese live a very active lifestyle since childhood. In fact, according to the World Health Organisation, more than 98 percent of Japanese children walk or bike to school. This statistic only proves that Japanese children probably get in the recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity just by going to school and back.

They maintained squatter-styled toilets

introvertjapan.com

Unlike other cultures and countries, including ours, the Japanese use toilets, which require you to get into a deep squat. Squatting while crapping has several benefits over using a western-style toilet, such as loosening and limbering up your limbs as well as emptying your bowels completely (50 seconds on an average) three times as fast as it would take you on a western toilet.

Their medical system relies heavily on prevention over cure

baomoi.com

While countries across the globe have adopted a medical system that’s quick to jump to using antacids, antibiotics and NSAIDs the Japanese still inculcate heavy use of their ancient medical systems that attempt to get to the root of the problem by using healthy habits, herbs and prevention practices. That’s why meditation, martial arts and other calming rituals that strike a balance between their mind, body and spirit are still an integral part of their culture."
Bad politics behind endless project delays,"In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited the example of a railway line between Howrah and Champdanga in Bengal. It was decided in 1975 to put in broadgauge tracks in this 74-km stretch. Part of the project was completed — the rest has been stuck for 42 years. Modi said his monthly reviews of projects have speeded up investment, completion and commissioning of new projects. It is welcome that some projects are getting completed in this fashion. Mere monitoring will not, however, help others get built.

Delays in executing projects do not really highlight the failure of Indians to strategically plan, manage and execute new projects. What it does underline, however, is the trait of overambitious politicians to allocate projects to suit particular constituencies, with scant regard about whether it is possible to execute them all in time.

An over-supply of announcements tends to spread resources like capital, manpower and managerial skills too thin on the ground for any one project. Delay follows. The solution is for politicians to refrain from throwing confetti-showers of projects, which are much more than the capacity of the public or private sector to execute, to impress voters.

Data from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) shows that the value of projects completed every quarter peaked in March 2016, five quarters ago. It has been falling, on average, since then. The last two quarters, from January to June 2017, have been especially bad. CMIE cites the lack of investment appetite and says most projects being finished now were proposed 10 years ago. The government should try to mitigate financial and other risks associated with investments to bring animal spirits back to the business of forming and executing new projects."
Yen for Lutyens: The old boy shows up in the least expected places 😜,"The British architect is celebrated in song and coveted in bungalow. Those drunk on nationalistic power clearly see no contradiction in desperately wanting to live in a colonial hangover. Some of the great unwashed who wash up in Parliament commit their own atrocities as tenants of these colonnaded gems, and, now, in the nightly battle hymn of the Republic, the bitterest grapes of wrath are roared at the ‘Lutyens elitists’. Despite all this, Sir Edwin created a lasting legacy: architectural, social and, we thought, uniquely Indian.

No-ji, he was the go-to/must-have architect of the civilised world of the 1930s. His imprimatur is also on the cenotaph in London’s Whitehall, country seats in Britain, and the World War I cemeteries of Northern France. A couple of days ago, when the echoes of India at 70 resounded at his Kingsway aka Rajpath, we found him in – Liverpool.

Actually, the city of the Beatles hadn’t seen him ‘standing there’ for nearly a century. But now the ‘Lutyens crypt’ is the latest tourist attraction on Hope Street, the world’s only avenue with a cathedral at each end: the largest Anglican one in the UK, and the modernist Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King where a recent restoration project revealed Liverpool’s best-kept secret.

Sir Edwin Lutyens was commissioned to design a cathedral. In 1933, the foundation stone was laid, and the first stage, a crypt, was built. Then WWII put paid to every civilian activity, followed by the familiar story of inflation. The entire project was shelved. But the Catholics still wanted their cathedral. An Anglican architect won the competition, fulfilling the two criteria: it shouldn’t cost more than a million pounds and it had to be built in five years. Btw, the Anglican cathedral’s designer was Catholic, and it took 70 years.

The grand halls of Lutyens’s once-forgotten crypt house, apart from three tombs, the cathedral’s priceless treasury and historical exhibits. In the edifying blend of sacred and secular now common in the West, it’s also the venue of, et al, the annual beer festival.

What would make Sir Edwin turn in his own tomb? To be reviled as ‘elitist’ in India or, closer home, be glorified in ‘a monument to the greatest building never built’?

"Excessive margins fuelled corruption in orthopaedics, says NPPA, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representative photo

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority’s decision to cap the prices of knee implants was based on its conclusion that excessive trade margins were sustaining a system of ‘commissions’, especially to doctors and hospitals, which was “the biggest reason for price distortion and the root cause of unethical practices in the system of orthopaedic healthcare ”. NPPA ’s examination of data confirmed that, just as in stents, “the margins were exorbitant and irrational, indicating unethical ‘profiteering’ at every level and mostly at the level of distributors and hospitals.The NPPA therefore observed that cutting out such huge margins would encourage “selection of device on its intrinsic value supported by clinical data and not based on margins to distributors, hospitals or orthopaedic surgeons”.The minutes of the NPPA deliberations show that its studies established that trade margins were not going to the manufacturer to be used for product development or investing in research and development. The NPPA concluded that the price caps would not deprive the industry of reasonable margins or adversely affect innovation and R&D as claimed by industry.Import prices already include the R&D cost and sufficient margins, it argued. With 90% of the knee implant market being imports from multinational device companies, the import price has been used as the basis for the price cap.The authority noted that though the industry talked of self-regulation there was no tangible outcome over 5-6 months. “With about 90% of the market in hand, MNC importers could have rationalised the margins and local manufacturers would have followed,” noted the NPPA, adding that even the president of the orthopaedic association suggested bringing down costs in consultation with the industry, but there was no follow up.Importers and manufacturers justified higher prices saying they needed higher margins to enable payment to distributors and hospitals (including doctors) in existing business model. “They expressed that if they do not pay these margins, distributors and hospitals will not buy their product and rivals will benefit,” noted the NPPA."

"India to seek investments for oil and gas auctions at mega hydrocarbon event in UK, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government will seek global investor participation for its ongoing mega oil and gas auction during the international Society of Petroleum Engineers ( SPE ) Offshore Europe conference to take place in Aberdeen, UK next month.The four day-conference that will begin on 5 September will include technical sessions, conferences, workshops, exhibitions from industry players across the value chain of the oil and gas sector and include a special event by the Indian government on Open Acreage Licensing Programme ( OALP ), National Data Repository (NDR) and the latest investment opportunities in the Indian oil and gas sector.“In order to showcase investment opportunities in upstream Oil & Gas sector in India and recent policy reforms – OALP, Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy ( HELP ) and National Data Repository, the government is organising an event at SPE Offshore Europe-2017 at Aberdeen,” upstream regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons ( DGH ) said in a notice today.The SPE Offshore Europe Conference is expected to witness participation from oil and gas giants including Schlumberger Limited, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Wood Group, Petrobas, GE and leading E&P professionals from across the world.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had called upon the global investor community to participate in India's current oil and gas bidding round at the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) held in Istanbul, Turkey last month. The move by the government has the potential to attract investors in the auction which has already received over 45 Expression of Interest (EoI) in more than a month, according to DGH website. However, a senior executive close to the auction process said the government has received around 75 EOIs since the auctions were made live on 1 July.The oil ministry is offering over 85 percent of the country’s 3.14 million square kilometres of hydrocarbon sedimentary area under the new bidding mechanism of OALP and a revamped exploration policy HELP. The new OALP bidding mechanism under HELP allows investors to bid for acreages throughout the year. The current auction under HELP follows the just-concluded Discovered Small Fields (DSF) bidding rounds under which 31 blocks were awarded to around two dozen mostly small-sized firms."
Junior players impress in Indian Hockey team’s Europe tour,"Indian Hockey team’s thrilling 4-3 win over Austria in the last match of their Europe tour brings good tidings for sports lovers. After a disappointing start to the tour with two consecutive losses, the team showed remarkable resilience to bounce back. The team won their last three encounters to finish on a winning note. Hockey India’s decision to blood younger players into the playing eleven seems to be slowly paying off.

The 18-member new look team had six players – Gurjant Singh, varun Kumar, Armaan Qureshi, Dipsan Tirkey, Nilkanta Sharma and goalkeeper Suraj Karkera – who made their international debut. India lost its first two matches against Olympic silver medallists – Belgium but they could draw solace from the fact that the team comprised of nine players who were a part of the winning 2016 junior world cup team. The team had managed to impress with their defence but was found wanting in attack.

After making some changes, India took on Netherlands in the Robo Cup where they surprised the opposition team with their attacking skills. Gurjant scored his first international goal for the senior team with a reverse shot high into the net off a rebound. This is the most potent weapon in his armoury that is soon going to make Gurjant one of the most feared players in the opposition’s striking circle. Varun and Armaan too impressed with their skills, they alongwith Mandeep Singh have now added more depth to the Indian attack.

India’s consecutive wins against Netherlands are also significant because the Dutch had decimated the Germans 7-1 a week ago. In the final game against Austria, India led 3-1 at the start of the final quarter but frittered away the advantage. The score line read 3-3 with a minute to go and it was almost certain that the honours will be evenly divided. But India put up a spirited performance till the end resulting in Chinglensena’s deflection off a Gurjant cross-hit that found the back of the net with seconds to go in the match.

The investment on youth pays off for India as the team finish on a high in the tour of Europe.

Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness. What is his caste you may ask? Pat comes the reply, he is an Indian. For him, the happiness of the people around him is more important than the caste he belongs to. Known for their strong stand to unite one and all, United Colors of Benetton strongly believe in the ideology of unity. In this video, they bring alive the incredible story of this man in Lucknow and exemplifies how we all can be #UnitedByFaith."

"Disrupted Gut Microbiome makes children more susceptible to amoebic dysentry, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Children with lower diversity of microbial species in their intestines are more susceptible to severe infection with the Entamoeba histolytica parasite , according to a new study published in PLOS Pathogens E. histolytica is an amoeba that typically spreads via food, water, or hands that have been contaminated with feces. Some infected people have no symptoms, but others experience symptoms of varying severity, from mild abdominal symptoms to life-threatening disease. The factors that influence severity are unclear, but previous studies suggest an important role for the gut microbiome In the new study, Koji Watanabe of the University of Virginia and colleagues collected and analyzed stool samples from children in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. They found that children who experienced colon inflammation because of E. histolytica infection had lower diversity of microbes in their stool than children with asymptomatic infection.To better understand these findings, the researchers used antibiotics to disrupt the gut microbiome in mice. They then exposed the mice to E. histolytica to see whether they were more susceptible to infection. The researchers found that mice treated with antibiotics had more severe colon inflammation than untreated mice.Mouse tissue and gene expression analysis showed that disruption of the gut microbiome decreased the activity of infection-fighting white blood cells known as neutrophils. The surface of neutrophils in these mice had lower amounts of a protein known as CXCR2 than in untreated mice. CXCR2 plays a role in the recruitment of neutrophils to fight infection in the gut, so decreased CXCR2 levels likely resulted in the observed decreased neutrophil activity.The analysis also showed that disruption of the mouse gut microbiome decreased production of a protein known as interleukin-25, which aids the function of the mucosal barrier that acts as the intestine’s first line of defense against infection.These findings suggest a molecular mechanism by which disruption of the gut microbiome increases severity of E. histolytica infection, but further research will be needed to determine if similar molecular effects occur in humans. Meanwhile, the finding that disruption of the mouse gut microbiome can interfere with neutrophil activity may be of broader interest in research of other infectious diseases."

Australia recall Faulkner, Coulter-Nile for India tour

Australia have recalled all-rounder James Faulkner and pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile for their upcoming tour of India. While Faulkner makes his way back to the ODI squad, Coulter-Nile finds a place in squads of both the limited-overs formats. The T20I squad also includes uncapped left-arm pacer Jason Beherendorff, who averages 19.47 for his 53 scalps in 38 T20s.

Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc, meanwhile, continues his recovery from an injury to his right foot away from the game. The spearhead of Australia's bowling attack sustained the injury midway through Australia's Test tour of India early this year. He played the Champions Trophy but has been given more time to return to his best.

With the upcoming Ashes series in mind, Starc has not been included in Australia's two-Test tour of Bangladesh (starting from August 27) as well as the India tour.

Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley explained that that the fast bowler's recovery has been slower than expected: ""We have recently reviewed the progress of Mitchell's right foot injury and the healing process has been slower than we would have liked.""

""Consequently, in order to ensure his best possible preparation for the Ashes, he will be unavailable for the Tour of India and will continue his rehab in Australia with an aim to have him play for New South Wales in the domestic one-day cup.""

Australia are scheduled to play five ODIs and three T20Is in India during the months of September and October this year.

ODI squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood, Ashton Agar, Hilton Cartwright, Adam Zampa T20I squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Jason Behrendorff, Daniel Christian, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Glenn Maxwell, Tim Paine, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa

After constantly being laid low by injuries, Coulter-Nile found success while representing Kolkata Knight Riders during IPL 2017. The fast bowler, who bagged 15 wickets in eight games for KKR, is expected to make a big impression during the India tour. Cricket Australia selector Trevor Hohns talked up Coulter-Nile's return while also praising all-rounder Faulkner's familiarity with the sub-continent.

""Nathan brings raw pace to the side with good variation. It is great to see him back from injury and we are hopeful he will have a big impact in this series. ""James Faulkner is a solid One-Day campaigner and is very familiar with sub-continent conditions, coming off a very good tour of Sri Lanka last year. We hope that he will take his chance in returning to the one-day side,"" Hohns said.

Cricket Australia have also invested some amount of faith in Western Australia all-rounder Hilton Cartwright, picking him in both the squads. Cartwright, who made his Test debut for Australia earlier this year, comes with the reputation of being a big-hitter and is expected to slot into the shorter format with ease.

""Hilton is an aggressive striker of the ball and we think his game will be well suited to the transition to short-form cricket,"" Hohns opined.

While wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine has kept his T20I spot despite poor outings with the bat during the home series against Sri Lanka in February, all-rounder Daniel Christan braces himself for a return to the national side after more than three years.

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC,"BCCI VS COA

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:39 PM

The CoA is unhappy with the ouster of CEO Rahul Johri from the BCCI meeting © AFP

In its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked for the removal of the current office bearers of the BCCI for the non-compliance of the court's orders to adopt the Lodha reforms. The CoA cited the court's January 2 ruling that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their BCCI posts, for the eviction of acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary.

""The Committee of Administrators submits that since the then President and Secretary of the BCCI had been removed because the BCCI failed to implement the reforms mandated by the Judgement despite a period of six months having passed, it is only fair that the current office bearers be treated in the same manner because a further period of six months have elapsed since the said office bearers submitted their undertakings and the reforms mandated by this Hon'ble Court have still not been implemented,"" the report stated.

The report has been submitted two days ahead of the July 18 hearing, wherein the three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud will reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership. Earlier in an SGM held on July 26, BCCI had decided to selectively adopt the Lodha reforms, leaving out five of them.

It was during the same SGM on July 26, when BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was asked to leave. The latest report by CoA, claims that the office-bearers deliberately misconstrued the SC order and ousted Johri from the SGM.

""After the attendance register was signed, the CEO and the other administrative staff including the legal team of the BCCI was asked to leave the meeting on the purported basis that the order dated July 24, 2017 passed by this hon'ble Court only permits office bearers to attend the same""

The CoA further wrote that this was a pre-planned and orchestrated move by the BCCI and explained the 'obvious' motive behind the same. ""The motivations of such a clever manoeuvre are fairly obvious. The presence of the CEO in the previous SGM held on June 26, 2017 had enabled the Comittee of Administrators to receive first-hand account of the proceedings and bring conduct of certain specific individuals to the attention of this Hon'ble Court. The absence of CEO from the July 26 SGM would make (and has made) that task very difficult.""

The CoA brought to SC's notice that the BCCI had failed to adopt a new fund disbursement policy which was formulated by Deloitte in line with the Lodha reforms. ""Adoption of the new fund disbursment policy by BCCI is one such reform aimed at ensuring proper allocation of funds to the State Associations based on need/requirement and with appropriate checks in place to ensure proper utlization and reporting by State associations.""

The report conveyed to the SC, BCCI's failure to appoint a new Ombudsman, despite the position being left vacant since September 2016 after the Justice (retd.) AP Shah stepped down. He had been roped in to address the conflict of interest issues prevalent within Indian cricket. The CoA also noted that the BCCI failed to adopt the new BCCI conflict of interest rules during the SGM in July, despite being handed the copy of the same through email more than a month prior to the meeting. Since the BCCI did not list new conflict of interest rules as one of the five reforms it was against, there was no justifiable reason for BCCI to not adopt the same.

GOD’S OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura’s alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.“Monkeys.They are chashma chor — spectacle stealing thieves,” he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:“You can’t blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.” We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna’s chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone — holy men, devotees and tourists — entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city’s Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister’s offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings — temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."
"energy supplies: PG course on solar energy in Kolkata, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Kolkata: Come October and a post-graduate course in solar energy will be launched here, as Amity University and the NB Institute for Rural Development (NBIRT) signed an MoU on Wednesday.“The one-year course with Amity University, thanks to Prof Dhrubajyoti Chattopadhyay, vice-chancellor, Amity University, will go long way in creating green engineers for sustainable future in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s target of 1 lakh mw solar projects by 2022,” said S P Gon Chaudhury. NBIRT has been the brainchild of this renewable energy expert, who’s also an Ashden award winner and adviser to the state government’s power department.He added, “India needs huge solar field engineers to achieve 100000 MW Solar target by 2022.We have Surya Mitra and reseachers in the field of Solar Energy. But what about middle level engineers who play an important role in commissioning . Unfortunately, we do not have any institution catering to this sector.”India’s significant and sustained economic growth is placing enormous demand on its energy resources. However, there is a pervasive demand-supply imbalance that necessitates serious efforts by the government of India to augment energy supplies . The country imports about 80 percent of its oil. With the threat of a further increase in oil prices, serious problems with regard to energy security is anticipated. India also runs the substantial risk of lesser thermal capacity being installed. While dependence on imported coal is increasing, supply of indigenous coal is likely to decrease in the coming years because of production and logistic constraints.Renewable energy can make a substantial contribution in each of the above mentioned areas. It is in this context that the role of renewable energy needs to be seen. It is no longer “alternate energy”, but is increasingly becoming a vital part of the solution to the nation’s energy needs.The thrust given by National Climate Plan and Jawaharlal Lal Nehru National Solar Mission have suddenly created the need to train large human resource in the field of new and renewable energy especially with expertise in solar energy. Energy Institution in the country except few IITs, running MTech course in Renewable Energy. The NBIRT of Kolkata was the only College giving Renewable Energy Diploma to the students in association with TAFE, Queensland Government, Australia.The PG diploma course is designed in such a way so that students get more practical knowledge to undertake field-level renewable energy projects. The institutions conducting Renewable Energy M. Tech/M.Sc and PG Diploma are MSc (Renewable Energy), Department of Physics, University of Lucknow, MTech (Renewable Energy Engineering and Management) and PG Diploma (Renewable Energy), TERI University , New Delhi, MTech (Energy Management) and PG Diploma (Renewable Energy), Allahabad Agricultural Institute (Deemed University), Allahabad (www.aaidu.org), MPhil (Energy), Gandhigram Rural University, Gandhigram (www.ruraluniv.ac.in), MPhil (Energy), Centre for Non-Conventional Energy Resources, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur (www.uniraj.ernet.in). So, there’s a need to introduce PG Diploma in Renewable Energy (Solar Energy) Science and Technology."

"Human infertility: New method could overcome genetic male infertility, Health News, ET HealthWorld","London: Using a stem cell technique for sperm creation , scientists have created healthy offspring from genetically infertile male mice, offering a potential new approach to tackling a common genetic cause of human infertility Our sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes. Usually, girls have two X chromosomes (XX) and boys have one X and one Y (XY), but approximately one in 500 boys are born with an extra X or Y.Having three rather than two sex chromosomes can disrupt formation of mature sperm and cause infertility In a study published in the journal Science, scientists at Francis Crick Institute in London and Kyoto University in Japan described a way to remove the extra sex chromosome to produce fertile offspring.If the findings can be safely transferred into humans, it might eventually be possible for men with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Double Y syndrome (XYY) who are infertile to have children through assisted reproduction using this technique.""Our approach allowed us to create offspring from sterile XXY and XYY mice,"" said first author Takayuki Hirota from the Francis Crick Institute.""It would be interesting to see whether the same approach could one day be used as a fertility treatment for men with three sex chromosomes,"" Hirota said.The team took small pieces of ear tissue from XXY and XYY mice, cultured them, and collected connective tissue cells known as fibroblasts.They turned the fibroblasts into stem cells and noticed that in the process, some of the cells lost the extra sex chromosome.With an existing method, they used specific chemical signals to 'guide' the stem cells into becoming cells that have the potential to become sperm.These cells developed into mature sperm when injected into the testes of a host mouse.The researchers then harvested these mature sperm and used them through assisted reproduction to create healthy, fertile offspring.In a preliminary experiment, the team found that stem cells produced from fibroblasts of men with Klinefelter syndrome also lost the extra sex chromosome.However, more research is needed before this approach could ever be used in humans, the researchers pointed out.--IANSgb/vm"
Chasing shadows: “New India” is not compatible with the state playing moral police,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for a “new India”, a vision that would be impoverished if it is confined merely to building shiny roads, airports and power stations (Saudi Arabia is already there, but that’s not where new India wants to get to). It should incorporate changed mindsets as well, where citizens are empowered rather than seen as mere wards of the state. That, in turn, means that citizens are allowed to make their own choices as long as these do not impinge on the freedom of others, instead of the state and authorities appointed by it making all their decisions for them. Without such empowerment, new India is bound to fail.

Unfortunately, there are just too many instances of this principle being denied in practice. Contrary to the recommendations of a parliamentary panel, the government may not remove transgenders from the ambit of section 377 of IPC, when this section itself ought to be dropped as no government should dictate sexual choices made by consenting adults. This means, in effect, that transgenders have no sexual rights and their very existence is criminalised.

Likewise the nebulous meme of ‘love jihad’, popularised by the Sangh Parivar, is often invoked by conservative parents when they want to stop their children from entering into interfaith marriages. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken up an alleged instance of ‘love jihad’ and discovered a ‘pattern’ in such cases, which in turn has persuaded an initially reluctant Supreme Court to order a probe. It is disturbing that if young men or women marry who they want they are subjected to such intervention and interdiction by the state, including by NIA which immediately raises the prospect of a terror link.

The apex court has suggested a connection between the alleged ‘love jihad’ case and the Blue Whale Challenge, indeed an apt analogy. There is grave reason to doubt the phenomenon of a rash of teen suicides allegedly linked to an online game (see accompanying oped), and stopping teen suicides by telling Facebook and Google not to provide a platform for Blue Whale is a bit like stopping terror by interdicting interfaith marriages (doing so, in fact, increases the probability of terror and communal violence by ghettoizing and putting up walls between communities). To the extent that NIA goes haring off after red herrings, it will blind itself to the next terror plot when it does unfold."
Saha's 'immeasurable' brilliance leaves the world gasping,"Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp with his wicketkeeping skills in the Colombo Test © Getty

When pitches start to wither, when the bounce gets fickle, when a ball throws up dust on hitting the turf, it is the batsmen you worry about. ""Oooh"" we go when one takes off past the shoulder of the bat or hurtles through at ankle height. The spinner has a mischievous grin, the batsman the look of a condemned man.

You don't think too much about the wicketkeeper though. The byes that result from a wicked surface go against his name and if he keeps a clean sheet, it doesn't stare at you from a scorecard a fortnight later. And yet, as much as the batsman almost, he has to combat the surface. If the batsman is beaten, he lives another day, if the 'keeper is beaten, it is four byes and slip looks at short leg with a twisted smile and a raised eyebrow.

I thought of that over the last couple of days of the Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. Normally, the batsmen are on the guest list there. Hundreds are strewn around and if you are Mahela Jayawardene, you only count the runs after the mandatory hundred has appeared. But this track was different. It was powdery to start off and by the third morning, the ball was spitting and bouncing. By the fourth morning, the odd one was taking off almost vertically as Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews discovered.

And yet, every time the ball beat the bat, at varying heights, it found a comforting glove. Every time it acquired a mind of its own after pitching, it was arrested and returned to the bowler. There were no oohs and aahs, no exaggerated reactions, just a calm gather and a crouch for the next ball. Keeping was hazardous but Wriddhiman Saha made it look like just another balance-sheet to be put together and filed away.

I have very rarely seen wicket-keeping like this. Maybe Nayan Mongia standing up to Anil Kumble's rockets on a pitch of variable bounce. Maybe Syed Kirmani at his peak. Kiran More was good and MS Dhoni brought his own style to a difficult job and rarely had a bad day. But Saha, so understated, was a treat to watch. Only once in the second innings was he beaten and he would have needed a fisherman's net to catch that one. And when he caught Mathews off another Jadeja sortie that bombed the pitch, we gasped.

Jadeja was bowling in the high nineties, more than ten kmph faster than Ashwin who was going past the outside edge for fun himself, more than 15 kmph faster than Herath on average and a good 20 kmph quicker than the debutant Pushpakumara. When he felt like it, he crossed 100 kmph. After he faced the first ball, Mathews asked for an arm-guard because the first one hissed at him violently.

But Saha seemed unperturbed. Indeed, amusing as it seems, taking a DRS call seemed to fluster him more. He couldn't have known where the ball was headed and yet it seemed he did. In our commentary box, Vijay Dahiya, no mean 'keeper himself, was rejoicing. Ajay Jadeja wanted to make him the Man of the Match.

In time to come, there will be nothing to measure Saha's brilliance, no scorecard will be read in reverence, no highlights packages will be preserved, no accolades offered on awards nights.

But the eyes saw it. And left imprints behind. Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp in Colombo.

Rohit intends a ""behind the scene"" role as India's new ODI deputy

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:28 PM

Rohit Sharma, the India ODI team's newly-appointed vice-captain, said he was honoured to be named the deputy to Virat Kohli for the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. He also added that the role will be a little bit more backstage compared to what he does with the Mumbai Indians, where he is the captain.

""It is a huge honour to be appointed as the vice-captain,"" Rohit said after the team's optional practice session in Pallekele on Wednesday (August 16). ""Ten years ago, I was only thinking of playing for India. Being the vice-captain now feels really, really good. It's a kind of honour that whenever the opportunity comes - the first One-Dayer, when we come [play] on August 20 - there will be some sort of role that I will need to play, and I am looking forward to it. I am not thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment as of now. Yes, it will be a good opportunity for me to get on to the field.

""It's a different ball game completely. IPL and when you come and play international cricket, it is completely different. But again, the excitement and the energy level is the same. So yes, nothing changes too much. I am the vice-captain here, there I was the captain, so I was more in front. Here I have to play a little behind-the-scene role. But yes, I will be very excited to step on to the field as the vice-captain of the Indian team.""

Rohit was one of the three players who turned up for the optional practice session, alongside KL Rahul and Axar Patel. The opener was seen playing a number of sweeps and reverse-sweeps against the net bowlers. Rohit hinted that the shots were part of a plan to counter Lasith Malinga.

""Everyday is a learning day, today I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse-sweeps when someone like Malinga comes and bowls to you. It is something that the game demands these days. You got to be innovative and you got to play different kind of shots to get maximum results. You keep learning every day and I keep trying these things and learn about things I can do and things I cannot do. Every addition to your armoury is good and I am trying to see what I can add to my armoury. What better place than coming here and doing it; that's what training sessions are all about. Come here, improve your skills, and try and get better as a player,"" he added.

Speaking about India's opponents, Sri Lanka, Rohit said they were a dangerous side, as evidenced by their victory over India in the Champions Trophy, but added that India would look to stick to their strengths.

""I have no idea about the squad for this ODI series, but what they had in the Champions Trophy was a very good side. They beat us quite comfortably. So you know in One-Day cricket, they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing for the past few years. We got to stick to our strength.

""We have been playing good cricket. West Indies was good, Champions Trophy was good except for one day - but that can happen - but in the past two years, we have played some consistent cricket in the ODI format. As far as I am concerned, we need to look at what we need to do as a team and bring out the best on the field. That's what we did in the recent Test series. We just focused on what we need to do as a group and that has always been the talk. We need to focus on our ability and strengths,"" he said.

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"By creative policy, not rigid rules","Is the central government wrong to mandate private participation in any metro rail project it part-finances? Metro-man E Sreedharan thinks so, emphatically. He can list a number of instances of failed private participation in India and abroad. Rigid rules on the nature of ownership of infrastructure projects do not make sense, whether for or against private participation. The Centre can limit its participation in a project put up for co-financing to a level it thinks fair, given the size of the population of the city the metro seeks to serve. Beyond that, how the concerned state or local government seeks to finance it is not the Centre’s business. Malayalis who work in West Asia have funded airports in Kerala on considerations other than financial returns. That said, it does not make sense to bar private investment in any kind of infrastructure.

The bulk of the trillions of dollars of global savings seeking profitable deployment anywhere secure comprises non-state funds. It makes eminent sense to draw them into creating much-needed new infrastructure in the developing world, whose economic returns would be significant. If commercial returns do not capture the full extent of economic returns in a particular project, deterring private investment, the government can remedy that in many ways.

An outright subsidy is one option. More desirable would be measures such as levying a carbon tax on petro-fuels and congestion charges on road use that would make the fares needed to make a metro commercially attractive seem perfectly acceptable in comparison with travel by road. Would this not be a big burden on the common man?

Cheap transport for the urban commuter ultimately subsidises the business that employs that commuter. If this subsidy is removed, the costs and revenues of the business would reconfigure, that is all. Clean transport would improve health and lower healthcare costs as well.

Simply mandating a private role in infrastructure would not work. Supplementary action is required to make it attractive for the private sector to invest in infrastructure. That calls for policy innovation, not diktat."

These rivers are our and our country’s lifeline. No river, No us. So to save the rivers and for saving us, I am campaigning for Rally for rivers. To save our rivers, I’m giving a missed call on 8000980009. I request you to do so too.”

He captioned the video as,

“Make a difference by being an active participant of the Rally For Rivers movement. Give a missed call aaj… abhi (today… right now)!”

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"Foster competition: Instead of targeting Delhi’s private schools, improve government schools","In a bizarre proposal, the Delhi government has told the high court that it intends to take over the management of 449 private schools that have failed to refund excess fees. The schools were identified as defaulters by the court-appointed Justice Anil Dev committee. While excess fees being charged by private schools may be an issue, the Delhi government threatening to take over these schools is a throwback to the old India of the 1970s. In that sense, the capital’s ruling AAP dispensation appears to be left of even the Left in Indian politics.

It’s welcome that the Delhi government has made education reforms a key agenda. However, its statist approach hampers improvements. Going after private schools for charging excess fees can be politically projected as an anti-elite move. But it does little to address the main problem afflicting primary education – lack of adequate number of quality government schools. There’s a huge demand-supply mismatch which results in parents fighting to get their children admitted in a handful of good private schools. If the Delhi government is serious about rising school fees, it should establish quality government schools that can attract students from all economic backgrounds.

This holds true for primary education across the country. According to a new study, between 2010-11 and 2015-16 student enrollment in government schools across 20 Indian states fell by 13 million while private schools gained 17.5 million new admissions. This shows a clear preference for private schooling and the corresponding poor standards of government schools. Solution to the rising fees problem lies in bridging this gap, not government taking over and running private schools to the ground. In the Delhi case, the high court questioned whether the state education department had even 50 trained officers to take over the 449 private schools in question. Instead of such ludicrous proposals, authorities would do well to improve quality and quantity of government schools."
"Slash IUC, licence and spectrum fees","The telecom regulator’s proposal to bring down the Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) promises to both increase bad blood in the telecom sector and worsen its finances. The government must intervene to protect the consumer and the sector’s viability. IUC is the charge that an operator, in whose network a call originates, pays the operator in whose network the call terminates, for the service of receiving the call from the originating network and carrying it on to the called party. As compared to the old 2G days, the network usage per call is lower now when calls are converted into discrete packets that are sent over the network interspersed with packets of other calls and assorted data. This is the rationale for trimming IUC.

However, the cost of the network has gone up because of higher spectrum costs. A lower IUC would lower the cost of a call for the consumer, who, ultimately, bears the cost of the call. However, it would lower revenue for telcos. Now, for large networks such as Bharti and Vodafone, what one pays the other as IUC gets more or less offset by what it receives from it as IUC, since they have roughly the same number of subscribers.

Smaller networks pay out more as IUC to larger networks than what they receive as IUC. Apart from the decline in network usage due to packetisation of calls, two factors favour lower IUC. One, voice accounts for an ever-declining share of telecom revenue globally and net IUC receipts form a tiny fraction of this dwindling part of the business. Two, high IUC is anti-competitive, favouring incumbents against new entrants.

Telecom finances in the country have turned parlous with the aggressive entry of Reliance Jio and the government’s insistence on high spectrum fees, extracted by auctioning tiny chunks of spectrum. To prevent telco loans from adding to the banks’ growing mountain of bad debt, the government must intervene. It can lower the steep revenue shares it collects as licence and spectrum usage fees, still pegged at the high rates set when spectrum was allotted along with the licence without separate upfront payment."
20 Hauntingly Beautiful Lines By Gulzar On Pain And Love That Speak Directly To Our Hearts!,"""Nostalgia is a sweet place for a poet and writer to be in""-Gulzar Saab

He believes in the power of nostalgia, heartbreaks, and pain. He has even explained that even though nostalgia is an indulgence; a distraction, one can't live in distraction for long.

Twitter

Gulzar Saab is one writer and poet who has managed to capture the fancy and hearts of people, where age is no bar. The way Gulzar Saab has penned down lyrics and nazms that manage to convey the pain, yearnings of a heart and grief, it's unmatchable.

BCCL

While a 15-year-old today loves to read Gulzar's poetry, a 25-year-old me still fancies and adores his Bollywood numbers. And the internet agrees.

May Gulzar saab keep writing till the end of this wretched world. — Shakti Shetty (@Shakti_Shetty) August 18, 2017

No one like Gulzar Saab. Ever. I cannot think of any other lyricist who has had such an impact through his writing on my life. No one else. — Vivek Tejuja (@vivekisms) August 18, 2017

Not many know that before he made his way with words, he used to work as a touch-up guy for cars in a garage. But life had some other plans for him and life since then has been like a roller-coaster that has only gone up.

He got his first big break with the film Bandini in 1963 as a lyricist. However, his passion and love for writing weren't supported by his family members. They didn't understand that writing could help him make a career but as 'Ziddi'' as he claims himself to be, today his Bollywood songs, poems and Nazms stay relevant and loved.

A rebel at heart, he used pen name Gulzar Deenvi and later shortened it to Gulzar. He ventured into films but when his film ‘Hu Tu Tu’ failed at the box office, he went into a major depression and that's when his daughter Meghna pulled him out of it. In that phase, Gulzar bounced back to life by giving life to his words.

His versatility is noticeably visible from his work. On one hand, he can pen down a love ode Kajra Re. , and on the other, it was him who wrote Oscar-winning Jai Ho with AR Rahman. While he can pull off a 'Ae Papad Wale Panga Na Le' from Makdee, he can write a love song that states, 'Dil sa joi, kameena nahi..'. He knows how to capture attention and hearts, with the right set of words.

Manipur shows how to improve health measures in the face of huge challenges,"The tragic events in Gorakhpur showed up India’s poor capability of meaningfully improving health outcomes of its citizens. But all recent news on the healthcare front has not been negative. Manipur, a state often torn apart by internal divisions, has provided a reason for optimism

The latest data on infant mortality rate showed that Manipur, along with Goa, recorded the lowest infant mortality rate in India. Goa is among India’s most developed states and one of the richest in terms of per capita income. Its impressive performance, therefore, does not come as a surprise. It is Manipur’s performance that is remarkable.

First, why is infant mortality rate (IMR) important? The following explanation by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention provides the answer.

“The death of a baby before his or her first birthday is called infant mortality. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths that occur for every 1,000 live births. This rate is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a nation, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants.”

A look at the data showed that Manipur’s IMR is 9, while Kerala, a benchmark for health indicators, had a mortality rate of 12.

The most impressive aspect of Manipur’s performance is that it has consistently lowered its IMR over the last three years, while some states have states such as Bihar or Uttarakhand have stagnated or slipped.

Manipur’s performance in IMR deserves a lot more attention and study. It is unique because it’s far better than its neighbor, Mizoram. This suggests that the cause for the impressive performance is state-specific rather than being broadly region-specific.

One explanation which has been offered in the past links the state’s performance to the status of women in society. According to this explanation, Manipur’s women have relatively more freedom and decision making powers which translates into better choices in this area.

Whatever the reasons, Manipur’s performance should inspire other states."
"UP government slashes medical education budget by 50%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LUCKNOW: As the death of 23 children in a single day in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) grabs national headlines, a sharp cut by the Aditya Nath Yogi government in the budgetary allocation for medical education this year is raising questions.

The allocation for BRDMC followed the pattern, plunging from Rs 15.9 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 7.8 crore for 2017-18. More specifically, its allocation for machines/equipment was slashed from Rs 3 crore to just Rs 75 lakh.The budgetary allocation fell across all medical colleges. For example, the medical colleges in Kanpur and Allahabad saw their allocations come down from Rs 15.9 crore each to Rs 3.3 crore and Rs 4.2 crore, respectively."

But for a person who would go on to lead the country, his debut was nothing great. The then 19 year-old made just 12 and India managed just 146. Sri Lanka would win by 8 wickets but Kohli would only emerge stronger.

He worked on his game, cemented his place in the side and eventually went on to become the leader in all formats.

"Coal mines in Shanxi city ordered shut for safety checks -official, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","BEIJING: Authorities in the city of Jinzhong in Shanxi province, one of China's top coal producing regions, have ordered coal mines to shut for safety checks following a fatal landslide a week ago, a city official told Reuters on Friday.

The measure has not affected production in two state-owned coal mining companies in the city, Lu'An Group and Yangquan Coal Industry Group, said the official at the public relations department at Jinzhong's coal administration bureau.

The landslide took place on Aug. 11 at an open-pit mine operated by Lu Xin Coal Co Ltd, which is owned by Jinneng Co Ltd.

Jinzhong city in July ordered safety checks that will last until October targeting all coal mines within its administration, but the schedule has been adjusted due to the recent coal accident, the official said.

The authority did not disclose how long the mines will be shut.

The inspections will affect 51 coal mines with an annual coking coal capacity of 21.45 million tonnes, said Zhang Min, a coal analyst at China Sublime Information Group.

The most-active coking coal futures contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange has gained 9.4 percent since the accident was announced last week.

Beijing has ramped up safety inspections across its vast coal mining sector in an effort to curb the number of deadly accidents at mines in recent years.

In July, China's coal output fell to its lowest since October, in part due to government safety checks in Shanxi province."
FIFA U-17 World Cup: Challenges of putting together a squad,"By Joy Bhattacharjya

The most challenging task while hosting a Junior World Cup, especially for developing football countries, is putting up a competitive squad. All the remaining preparations will not have much value if the Indian team doesn’t compete against its opponents in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. FIFA does not publish junior rankings, but in the list of football nations, five of the top ranked FIFA countries will be in India come October, including World No 1, Brazil. India’s group features the 8th, 26th and 50th ranked countries, and its no help that the lowest-rated team, Ghana, have been monsters in this competition with titles in 1991 and 1995.

The process for putting together this particular team started in April 2014, just a few months after India was awarded the tournament, when a group of 30 odd boys started practicing together in the AIFF academy in Goa. While there have been dropouts due to injury and loss of form, and fresh talent has also been unearthed over the years, at least half the squad is still from the original thirty. Most of the original boys were selected by a set of scouts led by the then Technical Director, Scott O’Donell. The challenges were immense. The first and most important issue was age. Almost 50 per cent of the boys selected could not provide birth certificates. And a fair number of those who seemed to be fine on paper then failed the compulsory wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test that is the most accepted age test in junior football.

In addition, state federation heads were often keen to put forward their favourites, rather than the best players in the state. Finally, the biggest conundrum was whether to select just the best players or also start looking at the players from the point of view of the position they could play. From over two thousand potential candidates, 29 were finally selected, with a shortage of quality left foot players. Almost half that number came from the North East, with Manipur contributing the most players, including the core of the current midfield — Suresh Wangjam, Amarjit Kiyam and Jackson Singh.

While the team started practicing and playing tournaments almost immediately, the process of scouting for new players continued. Abhishek Yadav joined as the CEO of the AIFF U-17 team in 2016, and set upon a punishing schedule of trials. Since June last year, he has personally seen more than twelve thousand boys, many from the smaller districts of traditional powerhouse states like Bengal and Kerala. Aniket Jadhav from Kolhapur was just one of the boys selected, who forced himself into a first XI position in the team almost immediately. The other push has been the online portal, where players of India origin from around the world can upload their match footage for a chance to play for India. Defender Namit Deshpande from New Jersey is one of the two players from the Americas, the other being towering 6’5” goalkeeper Sunny Dhaliwal from Canada.

The exposure given to this team has been unprecedented in Indian football. Over the past couple of years, they have played tournaments and matches in Germany, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Russia and also participated in the AFC U-16 qualifying tournament in Goa. The team has competed against the likes of Brazil, USA and Russia and while a lot of the matches ended in defeat, the opposing coaches were often impressed by the skills on view. More recently, the team under coach Luis Norton drew 1-1 against a full strength Chile, among the top 10 sides in international soccer, in a tournament in Mexico.

India have never qualified for a FIFA World Cup, senior or junior, men’s or women’s, so the pressure on these thirty is absolutely unprecedented. Talismanic senior striker Sunil Chhetri spoke of how he would cheerfully trade his entire international career for one shot at a World Cup, and these boys bear the burden of all those unfulfilled dreams.

But they have a few things going for them as well. They have played for a long time together and have had enough time to gel as a unit. They have also competed against the best in the world from different football ‘gharanas,’ — from short passing South American and Spanish teams to athletic long ball teams like Tanzania and the German Bundesliga squads, so there aren’t any real surprises. And finally, they will easily be the fittest Indian team ever to play a World Cup, going at full tilt well into stoppage time. As long as they run themselves into the ground and give it their 100 per cent each time, Indian fans will not complain."

Did You Know That According To Science The Best Way To Drink Whiskey Is To Dilute It With Water?,"A religious whiskey drinker may insist having his drink on the rocks or with a dash of water added to it. Well, it turns out there’s good reason for that and it's one that now even science backs.

alkotraz.ru

Researchers at the Linnaeus University in Sweden carried out a test to examine how compounds such as guaiacol in whiskey moved around with the presence of water in it.

They concurred that adding water to your drink frees guaiacol from its entrapments and enhances its smell and taste!

The flavour in whiskey comes from the molecule called guaiacol, which is what gives whiskey its smoky, spicy and peaty flavour. It resembles other compounds such as vanillin (a compound that tastes like vanilla).

majesticwinespiritspa.com

The study published in the journal Scientific Reports was conducted to simulate what happens to guaiacol in different concentrations of water.

Since water and ethanol don't mix that well drinks contain clusters of ethanol, which trap aromatic compounds such as guaiacol, hampering what the drink should ideally taste like.

Whisky is distilled at concentrations of alcohol above 59 percent. But whiskeys like Jack Daniels come bottled at a dilution of 40 to 45 percent where the ethanol and guaiacol accumulate at the surface.

shayorepublic.com

Diluting it to around 27 percent overall alcohol by adding a dash of water allows the guaiacol to ‘aerosolize’ and dispersed away from the surface, which allows the fragrant compounds to waft into your nose and keep your spirits high and holding on to your favourite drink!

hellorf.com

Since the taste, smell and flavour of your drink go hand-in-hand and the fact that the right amount of water is what is needed to enhance the flavour, it makes you wonder why whiskey isn’t manufactured at lower concentrations?"

Processor Advancements Will Lead To Energy Crisis Unless We Find New Materials And Technologies,"Moore’s Law has long been a constant in computer technology. Postulated in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention, and that trend would continue.

That trend has led to a massive progress in microprocessors, giving us the computers, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices we know today, all much more powerful than top-end computers from the 1990s. But as these powerful devices become more widespread, the expectation is that electronics will eventually consume the entire planet’s energy budget within a couple of decades. The only way scientists see out of this is to develop a new material, one that can be used to develop processors while being more energy efficient.

Materials scientist Nicola Spaldin, of ETH Zurich, believes the answer lies in multiferroics. These are materials that have both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. A lot of processors and storage forms depend on magnetic properties that need to be manipulated with magnetic fields. Instead, multiferroics can have their magnetic poles changed using an electric field, making it that much more efficient.

“Replacing the magnetic fields in our existing magnetism-based technologies with electric fields offers tremendous opportunity for energy savings, miniaturization, and efficiency,” she told MIT’s Technology Review.

A 128 Qubit quantum chip constructed by D-Wave Systems

Using multiferroics could eventually end our reliance on silicon transistors, thereby removing the restrictions of Moore’s Law. However, there are other possibilities for development as well. Quantum computing, for instance, makes use of quantum entanglement to produce computational devices orders of magnitude more powerful than current day processors. In addition, quantum communication is also currently impossible to spy on when sending a signal between two devices.

“The true breakthroughs that will change the course of history will not come from initiatives to improve existing materials or devices, or to advance technologies that have already been identified,” Spaldin says. “Instead, they will come from off-beat individuals or small teams of fundamental researchers pushing the boundaries of knowledge in directions for which there is not yet an application.”

Basically, we don’t need more research to perfect the technologies we already know, but instead need scientists to be exploring other ideas that haven’t even been considered yet."

How to help bankrupt realtor’s customers,"Insolvency proceedings against debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech have left over 30,000 home buyers in the lurch. They need more than state sympathy. Home buyers have been advised to file a claim with the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal. However, as unsecured claimants, home buyers have limited rights under the bankruptcy code. They are akin to customers who have placed orders and paid advances to a manufacturing company that goes under liquidation. In the pecking order of rights, the code allows the proceeds from the sale of assets to be distributed to secured lenders (read: banks), to pay off workmen’s dues for a period of 24 months before the liquidation commencement date, to pay wages and any unpaid dues owed to employees other than workmen, and to clear financial debts owed to unsecured creditors.

How can home buyers who have made payment in full or in part be given their homes? The assets now belong to the banks. If the liquidation proceeds are large enough to pay off secured creditors and employees and still have enough left over to repay home buyers their infructuous advances, well and good. Suppose that is not the case. What incentive do the banks or the IRP have to invest fresh funds to complete the construction of homes, payments for which have gone to the bankrupt firm and will not come to the new owner?

Why should banks part with assets that they have taken possession of under the law, to recover their unpaid dues? Bankers are unlikely to be moved by home buyers’ tears: the CBI might raid them for causing an avoidable loss.

There is one way out: raise the floor area ratio for the project, build and sell additional homes to generate the funds needed to complete stalled construction."
"FM Jaitely urges states to reduce VAT on petroleum products used for making goods, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today urged state governments to reduce Value Added Tax ( VAT ) on petroleum products used for making goods which attract Goods and Service Tax ( GST ), an official statement said. The move is aimed at easing tax burden on manufacturing sectors using petroleum products.The GST regime rolled out on 1 July excludes crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel while other products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha are included in GST. In the pre-GST regime, both petroleum products and final goods produced attracted VAT and hence input tax credit of petroleum products used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different states.However, in the post-GST regime, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products like natural gas, petrol and diesel used in manufacturing of the products attract VAT which leads to stranded taxes and cascading of taxes.“In view of this, in the pre GST regime certain States had lower rate of 5% VAT on Compressed Natural Gas used for manufacturing of goods. Some States also had lower rate of VAT on diesel being used for manufacturing sector. Thus the FM has requested other states also to explore the possibility of having lower VAT on petroleum products used for manufacturing items on which there is GST, so that there is minimum disruption in the costing of goods,” the statement said.At least one analyst told ETEnergyWorld VAT reduction on petroleum products used in manufacturing would reduce tax disadvantage currently suffered by City Gas Distribution (CGD) Companies as well as Piped Natural Gas (PNG) consumers along with the power, Ceramics, Glass, Chemicals, Pharma, Dairy, Steel and Engineering industry.“Currently CGD companies face a significant disadvantage when they sell PNG (Industrial and Commercial) as it continues to attract VAT on which input tax credit cannot be availed by its consumers who would be under GST. On the other hand, if they were to use liquid fuels such as Fuel Oil, Diesel, Naphtha, LPG, input tax credit is available because these products come under GST. If the states were to reduce VAT on PNG, that will reduce the tax disadvantage suffered by CGD companies and some of their consumers,” K Ravichandran, Senior Vice President at ICRA told ETEnergyWorld .He also added sectors such as ceramics, glass, chemicals, pharma, dairy, steel and engineering will be benefited as many of them use PNG. If the VAT were to be lower, under recoveries of companies operating in these sectors on taxes will be lower, which will improve their cost structure.Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the statistical arm of the oil ministry has projected the natural gas demand for the financial year 2017-2018 to be 494 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter Per Day (MMSCMD). Of which the power industry would require 225 MMSCMD followed by the fertilizer industry requiring 113 MMSCMD, city gas distribution 47 MMSCMD and Industrial requirement of 28 MMSCMD among others. Sanjiv Singh , Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the country’s largest fuel retailer, had recently said the firm is in talks with state governments for deferring levy of VAT on petrol, diesel, Aviation Turbine Fuel and crude oil to reduce the tax impact of these products as they are outside the ambit of GST."

"Government seeks caps on drug trade margins, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government plans to cap trade margins to make drugs cheaper, replace brand names with salt names for generic drugs , clamp down on unfair marketing practices and boost local manufacturing to reduce dependence on imports, according to government's draft national pharmaceutical policy.The draft, prepared by the pharmaceuticals department, also suggests restructuring of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to strengthen the price regulatory mechanism.It highlights the high trade margins and bonus offers by stockists, distributors and retailers, which hit the industry and consumers.The draft policy said, ""After detailed stakeholder consultations, the level of trade margins will be prescribed to create a level playing field for the Industry and to bring down prices.""""Institutions receiving supplies directly from manufacturers/distributors or retailers will also be covered under the trade margin reforms,"" it said.In its effort to promote generic medicines, the draft proposes that public procurement and dispensing of medicines to be of generic drugs in salt names. ""Giving brand names to generic drugs hampers real innovation and shall be discouraged... To facilitate this, the government will pursue the policy of sale of single ingredient drugs by their pharmacopeial name/salt name. To keep the identity of the manufacturer, the manufacturer would be allowed to stamp its name on the drug package. For patented drugs and Fixed Dose Combination (FDCs) drugs, brand names may be used. However here, the principle of 'one company-one drug-one brand name-one price' would be implemented,"" it said.It also proposes e-prescription to aid and assist the registered medical practitioners in prescribing medicines in the generic names. E-prescriptions will be put into operation whereby the prescriptions will be computerised and the medicine name will be picked up from a drop down menu of salt names.Once implemented, the proposed policy is expected to address the current challenges of the pharmaceutical industry and make essential medicines more affordable. It is also likely to give more powers to the government on deciding price of medicines over the pricing regulator NPPA As per the draft policy, the government will decide on the drugs to be subjected under price control, while NPPA will be responsible for laying down the price ceilings of selected medicines, enforcement of those price ceilings and ensuring that medicines are available in the market in adequate quantities.Prices once fixed by the NPPA shall not be revised by the regulator unless directed specifically by the government or a higher court to do so, according to the draft.Strengthening the regulatory mechanism, it suggests NPPA be assisted by an advisory body for pricing, nominated by the government. ""The body will consist of doctors, pharmacists, other experts, civil society representatives, industry representatives and government representatives. The advice of this body will be recommendatory and the NPPA may accept or modify the advice rendered. While modifying/rejecting its advice, the NPPA will assign reasons in writing for doing so,"" the draft said.""The regulator and the government would be two distinct agencies. The government shall not be the regulator and the regulator shall not be the government,"" the draft policy said.The draft policy also laid down several other policy prescriptions that include enhancing quality standards, reining in unfair trade practices, faster approvals, boosting indigenous manufacturing and encouraging research and development.The department has sought comments from the industry on the draft, after which it will be tabled before the Cabinet."

Chawla joins Ranji champions Gujarat for 2017-18 season

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:50 PM

""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move"" - Chawla © Getty

Piyush Chawla has ended his long-term association with Uttar Pradesh cricket in order to represent Gujarat in the upcoming first-class season, the legspinner confirmed to Sportstar. ""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move,"" Chawla said on Wednesday (August 16).

Chawla, who picked up 226 wickets in 80 first-class matches for UP over a period of almost 12 years, will now bolster the defending champions' bowling line-up which already consists the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and RP Singh, who also made the same move two years ago. It is to be noted that Chawla featured in only two Ranji games last season after getting sidelined for a major period with an injury.

The 28-year-old made his Test debut for India way back in 2006 but has since then managed to add only two more caps with his last appearance in the format coming almost five years back. With the BCCI reverting to the home-away format for the Ranji this season, the legspinner has observed the lack of help for spinners from the surfaces in UP as the main reason behind his move. ""The kind of wickets you get in the Western region which has a red soil layering help the spinners better,"" Chawla pointed out.

""When I play in Uttar Pradesh, the wickets are either seaming tracks or flat ones. That's how the weather is. So, it was time to make a move to a state where I can bowl much better and get wickets.""

Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel had a role to play in the move, according to Chawla's own admission. ""A couple of years ago, when UP toured Gujarat for a match, I saw the wicket was a turner, and it was helping the spinners,"" he recalled. ""So I had told Parthiv, 'If I ever think of making a move, please keep your options open for me.'

""Last year, I only played a couple of matches for UP as I was injured. I couldn't play much, and only participated in one-dayers and T20s, because in the second game of the Ranji Trophy itself, I was injured. So, this year I was mulling a change. I spoke to Parthiv and told him about my plans. He and the officials at the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) were happy with the move. I am thankful to them that they welcomed me,"" he added.

"There are many projects in India to sequence human genomes: Brenda J Andrews, Health News, ET HealthWorld",", Professor and Director,, Canada, talks to ETHealthworld about the growth of functional genomics and their collaboration with India. Edited excerpts:The difference between genomics and functional genomics is that “genomics” is the science of determining a genome sequence. We can determine genome sequences now in any organism in a very short period of time for little money. Functional genomics is the science of trying to understand the information and that requires us to manipulate it in some way to see what the consequences are of perturbing certain genes and certain sequences in the genome. There is no technology of doing that in all systems. Doing a focussed experiment is a major challenge which will require huge investments by labs around the world, to try to really understand what each gene in the human genome is doing and how the genomes work together to make the cells function the way they do. We need to understand how these genes basically are wired together in order to make a certain outcome. We are getting there in some of the projects that are ongoing in our centre which involve trying to perturb genes by themselves or in combination of trying to figure out what happens to the cells. I hope over the next few years a lot of current methods will be developed such as genome engineering methods that have come out in the last few years. Those can be further developed so that we can do functional genomics experiment much faster and interpret them better.The Donnelly Centre was established about 10 years ago with the idea of setting up centre for biology and the idea was to make rapid progress in functional genomics. Mainly we need to put scientists with different expertise together in the same place. We are at the University of Toronto, it has a great computer science department, a great chemistry department, big faculty of medicine but those people never use to talk to each other. So we thought to put them together in the same space and then new science will emerge. The building opened in 2006, our scientists in the building were from applied sciences in engineering, people that were experts in stem cell engineering, other people from the chemistry department and a lot of computer scientists cause you need a lot of computer scientists to interpret genome information. In the last 10 years we also requited new people into the building which filled the gaps in our expertise and now we have many ongoing projects that involve collaborations between at least 5-6 different scientists in the centre and their trainees. So we consider that our bigger success that is our project has started because of who we are and where we are together, in the same building and that probably wouldn’t have happened if we were scattered across other buildings.The partnering with India that is ongoing at the moment was set up largely by Sachdev Sidhu who is a professor in the Donnelly Centre. He was recruited to the centre from genetics in the United States where he developed platforms for doing a technical platform called Phage Display and this allowed him to engineer proteins. So these are the building blocks or protein that were encoded by the DNA to engineer proteins to do basically what he wanted them to do and the specialty is antibodies which are one of the largest growing drug sectors in the world. So they have setup this platform at the Donnelly centre and has been collaborating to try to think about how we might together make new antibodies that are largely oncology targets together.It is hard to predict because five years ago if you asked me how I see the future I would have been completely wrong. The reasons are two: DNA sequencing got a lot cheaper and we have got better methods for genome engineering. So the CRISPR Cas9 system can now be used to precisely engineer the human genome and that wasn’t available 5 years ago. It is hard to predict if you can’t even imagine what techniques might come so that makes it a challenging but also a very exciting time in biomedicine. I certainly think that we might have huge amounts of genome sequencing information. I know that there are many projects here in India to sequence human genomes. There are projects like that around the world and I think we will get way better in understanding it; our computational methods will get better so I think the flow of information 5 years from now will be much smoother and much valuable."
Blue Whale Strikes Again! Two Kerala Families Say Their Sons Committed Suicide After Playing The Game,"The deadly online challenge game, which is spreading like wildfire appears to have claimed more victim in India than what is already been reported. With the news about the deadly game making headlines now more and more people have come forward expressing doubts about the deaths of their family members.

Two new suspected cases of Blue Whale deaths have now surfaced from Kerala.

In the first case, the family of Manoj C Manu, a teenager from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram who committed suicide last month has now approached police claiming that they doubt the role of the game in his death.

In their complaint, the family said Manoj who was a class XI student had downloaded the game nine months ago and had been addicted to it since.

Manoj C Manu/ Facebook

His mother Anu told a Malayalam news channel that she had talked him out of it. But with the recent reports of the Blue Whale challenge, she said Manoj's behaviour was similar to those killed themselves playing the dare game.

She claimed that Manoj, who never used to go out alone had visited a beach by himself, jumped into a river despite not knowing how to swim and even used to visit a cemetery.

Manoj was found hanging at his home on July 26.

Police who had earlier registered a case of unnatural death said they will look into the possibility, but expressed doubts as Manoj had hung himself, whereas, in all the other reported cases of deaths or attempts to kill themselves, the gamers had jumped off buildings.

Another similar case has surfaced from Kannur, where an IIT student named Sawant killed himself last month.

According to Swanta's mother her son used to spent the whole night playing the game on his phone and frequently used to venture out from home at night only to return in the morning.

After he began hurting himself and inscribing letters on his body using a compass, Swant's family who thought he had mental issues had taken him for counselling.

He committed suicide last month by hanging himself.

While the links to the two deaths and the challenge game is yet to be established, this is not the first such report from Kerala. After it was reported that two teenagers ventured into a beach in Alappuzha under suspicious circumstances, the Kerala government had urged the central government to ban the game.

The Central government has already directed internet companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft to remove links to the game from their services.

So far, there is one confirmed case of Blue Whale death in India, a 14-year-old Mumbai boy who killed himself playing the game.

There have been a number of reports attempted suicides from many parts of the country since.

The Blue Whale is a challenge based game developed by some Russian programmers. It is said to be involving daily challenges for the gamers from daring to risky. Some of them include watching horror movies alone to hurting themselves.

In the 50th level, it is said that the participants are challenged to attempt suicide. In all the stages, the participant is asked to make a video of the challenge.

The administrator whom the player is in contact is said to emotionally blackmail the player to complete the challenge."

Environmentalists oppose plan to link Indian rivers Interlinking entails diverting surplus river water through a network of canals to drier areas. While the idea to link India's rivers was first mooted in the 1970s, plans to join up more than two dozen rivers have seen little action.

"Who will save our children? Go beyond immediate causes and buck passing on Gorakhpur child deaths, fix systemic failures","Seventy child deaths on the eve of 70 years of Independence! The nation is shocked. Two doctors at the state-run BRD hospital were held responsible and removed by the Uttar Pradesh government. In its defence, the state government has been quoting statistics to prove that there has been a pattern of child deaths in Gorakhpur in August especially due to the long-standing problem of encephalitis – and, by implication, that it cannot be held responsible with just five months in power.

While the callous corruption of these two doctors may have been the immediate cause of child deaths in this particular case, who do we hold responsible for the systematic pattern of child deaths in Gorakhpur, or in UP and the country at large? India has been the world’s largest contributor to all levels of child deaths since 1953 – the first year for which we have Indian data available. Starting out with nearly 4.7 million deaths a year under the age of five years (U5), it took us almost three decades to bring them down to 4 million a year.

Between 1969 and 1979 China reduced U5 deaths by 2.4 million, the highest in a decade in any country in recorded history. The beginning of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) did accelerate the pace of progress in India, but China again outperformed us. As did our neighbours Maldives, Nepal and Bangladesh between 1990 and 2015, to achieve their MDG targets on child survival.

We did not achieve our MDG targets, despite having a lower U5 mortality rate than our neighbours in the pre-MDG era. Maldives actually recorded the highest decline in the rate not just in South Asia, but in the entire world during the MDG period. We could dismiss the achievements of our neighbours on the ground that they are small countries. But can’t we learn from their political commitment to child survival? Secondly, what about China, whose population size is still larger than ours, and whose GDP per capita was lower than ours until 1990?

I am sure someone will jump up to say – China is an authoritarian country which can get things done, and is not diverse like us. Well, no one is like us as far as our commitment to child survival goes! Do we wish to continue with our uniqueness in this regard?

The story has been similar at lower levels of child survival as well. At the neonatal level (ie during first 28 days of birth), the Bimaru states accounted for 55% of all deaths in the country in 2011 – UP (27%), MP and Bihar (10% each) and Rajasthan (8%) – and 15% of the global burden. While China performed even better at this stage, with a 90% decline in number of neonatal deaths during the MDG period, we had 695,852 neonates dying in 2015 – more than 7 times China’s.

Clearly, with efficient and equitable health systems and doctors – particularly at the primary health care level – many of these deaths could have been averted. However, as the UP CM himself argued, in an attempt to shift responsibility to individuals, lack of sanitation was the reason for recent child deaths in his constituency. According to one report, doctors at the BRD hospital claimed, perhaps in their own bid to deflect some responsibility, 70% of children affected by encephalitis who visited the hospital were malnourished.

Clearly, sanitation and nutrition are not responsibilities of hospitals and doctors – although they can adopt measures to mitigate some of their impact – and are influenced by people’s socioeconomic status, especially educational and economic status, as well as the efficacy and equity of municipalities and nutritional interventions of the government. While health systems and doctors are the immediate causes of child deaths, structural failures are responsible in the final run.

Is it the fault of parents that they are poor and illiterate – or that their localities are not cleaned by the municipalities? To a degree, their own socioeconomic status could be. But even a libertarian like Milton Friedman argued for ‘paternalistic concern for children’ and the ‘financing of education’ by the government on the grounds that holding parents responsible for children ‘rests on expediency rather than principle’.

A state health officer in Lucknow told me in 2009 that poor people keep producing children and expect us to take care of them. Again, it is the economically and educationally weak who have more children. No matter how you approach the issue, the buck would ultimately stop at the state. Present governments have to accept their share of responsibility, but we as a nation and the Indian state since Independence are also responsible for the broader pattern of child deaths.

Social and systemic injustices have played their own set of roles. People are poor and uneducated because of both sorts of injustices. Confining ourselves to immediate medical causes is not going to take us far in addressing the systematic pattern of child deaths – we will have to go way beyond. If it is true that people get the government they deserve, can we, on our part, pledge that we will only vote for candidates who put forth a concrete vision for saving our children – the future of our nation – and will not indulge in social injustices that perpetuate poverty and illiteracy?"
"Andy Rubin's Essential Smartphone Will Ship Within 7 Days, Taking Aim At Android Flagships!","The Essential Phone, a smartphone by Android co-founder Andy Rubin, was announced in May and originally scheduled to release in June, with few other competitors.

Unfortunately, the phone has been delayed and is now set to launch in one week, at the same time as the Galaxy Note 8, followed likely by the LG V30 and Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL the week after, as well as the upcoming iPhone 8 and more.

The Essential Phone features a QHD (2560x1312) edge-to-edge display, with rounded corners and ultra-narrow bezels in a titanium build. It has a dual rear camera system with a 13MP RGB sensors, and 13MP monochrome, as well as an 8MP front camera. The device packs a 2.45GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with a Adreno 540 GPU and 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB internal storage.

According to an email registered customers received from the company, the smartphone will ship within seven days, at a buy price of $699 (approximately Rs 44,800). Though some of the other offerings coming out soon may be more expensive than the Essential, they’re more powerful devices from tried and tested brands, as opposed to a startup. It all comes down to whether Essential’s camera and it’s touted accessories can carry it ahead of the pack."

"Delhi HC directs Health Ministry to use Rs. 100 crore fund for rare diseases, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: The Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW), Lav Aggarwal, gave a presentation on the National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases to Justice Manmohan in the Delhi High Court and highlighted the important aspects.

He mentioned that there is no specific definition of rare diseases since there is no epidemiological data and the reliability of the estimates are questionable. There is a need to arrive at our own estimate. He also pointed out that there is a need to balance out the competing priorities of public health.

While giving the presentation, Aggarwal added, ""The biggest challenge with rare diseases is that they have mimicking symptoms of other diseases and thus, take years to get diagnosed. Moreover, there is a low pool of patients for research and hence, in the process of covering up for the cost of R&D, the treatment is expensive. Thus, strong measures need to be taken to make the diagnosis and treatment process easier. In this regard, the policy proposes an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore for funding treatment of rare genetic diseases. The state governments should come forward and request how much fund they need and for which diseases which the centre can provide from the Rs. 100 crore corpus fund under the National Health Mission.""

With respect to the Rs. 100 Crore corpus fund, Justice Manmohan emphasised that the fund should not get lapsed. Since the financial year cycle might be from January to December now, there is a possibility that this fund would not be used and would go waste.

He suggested that the money should be at the disposal of individual hospitals like AIIMS so that the patients can directly benefit. Alternately, the Justice recommended that the money should be put in a revolving fund so that interest is received on the amount. In any case, he stressed that the money should not get lapsed and should directly benefit the patients.

""The Honourable Court is very sensitive to the immediate implementation and utilisation of the Rs. 100 crore corpus. It also rightly mentioned that the fund may be allocated and transferred to AIIMS and immediate steps need to be taken by Health Ministry to form medical expert committees of physicians at central and state levels. The states should screen and recommend patients based on standard formatted parameters and severity of the disease. Nonetheless the Rs. 100 crore allocation should be carried forward in the next financial year with a revised amount as, at present, the fund is too less to treat all diagnosed patients"", Manjit Singh (President, Lysosomal Storage Disorders Society (LSDSS)) commented.

The policy also proposed that an Inter-ministerial consultative committee and a technical cum administrative committee be formed. The consultative committee would coordinate the initiatives taken by the different ministries and departments.

The technical committee would be formed at the state as well at national levels for management of and release of corpus funds and developing various technical requirements for identification and treatment of rare diseases. Going forward, these committees should be set up within the next three weeks (by August last week).

Lauding the efforts of the Ministry, Justice Manmohan said, ""The presentation has been very helpful in understanding the concept of rare diseases. However, some urgent orders are required to make the National Policy functional at the ground level. The two committees need to be appointed within a period of three weeks. The Ministry is directed to file a status report on or before November 30.""

Jurist Advocate Ashok Agarwal who has been fighting for rare disease patients commented, ""The National policy is a landmark step. However, the policy can only be tested on the basis of the actual number of patients getting treatment. The patients should not start applying to the Delhi government for treatment and these applications should start getting processed."""
‘7 Sins of India’ – this Chinese video on Doklam is 70 kinds of funny,"Indian television news content is often criticized for being over the top. Moderators are criticized for their histrionics. The absence of reason is mourned, as is the resemblance of programming to government propaganda. But a new Xinhua video suggests that even in this game China has India beat.

Streamed on New China TV, the official YouTube channel of Xinhua news agency, which is the official press agency of the People’s Republic of China, the video features a pulchritudinous female anchor throwing peculiar new light on the Doklam standoff, topped by a faux hirsute faux Indian making a fool of himself backed by a full supply of canned laughter.

The script is pretty hilarious actually. It’s not clear to me if the scriptwriters are really taking the mickey out of India or sort of subtly subverting their own scriptmasters as well.

I have recorded the script below, with the hope that in something like the august tradition of rap battles, someone out there is going to put together a classy rejoinder:

Anchor: It’s been two months since Indian troops illegally crossed the China-India boundary but so far India has shown no sign of withdrawal at all.

When the whole world is trying to wake India up from its impulse China’s realized it’s impossible to wake a guy who is pretending to be asleep.

Faux Indian: Nobody is blaming me because I’m asleeeeep. (Snoring)

Anchor: Fine fine … let’s now take a look at what India has done during these two months which in a nutshell is regarded as the 7 Sins.

No 1: Trespassing

On June 18 Indian border troops carrying weapons and driving bulldozers illegally crossed the delimited boundary into the UNDISPUTED Chinese territory.

Yeah you heard it right, driving bulldozers straight into your house without even knocking at the door. What kind of neighbor would that be?

No 2: Violating bilateral convention

No 3: Trampling international law

You may think Doklam is a disputed area but the truth is both India and the international community have recognized the place as a part of China according to the 1890 convention between Great Britain and China relating to Sikkim and Tibet. And the thing is this exact convention is part of international law.

Didn’t your mama tell you never break the law!

No 4: Confusing and wrong

No 5: Putting blame on victim

This is kind of funny. India has been inventing various excuses to whitewash its illegal move. But first of all you’ve got to make sure your excuses can hold water dude!

India’s argued that China’s building of roads would represent “significant change of status quo … with serious security implications for India”. Would you go and take it up when your neighbor’s building a path in his garden?

Faux Indian: He’s building a path in his garden! I’m in DANGER!!

No 6: Hijacking small neighbor

Well this is most outrageous. We thought India would have been wiser after the first stupid excuse. But this time it attempted to justify its incursion in the name of “protecting Bhutan”.

Faux Indian: Don’t move – this is Bhutan’s home. I’m here protecting it.

Faux Bhutanese: (with the faux Indian waving a knife at him) No not my home.

Anchor: The Bhutanese authorities have clearly told Chinese officials that Doklam is not Bhutanese territory and they are also confused by India’s behavior.

Well I’m just wondering, how does it feel shooting yourself in the foot?

No 7: Sticking to mistake knowingly

China has a strong will to solve the problem peacefully – with the prerequisite of India’s withdrawal of course.

However India is so thick-skinned that it is on the one hand crying for talk but on the other hand refusing to withdraw.

Have you ever negotiated with a robber who had just broken into your home and refused to leave? (Nooo) You call 911 or just fight him back, right?

Faux Indian: Why call 911? Don’t you want to play house bro?

Anchor: If you really want to play, get out of my house first. (Shaking her finger)"
Home-grown Nationalism,"

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. “She was an audacious woman who could hold her own,” she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda — who initiated her in brahmacharini vows — Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‘Nivedita,’ one who has dedicated her life to God.“She was a remarkable person.I don’t think we have focused enough on her,”says Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita’s life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master’s views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta’s Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta’s elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita’s 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.” Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.“Swami Vivekananda had said that it’s not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It’s a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,” says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. “Nivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,” elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.“ She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission — Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.” “Her nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India’s identity,” explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita’s sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. “Patriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it’s about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it’s not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.” In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms — from her extensive travels across the country — her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:“India must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion — the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.” Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.“Tradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it’s not about this and not that. It’s about inclusive Vedantic theory,” says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore’s Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.“One had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.”

"India to phase out 5,500 Megawatt of coal-fired power plants, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: India has identified 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of inefficient coal-fired power plants to be retired, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told lawmakers on Thursday, as the country looks to cut emissions and make better use of its coal reserves.

The Central Electrical Authority (CEA) has identified coal-fired plants which are more than 25 years old for retirement in a phased manner on the basis of their ""inefficiency and un-economic operation,"" Goyal said. He did not provide details on the timeframe over which they would be phased out.

Around 78 percent of generated power in India still comes from coal-fired plants, making it one of the biggest users in the world of the dirty and cheap fuel.

Coal-fired plants account for about 195 GW of India's 330 GW of installed power capacity, data on the CEA's website shows.

India, which is also undergoing a programme to retrofit several coal-fired plants to reduce emissions, has retired about 4 GW of coal-fired power plants over the last two years.

However, state-run power utility NTPC Ltd plans to invest $10 billion in new coal-fired power stations over the next five years despite the electricity regulator's assessment that thermal plants now under construction will be able to meet demand until 2027, Reuters reported this month."

"Germany, Nice, Orlando 'Lone Wolf' Attacks Are ISIS's Deadliest And Most Effective Weapons Yet","Yet another European city, this time Barcelona, has come under a terror attack. Again the Islamic State has claimed the responsibility for the attack. The attack has left 13 people dead while nearly a hundred others injured.

AFP

Once again, the attack involved a car, which ploughed onto unsuspecting holidaymakers in Barcelona, Spain. ISIS was soon to take responsibility for the attack, which had the markings of the jihadists.

The latest attack once again reiterated the success of the strategy ISIS had laid out in 2015 for Europe for 'potential jihadists'- carry out lone wolf attacks.

Lone Wolf

The term ""lone wolf"" is used by US law enforcement agencies and the media to refer to individuals undertaking violent acts of terrorism outside a command structure.

ABC News

“One-third have mental health problems and others had other stressors such as having lost their job. The ideology gives them a buffer from their other problems,” says Dr Paul Gill, an academic who has studied over 100 “lone actor” terrorists.

Why lone wolves are dangerous and effective?

Simply because a lone wolf is not acting on anyone else's order or instructions there won't be a group involved in planning and executing the attack. This makes them to a great extend immune to scrutiny by intelligence agencies. It also increases the chances of their ""mission"" being successful.

Reuters

Weapons

Normally a lone wolf attack involves one man-heavily armed. This makes his target, most likely scenario- a crowded public place - more accessible for them. Most of the times the attacker will be armed with an assault rifle, suicide weast or a sharp weapon. IS which earlier this year issued a handbook for potential lone wolves had urged them to use vehicle as weapons. The attack in Nice even though no clear link with IS have been established so far bears the signature of the outfit's direction all over it.

Frequency

A study of 5,646 terrorist attacks around the world between 1968 and 2010 found that 72, or 1.3 percent of them, were committed by lone wolves. In recent decades, such attacks became more frequent in the U.S.

Reuters

The study was conducted before Islamic State leaders in 2014 began to urge followers to do whatever they could to kill citizens of nations fighting the group. A 2015 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that lone-wolf attacks in the U.S. became more common after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Challenges in preventing lone wolf attacks

As mentioned earlier the biggest challenge for intelligence agencies is to identify potential lone wolves and to infiltrate their groups. Since most of the time it is one person acting alone, there could be very few hints on someone is preparing for an attack.

Reuters

Only traces of them are most of the times their social media interactions. Also since they may not be buying weapons in huge amount this too, in most of the cases go unnoticed. The use of cars/ trucks as weapons only add to the their lethal capability to inflict damage as until recently it was unimaginable to see everyday vehicles as weapons."
"Blue whales and other folk tales: We, the middle class are as susceptible to urban legends as anyone else","It started last May, with a series of clickbaity stories on the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. They described the bizarre Blue Whale challenge as an online game that preyed on teens, with a moderator giving each participant a set of escalating challenges, eventually leading to suicide. The British tabloids ran with it next, and soon, solicitous police departments were warning parents. From Brazil to India, by now the Blue Whale story has been heard around the world.

And yet, hardly anyone has direct knowledge of the subculture. Forums discussing suicide are not alien to the internet, but there’s a fog of facts around the Blue Whale bogey. A 21-year-old Russian man called Philipp Budeikin was arrested for masterminding the game on the basis of one wild, braggy interview. Many of the first claims have been deflated. The estimated number of suicides has swung wildly, from 130 to “at least 16”. In many countries, including Russia, the original story has been undercut, but to no avail.

The lurid appeal of Blue Whale is just too great, as is the number of media outlets prepared to swallow it whole, the array of experts willing to speculate without facts, the majority of adults convinced that kids are up to dumb, dangerous things, and malign forces roam the internet.

The journalist Anne Collier, who works on young people and digital safety, has tried to put Blue Whale in perspective. In Russia, tens of thousands of bots were found using those hashtags. There were a few seeming followers, and the rest looked it up out of curiosity, or were advertisers trying to promote something, and “professionals testing technologies for information dissemination”.

Radio Free Europe tried to find suicides linked to Blue Whale, and came up empty. The fact-checking site Snopes went at it too, and found no conclusive evidence of Blue Whale, in specific, goading teens to suicide. Bulgaria’s Safer Internet Centre, which empirically studies teen digital behaviour, pointed out that given that Russia has among the highest teen suicides in the world anyway, it would be hard to prove that this weird internet subculture actually caused the deaths.

In other words, we’ve all been had, and how. Even one teen death is one too many, but to get agitated about Blue Whale instead of noticing signs of mental trouble, is irresponsible. The danger with spreading such sensationalist stories about death cults and copycat suicides is always this: it triggers real tragedy, because a few vulnerable individuals get swept up in the contagion.

Look up stories about the “suicide town” of Bridgend, or the Slender Man meme about a tall thin supernatural killer that swept the US a few years ago. With Slender Man, what started as a tale told around a campfire became a networked horror story. Folklorists studied the scale and velocity of the myth, as people recounted the phenomenon, added their two-bit and their FOAF (friend-of-a-friend) accounts, shared creepy visuals as “evidence”. Eventually, it led to a real stabbing.

Technology has always been blamed for driving teens round the bend. Decades ago, there was a similar moral panic around the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, which was blamed for suicide and demon worship. Violent videogames were held out as the reason for mass killings like Columbine. While excessive focus on anything, whether workaholism or exercise or Netflix, should be a sign of mental distress, that’s not to say that these activities cause the mental distress and its violent manifestations.

Of course, in India, even urban legends are divided by class. People like us deplored the “mass hysteria” that drove folks in UP and Haryana to believe women’s braids were being chopped off by mysterious forces, even as we solemnly appealed to the grownups in government to tackle the “Blue Whale” problem. Even a presumably rational communist like Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Prime Minister Modi to do something, anything. The IT ministry declared the game “unacceptable” and ordered social platforms to scour their content.

The whole point about a moral panic is not whether the story is true or false. The question is, what is the standard used to call it an ‘epidemic’? One person, or ten, or hundred, or more? Usually, a small or stray ‘actual’ incident is made into a gripping narrative, one that stokes genuine social anxieties. Media may be a big part of these moral panics, where attention builds, peaks and then falls off just as suddenly. It’s happening with the braid chopping story, and will inevitably happen with Blue Whale too.

A moral panic is a dramatic production that involves several actors — there’s always a ‘folk devil’ or scapegoat (in this case, the internet), there are law enforcers, media, politicians and the public who all play their part. New technology often sets off moral panics – from electricity to the telephone to social media, each new thing has made us freak out about the fraying social fabric.

And yet, no technology actually turns anyone’s head, it only makes it easier to do what they were doing anyway. Our protective posture towards young people, our sense of their suggestibility, guilt about not having given them enough attention, our discomfort with their growing autonomy, all combine to let us readily believe such ‘trends among the youth’ stories.

Falling for such narratives is not a failing or an embarrassment, it’s the human default. But perhaps knowing that we are all suckers for a sensational story should make us a little humbler, a little less quick to judge others who do the same."

5 Simple Ways To Help You Get Exactly What You Want In Bed,"It’s the weekend and you’re in the mood for some steamy sensual sex with your dream man or woman. The only problem is that as much you want things to come spontaneously rarely does your partner tune into your desires from the word go; especially if you guys are in the initial phases courtship.

universityprimetime.com

Phrases like “can you go down on me” or “can you squeeze me here” are often at the tips of your lips but seem so hard to let out—disrupting that mind-blowing sex you so desire. Here are some ways your work around some of the most common reasons that might be blockading your path to fulfilling sex.

#1. Make sure you know what you want

Some of you may realise and some may not, but if you’re not sure what turns you on under the sheets either you’ll be making the wrong request or end up never knowing what really excites you.

lmt-lss.com

What to do: Get curious about what you prefer by exploring your body by yourself. During your next sexual encounter try and figure out what feels or what you think feels more pleasurable by experimenting without holding back.

#2. Communication is the key even in the bedroom

The fact that you might upset your partner may be at the back of your mind but if you don’t communicate what you prefer in bed, how do you expect your partner to know?

medicalpress.es

What to do: Start with small compliments like “ I love it when you touch me there” in a sweet and straightforward tone and see how your partner responds. There’s more likelihood of you getting a better response so you can ask for bigger requests.

#3. Be his/her guide while you’re in the act

Some of us have our fantasies, fetishes, likes and dislikes well scripted in our mind. Use this information to your advantage by showing your partner what you like.

sexlovepizza.com

What to do: If you know that you like being touched in a certain area for instance either spell it out or guide his/her hand to area or spot you want to caress. Tell your partner what you want while you’re doing so to make your request even more specific.

#4. Use sensual video footage or erotica’s to build arousal

This is ideal for people who are not fans of physically or mentally expressing their desires since arousal starts in your brain anyway.

luaquebrada24x7.blogspot.in

What to do: Have your partner read an erotic scene from a movie/book or role-playing a character from a bondage, dominance, submission and masochism film (if you're kinky in the head) might be just what you need to spice things up.

#5. Never fake it if you want pleasure in the long run

You’ve been faking an orgasm because you feel the need to please or not to hurt your partner somehow. Unfortunately, this may only get your partner to think that he or she has figured the secret code out and it may be hard to change correctly that behaviour.

femeia.ro

What to do: Be honest and first be frank about the fact that you faked it because you were too embarrassed to share your what you originally felt and then state what you really are into. If you don’t want to mention the fact that you’ve been faking it you can try and squeeze in the fact that you would like to explore and experiment with new techniques. That should set the ball rolling."

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

"Quality drug test: Bad Medicine! Pfizer, Cipla, DRL, other 63 drug firms fail quality test, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Pfizer Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Cipla are among 66 drug makers that have some of their products failing quality tests carried out by the country’s drug regulator.Samples tested from these companies were found to be not of standard quality during a drug survey carried out through the National Institute of Biologicals over two years, according to a Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation ( CDSCO ) notification posted on its website. At least five samples of drugs from these companies failed the tests during the 2014-2016 survey, CDSCO said.According to the notification, 25 samples by Pfizer, nine each by Dr Reddy’s and Alembic, seven by Cipla and six by Zydus Healthcare were found to be not of standard quality. It didn’t specify the drugs that failed the tests.A Pfizer spokesperson said the company was unable to confirm authenticity of products picked for the tests, or the evidence of the alleged deficiencies “as the due process of providing a sealed market sample was not followed"".Samples of the company's products were found to be fully compliant with all required specifications during tests at independent FDA-approved laboratories, the spokesperson said, adding that this was communicated to the regulatory authorities and no further action was recommended.“Pfizer places the utmost importance on product quality and patient safety. All Pfizer products released in the market meet every national and international testing specification,” the spokesperson said.Other companies ET contacted for comment did not respond until press time Friday.The survey, conducted to check the proportion of substandard drugs in the country, had tested 47,012 samples from 1,719 manufacturing units, CDSCO said. Around 3.16% of these samples were found to be not of standard quality, while 0.02% were spurious.India expects to bring down the proportion of its substandard drugs to 2% over the next three years to match global standards. The country’s drug regulator has been engaged in risk-based inspections of over 250 manufacturing plants as part of its efforts to achieve this goal."
"Knee surgery: After cardiac stents, government now caps knee implants price, cuts prices by up to 69%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: After coronary stents, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has wielded its powers of price control on knee implants — devices used to replace parts of the knee joints that are damaged. The difference this time is that the regulator has exercised its own emergency powers to do so, instead of waiting for the government to bring the devices under the National List of Essential Medicines as it did on stents.The drug pricing watchdog slashed the prices of total knee replacement systems and their individual components by as much as 69%, an NPPA notification issued on Wednesday evening showed.This decision is expected to lead to a saving of Rs 1,500 crore per year for the people of India, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar said. According to him, 1-1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures are done in India annually.Industry bodies representing manufacturers said they were reviewing the order and would take their suggestions to the regulator for its effective implementation.The price of total knee implants made of cobalt chromium has now been capped at Rs 54,720, down 65% from its average maximum retail price of Rs 1.58 lakh, data from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers showed. These are the most widely used complete knee implants, it said.Total knee implants made of special metals like titanium and oxidized zirconium can be priced at a maximum of Rs 76,600, or 69% lower than the original average MRP. High-flexibility implants have also seen a similar reduction in the maximum price to Rs 56,490. Revision implants, used in repeat procedures when the initial knee implant has failed, is capped 59% lower at Rs 1.14 lakh, down from an average of Rs 2.77 lakh.Special knee implants for cancer or tumours will follow the prices of revision knee implants, NPPA said.These prices are exclusive of goods and services tax, but take trade margins for manufacturers or importers, distributors and hospitals into account, NPPA said.The regulator's latest order specifically highlights the ceiling prices of each component used in a knee replacement procedure, such as femoral, tibial, insert and patellas. In most cases, the ceiling prices of these components have been set according to the materials used, but in the case of certain components, these have been fixed regardless of the materials used.NPPA's order comes around six months after it slashed the prices of coronary stents by up to 85%.Unlike stents, the government did not put knee implants on the essential medicines list. Usually, the Department of Pharmaceuticals notifies products for price control and NPPA caps the prices after the health ministry puts it on this list.Out of 1.5-2 crore patients who require arthroplasty interventions, only around a lakh are in a position to pay for the procedure every year, NPPA stated. Citing a World Health Organization bulletin from 2003, it said osteoarthritis could become the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. India is likely to be one of the leading countries of such immobilized citizens in terms of numbers.""As the public is aware, prices remain too high for devices across the board. We would like this to be the start for NPPA to systematically fix prices of all other devices on which data was collected in public interest,"" said Malini Aisola of patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN). ""The price reductions still need study and it will not be successful without a check on the hospital rates,"" she added.According to some knee implant manufacturers, the order has left a lot of issues unresolved without which the price cuts might not be possible. One of the companies that ET spoke to said a knee implant device has a number of components, and without fixing the prices of those components, it would be difficult to gauge the price cut.The Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD) is expected to meet the drug regulator asking for time in implementing these price cuts. The Medical Technology Association of India, another body that represents knee implant makers like Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew, said it is currently reviewing the order and will respond with suggestions to NPPA to ensure practicality of its decision.“Prices are reasonable and we are with the government. We believe this price cap will help every person of the country who needs implants,” stated Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD."
Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri,"EXCLUSIVE

Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri

K Shriniwas Rao • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:44 AM

Irrespective of how much I may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. © AFP

Given all the drama that surrounded the selection of the coach before they left for the tour of Sri Lanka late in July, a 3-0 series sweep like this one, wrapped up in just under eleven days, has once again brought the smiles back in the Indian camp. Ravi Shastri, back in a very familiar setting that he had helped put in place during his previous stint, is understandably elated. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Shastri talks about the road map ahead, his chemistry with the cricketers and his role going forward. Excerpts...

This was a first: A series sweep away from home. It should instil a good deal of aggression and positivity.

When was the last time that Sri Lanka were beaten like this at home? I'd like to wait and see how some other teams will cope against this same Sri Lankan team in the near future. But then, this is not about Sri Lanka, this is about the Indian team and the manner in which they've stamped their authority here. India's lowest score in this series (487) was still a 100-odd runs more than the best that Sri Lanka could manage throughout the three Tests. So, that should sum-up the total dominance, with the bat and ball.

What are the takeaways for the team after a performance like this?

Even if this team ends up losing a game, as long as they can walk out of the field with their heads held high, knowing that they gave their best, there's no problem whatsoever. A disciplined approach is what counts. For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik [Pandya] and one in the third game from [Mohammad] Shami, we've not faltered. How many catches did we drop throughout this series? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid. It's the effort that counts and in that, if we have to look at the bigger picture, we're taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.

The bowling unit has been coming together splendidly...

Bharath Arun has known these youngsters for such a long time now. Look at Kuldeep [Yadav], for instance. He's been tracking Kuldeep's growth from the Under-16 days. It's the same with some of the others he's worked with for a while now. So, in that sense, there's a sense of familiarity that's also helping. We've always seen Kuldeep as a guy with great potential but let's not go on harping about it. One step at a time. Not just the Test team, even [in] the ODIs, now that we have the likes of Jasprit [Bumrah] and Axar [Patel] coming in, they've all worked with Arun and I am keen to see things moving forward from here.

Hardik made a huge impression in the series...

Hardik may still be new to Test cricket but he's showing what a quick learner he is. As Virat [Kohli] said, he's been the biggest positive of this series. He was working on the cutters for the first time on the morning of the day's play with Arun and he didn't flinch once in going out and testing it the same day. That kind of confidence is what you need at this level.

He can add good balance to the attack if you only have to go in with two pacers...

Of course. But look at Shami and Yadav. They have been relentless. Look at the kind of surfaces that were on offer and these two continuously kept clocking between 141 and 145 kmph. To watch them in action on Day 2 of the game was very satisfying, knowing that these tracks hardly gave them any assistance.

And the fielding too... you've been quite focused on that front...

Oh yes. That's what I also talked about in my interview. When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding eleven in the world. The fittest of the lot and that's right up there in the list of priorities.

You really don't mind showering praise on individuals when you have to...

A few good words don't just make your day but they also give you the sense of belonging and confidence to take the next big step forward. A lot is spoken about coaching an international team. This team loves the pressure they face and the players see it as a challenge. Cynicism and negativity can kill all the joy. I'm not that kind of a guy. I look at the glass as being half-full.

And when there's enough trust and confidence in a healthy working relationship, things begin to look so much better from the outside.

Well, the trust is there. I can't speak for the time when I wasn't around, but what I can say with a sense of absolute belief is that nothing has changed between how things were during my last stint and now.

What is it about you and this Indian team that they have absolute faith in you?

Well, that is for the players to answer. I have a job to do and in my close to 35-year career as a cricketer and a commentator and the other roles that I've handled, I've always tried to give my best. All I can say is that the sense of trust comes from the players knowing that they have someone around who they can walk up to and discuss anything they want. If I really want to make lives difficult in order to get 100% commitment from the other guy, I can very well do that and everybody in this set-up knows what I'm talking about. Yet, at the same time, I don't believe in unnecessary interference. Everybody in this set-up has a responsibility carved out and come what may , that responsibility needs to be carried out to the best of the ability. My job is to ensure this is happening on a daily basis and outside of this, anything that needs to be done in the interest of the team.

A word on Wriddhiman Saha....

Saha has been excellent, be it his wicketkeeping, batting or catching. He had always been an unwavering guy in domestic cricket for years and that hard work is showing. He's grown so much in confidence and remember, he's walking into MS' [Dhoni] shoes. He's done phenomenally well to grow out of that shadow. The kind of 'keeping he came up with in this series - on the kind of surfaces that were on offer - makes him the No. 1 wicketkeeper in the world right now.

Batting seems to be the last of your worries...

To be honest, with a batting unit like this one, the last thing you'd do is lose sleep. The core is such a good one and I'm glad the way Shikhar [Dhawan] is timing the ball. He's got two big hundreds that have put him in the frame of mind that he loves to be in.

Cheteshwar [Pujara] has been batting like a dream and he's in a zone where he has set his targets going forward. And as if all of this wasn't enough, you saw a knock of a different kind here the other day. Hardik's century simply changed the course of an entire Test in less than an hour. We were thinking of going forward by 60 to 80 runs when the tail was batting and look where we ended. Five batsmen got a hundred in this series and close to 10 cricketers got 50-plus scores, which is a first in Test cricket for any team.

You keep insisting 'this is Virat's team' and you're just an extension. Can you elaborate?

I've always maintained this, not just now but even in my earlier stint that this is Virat's team. Prior to when he took over as captain, it was MS Dhoni's bunch and he nurtured some of the boys who've prospered today. The captain is the leader of the pack and the coach is an extension of that role, in the sense that it's the coach's responsibility to ensure that everything is in order for the team and its skipper to go and give their best. These are the principles I followed in my previous stint too. Irrespective of how much I or anyone else may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. Too much importance is given to other things, which is unnecessary. What matters is whether there's confidence and trust between all the individuals and that is my responsibility, to ensure there's enough of it.

There are some big Test series coming up next year, followed by the World Cup in 2019. Has the team sorted its priorities?

The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, we must realise that if India need to show their might in the game, achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle. Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it's Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year.

"Digitisation: Two-thirds of power utilities bullish on digitisation: Survey, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Two-thirds of Indian power utilities have citied digitisation of manual processes as one of the biggest drivers of growth and want to invest in technology for making their organisation more agile, a survey said today.According to the International Data Corporation ( IDC ) Energy Insights survey commissioned by Schneider Electric , 64 per cent of utility companies cited the digitising of manual processes as one of the biggest drivers for people, process and technology transformation within their organisations.The survey, done by US-based IDC, found that organisational flexibility and agility is also an issue, with 68 per cent of respondents stating their desire to create a more agile organisation as the top driver behind their information technology investments. Anil Chaudhry , Country President and Managing Director, Schneider Electric India, said, ""Digitisation offers tremendous opportunities for improving competency of power distribution in India.""""Traditionally, we have addressed the energy equation from the supply side - adjusting the amount of electricity generated to ensure that supply matches demand. But depending solely on supply-side solutions will not allow us to meet our obligations to reduce our carbon emissions and reduce energy consumption,"" he added.The study, released today, stated that Indian power sector faces several challenges, particularly rapid energy demand growth, infrastructure modernisation, and transmission and distribution inefficiencies.It found that the operational efficiency and cost are the top priorities the Indian power companies are facing.The research outlined the heavy focus that Indian utilities have placed on operational efficiency to improve their financial position, with improving efficiencies and reducing costs figuring as their top two priorities in the next 12-18 months.It found that the manual distribution processes, lack of decision making transparency, insufficient infrastructure, and lack of real-time information are some of the other challenges that are in turn resulting in delayed revenue realisation, poor operating efficiency, and high operating costs.Among Indian utilities, cloud platforms for data management, IoT and utilisation of data within 3D visualisations are particular priorities for organisations looking at new areas of technology investment."
Why Walnuts May Be The Answer To Beat The Hunger Pangs You Face All Day Long,"Nuts and seeds have been touted as a staple to add to your diet for a while now. Walnuts, however, specifically have a significant role to play in your daily eating habits; especially if you’re looking to lose weight or curb your appetite.

corbis/Representational Image

A recent finding that was published online in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found out that consuming walnuts daily may activate an area in your brain which decreases hunger. According to researchers, walnuts are also thought to discourage overeating by promoting feelings of fullness.

Study's first author Olivia M Farr from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said that people often report feeling fuller after eating walnuts, but it was pretty surprising to see evidence of activity changing in the brain related to food cues, and by extension what people were eating and how hungry they feel.

SuperFoodsRx/Representational Image

To determine exactly how walnuts quell cravings, Farr and colleagues, in a study led by Christos Mantzoros, MD, DSc, PhD hc mult, director of the Human Nutrition Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe how consuming walnuts changes activity in the brain.

The scientists recruited 10 volunteers with obesity to live in BIDMC's Clinical Research Center (CRC) for two five-day sessions.

Livestrong/Representational Image

During one five-day session, the volunteers consumed daily smoothies containing 48 grams of walnuts.

During their other stay in the CRC, they received a walnut-free but nutritionally comparable placebo smoothie flavoured to taste exactly the same as the walnut-containing smoothie.

The order of the two sessions was random, meaning some participants would consume the walnuts first and others would consume the placebo first.

The findings revealed that when the participants were shown pictures of highly desirable foods, fMRI imaging revealed increased activity in a part of the brain called the right insula after participants had consumed the five-day walnut-rich diet compared to when they had not.

This area of the insula is likely involved in cognitive control and salience, meaning that participants were paying more attention to food choices and selecting the less desirable or healthier options over the highly desirable or less healthy options."
"Biocon developing 10 biosimilars that collectively target global market opportunity of over $60 billion: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi: India’s biopharmaceutical company Biocon , which ranks among top three biosimilar global players for insulin , has multiple successes in its container since its inception. So far, Biocon has successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars from laboratory to market in India.“We will continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in our research and development,” said, Chairman & Managing Director,. In an email interview with ETHealthworld, the Biocon chief shared her in-depth insights on the challenges, achievements and growth prospects of the biopharma industry in India. Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion’s share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‘Start-Up India’ initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia’s first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‘lab to market’ in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‘first-in-class’ oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."
"Single use medical devices: Mumbai: FIRs against 37 hospitals for reusing devices, patients to be reimbursed, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has filed complaints against 37 hospitals across the state for reusing single-use medical devices and overcharging patients, said minister for consumer protection Girish Bapat . The government is also working on ways to refund patients who were unfairly charged for reused devices, he announced in the legislative council on Tuesday.Moreover, to prevent such incidents from recurring in hospitals, the state government plans to develop a web portal that will record every medical device’s journey—right from its purchase to use and re-use.“The web portal will keep a track of each medical device from the moment it is purchased, the medical institute it is sold to, and its use,” said Bapat, replying to a query raised by Congress MLC Satej Patil during question hour. The minister added that discussions with the Medical Council of India, the Drug Council of India and secretary of the public health department on the issue are in the final stages.The announcement follows special investigations by the state Food and Drug Administration in May-June that showed many private hospitals charged premium charges from patients for reused cardiac catheters and guidewires; most of these devices are only meant for single use.In April, the state FDA had found three city hospitals guilty of not only reusing medical devices meant for single use, but also charging multiple patients for the same. Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi, which is managed by the Fortis group, and BSES Hospital in Andheri were later issued show-cause notices for violating the Drug and Cosmetics Act.On Tuesday, when Patil pointed out that a few hospitals have already reused implant devices and cheated patients, the minister assured him that the government would get information about such cases and refund those patients."
"Modi govt’s energy efficiency scheme to enable Rs 1,000 cr investment by 2020, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The Modi government’s flagship scheme to ramp up energy efficiency profile of buildings being executed by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) will lead to investments of Rs 1,000 crore over the next three years through 2020, an official statement said today.EESL, a joint venture of PSUs under the power ministry, is implementing the Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme which was launched by power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal in May. “Under the programme, EESL intends to bring in investment of around 1,000 crore covering more than 10,000 large government or private buildings by 2020,” the ministry said.EESL plans to retrofit one crore LED lights, 15 lakh energy-efficient ceiling fans and 150,000 lakh energy efficient ACs in buildings. Apart from retrofitting, EESL also aims to widen its services in areas like centralized AC system, Energy Audits, and New Generation Energy Management System in buildings.The finance ministry has issued guidelines for mandatory installation of energy-efficient appliances in all central government buildings across the country as a majority of these buildings are old constructions and, therefore, consume large amount of energy. The finance ministry has directed usage of LED-based lightings and energy-efficient cooling equipment in government buildings will lead to savings through reduction in energy consumption.In order to implement this plan, the Department of Expenditure under Ministry of Finance has decided to take up the services of EESL on nomination basis to assist ministries and departments to retrofit energy-efficient appliances in their premises across the country.The Buildings Energy Efficiency Programme has two business models -- The Energy Servicing Company (ESCO) model where the entire upfront investment is made by EESL and is paid back by the building owner out of the resulting energy savings from the intervention and the Project Management Consultancy (PMC) model where EESL acts as the project management consultant for implementing the project and the client invests the entire project cost and bears one-time PMC charges of EESL.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in January 2015 launched the National LED Programme to facilitate rapid adoption of LED-based home and street lighting across the country. The programme components -- Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) and Street Lighting National Programme (SNLP) of EESL -- are currently under implementation in 29 States and 7 Union Territories."

"petrol pumps: Petrol pump racket: Accused visited 25 nations to study tricks to rig machines, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: The man at the centre of the investigations into tampering of fuel dispensers made several trips aboard to study technology and methods for rigging machines at petrol pumps , cops have learned.Prakash Nulkar, 56, who previously worked at a manufacturer of fuel dispensers, visited 25 countries, including China, Japan, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa between 1998 and 2017. He finally decided to import components such as microchips from China and altered them to suit local specifications, said an officer with the Thane Crime Branch The chips were inserted into fuel dispensing units, which then pumped less fuel than what customers paid for. The method helped dishonest petrol station owners skim hundreds of litres of fuel every day.“Nulkar was the biggest supplier of tampered machines and parts to petrol stations across the country. He revealed many details during interrogation,” said the officer, who has been part of the probe from the start.On June 16, the Thane Crime Branch inspected a petrol station in Manpada and found that its dispensing units had been altered to secretly pump less fuel. Several petrol stations were subsequently raided in Mumbai, Thane district and other parts of the state and more instances of cheating came to light.Nulkar was arrested from Hubli Karnataka , on July 11. He apparently wanted to set up an operations control centre in China. Investigators are reviewing his international transactions and trying to identify suspects located outside India.One of his main associates in the country was Vivek Shetye, a 47-yearold software engineer from Dombivali. He was arrested earlier. The Crime Branch officer said multiple teams tracked Nulkar’s movements for close to a month before finally nabbing him.In all, he made 40 trips abroad. Singapore, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Madagascar, Bahrain, Myanmar, Malaysia are among the countries he visited. “Nulkar conducted a detailed study before starting the racket. All his foreign trips and the people he met there are under scrutiny. This could be just the tip of the iceberg,” said deputy police commissioner (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe.So far, evidence of tampering has been found at 125 petrol pumps across the state."
Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now © Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

"Roving surgical robot to tour four key Andhra Pradesh cities, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Visakhapatnam: Cancer is a relentless disease. Damaging organs and tissues in its wake, cancer can be insidious in its onset, hiding malignant cells and tumours in the most unreachable parts of the body.

Early detection is a daunting challenge. Once detected, patients find it hard to accept its presence spending time in exploring alternative methods to banish cancer.

Eventually calling for surgery, medication and a combination of radiation and chemotherapy.

But there is one hope on the horizon for sufferers of this most devastating of conditions. Robotic surgery methods can allow for hugely magnified views of the damaged tissue and provide very fine and precise instruments needed to get access to them inside the body and bring relief.

The da Vinci robot is no autonomous machine, performing surgery on a helpless patient with minimal interference from the surgeon. In fact, a trained surgeon is in charge every second of the way.

The da Vinci surgical robot that combines the best of science and medicine, is a whole 1000 kilos of hardware. Its brains are equivalent to software packed in several PCs. It includes 2250 plus patents with 1550 more pending and so is filled to the brim with innovation. What the robot adds is a way of seeing better and four flexible arms that enter the human body through tiny incisions can be guided to make the repair needed. It is the next breakthrough step in minimally invasive surgery and a major step up from laparoscopic procedures.

Dr T Subramanyeshwar Rao, Medical Director and Chief Surgical Oncologist, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital, Hyderabad says, ""The distinct advantages of robotic assistance are high resolution 3-dimensional visuals and 10-fold magnification, wristed instruments with seven degrees of freedom of movement, filtration of tremors of surgeon's hands and motion scaling to suit the speed and experience of a surgeon.""

When working with a da Vinci, the surgeon, a specialist not only in the use of the machine but also in her own field of surgery, sits at a console controlling the robotic arms and sending the right instrument to remove or repair tissue. Because it is so precise, there is less chance of collateral damage. And since the cuts and incisions needed to send the robotic arms are so tiny, the patient doesn't have to suffer the trauma of traditional open surgery. A huge relief to just about anyone. It means negligible blood loss, less pain, quick recovery and shorter hospital stay.

Spelling out advantages of Robotic Surgery over laparoscopic surgery Dr C. Mallikarjuna, Managing Director and Senior Urologist, Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology, Hyderabad says, ""Laparoscopic surgery is an extremely difficult field to practice. To perfect you need a lot of training, mentorship, and clinical practice. To excel it needs a lot of time and perseverance. da Vinci Robot makes that learning curve easy so that the expertise can come earlier. It literally means technology helps you get better in shorter time.""

Robotic surgery works best in areas involving soft tissue. It is certainly proving better than traditional surgery in many gynaecological cancers, head, and neck and thoracic surgery, removal of organs such as the kidney, liver, pancreas, thyroid, prostate, and uterus, urology ailments and even organ transplants. Robotic surgery is also being used more and more for paediatric patients. In this form of surgery, suturing is flawless.

The Vattikuti Foundation, Vattikuti Technologies and Intuitive Surgical Inc. have instituted a 'Roving Robot' project in which the surgical robot is being taken around the country for surgeons, hospital managements and local physicians to touch and feel a Surgical Robot and listen to one of the accomplished robotic surgeons in the country to share her experience and the benefits to patients.

""The 'Roving Robot' will help surgeons experience the capabilities of a da Vinci surgical robot in removing cancerous tissue while retaining healthy tissue,"" says Gopal Chakravarthy, CEO, Vattikuti Technologies that distributes the da Vinci robot created by US-based Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA.

The Vattikuti Foundation and Vattikuti Technologies have helped expand robotic surgery to 47 hospitals in 20 Indian cities, in the past six years, while creating a ground swell of trained robotic surgeons. Vattikuti Foundation began promoting Robotic Surgery in the US in 1997 and has since played a stellar role in spreading it across the USA, Europe, and India.

In the next leg of its country-wide march, the Roving Robot is Southward bound to four cities in Andhra Pradesh. The da Vinci will be showcased in Vishakhapatnam (Care Hospital Aug 18; Apollo Hospital Health City, Arilova, Aug 19; Pinnacle Hospital Health City, Arilova Aug 21-22), in Rajahmundry (GSL Medical College, Aug 26), Vijayawada (Prashanth Hospital Aug 28, Aayush Hospital Aug 29 and Ramesh Hospital Aug 30) and in Tirupati (SVIMS Sep 2-3).

Eminent surgical-oncologist Dr Jagdishwar Goud from Hyderabad's Yashoda Hospital will highlight the benefits of robotic surgery in an interactive session with surgeons from Vishkhapatnam and neighbouring towns on Aug 23.

Vattikuti Technologies and surgical robot maker Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA will offer hospitals the da Vinci robot along with instruments and maintenance required for the next three years at a special price point.

Currently, Andhra Pradesh has surgical robots at Apollo Hospital, Asian Institute of Nephrology & Urology, Basavatarakam Indo American Hospital, Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences and Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad and Vizag Hospital and Cancer Institute in Vishakhapatnam.

Part of the Foundation's mission is also to offer 100 paid fellowships to super specialist surgeons, over the next five years, so they can become robotic surgeons. In this, they are making good progress. Vattikuti Foundation also organizes Robotic Surgeons conference every six months.

At the recent Robotic Surgeons' conferences hosted by the Foundation, over 100-125 robotic surgeons participated and shared their experience and techniques with others to encourage further appropriate use of this form of surgery.

Vattikuti Technologies has been making available da Vinci Robotic Surgery System from Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA. The da Vinci Surgery is considered the gold standard in minimally invasive surgery.

In 2016, over 750,000 procedures were performed worldwide using over 4000 da Vinci robotic surgical systems world-wide. The da Vinci system has brought about a paradigm shift by making it possible to have almost all complex procedures done with minimal access. Over 4 million da Vinci procedures have been carried out so far.

Since 2011 Vattikuti Technologies has partnered with several hospitals in drawing a roadmap for success of the robotic program as well as supporting training of surgeons besides ensuring high uptime for the system through its trained clinical support and service team.

Large corporate hospitals; Government hospitals and Trust hospitals in 20 Indian cities are using the da Vinci Surgical Robots. (ANI-Businesswire India)"
"Oil & Gas, Latest Oil & Gas News, Energy News","When Saudi Arabia decided in June to raise price of crude and cut shipments to Asia and the US, it may have unwittingly provided the spark for India’s maiden drive towards America for supplies and helped New Delhi to undercut Opec’s sway over the world’s third largest oil consumer."
Increasing gulf in quality defines current health of Asian giants,"Sri Lanka will have to improve massively in order to challenge India later this year. © AFP

Purely as a game, I sometimes try to do the old six word review of things. I attempted it for the series against Sri Lanka and came up with: Sri Lanka abysmal, India intimidating. It told me everything about the series and I had a word left! The home team was that bad.

Admittedly, India began overwhelming favourites but teams have visited the lovely island as favourites before and discovered opposition they sometimes hadn't anticipated. There were always, certainly in the last fifteen years, players who could take the game away from you. There were tough players, others with an air of mystery around them, some who played exotic shots and bowled at unique angles. This time there were none. It is not good for cricket because Sri Lanka has given us some very fine talents who inevitably resided within modest personalities.

It is easy therefore to belittle India's performance but that wouldn't be fair. You play the opposition you are provided and if there is a gulf between the two teams in ability, you make sure that is reflected in the scorecards. And sure it was. Each time, India racked up a lead in excess of 300, the margins of victory were the kind you would expect if a heavyweight boxer entered the ring with a middleweight. To that extent, India did what they could and while playing an opponent who hardly throws a punch back can lead to bad habits, India dominated like the better side is meant to.

Shikhar Dhawan made the most of the opportunity as did Cheteshwar Pujara. One punched with a smile, the other made incisions with narrowed eyes. And all the batsmen partook of the feast on offer. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up 17 wickets and scored runs fluently and until a headmasterly approach to the game took out Ravindra Jadeja, he had fun too. And if Hardik Pandya had been asked to choose a debut series, he couldn't have picked a better one. There is something about him and I hope it stays that way as fame envelops him. If you like fame too much it isn't your best companion as doubtlessly he will be told by wise heads. Kuldeep Yadav impressed too and the fact that batsmen don't seem to pick him means captains will always be tempted to pick him. India will have some tough choices to make in the days ahead.

If you are a cricket lover, it is difficult not to be carried away by the manner in which the ball leaves Mohammed Shami's hands and makes its journey to the batsman. The seam is upright and proud and the ball reaches the bat at a nippy pace. Shami probably bowled too little and admitted in an interview that he was the support bowler in these conditions. That may be understating things but I do hope he thinks he is Ashwin when the side tours more seam-friendly lands.

But for all that, the most dramatic performance for me came from a quiet man whose deeds even modern scoreboards haven't found ways to reflect. Wriddhiman Saha's wicket-keeping in the second Test was the performance of the series for me.

Sri Lanka come to India this winter and I hope they have more to offer. Karunaratne, Mendis, Mathews and Chandimal are far better players than they let themselves be at most times but it is the bowling they need to sort. Sandakan must play everytime but how do they replace Herath? I wish they can cajole a few more months out of fingers that have twirled so long because otherwise their batsmen will always have a mountain of runs in front of them.

The one-dayers will be more competitive but I'm afraid Test cricket needs to come to grips with the crisis that confronts it. Nobody came to watch and when one team looks like a juggernaut and the other a meek figure waiting to be run over, it doesn't bode well.

"Nuclear medical generators stuck at airports, PMO concerned, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: Reacting to a TOI report on the scarcity of nuclear generators affecting diagnosis at the country’s leading hospitals, the prime minister’s office asked doctors from AIIMS , New Delhi, on Monday to brief its officials about the issue. Over 90 technetium-99m generators, which could have helped perform nearly 10,000 life-saving scans, have been languishing at Mumbai and New Delhi international airports since August 6 and are close to expiry.TOI had reported the previous Saturday how the generators with a maximum shelf life of 14 days are stuck at airports because one of the major importers could not complete the paperwork for a new licence in time. As a result, thousands of scans to be carried out at nuclear medicine centres for cancer, heart, renal diseases had to be cancelled.Dr Chetan Patel, who heads the nuclear cardiology unit at AIIMS, said the PMO has promised to look into the matter and expedite the process of getting approvals. “Currently, we have cut down the volume of tests by 40%,” he said. The hospital has approached the government’s Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology for the key radioactive material but is yet to receive supply.Currently, in most of the 200-odd nuclear medicine centres in the country, scans have either been completely stopped or drastically reduced. “The crisis will worsen as we have been told there will be no supply in the coming weeks,” said Dr B R Mittal, head of nuclear medicine, PGIMER Chandigarh, which normally performs at least 100 scans every day. “We are forced to turn away patients,” he added.While the generators have been coming to the country since the past 30 years, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) imposed quality control last October, making it mandatory for importers to obtain fresh licences. However, an order asking the customs to restrict their import has disrupted the supply of generators since one of the importers is yet to get the registration certificate. Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh had previously told TOI that importers were given five to six extensions since last year to complete the formalities.A bigger hazard looming now is that of radiation exposure at the two key airports. Even if the generators become useless for medical consumption, they cannot be discarded like regular medical waste. Hospitals store them for two to three months before they become non-radioactive and are safe to be discarded. “Since airports don’t have any such facility, there is a risk of radiation exposure, even if minimal,” said Dr Anshu Sharma, president, Society of Nuclear Medicine (India). “The Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) has stringent regulations for discarding of radioactive materials. How will airports follow these regulations?” he said.Vishat Diagnostics, the largest importer of technetium-99m generators that supplies to 80% of the hospitals, said they won’t import generators till they get the registration certificate. Ajith Kumar from Vishat said, “We have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 15 lakh because of the government’s stance. We will not be importing any more generators till we have all the papers.”Meanwhile, patients have been badly hit. Patang Khandekar (65), who was asked to undergo a full-body scan, was turned back from a Marol hospital on Monday. “It is sad that we have wasted precious radioactive material that our nuclear reactors don’t manufacture,” said Dr G Mahapatra from SevenHills Hospital."

"Unit Tariff: Solar tariffs at Rs 3 a unit may be the new normal: NTPC CMD Gurdeep Singh, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh said Rs 3-3.20 a unit tariff for solar power may be the new normal and can be achieved without the support of “cheap funds or cheap panels"", which have been a concern for the industry.Solar and wind energy units generate less than 10% of the global electricity output and have remained on the side-lines historically as these projects were taken up to fulfill a social responsibility towards clean energy But these green energy sources have seen a decline in prices making them comparable to conventional energy and causing a disruption in the power sector. India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.“We should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.“We are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,“ Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."

"Need to blend healthcare and technology for the hospital, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Technology enabled care is growing rapidly today

ByDirector Operations, Primecare INDIA, Bangalore mobile devices , and related technologies are presenting new opportunities in health care to better diagnose, monitor, and manage patients and treatment. Many providers employ these technologies along a continuum of wellness and prevention, to therapeutic remedies and treatments for illness. Some examples of current innovations include:Thanks to rapid advances in technology, today our doctors can diagnose, monitor and consult a patient from a distance through advanced telemedicine technology, videoconferencing, remote monitoring and other methods.Adoption of EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system has enabled the hospital and doctors to share patient health records such as prescriptions, lab reports, X-rays, CT, MRIs, Medical information through e-report by just a click.With the help of Electronic Medical Record/Electronic Health Records (EMR/HER) all risk factors such as loss of critical information, mismanagement of health records are ruled out. Patient files or patient records are being kept in databases securely. This is keeping with the best practices which have become a norm for doctors and hospitals today.“We live in an age in which every moment counts heavily and the price of delay is human lives.”At Hospital usage of technology advancements in Lab & Radiology diagnostics has substantially assisted in patient management. The technological advancements in the field of Radiology have transformed diagnosis interpretation. Earlier, the results used to take three to five days to reach the ordering physician but now it reaches within a short period of just thirty minutes. This advancement is of great gain because now, the interpreted report will reach the ordering physician quick enough to treat the patient in a shorter time span. All of this will prevent diseases from spreading to others’ and in turn save many lives. Due to advancement in technology, comprehensive information helps in accurate diagnosis and enables physicians to create an effective treatment plan and gain control over patients’ health during critical stages is much more accurate and fast. Following best practices have become a norm for doctors and hospitals today. Hospital Health Information System (HIS) technology focuses mainly on the administrational needs of the hospital. HIS is another integrated information system implemented in hospitals to manage all aspects of hospital’s operations like appointment scheduling, patient billing, financial accounting, patient visits for outpatient care, in an emergency, admission either a short stay or long in duration, medication therapy evaluation in inpatients care settings, OT management, Lab information system (LIS), pharmacy management, inventory management, resource management and corresponding processing of services is efficiently managed with the help of HIS. Hospital generate a wealth of data round the clock, 365 days a year, all of which needs to be well managed to ensure efficient functioning of hospital. Thanks to the IT for making healthcare look more organized and professional.We certainly can’t deny the benefits of technology in healthcare. Among the advantages of technology in healthcare we can also count the decline in preventable death cases, along with a general improvement of patients’ well-being. Treatment and recovery time have been reduced significantly. Medical technology doesn’t only affect patient’s quality of life; it also affects the lives of thousands of medical professionals and students spend time in training to become medical experts.From a bigger perspective, innovative health technology is helping us grow the world economy. More and more entrepreneurs and business owners have started to invest in medical technology today. If we are to widely consider the question, how has technology changed healthcare? There is no straightforward response since it’s an ongoing process. All we know is that it’s becoming a huge focus on world economies."

Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."
"Mylan, U.S. finalise $465 million EpiPen settlement, Health News, ET HealthWorld","By Nate Raymond

BOSTON - Mylan NV has finalised a $465 million settlement resolving U.S. Justice Department claims it overcharged the government for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, which became the centre of a firestorm over price increases.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts on Thursday announced the accord, which was soon after criticized by some congressional members as being too easy on the drugmaker. It came 10 months after Mylan said it had reached a deal.

The settlement resolved claims that Mylan avoided higher rebates to state Medicaid programs by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic product, even though it was marketed and priced as a brand-name product.

""Taxpayers rightly expect companies like Mylan that receive payments from taxpayer-funded programs to scrupulously follow the rules,"" Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said in a statement.

Under the deal, Mylan did not admit wrongdoing. It will reclassify EpiPen and pay the rebate applicable to its new classification as of April 1, 2017.

""Bringing closure to this matter is the right course of action for Mylan and our stakeholders to allow us to move forward,"" Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch said in a statement.

The deal followed a False Claims Act whistleblower lawsuit filed by French rival Sanofi SA in 2016, two years after it first raised the matter with authorities, Weinreb's office said.

Sanofi, which formerly marketed a rival product called Auvi-Q, will receive nearly $38.8 million as a reward from the government.

Sanofi in a statement called pursuing the matter ""the right thing to do."" It has a separate antitrust lawsuit pending alleging Mylan engaged in illegal conduct to squelch competition to EpiPen.

Mylan shares rose 2.10 percent to $31.11 on the Nasdaq.

The EpiPen, which Mylan acquired in 2007, is a handheld device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine.

Mylan came under fire last year after raising the price of a pair of EpiPens to $600, from $100 in 2008, enraging consumers and putting it in the centre of the ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of prescription medicines.

Mylan has since offered its own generic version for about $300. The company announced it had reached a Justice Department settlement in October.

Some congressional members previously criticized the $465-million settlement as too small. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, renewed that position on Thursday, calling it ""completely insufficient.""

A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis released in May found the U.S. government may have overpaid for EpiPens by up to $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016.

""Absolving Mylan from a finding of wrongdoing has cleared the way for the company to pocket the money it embezzled from an American public in desperate need of lifesaving and affordable medications,"" Blumenthal said in a statement.

Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa in a statement called the accord a ""disappointment,"" saying it ""looks like the settlement amount short-changes the taxpayers.""

Mylan shares were up 0.1 at $30.50 in late trading.

"Piyush Goyal: Centre rejigs PPA, takes the wind out of state power discom bullies, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The Centre has taken a stern view of state distribution companies violating contracts by bullying solar and wind power developers to cut prices, which bankers say will discourage lenders and investors.The minister for power, coal, renewable energy and mines, Piyush Goyal , has expressed concern at the development and has opposed violation of contracts that have already been signed. Goyal is spearheading India’s massive expansion of renewable energy capacity, which has made India a world leader in growth of wind and solar generation.“The government view is very clear that the legal framework has to be respected.All PPAs, whatever the legal terms are, they will be respected. But if a PPA has a mutual negotiation clause, and somebody is willing to do it, then what can be done?” he told ET.Fierce competition in solar and wind power auctions along with falling prices of equipment have helped tariffs tumble to record lows, making older projects look very costly. This has prompted many state discoms to ask project developers to sell electricity at the lowest available rate even if the contract for a particular plant was signed when costs were much higher.A government official said the Centre was considering sending an advisory to states, cautioning them about the adverse implications of their efforts to arm-twist companies to cut rates. The Indian Banks Association has also written to the power and finance ministries saying that the action by states was threatening the viability of projects, which in turn would make their loans risky.States where project developers are being pressured to cut tariffs include Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, UP and Jharkhand. Government officials said that renewable energy projects are a key part of India’s efforts to meet its climate commitments and to reduce the use of polluting fossil fuels, and the effort to promote clean energy has the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At a recent meeting with the wind developers and state nodal agencies for renewable energy, newly appointed secretary of the renewable energy ministry, Anand Kumar, expressed great surprise at the deluge of complaints from developers. Most of them related to state discoms trying to go back on their commitments on wind energy.He promised to do something about the matter and also told them to keep filing petitions before the appropriate forums. Subsequently, there has been a meeting of state regulators with MNRE officials at which issues raised by developers were discussed with them. Thereafter MNRE has also been in touch with the power secretaries of different states pointing out the problems that have arisen and urging them to get their discoms to behave and honour commitments.Kumar also wants power purchase agreements to be honoured unless there is an issue of irregularity or corruption."

"11th edition of FICCI gets under way, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI, August 17, 2017. C K Mishra , Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, today underlined the need for investing two-thirds of the spending in primary healthcare and enhancing preventive care to keep the requirement of diagnostic care and admission to hospitals in check. As financial resources are limited, it is essential to invest in the right place for optimal results, he said while inaugurating the 11th edition of FICCI HEAL on the theme ‘ Indian Healthcare : A Patient’s View’.Mr. Mishra said that infrastructure in remote areas was weak and only government establishments were functional in such places; therefore active private sector participation was needed to make quality and affordable healthcare accessible to all.He said that the new National Health Policy 2017 with the three pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality of care are in line with a patient’s needs. He added that there was a need to customize care and value the choices of a patient.Recognising FICCI’s efforts in the health care space, Mr. Mishra said that the industry had been forthcoming with policy and reform suggestions, which enabled the government to strengthen its policies. He urged FICCI to develop a framework in conjunction with the government to step the country’s healthcare delivery system.On the occasion, Mr. Mishra released a Knowledge Paper ‘The healthcare consumer: Understanding expectations & experiences in the patients journey’ prepared by FICCI in collaboration with KANTAR-IMRB . The report is based on interviews with over 5000 patients pan-India from both public and private hospitals. Some key findings show that 61% of the patients rated their overall experience in private hospitals positively as compared to 45% for government hospitals. The report delves on the experiences and expectations of the patient and provides recommendations for the government and healthcare providers.Mr. Pankaj Patel, President, FICCI, said that the government’s intent to increase the public health spend to 2.5%, efforts should be made to increase it to 4% of GDP to meet the universal healthcare goals of the country. He added that long-term financing options from banks are still not available to healthcare providers and this was hampering the penetration of private healthcare in the country. He said that while retention of healthcare services in the tax exemption list under the GST regime is thoughtful and will enable flow of seamless tax credit and improve overall tax compliance, the services rendered by the hospital are exempted from taxes, several input services are subject to GST, which will result in increase in overall cost of care for the patient. Mr. Patel said that FICCI assures the government, its complete support for achieving affordable, accessible and quality healthcare to all Indians."
Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release — to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour’s standards. Somehow ‘comfort zone’ has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life’s journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‘until a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.’ Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‘I’,the soil into which it is buried is God — the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected — into us.■

SL name ODI squad; skipper Tharanga calls for support

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Tue, 15 Aug, 2017, 09:03 PM

Upul Tharanga urged the country to rally behind the team while stating that every team in each sport goes through a rough phase. © AFP

In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's abysmal 3-0 Test series loss at the hands of the No. 1 ranked Test side India, ODI skipper Upul Tharanga called for the nation's support and urged the fans to rally behind the team in testing times as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match ODI series on Tuesday (August 15).

ODI Squad: Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando

With Asela Gunaratne yet to recover from the thumb injury he sustained during the first Test, the selectors have recalled allrounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana for the five-match series. While Perera was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe, Siriwardana's last appearance for the national side came in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in March-April this year.

Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who featured in the final ODI against Zimbabwe, has been given the axe alongside Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. In their place, the selectors have included Malinda Pushpakumara, who recently made his Test debut against India and young seamer Vishwa Fernando. Both Pushpakumara and Fernando are yet to make their debut in the 50-over format.

""Every team goes through a rough patch,"" skipper Tharanga said. ""This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.

Sri Lanka conceded 600+ totals in two of the three Tests and were asked to follow on in the last two games before succumbing to innings defeats. While the island nation weren't expected to topple the No. 1 ranked side during the series, the manner of defeat came across as rather baffling as their side kept slipping to newer depths every time. With the five-match ODI series and a lone T20I coming up, the skipper noted that every team had its share of lows and goes through a phase of transition before coming back on top.

""Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch. Obviously there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.""

The skipper also reposed faith in the limited-overs outfit and felt that they are well equipped to fare better against their opponents in the 50-over format of the game. ""Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.

""The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us.

""Yesterday despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too - so as the captain of the ODI & T20 teams, I want to appeal to each every one of you,"" concluded Tharanga.

Why Skipping Breakfast Makes Your Child Undernourished,"If your child is in the habit of skipping breakfast regularly he or she may be falling well short of the daily required amounts of nutrients that are essential for their growth and development, claim the researchers of a recent study.

Reuters/representational image

The findings showed that 31.5 per cent of children who skipped breakfast did not meet even the lower recommended nutrient intake (LRNI) of iron.

While 19 per cent did not meet LRNI for calcium, 21.5 per cent did not meet lower levels of iodine and 7.3 per cent had a folate intake below their recommended nutrient intake level.

Reuters/representational image

On the other hand, children who ate breakfast every day were found to have higher daily intakes of key nutrients such as folate—important for the development of genetic material–, calcium, iron and iodine—key in the development of thyroid function.

“This study provides evidence that breakfast is key for parents to ensure that their children are getting the nutrition they need,” said Gerda Pot, a lecturer at the King’s College London.

For the study, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, the team included 802 children aged from four to 10 years and 884 children aged 11 to 18 years.

Reuters/representational image

Breakfast was considered as consumption of over 100 calories between 6 and 9 a.m.

The study also showed that, in younger children (four to 10 years old), on days when breakfast was consumed, children had higher intakes of folate, calcium, vitamin C and iodine compared to their breakfast-skipping days.

Out of these same nutrients, for older children (11-18 years old) only calcium intakes were higher on breakfast-consuming days.

"China: India is quietly preparing to end Chinese businesses' free run here, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: India is tightening the rules for businesses entering its power transmission sector and making stringent checks on both power and telecoms equipment for malware — moves that government and industry officials say aim to check China 's advance into sensitive sectors.Chinese firms such as Harbin Electric, Dongfang Electronics, Shanghai Electric and Sifang Automation either supply equipment or manage power distribution networks in 18 cities in India.Local firms have long lobbied against Chinese involvement in the power sector, raising security concerns and saying they get no reciprocal access to Chinese markets.With India and China locked in their most serious military face-off in three decades, the effort to restrict Chinese business has gathered more support from within the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , worried about the possibility of a cyber attack.The Indian government is considering a report prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) that sets new conditions for firms bidding for power transmission contracts, tipping the scales in favour of local companies.According to an official involved in drafting the report, who asked not to be named, it says companies looking to invest in India should have been operating there for at least 10 years, have Indian citizens as top executives, and employees of the foreign firm should have lived in India for a certain period, the official said.Those companies have to detail where they procure the raw materials for transmission systems, and will be barred from further operations in India if their materials contain malware.Though the report makes no direct reference to China, the official said the recommendations are intended to deter China from making further headway in India, because of the security risks.CEA Chairman R.K. Verma said the possibility of a crippling cyber attack on India's power systems was a key consideration while drafting the policy. ""Cyber attacks are a challenge,"" he told Reuters.A representative of a Chinese enterprise engaged in exporting electric power equipment in India told China's state-run Global Times that India's industry has long tried to block foreign competition under the garb of safety issues.""Now, as Sino-Indian relations are getting intense, the old tune is on again. But in fact, it is unrealistic to completely ban China and India power investment cooperation. India will pay a huge price for this,"" the paper said.Shanghai Electric, Harbin Electric, Dongfang Electronics and state-run China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd, all involved in India or trying to enter, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the proposed Indian investment rules.TELECOMSThe Indian government is moving simultaneously on the telecoms sector, demanding higher security standards in an area dominated by Chinese makers of equipment and smartphones.In a letter reviewed by Reuters, the ministry of electronics and information technology has asked 21 smartphone makers, most of them Chinese, to provide details about the ""safety and security practices, architecture frameworks, guidelines, standards, etc followed in your product/services in the country.""Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, Vivo and Gionee together account for over half of India's $10 billion smartphone market. The letter, dated Aug. 12, was also sent to Apple, Samsung Electronics and local maker Micromax, a ministry source said.India has also privately raised objections to Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group's proposed $1.3 billion takeover of Indian drugmaker Gland Pharma, it emerged last month.""There's a lot of resentment against China for meddling in our internal affairs, supporting Pakistan's cross-border terrorism, and, on the other hand, posing a huge loss to our trade and industry each year,"" said Satish Kumar, national president of the Swadesh Jagran Manch, a right-wing nationalist group with ties to Modi's ruling party.The group has this year run a campaign asking Indians not to buy Chinese goods to protect local industry and reset a trade deficit of more than $51 billion.CHEAP GOODSIndia has used Chinese equipment for power generation and distribution as it looks to provide affordable electricity to an estimated 250 million people who are off the grid.China Southern Power Grid, in association with CLP India Pvt Ltd, is among Chinese firms bidding for power transmission lines, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament this month.Sunil Misra, director-general of the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association, said the new rules for power transmission would help local industry and were in line with the limited access China gives to foreigners in its market.Indian firms engaged in the power sector include Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Ltd and Larsen & Toubro Ltd.Security agencies have implemented a series of protocols and checks for Chinese equipment coming into the power sector, said another person involved in drafting the CEA report.""This is recent and happening quietly,"" he said."

"Draft emission norms for diesel locomotives in two weeks: CPCB, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has told the National Green Tribunal that the draft emission standards for diesel locomotives will be finalised within two weeks.

The apex pollution monitoring body told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar that it would place the interim norms before August 30, the next date of hearing.

""The counsel appearing for CPCB submits that within two weeks the interim guidelines will be placed on record,"" the bench noted.

The lawyer appearing for CPCB said the emission standards for diesel locomotives were still to be decided and they would send to the MoEF after finalisation.

The submission came in the wake of the green panel's direction to set standards in this regard and ensure that the railway locomotive engines don't cause pollution.

The CPCB's interim report, titled ""Exhaust Emission Benchmarks for Diesel Locomotives on Indian Railways"", aims to fix standards and protocols for the sector to achieve the targets submitted by India under the Paris climate change agreement.

According to the report, the contribution of emissions from the transport sector on the whole has risen 3.5 times since 1990 to stand at 250 million tonne carbon dioxide, or 13.5 per cent of the total emissions in 2013.

The Railways contributed 9.7 per cent of this figure (24.7 million tonne). Globally, however, only 3.5 per cent of the emissions from the transport sector are attributed to the rail sector, CPCB's report said.

""The changes in the energy sources allowed for a reduction of the share of rail transport carbon dioxide emissions from 24 per cent in 1990 to less than 10 per cent in 2013, while rail activity doubled in the same period,"" the draft report by CPCB said.

Earlier, the tribunal had directed MoEF to hold a meeting with the CPCB and Railways and submit a report on emission standards for diesel locomotive within six weeks.

However, when the matter came up for hearing, the Environment Ministry sought more time, saying ""the standards are yet to be fixed and one year's time is required for completion"".

The Railways had earlier submitted international standards for emissions from diesel locomotive railway engines and filed a data sheet indicating the emissions from 30 railway engines.

According to the data sheet, the emission levels in the tested 30 railway engines were much above international standards.

The directions came during the hearing a petition filed by Dwarka resident S K Goyal about harmful emissions from diesel locomotives."
Bullying madrasas to celebrate Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic,"Inbound VP Venkaiah Naidu has disagreed with outbound VP Hamid Ansari over “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” creeping in among the minorities in India. Naidu says this kind of talk is just political propaganda. He says “compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due.” Perhaps the disagreement is over what exactly is “their due”. Selective food bans, anti-conversion and ghar wapsi crusades, vigilantism and ‘beef’ lynchings?

Priti Gandhi, national executive member of the BJP Mahila Morcha, has a more aggressive challenge for Ansari: “For 10 years my Hindu majority nation accepted you with open arms, placed you at the pinnacle of power and you still feel uneasy. Agenda kya hai?” Perhaps the agenda is educating the “Hindu majority” about how its condescension is neither fair nor merited. How dare you expect minorities to act as supplicants or servile? Listen up your citizenship is not of a higher order.

In its very first year the Modi government had caused a great upset by declaring Christmas Day as Good Governance Day. This year it selected Good Friday as Digital India Day. It’s true that India’s religious calendar is very crowded but it’s also true that Diwali hasn’t been declared Ujjwala Bharat Diwas for which maybe all schools and government offices could stay open. Holi also remains a holiday. The discrimination is manifest.

And now even Independence Day is being sullied. In Uttar Pradesh state-aided madrassas have been told to submit video footage of Independence Day functions to minority welfare officers in all districts of the state. Going back to Ansari’s point, surely this kind of blatant targeting is cause for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” among the minorities. The show of distrust can hardly engender trust.

BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has said with a tellingly raw crudeness, “At a time when the spectre of radical Islam is a threat to the community, Muslims should welcome the move rather than place religion over nation. Respect for national symbols is non-negotiable.” This is such a shamelessly majoritarian party line. Telling Muslims what they should feel (grateful). Setting “non-negotiable” conditions for their Indianness. And of course using the spectre of radical Islam to try to push the minority into a meek corner. But bullying someone into celebrating Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic. It kind of rubs in an absence of freedoms. And that is sound reason for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity”."
"EESL to procure 10,000 electric vehicles to replace government’s fleet, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Energy Efficiency Services Limited ( EESL ), a joint venture company of the ministry of power , has floated a tender to procure 10,000 electric sedan cars along with 4,000 electric vehicle chargers for replacing government vehicles.The ministry of new and renewable energy will be the nodal agency for the procurement of electric vehicles under the government’s faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles in India (FAME) scheme.“At the moment, the plan is for replacing government vehicles with e-vehicles and it will be open to any government agency. We could begin the process by November. Each car is estimated to cost around Rs 12 lakh while a charger would cost around Rs 2 lakh each,” Saurabh Kumar , Managing Director, EESL told ETEnergyworld.The government has estimated an expenditure of around Rs. 1,200 crore for the vehicles and Rs. 80 crore for the chargers.The tender, issued on Tuesday, seeks procurement of 3,000 AC (alternate current) or slow charger's and 1,000 DC (Direct Current) fast charger's compatible with Bharat AC-001 and DC-001 charger specifications.The tender is part of the government's plan to promote electric vehicles. The move is also set to give a boost to the government’s ambitious plans of moving to electric vehicles for all by 2030."
"Sher Bahadur Deuba: India to host Nepal PM next week amid China seeking to expand influence in region, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: India is set to host Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba later this month as part of efforts to step up engagement with the Himalayan nation at a time when China is seeking to increase its influence in the region including Bhutan Deuba is expected to begin his five-day visit to India on August 23, his first foreign trip after being elected the prime minister for the fourth time two months ago, according to people aware of the matter.That Dueba chose India as a destination for his maiden trip abroad reflects close nature of Indo-Nepal ties, they said, amid China’s relentless efforts to expand its sphere of political and economic influence in the landlocked Himalayan state including extension of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).A slew of India-assisted development and economic projects will figure high on the agenda during Deuba’s trip, said a Nepalese observer, who did not wish to be identified. These include finalisation of a joint detailed project report for the Pancheshwar Multipurpose project . The trip will provide Deuba, who signed the Indo-Nepal Mahakali Treaty in 1996, an opportunity to discuss with the Indian leadership implementation of the Pancheshwar project, the person said.According to reports Deuba is also likely to take up the issue of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes withdrawn by India in November 2016 as part of the demonetisation drive. As per a directive by the Reserve Bank of India, from January 2015 any Nepalese individual visiting India was allowed to have Rs 25,000 in denominations of 500 and 1,000.Other items on the agenda include Nepal’s hassle-free access to India’s power exchange market, implementation of energy bank proposal, additional cross-border power transmission lines; additional air routes from Janakpur, Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar; supply of defence hardware for Nepal Army and construction of an LPG pipeline from India to Nepal.This will be the third visit by a Nepalese PM to India in less than a year – unprecedented in the recent history of Indo-Nepal ties. Then PM Prachanda visited India in September last year, followed by another trip for the BRICS-BIMSTEC outreach meet in October.Proving critics wrong, Prachanda resurrected Indo-Nepal ties that had deteriorated under his predecessor KP Oli. He not only brought balance in Nepal’s policy towards India and China but also injected dynamism in India-Nepal ties. He gave impetus to the hitherto neglected area of power, with the result that India is now emerging as a key provider of electricity to its neighbour.The visit of Nepal’s President Vidya Bhandari earlier this year, after then President Pranab Mukherjee ’s visit to Nepal last year, was yet another milestone in bilateral partnership. There have been more than 30 official and ministerial level engagements since Mukherjee’s visit to Nepal in November last year."
"Today online medicine market is growing at an exponential rate: Deepak Tomar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, CEO,, Gurgaon, India, talks on how the online pharmacy is catering to the medicine requirements of the retailers, wholesalers and people in an easier and safer way. Edited excerpts:The concept of online medicines started around 4 to 5 years ago. At that time some companies came up with a concept where a user can upload their prescription and medicines are delivered at the doorstep. The prescription however needs to be vetted by a pharmacist physically or online in order to be considered. This concept is getting a lot of support from the government of India as well. Couple of years ago, there was no provision of online pharmacy licensing. Now the government of India has allowed online pharmacy licenses in few of the states, where online orders can be taken in and the medicines can be home delivered. This online medicine market is growing at an exponential rate and currently the number of online medicine orders range somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 a day.Another company that I own, Clavex has its headquarters in San Jose, California with offices in Sydney, Australia & Gurgaon, India. It was while working on Clavex, that we got an opportunity to work with a number of pharmacies in Australia and New Zealand, health research companies in US & UK and some of the health care providers through them. It was due to an intense interaction with them, that we gained a deeper understanding of the health care industry and how the industry works. After this, I returned to India and interacted with the big names in the pharmaceutical industry in order to understand the trends and future scope of the industry in the country. After all, we know that the Indian retail economy is projected to expand to $1.1 trillion in a couple of years. There however aren’t many players who would be willing to cater to the health care sector. It is to fill this void that we came up with the concept of an all inclusive health care platform for India and see a great scope of expansion.It was two years ago that we came up with HeyCare. Most of the players in the field like Amazon, healthcart which are essentially e-commerce companies and 96% of the e-commerce companies are not into getting the pharmaceutical goods. Selling online in the smaller towns, cities, and villages is quite a challenge. Villages make up for about 50% GDP of the country and if we combine the tier 4, 5 cities and small towns with it, it accounts for 60 to 70% of the country’s GDP. The e-commerce companies are currently targeting only the 30-40% GDP of the tier 1, 2, and 3. What sets us apart from the rest of the industry is that we cover the whole country and have a clear segmentation of the country in place. The current model of e-commerce is definitely not the best suited one for it, which prompted us to come with inclusive e-commerce which essentially means e-commerce with assisted sale. The concept of assisted sale is assisting the retailers who are already selling in these villages. Currently the e-commerce companies are getting the products sent in by the retailers into their warehouses, and then send the orders to the consumers. The retailers are barely making any profits as they are also paying warehousing charges. This model is, hence rarely profitable. What needs to be done is to go hyper-local. You can send the medicines to the retailers and they can then take care of the logistics. This is the model that we are introducing with HeyCare and another parallel brand.HeyCare is a B2C platform for first world India that is the tier 1, 2, and 3 cities where users can come online, make an appointment with the doctor, upload the prescription and get the medicines delivered at home. In case there are any tests prescribed by the doctor, they can be booked with the diagnostics lab, and a representative would come collect your samples from home. The reports will be uploaded on the same application and accessed easily by the user. For kids especially there is a vaccination reminder feature and a pill reminder function, especially for the elderly. The money transactions are also pretty simple here which is managed by a special dedicated wallet within the application called Care Wallet. These are the features currently developed in the application.While interacting with numerous pharmaceutical companies, a common pain point came to light, that is distribution. The supply chain here is exceptionally long consisting of a country head, regional heads, then state heads and CNF, supervisors of distribution, distributors, wholesalers and then retailers. It is for this reason that the margin really thins out for each of these entities. HeyCare steps in here and offers a direct connection between these pharmaceutical companies and the retailers. HeyCare would provide a complete retail distribution channel thus fattening up the margins for both, the pharmaceutical companies and the retailers. This model also eliminates the fear of counterfeit medicines as these activities are rife at the super distributor and distributor level which is out of the companies’ control.The future of HeyCare in India is the development of a highly efficient retail distribution channel in the country which would then act as a third party distribution channel for its first world healthcare industry. Once the system for the first world India is regularized and implemented effectively, we intend to expand the channel across other industries as well. The biggest advantage here would be an efficient and common payment platform for the consumers, retailers and wholesalers which would ease up the transactions for everyone. It is pleasantly surprising that some of the bigger names of the pharma world are approaching us to sign on with us and eliminate the hassle of maintaining a physical retail distribution channel while opting for the online distribution channel with HeyCare. The model of companies like Micromax mobiles where they chose to go exclusively on sale with Flipkart is slowly being emulated in the pharma industries too. HeyCare has, in fact bagged quite a few contracts with the pharmaceutical companies that are partnering exclusively with us and we would be their exclusive online distributors."
iOS 11's Beta Version Has A 'Cop Lock' Feature That Lets You Quickly Deactivate Your Touch ID,"Apple seems to be paying attention to the rising instances of law enforcement agencies abusing their power in the US. The company is giving its users an old way to protect themselves. It is now adding a quick way to disable your Touch ID in iOS 11.

The new feature lets iPhone users tap the power button five times in quick succession to call emergency helplines. Take note, it doesn’t automatically dial for you. Instead, it brings up a quick menu where you can tap to dial, while also offering you the option to temporarily disable your Touch ID until you enter a passcode.

The new feature appeared in the latest beta version of iOS 11. Previously, you’d have to dive into your menu settings to disable our Touch ID. The new method is more discreet and faster to activate, both important points if you’re in a situation where you fear someone might try to force you to unlock your iPhone.

iOS 11 is a game-changer for Touch ID. Press power button rapidly 5 times and it opens the 2nd screen, but it also forces passphrase entry! pic.twitter.com/uvWbM04lyk — Kia‏☆ (@alt_kia) August 17, 2017

See, if law enforcement agencies suspect you of a crime (whether you’re guilty or not), you might be intimidated into handing over your phone whether that’s legal or not. But an officer can’t stop you from tapping your power button, something you can do quickly and quietly the second you sense trouble. You wouldn’t even have to think twice because there’s a simple password to reactivate it.

Of course, the feature is even more useful considering Apple is expected to debut its iPhone 8 with face scanning instead of a Touch ID. There’s no way to stop a police officer from holding your phone up to your face, so it’s probably better to just have a way to deactivate it.

Of course, this is also a decent tactic to keep nosy parents and relationship partners out of your phone. Unless they know the activation password of course."
"Selling LEDs at petrol pumps a major step in boosting oil companies’ non-fuel retail business: Pradhan, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government’s latest move to make LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances available for sale at petrol pumps will give a major fillip to oil companies ’ business arising from segments other than fuel retail, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.The retail fuel outlets of Oil Marketing Companies witness a total footfall of over 35 million every day. “In order to take advantage of this to enhance the non-fuel retail energy business, LED bulbs and other energy efficient appliances from EESL will be sold at ROs. The Ministry had recently taken the decision on daily pricing of fuel to prevent huge distortions in margins in the retail business. This step of selling LED bulbs will also help in the margins of retail outlets ,” Pradhan said.The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking an initial pact between the three OMCs – Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) – and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) under the power ministry for selling of LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances at over 55,000 pumps across the country.Pradhan urged EESL and OMCs to develop a viable business model for the retail outlets in the next six months. The oil companies will help in branding and marketing of the UJALA Scheme – the government’s flagship initiative to promote LED bulbs -- at all their retail outlets thereby making petrol pumps attractive to customers. “The RO dealers will directly conduct business with EESL and would get around 10 per cent margin,” Pradhan said.The OMCs have been tying up with other stakeholders, too, to develop their non-fuel retail business at retail outlets. A pilot launch of tie-up with Mother Dairy Safal outlets has been carried out in Bhubaneshwar in Odisha under which customers are expected to get fresh and quality vegetables and fruits at affordable rates at the petrol stations.BPCL has also entered into a tie-up with In & Out retail chain at their ROs. HPCL is also in the process of tying up with retail chains of the market to expand their business at ROs. Pradhan said the Janaushadhi Stores under the Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers will also be opened at ROs in the future.Apart from this, Common Service Centre (CSC) concept of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is also being explored to be brought to the petrol pumps. Under CSC, citizens will be able to avail many Government-to-Citizen and Business-to-Citizen services including PAN, E-Aadhaar Cards, utility bill Payments, banking solutions and Agri Services."
"NPPA may lose absolute power to fix drug prices under new policy, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government proposes to revamp the country’s drug pricing regulator, allowing it to set prices of only essential medicines.The latest draft proposals suggest amendments to the drug pricing policy and inducting advisory body of experts in a move to strengthen the regulatory body, but at the same time may take away its absolute power to fix drug prices in public interest.Last year, Niti Aayog , the health ministry and the Department of Pharmaceuticals ( DoP ) were engaged in discussions to dissolve NPPA in its current form and reallocate it within the department. This proposal did not materialise.NPPA presently functions as an autonomous body that regulates prices of medicines under the National List of Essential Medicines and also monitors the prices of those that are not on the list. DoP’s latest draft pharma policy suggested that NPPA can cap prices of only those drugs included in the NLEM. The NPPA should lay down and enforce price ceilings of “selected medicines” and ensure that “adequate quantities” of the drugs are available.“National List of Essential Medicines will remain the basis of the medicines to be brought under price regulation… the Department of Pharmaceuticals will prepare the list of medicines for price regulation and transmit them to the NPPA for fixing the price ceilings,” according to the latest draft of the pharmaceuticals policy, a copy of which ET has seen.Appeals against NPPA’s decisions will lie with the government, while appeals against the government’s decisions will be decided by the judiciary.“On pricing, it seems to propose broad changes to the functions and processes of NPPA. The draft appears to impose greater oversight on NPPA such as review of all its decisions, which could mean greater say over NPPA’s ability to cap prices in public interest also,” said Malini Aisola, a member of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a civil society group. Some groups said the proposals would dilute the powers of NPPA.The draft may encourage profiteering if implemented as it proposes to weaken the powers of NPPA, Swadeshi Jagran Manch national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan told ET. The Manch is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It said the proposed provisions and amendments shift several important decisions to the Central government.The draft policy, circulated for stakeholder views, suggests amending the drug pricing policy and inducting an advisory body of experts to strengthen the regulatory body. It seeks to improve access to affordable medicines, reduce dependence on other countries including China for raw material, improve manufacturing quality and create an ecosystem to support innovative new drugs.One recommendation is to reorient the Drug (Prices Control) Order, 2013, which NPPA currently follows for its pricing decisions, to shift focus from price control to monitoring of drug prices, their availability and accessibility.The Department of Pharmaceuticals will be able to direct usage of emergency powers under Para 19 of the DPCO to regulate prices of patented medicines that are not under compulsory licensing.NPPA used powers under Para 19 on Wednesday to slash prices of knee implants by up to 69%, citing “extraordinary circumstances” as the devices were not on the list of essential medicines and hadn’t been notified for price control.“Language of DPCO should be made more definitive. There should not be much scope for different interpretations,” according to the draft.Apart from civil society, industry and government representatives, the draft proposes that NPPA’s advisory body for pricing should consist of doctors, pharmacists and other experts. While NPPA won’t have to accept the recommendations of this body, it will be required to assign reasons in writing for modifying or rejecting them.Civil society groups such as AIDAN said they are studying the draft. “While on the one hand the draft has some positive initiatives to improve access to affordable medicines, in some instances it seems to push towards deregulation,” said Aisola.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch wrote to Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar on Wednesday, alleging that the Department of Pharmaceuticals is “working against” the stated objectives of the Prime Minister and the chemicals and fertilizers ministry."
Virat Kohli Is Still Ruling The Roost As He Continues To Be The No. 1 ODI Batsman In The World,"Virat Kohli continued to be the world's top-ranked batsman in the latest ICC ODI rankings.

ap

Having 873 points in his kitty, Kohli will have a chance to increase the 12-point lead over second-placed Australian David Warner at the upcoming five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting in Dambulla on Sunday.

Other Indian batsmen in the top-15 are former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (12th), Shikhar Dhawan (13th) and vice-captain Rohit Sharma (14th).

However, no Indian bowler figure in the top-10 list. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (13th) is the lone Indian in top 15.

As for the ICC ODI Team Rankings, India are currently at number three and they would have to win the upcoming series at least by a 4-1 margin to ensure that they stay at that position, ahead of England.

afp

At 114 points, India, even if win the series 3-2, will slip to 113 points and behind England on decimal points.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will be eyeing the chance to seal direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 during the upcoming series.

The 1996 World Champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a place in the pinnacle 50-over competition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies.

The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30. Sri Lanka are placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies team, which has an unenviable task in its aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain direct qualification.

The bottom four sides on the ICC ODI Team Rankings will need to play a qualifying event, also featuring the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League.

The top two teams from this event will get to play in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

Winning two matches will take Sri Lanka to 90 points, while the Windies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.

However, a 4-1 win for India will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and the Caribbean side could edge it on decimal points if they win all their upcoming six matches.

The West Indies side will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka lose 0-5 to India.

"P.D. Hinduja Hospital: Screening is not a viable tool for detecting cancer in India: Dr. Sachin Almel, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Consultant Medical Oncologist,, talks about the cancer scenario in India. Edited excerpts:Cancer is definitely becoming one of the major killers as far as the incidence and other things are concerned. But in India, it still remains second or third on the list as we have other diseases which are probably the major killers. Compared to the Western world, I think cancer still has not caught up as yet, though the incidence in our country is increasing.If you’re asking me about whether we have adequate facilities for the treatment, the answer is no, because majority of these so called good treatment facilities or treatment centers are restricted to only the urban cities or urban areas of our country. And you have to understand that majority of our population resides in small towns and villages where they probably are not able to avail these facilities. So as of today, I feel we still don’t have enough facilities to cater to this burden of cancer which is ever increasing.As far as India is concerned, compared to the Western population, yes, the cancer incidence is definitely increasing. It is not the same as it’s seen in the Western population, but we are catching up definitely. There is an important difference in the kind of cancers which are increasing in our country viz-a-viz the Western population. For example- in Western countries, breast cancer in women is supposedly the leading cancer. But if you consider our country, we still know that cancer of cervix is the leading cancer in women. If you take into account the urban cities, urban areas, there the breast cancer has over-taken cervix as the major cancer in women. Likewise, the highest number of men suffering from prostate cancer and the incidence is increasing in our country. The difference is that cancer of the prostate is not the leading cancer in our country. In our country, we still have cancers of the tongue, head and neck region which remain one of the major cancers in men.If you look at the urban centers, yes we have adequate facilities. All the people living in the cities are able to avail these facilities. I must also admit that the facilities which are offered in many of these centers are at par with what you get in any of the top hospitals in the Western world. But, the problem lies in the fact that majority of the population of India are based out of towns and villages and there, the facilities are definitely very inadequate. There are not many centers which cater to that group of patients, and therefore, if you look at it as a whole, the facilities in our country are not adequate as yet, but things are improving. Lot of these major NGO’s and major organizations like Tata Memorial Hospital, Gujarat Cancer Research Institutes have their outreach centers at various places which cater to these kind of populations which don’t have an easy access to medical facilities. The awareness regarding this disease has also increased. So that also adds to the fact that the incidence of cancer is increasing and more importantly diagnosing a cancer does not end the matter for us, we need to treat it and that’s where the challenge lies. We don’t have enough facilities to treat those cancers as yet.Screening has been a debatable issue all over the world. Few years back it was said that screening is mandatory. Then came a time when people started talking about whether it is really helping in bringing down the incidence, the cost-benefit ratio was talked about, the amount of money that you spend to screen a large population of patients and at the end of it you are diagnosing say only a minuscule number of cancers. Then it is not a viable option for many of the countries. If you apply that to our country I feel screening is not a good tool for our country, because the population that needs to be screened is huge, so there would be a lot of wastage of revenue and at the end of it, the number of cancers that may be diagnosed or may be caught, is not going to be enough to actually make a difference. Plus the other important thing is the screening strategies which have been the guidelines for screening all over the world. Screening has made a difference in diagnosing cases of breast cancer, like mamograph for breast cancer and pap smear for cervical cancer in women, and PSA with digital rectal examination and to some extend fecal occult blood. These are some of the tests which have been advocated or they have said that these are the ones which should be done if someone wants to adopt a screening programme. Whereas for various other cancers, there are not proper screening programmes available, and therefore also it is a big debate whether we as a country, a third world country, whether we should even think about this. More importantly, we would rather want to propagate the message that prevention of cancer would probably be a better idea, other than just screening the cancer. We need to increase the number of treatment centers and improve the facilities which could be made available to the common man.Hinduja was one of the pioneers which came up with a proper day care center for medical oncology and oncology as a sub-specialty many years back. In those days probably, cancer was considered to be a disease in which there were no patients who would survive and all patients used to succumb to the disease sooner or later. But things have changed over the last few years. Hinduja day care center was one of the first ones, dedicated only for those patients who were receiving chemotherapy in a very conducive kind of atmosphere. Hinduja took an initiative, we had a programme in which many of our nurses were sent abroad to get trained in a proper oncology day care center, medical oncology day care center abroad. We had a tie up with Mass General Hospital Massachusetts, General Hospital and Boston. Our hospital looks into developing this support group for the cancer patients.

Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev’s kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, “You (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.” Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki’s eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki’s eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, “You have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them”. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.“So you take this son back,”he told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‘any of these sons can be the cause of great trouble’. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama’s job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God’s representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies — lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion — but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki’s womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna’s appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose — of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon’s founder, insisted — as all the great acharyas also insisted — that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified. If you engage in these activities, you will further pollute yourself.We want to overcome these enemies; we do not want to give them strength.Every time you give in to meaningless rituals, you are giving the enemies within your mind, greater strength and longevity, and they will overcome you. Ultimately, Krishna killed Kamsa. He appeared in this world, directly, in his original personal transcendental form,5,000 years ago through his wonderful pastimes which are revealed in the Srimad Bhagvatam and the Puranas, through his teachings of Bhagwad Gita, through his holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna,Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India’s current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country’s stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers’ productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a “development” prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."
"Being in a Sports Club is Good for the Soul, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Vienna/Alpbach, 16 August 2017 : While so-called social networks are booming and Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp have millions of users in Austria, ""real"" social contacts are perceptibly declining. Together with the Austrian Federal Sports Organisation (BSO), scientists from MedUni Vienna's Division of Environmental Hygiene and Environmental Medicine headed up by Hans-Peter Hutter have now investigated the effect that being an active member of a sports club has on our health. Apart from the beneficial effect of regular exercise, the main finding of the meta-study is: active membership has a positive effect upon mental health . Hans-Peter Hutter will present the study this coming Tuesday (22 August, 16-17:30 hrs, Flora Hall) as part of a partner session at the European Forum Alpbach under the title ""The sports club as a health driver "".The main health impacts from the 1,685 reviewed papers on the subject of ""Sports Clubs and Health"" are as follows:* Being an active member of a sports club during adolescence helps to integrate a person into society ""and helps to stop young people from going down the wrong path,"" says Hutter.* Active membership of a sports club increases a young person’s self-confidence – ""especially in the case of girls"".* Active membership of a sports club has a beneficial effect upon well-being and mental health (e.g. vitality). Says Hutter: ""These effects are much greater than those resulting from individually organised sporting activities.""* Members of sports clubs are generally (more) content with their lives.* Being an active member of a sports club is fun and also provides socialisation. This in turn leads to more regular sporting activities.The beneficial health impacts of the social aspect of sports clubs were observed in all age groups and in both genders.According to the authors (Hans-Peter Hutter and Peter Wallner from MedUni Vienna, Anna Wanka from Vienna University; Christian Gormász, Anna-Maria Wiesner and Rainer Rößlhuber from BSO), medicine often underestimates social aspects and rarely mentions their positive impact upon health – and this equally applies to sport.Finally, recent studies have also indicated that an active social life is beneficial in the prevention of dementia. Says Hutter: ""Social contacts keep you vital, because you have to respond to your opposite number. This improves your cognitive abilities. Playing sport in a club has general psychosocial benefits – that is also a unique feature of a group activity.""Being in a Sports Club is Good for the Soul"
Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire,"COUNTY FOR ASHWIN

Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire

""It is a blessing in disguise for both Pujara and Ashwin because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year"" - MSK Prasad © Getty

Ravichandran Ashwin, the spearhead of the Indian attack, is set to play for the Division 2 County side Worcestershire for the rest of the Championship season. He is expected to make his County debut against Gloucestershire at New Road in Division Two on August 28. Australia fast bowler John Hastings, who represents Worcestershire in the County circuit, was ruled out of the remainder of the season with a foot injury, and Ashwin slots in as a replacement for him.

""Ravi is a fantastic international cricketer who is currently in terrific form with his game,"" Steve Rhodes, the County's Director of Cricket, said.

""He is ranked in the top three as a bowler in Test cricket, is a wonderful all-rounder who can bat six and scores hundreds in Test cricket.

""It is unlucky for John Hastings with his injury but Ravi is a wonderful cricketer for us to have at a crucial point in our season.

""It is a really important last few games for the club and to have someone of his ilk and class and quality is a huge boost for the Club. The good thing about Ravi is he has been successful on all types of pitches in all sorts of different continents. He is a class bowler who will bowl well here,"" Rhodes added.

The off-spinner, with 292 Test wickets to his name, hasn't yet played domestic cricket in England. However, the ace spinner has now received the green signal from the board to represent Worcestershire in County cricket after the selectors decided to rest him for the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

Worcestershire still have four Division 2 matches left during the County season. So the veteran all-rounder could miss out on the upcoming ODI series against Australia scheduled to start on September 17 as he looks to acclimatise to the English conditions ahead of the Test series against England next year.

Meanwhile, Chesteshwar Pujara is also set to return to the Second Division County side, Nottinghamshire. The middle-order batsman has already scored 232 runs at an average of 44.60 for the County side this season. After playing the first half of the season, he was called up for national duty for the just-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka.

Both Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire are eyeing a promotion to Division One. Nottinghamshire have 184 points from 10 matches and are placed at the top of the table. On the other hand, Worcestershire have slotted in at second position with 149 points. Worcestershire last played in Division One in 2015 when they were relegated after ending the season as the bottom-placed team with 151 points.

""It is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year,"" MSK Prasad, the chairman of selectors said.

""It is always good to play and get that first hand feel of the conditions. From a selection point of view they have been rested first and then they have been given consent by the BCCI to go and play county cricket,"" he added.

Ashwin, in all likelihood, will play against his Indian team-mate, Pujara, when the Midlands County take on Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on September 5. Worcestershire are also slated to play against Leicestershire and Durham.

Nawab of Pataudi sr. (33 matches), Kapil Dev and Zaheer Khan (16 matches) are some of the famous Indian cricketers who have played for Worcestershire. Zaheer, the wily seamer, had a successful time at Worcestershire, bagging 78 first-class wickets for the County.

There were also reports that experienced pacer Ishant Sharma too was to ply his trade in England, turning out for Warwickshire. The fast bowler, however, clarified on Twitter that he hasn't penned a contract with any County side. Warwickshire also have Jeetan Patel as their foreign player and were unlikely to sign up Ishant.

Contrary to the news rounds through various sites, have not signed Warwickshire or any other county. — Ishant Sharma (@ImIshant) August 14, 2017

According to AP report, Catalan police said they shot and killed five suspects in a seaside resort town south of Barcelona in response to a terrorist attack. They also said six civilians were injured in Cambrils but didn't immediately say how. The force is working on the theory that the Cambrils suspects are linked to the Barcelona attack, as well as to a Wednesday night explosion in the town of Alcanar in which one person was killed.

"Coalscam: CBI supplies docs to Jindal, other accused, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The CBI has informed a special court here that the copies of the charge sheet and all the other documents have been handed over to the accused, including Congress leader and industrialist Naveen Jindal, in a coal scam case.

The CBI told this to Special CBI Judge Bharat Parashar who had earlier taken strong objection to non-supply of the papers by the central probe agency. The judge posted the matter for further hearing on September 25.

The documents along with the supplementary charge sheet were filed against five accused persons who were granted bail on May 25 in the case pertaining to the allocation of Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block in Jharkhand.

Those granted the relief were Jindal Steel's adviser Anand Goel, Gurgaon-based Green Infra's Vice-President Siddharth Madra, Nihar Stocks Ltd Director BSN Suryanarayan, Mumbai-based KE International's Chief Financial Officer Rajeev Aggarwal and Mumbai's Essar Power Ltd Executive Vice-Chairman Sushil Kumar Maroo.

The names of these five persons were given by Suresh Singhal, a chartered accountant, who was chargesheeted by the CBI as accused in the case but had later turned an approver. The court had summoned the five persons as accused after taking cognisance of the supplementary charge sheet filed by the CBI on March 24.

Besides Jindal, the case also involves former Minister of State for Coal Dasari Narayan Rao and ex-Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda as accused.

CBI had alleged that Koda had favoured Jindal group firms -- Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and Gagan Sponge Iron Pvt Ltd (GSIPL) -- in allocation of Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block in Jharkhand.

All the accused have denied the allegations levelled against them and said there was no evidence to show that there was any conspiracy during the coal block allocation process.

The CBI recently filed another charge sheet against Jindal and five others, including Goel and Maroo, for allegedly cheating the government by misrepresenting facts to get the Madhya Pradesh based Urtan North coal block. They have been summoned as accused for September 4 in the case."

"‘DD breached constitutional boundaries. This is an attack on democracy, there is now an authoritarian system in India’","The Left Front has accused the central government of censorship, saying Doordarshan refused to broadcast the original version of Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar’s customary Independence Day speech in Agartala. DD has denied charges that it blocked coverage. It claims that its local station did broadcast Sarkar’s speech at 7pm on August 15. DD’s official note though did not refer to the original message that the Tripura CM recorded on August 12 – to be broadcast on August 15 – and later circulated by Tripura government’s information department. Manik Sarkar spoke to Rohit E David on the controversy, Centre-state relations and why he accuses the central government of censorship:

You have accused Doordarshan of breaching constitutional boundaries by refusing to broadcast your Independence Day speech in its original form? Do you see this as an insult to the office of the chief minister?

Yes, this is absolutely correct. They crossed constitutional boundaries. We live in a federal country. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi can address the people of the country, chief ministers can also do the same in their state. On Independence Day, they recorded the entire speech. Then suddenly, they asked us to reshape my speech. How dare they ask me to reshape my speech? They cannot dictate to me. This is an attack on democracy. This is thoroughly authoritarian.

This was not a regional function. It was a day when the nation’s introspection can be done. The central government is controlling everything. This is a very bad thing. They are not in a mood or position to tolerate any sort of dissent. What is this?

Doordarshan has certainly insulted the Tripura chief minister’s office. I have been elected by the people. I cannot suspend the Doordarshan and Prasar Bharati personnel in the state. Both the state-level organisations of the national broadcaster are being controlled by the national organisation. This sort of attitude is not acceptable at all.

What action are you planning to take in response to this action by Doordarshan?

I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on in India. According to me, action means to create awareness amongst the people about what has happened. I am doing exactly that.

In your official capacity, what has the state government done after this incident?

We have protested against my speech not being aired. I can’t say anything more at this moment.

Do you think this case reflects poorly on the cooperative federalism that PM Modi has spoken about?

Where is this cooperative federalism? Can anyone tell me in this country? Federalism means it is cooperative but that is not the case. The central government first removed the Planning Commission. When this organisation was there we had the scope of discussion between the Centre and state. Now, where do we go?

Everything has been transferred into the hands of Niti Aayog. Niti Aayog is only serving the agenda of corporates. What happened to National Development Council (NDC)? The fact is that not a single meeting of NDC has been called for by the central government. What has happened to the Inter-State Council? Why has there been only one meeting in the last three and a half years? In practice, there is nothing like the cooperative federalism that PM Modi has been talking about. There is now an authoritarian system in India.

But critics say you were talking about national political concerns in your speech rather than focusing on state-specific issues as chief minister.

Tripura is part and parcel of India. I was speaking at India’s national Independence Day. Without talking about national issues how can I deal with the state? This is an inseparable part of the country.

Are your saying that the individual freedoms of Indians are under constant attack under the present central government?

Today, minorities and Dalits are under attack. Their security has been shattered as never before. It is precisely these things that I had mentioned in the speech. If anyone opposes the government’s ideas, they will block it. This is not right.

India is a big country. We have our tradition. The people of India cannot be fooled or be bullied. I have full confidence in them. When the time comes they will take a stand, turn around and face any issue."
How to kiss so that it leads to sex,"A kiss works as a precursor to sex. A hot, steamy, make-your-knees-weak, make-you-dissolve-like-Klimt’s-famed-The Kiss-painting kiss is the precursor to some oh-my-gawd-there-there-there-ooooooooooh kind of sex.

Without tantalising you further, here’s how to kiss so that he knows there’s going to be some seriously sizzling sex coming up next:



Be the initiator: There is nothing that turns a guy on more than a woman who takes control and has her way with him. Initiate the kiss by pressing your lips onto his and making him respond to you. While your lips get busy, let your hands rove over his body. And moan. You’ll activate an arousal in milliseconds.



Open wide: Your goal is a long, wet French kiss, but tease him before you get there. Open your mouth gradually. Get him hot and bothered before you open wide and let his tongue in. Sit in his lap in cowgirl position, so you’re on top of him and he’s at your mercy. Kiss his lower lip and move to his upper before opening your mouth and letting your tongue meet his more-than-eager one.



Be aggressive (with your tongue): Let your tongue be in the thick of the action. Do all the talking by slipping it into his mouth and letting it roll over his, clockwise, then counter-clockwise. Play tongue hockey and tease him by withdrawing and starting over. Nibble on his lip, preferably the juicier, thicker one, before you slip your tongue in again. By now, all his signals will be green and he’ll be raring to have rip-your-clothes-off, all-night-long sex.

Sarahah For Good: How A Chennai NGO Is Using The App To Raise Awareness On Child Sexual Abuse,"If you don't know what Sarahah is by now, we hope the rock you were living under will get an Internet connection soon. It's the latest social media fad that has captured everyone's imagination, which lets you post anonymous comments about the person's profile.

But here's the story of a small Chennai-based NGO that's using Sarahah's anonymity to drive awareness on child sexual abuse.

savethesmiles.sarahah.com is the page where organizers of the campaign are encouraging people to ask their child sexual abuse (CSA) related questions anonymously.

""We are working on this issue for almost a year, reaching out to every stakeholder for free awareness session,"" said Mr Sandhiyan Thilagavathy, founder of AWARE, the Chennai-based NGO which is running Mission Save The Smiles. Just to break the silence and ignorance among the people around this issue, Mr Thilagavathy and his team wanted to spread awareness on all available online platforms so as to reach more people.

REUTERS

And Sarahah seems to be the best medium to reach millennials and young people, seeing how popular it is among that audience right now. After using Sarahah for a week, ""Our entire team got the conviction that this platform can be very well used for learning and talking more about CSA,"" said Mr Thilagavathy.

""We understood that people hesitate to talk about it in open platforms and in person. Sarahah has an advantage of posting one’s query and experience anonymously and hence our team saw it as an excellent tool to initiate dialogue with silent survivors and vigilantes.""

While SaveTheSmiles was started as a movement to educate and empower children, parents and adults on prevention of child sexual abuse back on 19th of Nov, 2016 -- World Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse -- the Sarahah page was only launched on 15th of Aug, 2017.

SaveTheSmiles workshop underway at Madras Literary Society on July 1, 2017.

According to Mr Thilagavathy, the Sarahah page has received adequate response so far, with people asking questions around the topic of CSA without any restrictions, due to Sarahah's anonymity feature. Some of the comments the page has received are as follows:

""Hello.. First of all kudos to this idea.. My question is from when can we educate our children about good touch and bad touch and how do we go about it""

""I have details of pedophiles, I want them to be punished but I do not have the evidence, what to do?""

""If I give you details of a pervert, will you take action?""

Technology tools are playing an important role to fulfill SaveTheSmiles's mission in creating online awareness around CSA and engage in a candid conversation with online users. Mr Thilagavathy told us that his team of volunteers ""are already doing similar awareness through WhatsApp and Facebook where our subscribers will receive daily bytes on CSA content and ways to teach that topic to their kids.""

Mission #SaveTheSmiles team conducts awareness sessions on-the-ground to educate and empower people about CSA, by conducting workshops for children, teachers and volunteers, equipping and enabling them to understand the prevalence of CSA, and tips on how to prevent, process, report and handle cases. The team of volunteers learns a lot in the process, too.

""We seriously work on the feedback that we receive post our workshops and trainings,"" said Mr Thilagavathy. ""Positive feedback motivates us, while the negative ones push us more to improve our content. Through online campaign and awareness, the success stories that we have received from parents and teachers are the real motivation that boosts the team to do more.""

"Injectable tissue patch may help repair damaged heart, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The flexible tissue scaffold, shown here emerging from a glass pipette with a tip one millimetre wide, unfolds itself after injection into the body. (photo by Miles Montgomery and Rick Lu)

Toronto: Scientists have developed an injectable tissue bandage smaller than a postage stamp that can repair damaged hearts.

Repairing heart tissue destroyed by a heart attack or medical condition with regenerative cells or tissues usually requires invasive open-heart surgery.

Researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada have developed a technique that lets them use a small needle to inject a repair patch, without the need to open up the chest cavity.

The AngioChip is a tiny patch of heart tissue with its own blood vessels and heart cells beating with a regular rhythm.

""If an implant requires open-heart surgery, it's not going to be widely available to patients,"" said Milica Radisic from University of Toronto.

She said that after a heart attack, the heart's function is reduced so much that invasive procedures like open-heart surgery usually pose more risks than potential benefits.

Miles Montgomery, a PhD candidate in Radisic's lab, has spent nearly three years developing a patch that could be injected, rather than implanted.

Researchers found a design that matched the mechanical properties of the target tissue, and had the required shape- memory behaviour: as it emerges from the needle, the patch unfolds itself into a bandage-like shape.

""The shape-memory effect is based on physical properties, not chemical ones,"" said Radisic.

This means that the unfolding process does not require additional injections and would not be affected by the local conditions within the body.

The next step was to seed the patch with real heart cells. After letting them grow for a few days, they injected the patch into rats and pigs.

Not only does the injected patch unfold to nearly the same size as a patch implanted by more invasive methods, the heart cells survive the procedure well.

Over time, the scaffold will naturally break down, leaving behind the new tissue."

"GST: Piyush Goyal rules out review of 5 per cent GST on solar equipment, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","MUMBAI: Amidst reports that there is still lack of clarity on the 5 per cent goods and services tax (GST) levy on solar equipment, Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal has reiterated that there is no ambiguity as the government is very clear on the issue.

""There is no question of ambiguity on this. It has been made very clear that 5 per cent GST will be applicable on solar equipment. If they (equipment makers) still have issues with it, it is very sad and we cannot do anything,"" Goyal, who was in the megapolis, told over the weekend.

The industry has claimed that though the government has said GST would be applied to solar modules at a concessional rate of 5 per cent, there is still no clarity on whether it will be extended to other equipment as well.

""The Goods and Services Tax was introduced to bring in more clarity and transparency in the system. I think our stand is very clear in this,"" he said.

Goyal further said the ambitious plan of increasing solar capacity to 100 GW by 2020 and promoting solar products would boost small and medium enterprises.

""We have set a target of 40,000 MW of rooftop solar capacity by 2022. Small and medium enterprises can take active participation in this. Apart from this, there is scope in sectors like solar pumps, solar streetlights and energy- efficient systems among others,"" the minister said, adding ""the country is moving from a job-seeking to job-creating economy""."

Sangram Singh Launches A Wrestling Championship As He Too Looks To Make A Comeback On The Mat,"In a bid to promote and provide a platform for aspiring wrestlers from Tier 2 and Tier 3 Indian cities, wrestler Sangram Singh launched the KD Jadhav Memorial Kushti Championship in the national capital on August 18.

ap

The one-day event is slated to be held on September 15 at the Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi and will feature five bouts including Sangram headlining the championship, which is also being promoted as a tribute to independent India's first ever individual Olympic medallist KD Jadhav.

""When I read about KD Jadhav, I found out that he devoted his entire to the sport but eventually ended up living his life in anonymity. He didn't even get pension. So, I thought of doing something for the upcoming crop of younger generation of wrestlers. Every aspiring wrestler, particularly from the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, should get a platform to showcase their talent and further their respective careers,"" Sangram said during the event.

ap

Sangram, a former wrestler, is himself making a comeback to the mat and hopes that his initiative will help change the face of wrestling in India. The 32-year-old managed to pull off a star-studded event which was attended by India's lone individual Olympic gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra, Commonwealth gold medallist boxer Akhil Kumar and Olympian boxer Jitender Kumar.

Speaking at the occasion, Bindra said: ""I am delighted to see that a championship is being held as a tribute to KD Jadhav who holds an important and special place in our Olympic history. We shouldn't forget him and he should get the due for the services he did for the country. I must compliment Sangram for his efforts.""

Bindra, who is part of PM Narendra Modi's Olympic Task Force which has been put in place to prepare action plan for the next three Olympics, called for more opportunities to be given to athletes within the country to ensure a sustained career and increased level of completion. ""We must provide more and more opportunities for athletes at different levels. These things will help create an ecosystem for the athletes in India and we need more of such events and competitions in our country. We need to provide platforms for our athletes to help them prolong their careers. I think such initiatives are going to be very useful in that regard,"" he said.

ap

To make the event a success, the format has been tweaked to suit the TV audience. The wrestlers will grapple on a mat inside a ring in six rounds, each lasting three minutes. There will be a resting period of 45 seconds after each round.

While Sangram will take on American wrestler Kevin Radford in the main event, there are four under-cards - three men and one women. Upcoming wrestlers such as Yudhistir, Lubhanshu, Sherpal, Himanshu, Shravab, Pratik, Ekta and Akansha will be aiming to make an impression. The organisers have roped in DD Sports as the official broadcaster and claim that the event will also be telecast live in 25 other countries.

An award night for honouring Indian wrestlers has also been planned on the following day of the championship which Sangram claims is first of its kind in the country. ""We will be giving 10 awards to the wrestlers on September 16. Nine of them are for those who have brought laurels to the nation and one will be for lifetime achievement,"" Sangram said.

At the same time, these changes need to be seen in the context of India's current economic situation and its enormous endowments of coal, which is still a very cheap way of providing energy to hundreds of millions who are still energy-deprived,"" he said at the 16th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture here organised by The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ).Noting that both coal and renewable sources should be the focus of power generation, Subramanian said that ""for India today, the social cost of renewables is higher than that of thermal power, and it is highly unlikely for the converse to be true, at least for some time"".""Over-expansion, fuelled by the growth optimism of the mid-2000s, combined with stresses in the discoms and slowdown in the economy has led to a plummeting plant load factors, declining profitability, the spectre of large amounts of stranded power assets, and consequentially stranded coal assets as well.""All this can have a detrimental effect on the health of the banking sector, especially the public sector banks, in the country, which in turn can adversely impact the health of the Indian economy, already afflicted by the 'twin balance sheet' challenge,"" the CEA said.The declining viability of thermal power plants and the rising NPAs of state-run banks, which have lent to power companies ""seems a double whammy for the government,"" he said.For India, which is struggling to provide basic electricity to about 25 per cent of its population, coal will provide about 60 per cent of the country's power needs until 2030, he addedIndia's total renewable generation capacity has crossed 57 gigawatts (GW), with an increase of 24.5 per cent being registered in the last fiscal year.

Racism? Not just a black and white issue,"In the early 1960s in Washington DC, my parents were on the lookout for a better house. So my mother put an ad in the classifieds, listing requirements for “a diplomat and his family” and asking potential landlords to ring “Mrs Ray”. One gentleman who called was polite, pleasant and appeared to have the perfect home for them. Then came the rider. “How dark is the diplomat?” he asked politely and my mother hung up.

Many, many, years later, a childhood friend married a Norwegian, settled there and had a son. Her marriage didn’t last but Norway is her home now and she loves it. Given that Scandinavia always scores so highly on all the parameters we look for in terms of liveability, I asked if she ever felt that the indigenous Norwegians are racist. “Some of them are,” she said after much reflection. “But they are polite about it.”

“Polite racism” is an intriguing concept. We tend to think of it in terms of violent deeds, whether in South Delhi (against Africans) or in Charlottesville (against African-Americans and Jews). In my friend’s case it came in the form of a query like, “How did your son like going back home to India?” “Back home?” she recounted to me with some indignation. “Just because he is half Indian? He’s born and bred in Norway!”

Racism, evidently, is not as black-and-white an issue as some believe it to be. It is complicated and confusing. For instance, the white supremacists who gathered in Charlottesville last week definitely hate the African-Americans who rallied to counter them. But they are no fans of their florid President either as he has “let” his daughter marry a Jew. They probably regard him as a bigger traitor than David Bowie. Not polite, these racists.

David Bowie. Not polite, these racists. Indians can be pretty nastily racist too as recent incidents have proved. But are we politely (nicely?) racist too? More by omission than commission. While many desi families now happily have white and even east Asian members – a change from say a century ago when every other race and even region was regarded with distaste – how many Indians have dated or married people of African descent? Until very recently, all too few.

Neena Gupta’s relationship with Vivian Richards became a byword precisely because it was so rare ditto Anjoo Mahendru’s reported fling with Gary Sobers. But actress and cookery queen Madhur Jaffrey is the actual “pioneer” – if the word can be used in this context – of this kind of interracial marriage. She married the African-American classical violinist Sanford Allen nearly 50 years ago, after her divorce from Saeed Jaffrey.

It is interesting to note that despite Indians living in various African nations for many generations have remained mostly as ethnically homogenous as the other races. And a recent report on inter-racial marriages in South Africa reveals that still only 5% of “Asians and Indians” are likely to marry outside their race, and whites even less. What percentage of ‘rebels’ actually marry those of African descent is, unfortunately, not stated.

The video circulating about the Charlottesville rally also revealed one unusual fact: as the two antagonistic crowds faced off, shouting slogans and waving fists, there were no Indian or south east Asian faces to be seen. It seemed a throwback to the much less inclusive and racially diverse USA of the 1960s that my parents and brother saw. It does seem as if we Asians are still not clear about where we stand on the race issue.

Communities of single ethnicities are often not well disposed to other races or appearances. Significantly, those of African descent – in Africa or elsewhere are no exception either, as the marriage of Botswana’s first president, Sir Seretse Khama to the Englishwoman Ruth Williams in 1948 demonstrated. Not only did her father throw her out, his uncle apparently declared “If he brings his white wife here, I will fight him to the death.”

But nearly 70 years after Sir Seretse and Ruth’s wedding, Africans married to Indians today also mention family displeasure on both sides. Indian families whose sons and daughters have spouses/partners of African ethnicity take time to adjust—especially given the light skin hang-up that still plagues us –though most are not outright rude. And it’s the same on the African side, as recounted by Indian spouses. Polite racism?"
Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."

"ONGC: ONGC-GSPC buyout will help us develop high pressure, high temperature blocks: AK Srinivasan, ONGC, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In interview with ET Now,, speaks about ONGC's GSPC buyout and what this means for the ONGC's business going forward. Edited excerpts:This deal,in which we have acquired is 80% of the PI in the block of DDW, will enable us to produce gas from the block. Along with that and these facilities which we have taken will enable us to develop high pressure, high temperature blocks which we also have in our company's kitty. This will be a very good synergy for us to develop the gas fields which are with us on high pressure, high temperature.This block is already producing. Three wells have been been drilled earlier. The fourth well is under production and is producing gas, around 3 lakh cubic meters. The fifth well is being designed to do a hydrovac and drill. The entire activity is on. This block has to be drilled for about 30 wells by 2028-2029.It is about one TCF and we could recover out of this.It is very difficult at this point of time to answer because there are a lot of other discoveries in this particular block and only when we carry out lot of exploration in that zone that the entire potential can be assessed by us. As of now the only production is happening from one of the discoveries. Three wells were already there, fourth well is under production, the fifth is likely to be completed during the year and as we go along we have to drill more wells to complete the blocks. Apart from that, other discoveries in that particular block wherein we need to explore, do appraisals - it will take some time."

Simi Garewal Royally Roasted KJo On Twitter After He Tried Replacing Her As An Award Show Host,"Actress Simi Garewal's TV show Rendezvous was one of the most loved shows of the early 2000s and 1990s and then came KJo. KJo conquered the small screen space with Koffee With Karan and what the world didn't see coming was animosity between them.

While there was no direct rivalry between both, what happened recently proves that things didn't go down too well with Simi.

Both the chat show hosts were present at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne in Australia albeit in different capacities.

KJo was present to host a masterclass on 'How to direct a big Bollywood dream,' Simi was invited to host the awards ceremony that took place towards the end. However, as soon as the festival concluded, Simi overheard KJo talking to IFFM's festival director about wanting to host the awards in 2018.

This clearly irked and rubbed Simi the wrong way and she took KJo's case by calling it another 'take over.'

After I finished hosting IFFM Awards @karanjohar told Festival Director 'Next year I want to host the awards'! Another takeover?!🙄 — Simi Garewal (@Simi_Garewal) August 15, 2017

And in no way was it a pleasant tweet because when Twitter started reacting, Simi retweeted all the tweets that favored her.

This is a kind of Mafia taking over. — Raj (@Sonak_Rajesh) August 15, 2017

"Poland's JSW will analyse whether to pay out dividend in 2018 -CEO, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","WARSAW: Poland's state-run coking coal producer JSW will analyse the possibility of a dividend payout on this year's results in 2018, Daniel Ozon, JSW's interim chief executive officer, told a conference call on Friday.

""Next year, if the possibility arises, we will of course analyse (dividend payout). It is possible, but it needs an agreement with bondholders,"" Ozon said.

Under an agreement with the firm's bondholders as long as the bonds are not repaid, the firm could recommend a dividend payout if bondholders approve it or if a specific (current and projected) debt coverage ratio is met.

Ozon said the company may repay some debt this year, but the repayments will depend on the company's cash flow and forecast prices.

JSW reported late on Thursday first-half net profit of 1.43 billion zlotys, beating forecasts.

JSW, which nearly collapsed in 2015 following a slump in coking coal prices, is expected by some analysts to report a net profit of almost 3 billion zlotys this year as coal prices rebounded and JSW cut costs.

Ozon said the firm will present its new strategy late-September or early October.

The pacts were signed in the presence of power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal here.As per the PPAs signed, Mytrah Energy, Inox Wind and Ostro Kutch Wind would supply power of capacity 250 MW each. Further, Green Infra would supply 249.9 MW and Adani Green Energy 50 MW from their wind power projects through inter-state transmission system at a tariff of Rs 3.46 per unit discovered through open and transparent competitive bidding process,” the ministry of New and Renewable Energy MNRE ) said in a statement.""For the first tender, a tariff of Rs 3.46 per unit is great news. Feed-in tariffs can be good for initial hand-holding period and we can look ahead now. I have been told that for the second tender we have already received bids of about 2,800 MW,"" Piyush Goyal said.For these projects, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) conducted e-reverse auction on in February this year and issued Letter of Award (LoA) to successful wind power developers in April. The wind power projects under first wind auction are likely to be commissioned by September 2018.""As of today, we have 32.5 GW of installed wind capacity which amounts to only 10 percent of the total potential wind capacity. Earlier, transmitting wind energy from wind to non-wind states was a major challenge which prompted us to revise the wind policy. We are also planning to hold stakeholders sessions in order to address the challenges in the wind energy sector. The minister has asked us to come up with bids every month,"" MNRE Secretary Anand Kumar said. PTC India has tied-up this wind power for sale to power distribution utilities of various states.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers,"By Neeraj Kaushal

Steve Jobs, it is said, advised President Barack Obama that colleges in the US should staple green cards to the diplomas of graduating foreigners. Bill Gates made a similar recommendation in an article in The New York Times sometime back. Alas, President Donald Trump is unlikely to heed their advice. But the Indian government should.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges. India is more deficient in skilled workers, relative to its needs, than almost any major country. The most recent Manpower Talent Shortage Survey reported that almost two-thirds of Indian employers surveyed experienced difficulties in finding workers with required skills.

Expat’s Got Talent

The only other country where employers reported greater difficulties in finding required skills was Japan whose working-age population has been shrinking for a quarter century. Meanwhile, India is awaiting a demographic dividend, which requires substantial investments in education and training.

Let immigration policy not be an obstacle in attracting talent. It is likely that the welcome mat to foreign students will not immediately attract many from East Asia, Southeast Asia or Latin America. Our neighbours —Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka —will be the most immediate source of talent. We should offer to give residency permits to graduating foreign students and skilled workers, including those from South Asia.

For security reasons, Pakistani students may have to be kept out. But we have the potential to make India a highly attractive place of learning and work to the most talented students from Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Initiatives to proactively recruit the best PhDs, Indian or foreign, in Indian universities would make them more attractive to foreign students.

We get a large number of African students, who prefer India to the US or Europe. They find Indian universities academically strong without being prohibitively expensive. But they face racism and discrimination simply account of the colour of their skin. The best of Africa are as good as the best of anywhere in the world. We have the potential to attract the best from Africa, train them for Indian needs, offer them permanent residency and a path to citizenship.

In western countries, a substantial proportion of scientists and skilled professionals are foreign-born. Switzerland tops the list with 57% of the scientists, working and studying, in the country being foreigners, according to the GlobSci Survey of 2011. The corresponding figure is 46% in Canada, 45% in Australia, 38% in the US, 33% in Britain, 23% in Germany, and 17% in France. The proportion of foreign scientists working or studying in India, in comparison, is negligible: less than 1%.

Critics would argue that liberal immigration of foreign talent would adversely affect Indian skilled workers. In 2000, similar sentiments sent domestic politics in Germany on fire with the ‘Kinder statt Inder’ (Children not Indians) slogan in response to the government’s policy to allow foreign-born computer specialists. Talent shortages continued, and five years later, the German government announced an even more liberal immigration policy.

Critics might also say that India has its own millions to educate. Why should it use its resources on foreigners? International scientists, professionals and entrepreneurs make the rich world rich. If India wants to get rich, it needs to create policies and build institutions that attract foreign talent to supplement its skill requirements. China also has its millions to educate. But it has recognised the importance of mobile foreign talent.

Going for the Skill

Its leaders openly acknowledge that the biggest obstacle to future growth in China is talent. For this reason, it has been aggressively wooing foreign talent and sending its own youth to acquire state-of-the art skills abroad. In 2008, the Chinese government announced the ‘thousand-talents’ programme.

Highly talented research scientists and entrepreneurs are lured to this programme from around the world. It has launched a China Green Card, a permit for permanent residency, for certain groups of skilled foreigners and Chinese expats in Shanghai and Beijing.

The contribution of foreigners in raising innovative potential and economic prosperity is most visible in the US, where one of every five doctors is foreign-born, as are two of every five medical scientists, one of every five computer specialists, one of every six persons in engineering or science occupations, one of every four astronomers, physicists, chemical and material scientists, and one of every six biological scientists.

Since 1990, academics associated with US institutions and universities have won close to 65% of all Nobel prizes in chemistry, medicine, economics and physics. But less than half of the recipients were born in the US. Many European countries have been trying, rather unsuccessfully, to compete with the US for foreign talent. This is an opportune moment for these countries to roll out the welcome mat to foreign talent.

Foreign students who feel harassed by the US Department of Homeland Security could move to other countries with more liberal immigration regimes. India should join the race and offer easy residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges.

Such a progressive, growth-oriented immigration policy goes well with the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’ (the world is one family) laid out in the Upanishads.

KL Rahul could be the answer to Team India’s long-term No.4 riddle,"By Chetan Narula

In the last season or so, India’s ODI record has wavered. They played just eight at home, all in preparation for the 2017 Champions Trophy, winning 5-3 against New Zealand and England. For what it’s worth, they did finish runners-up in the quadrennial event. And whatever plans the team management charted for that tournament worked — barring Pakistan in the final, of course.

Yet they have to redraw the plans for the 2019 ODI World Cup and the team management has identified the wobbly No 4 spot as the weakest link. And with two years remaining, now is a good time to start working on it. “KL Rahul will bat at No 4 in the ODI series against Sri Lanka. He is too good a player to be left out of the playing eleven at this time,” said coach MSK Prasad this past week.

Rahul has climbed the charts very quickly in the last year or so, and has gained immense confidence from the dressing room in his abilities across formats. As such there are two ways to look at Prasad’s comments.

One, the Indian team has decided upon its opening combination for the near future. Rohit Sharma is steadfast at one end, while Shikhar Dhawan — with three international hundreds (and another four half-centuries across formats) since June — has bought himself more time.

And it is the continued inclusion of Ajinkya Rahane that confirms Rahul’s future batting spot. The latter had missed out on the New Zealand series last October due to a hamstring injury, and scored only 24 runs in three matches as he opened against England early this year. He was then unfit for the 2017 IPL and missed the Champions Trophy, both due to a shoulder injury. This resulted in Rahane being chosen as the back-up opener for the Champions Trophy.

Prasad was clear that Rahane would not be a middle-order choice as Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were picked. When Rahane opened in the Caribbean (as Rohit was rested), the debate was sealed — he is no longer seen as a No 4 option. Second, Rahane came into the ODI side as an opener and it was the same line of thought — that he was too good a player to be left out — by then-skipper MS Dhoni that saw him shunted up and down the batting order over the years. The result has been an unstable No 4.

There is no denying that Rahul has climbed the charts with great efficiency, and whilst doing so, has shown a sense of adventurism in his game. When he burst onto the scene in 2014-15, he was seen as a compact opener for Test cricket. Over the next year or so, he added various dimensions — mostly attacking stroke play — to his game. The result was easy to see in the 2016 IPL — he scored 397 runs in 12 innings at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 146.49.

The point is that he scored those runs batting in the middle-order and complementing the likes of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Rahul was afforded the opportunity to make his ODI debut thereafter and he scored 100*, 33 and 63* in his first three ODIs (albeit in Zimbabwe).

That was nearly 15 months ago, and much has changed since, including Rahul’s own improved ability to score runs.

There is no doubt that he merits a run in the ODI format and yet this move leaves room for doubt. Rahul moving down to No 4 will only be a repeat of the Rahane experiment.

It gives rise to further questions. How long will they persist with Rahul in the middle order if he is not successful? And what does this mean for Manish Pandey, who has been waiting for a way back into the ODI eleven since autumn last year?

It’s a coin toss for now. Heads, they win and Rahul solves India’s long-standing problems at the No 4 spot. Tails, they go back to the drawing board. At the least they have two years to figure it out."

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
"Climate change costs India $10 billion every year: Government, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: Extreme weather events are costing India $9-10 billion annually and climate change is projected to impact agricultural productivity with increasing severity from 2020 to the end of the century.In a recent submission to a parliamentary committee, the agriculture ministry said productivity decrease of major crops would be marginal in the next few years but could rise to as much as 10-40% by 2100 unless farming adapts to climate change-induced changes in weather.Wheat, rice, oilseeds, pulses, fruits and vegetables will see reduced yields over the years, forcing farmers to either adapt to challenges of climate change or face the risk of getting poorer. Adaptation will need different cropping patterns and suitable inputs to compensate yield fluctuations.The challenge is particularly urgent for Indian agriculture where productivity for crops like rice does not compare even with neighbours like China. The possibility of a further dip due to climate change will be particularly worrying as it could turn India into a major importer of oilseeds, pulses and even milk.By 2030, it may need 70 million tonnes more of foodgrains than the expected production in 2016-17.The economic survey, in its latest mid-year report, says ""estimates indicate that currently India incurs losses of about $ 9-10 billion annually due to extreme weather events. Of these, nearly 80% losses remain uninsured"". It pointed out that 2014 floods in Kashmir cost more than $ 15 billion and Cyclone Hudhud the same year cost $ 11 billion.The quantum of loss will increase substantially in future if one takes into account the impact of climate change on farm productivity.Extreme weather events are not always linked to climate change but research shows that their frequency and severity is increasing and this is being increasingly read as a fallout of climate change.The ministry, in its submission, noted that though most crops will see reduced production in a `business as usual' scenario, climate change may help improve yields of soyabean, chickpea, groundnut, coconut (in western coast) and potato (in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh). Potato production will, however, decline in rest of India, particularly in West Bengal and southern plateau region.The ministry also noted possible decrease in yields of certain crops in traditional sown areas but an increase elsewhere due to change in weather pattern.It also observed that increasing food demand due to an increasing population, expanding urbanisation and rising income may require India to depend on import if it does not act on time to increase production and productivity of major food crops, pulses, oilseeds and milk by adapting to climate change.""Vulnerability of Indian agriculture due to vagaries associated with climate change and low adaptation capacity of majority of Indian farmers poses risk to food security of the country"", said the Parliamentary Standing Committee on agriculture while referring to various submissions made before it by different ministries. The report of the panel was tabled in the Parliament during the Monsoon session.""If the country, which is more or less self-sufficient in foodgrain production, moves on with the business as usual approach, it will have to suffer a major loss due to rising temperature and uneven distribution of rainfall. If all the losses are compounded, India will be a major victim of climate change"", said an ICAR official, citing the projection made by the public sector agricultural research institution.The ICAR-National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research has projected food demand of 345 million tonnes (MT) by 2030 - almost 30% higher than in 2011. Referring to its projected demands for fruits, vegetables, milk, animal products (meat, eggs and fish), sugar and edible oil, the panel said the demand for these products by 2030 is estimated to be 2-3 times more than that in 2011.Though foodgrain production has increased from 259.29 MT in 2011-12 to 275.68 MT (estimated) in 2016-17, the country still needs to take multiple measures to match the projected demand of foodgrain by 2030."

"Coal, Latest Coal News, Energy News","More than 1,400 workers met in the mining hub of Singleton, New South Wales, about 200 km (125 miles) north of Sydney, this week and voted to continue industrial action that began in June against the Swiss-based company, according to a statement from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union."
"At last, India gets genuinely serious about companies flouting mining and environment laws","By Himangshu Watts

The landmark judgement of the Supreme Court imposing penalties of an estimated Rs 25,000 crore on illegal mining merits serious reading by the entire corporate sector, and not just by those who extract mineral wealth.

Two aspects of the verdict stand out. First, the verdict takes environmental law enforcement by the Centre and the highest judicial authority to anew high, which is a very strong deterrent against such practices in the future. This strong message will protect the environment and clean up the poisonous air in cities more effectively than some outrageous, controversial and ill-conceived steps taken by various authorities in recent years.

Second, the court has ordered heavy expenditure for the welfare of tribal people in affected areas. This reinforces the GoI’s declared strategy of targeting and extracting ill-gotten wealth to help the poor, whether by demonetisation of high-value currency notes, or with the goods and services tax (GST).

A crucial aspect of the court case that needs to be highlighted is the fact that the mines ministry, after Piyush Goyal took charge of its affairs, dramatically changed the relatively lenient position that the previous government had taken in the matter of companies violating green laws applicable to the sector. In doing this, GoI showed its determination to resist strong pressures.

Conventionally, mining was deemed illegal only if ores were extracted without a mining lease. Under the mining law, the penalty was equal to the entire output from such an operation. However, once the lease was obtained, even if the mining operation ravaged forests, made the air unbreathable and degraded the environment to make thousands of crores, the penalty under the environment law was a laughable Rs 50,000. This built a very strong business case to start mining without waiting for green clearances.

The government argued before the Supreme Court in January that extracting minerals without the necessary green clearance should be deemed illegal not just under the environmental law but also under the mining law that imposes back-breaking penalties for default. The Supreme Court has upheld this view.

It’s Mine, Not Yours

This means that even if you have a mining lease, any extraction without forest and environment clearance is illegal and the state must recover the value of the entire output from the defaulter.

Further, the court has ordered that the hefty penalty must be used very transparently for the development of tribal areas where the mines are located. It has ordered that the “very large amounts” that will flow to Odisha after the verdict must be kept in a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To ensure that the funds are used for the benefits of tribal people in affected areas, it has asked the state’s chief secretary to file an affidavit stating the work done and audited accounts of the SPV.

For those who think they can make millions without caring for the environment, the court did not mince words. It delivered the message in the first paragraph of the judgement, “Lessees… in Odisha have rapaciously mined iron ore and manganese ore, apparently destroyed the environment and forests and perhaps caused untold misery to the tribals in the area.” Some steps taken to help the local people, the court said, seemed “not more than a drop in the ocean —also too little, too late”.

The stern words from the highest judicial authority in the country are abreath of fresh air in the otherwise polluted approach toward green issues some authorities have demonstrated in recent years.

On top of the hall of shame is the Delhi government’s ill-conceived oddeven scheme that banned half the cars in the city on alternate days, but had no problems with smoky and noisy diesel generators or smoke-spewing, overloaded trucks.

Then there was the ban on 10-yearold diesel cars, which were sold in full compliance of the prevailing emission norms and a declaration to customers that these cars will be legally allowed for 15 years. It didn’t matter to the authorities that a newer car that is not properly maintained will pollute the air much more. Or that the actual emission is more important than the age.

The problem with such steps is that it creates mass public ill-will towards the noble cause of environmental protection simply because some authority has caused severe hardship with steps that scientists know wouldn’t clean the air. Such orders actually damage the environment because they make it difficult for political authorities to protect the environment when the common man thinks he is being short-changed.

Green and Bear It

In contrast, the Supreme Court’s latest verdict on mining, and GoI’s submission early this year, is a concrete step that will help the environment, even as some mining companies have genuine grievances.

The mining industry fears the verdict will disrupt business and that some mines may shut down. There are some legitimate grouses. It takes ages to get environmental clearances. Often, land is not available for compensatory afforestation. At times, clearances are not renewed even if there is no change in mining operations or output.

Legitimate concerns must be addressed. But for the crooks who ravage the environment, the message from the Supreme Court and the government is clear: if abiding by the law means shutting down your business, so be it."

"Pradhan meets Odisha CM Patnaik to resolve Paradip refinery tax issue, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today met Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here and discussed an ongoing tax issue between Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the nation’s largest fuel retailer, and the state government over the latter withdrawing tax incentives provided for setting up the Paradip refinery project in 2004.“Discussion happened in positive environment and both sides displayed the willingness to come to a mutually benefitting and agreeable solution,” Pradhan said in a tweet following the meet.The Odisha government had in February this year sent a notice to IOC stating it is withdrawing the promised 11-year tax deferment on payment of sales tax on Paradip refinery products sold in the state.The state government had originally offered the tax incentives to IOC and its then partner Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) in December 1998 to invest in setting up a refinery in the state. These investments were withdrawn in February 2000, leading to the company shelving the project.The state later restored the incentives and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IOC in February 2004 for providing a set of eight sops. The state government had reportedly withdrawn the tax incentives in ""public interest"", citing 6-year delay in commissioning of the project that was larger in capacity than originally planned 9 million tonne plant.IOC, however, pointed out the February 2004 MoU clearly allowed change in design, capacity and configuration of the project and that the Odisha government was informed about the change in capacity and the delay in construction caused by cyclone, land acquisition and law and order problems, according to a report.As per the MoU, IOC was to commission the refinery in 2009, but actually did it in November 2015 and the state government allowed IOC to avail of construction-related sops totalling Rs 550 crore all through the six years.The foundation stone of the Paradip refinery was originally laid by the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 2000."
"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don’t want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don’t interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that’s the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors’ well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."
"power sector: Loan sanctions have jumped 150 per cent in the first quarter: PV Ramesh, CMD, REC, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In a chat with ET Now, PV Rames, CMD of Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, talks about his company's margins. Edited excerpts: REC continues to maintain its robust growth momentum in terms of supporting the power sector development in this country. Our sanctions have increased by 150% in the first quarter year-on-year compared to the first quarter of last year. In terms of disbursement, we have grown 25% and our growth has come from all segments like distribution, transmission renewables. We are working towards realising the the goal of the government of providing assured, affordable and quality power for all in the shortest possible time. Coming to the margins, yes there has been a marginal decline in the margins. However,they continue to remain above 4% as far as NIM is concerned.t is one of the Lanco power projects. We have an overall exposure of about Rs 500 crore. but we are not the sole lenders. There are several other lenders. Our exposure as a proportion of the overall exposure is about 15%. We have made an appropriate provision as mandated by Reserve Bank of India and our gross NPA as proportion of our loan book is less than 2.6% and in net NPA it is sub 2%. Ours is a financial institution with a sole exposure to power sector which has the lowest NPAs among all the peers.Let me say categorically that we are grateful to the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We have carefully studied them and have taken note of those observations. It needs to be abundantly clarified that this is a joint report and pertains to our sister concern PFC. CAG has made pointed comments relating to REC and to PFC. In those observations that have been made, which have been erroneously in my view presented by some of the media outlets, says that we did not adhere to the RBI norms. But in the the same report CAG has stated that REC has adhered to the RBI norms."

Redefining party building: Amit Shah is leading BJP with courage of conviction,"On the evening of Narendra Modi’s swearing in as prime minister, Amit Shah was in the audience sitting next to a leader of a BJP ally. The alliance party leader informally enquired about Amit Shah’s chances of becoming party chief and said it would be a welcome development. Amit Shah politely remarked, tongue in cheek, that the latter’s joy may be short lived as in the event of his taking over, BJP may not part with so many seats. The ally leader was stumped by his candour.

Political scientist Rajni Kothari had famously defined what he termed the Congress system of party building. Pointing out the strength of Congress in the late seventies he rightly observed, “Congress is still, and is likely to be for a long time, the most organised political party in the country, with a nationwide following and considerable depth in the localities.” Ironically, today’s Congress seems to have squandered all that it had earned. And it is BJP that has emerged as the most organised party with pan-India following and presence in localities.

In fact, that rightly sums up the work of BJP chief Amit Shah. He has, through unrelenting efforts, converted the ‘nationwide following’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi into ‘considerable depth in the localities’. For any objective political analyst, Shah’s work presents a case study of party building.

When Shah took over in August 2014, BJP was in power in just a handful of states. Today, it has its own chief ministers in 13 states and is a partner in another five states. Its membership has increased from three crores to 11 crores. It has the largest number of MLAs and MPs as well. Even in Rajya Sabha, BJP is now the top party. To have achieved this in a span of barely three years is unparalleled and historic.

Through his presidency, Shah has ensured that party cadre remain engaged in one meaningful activity after the other. In the past two years BJP has conducted thousands of training programmes involving over ten lakh party workers. Many of these trained human resources are now engaged in grassroots party work as vistaraks, with their eyes set on party consolidation at the booth level. Over 4000 workers, dedicating six months to a year away from the cosy comforts of their homes, are engaged in this all over the country.

Shah believes in setting an example through his own untiring efforts. During the last few months, he has spent over 60 days undertaking systematic organisational tours to states across the country. On these tours he interacts with all functionaries, seeks feedback from booth level workers, meets all elected representatives, breaks bread with artists and writers, listens to social media enthusiasts and engages in question-answer sessions, thereby establishing a powerful connect.

Shah richly deserves credit for institutionalising party functioning. He has established an integrated chain of party meetings. Its national executive meets every quarter followed by state, district and taluka executives, ensuring a seamless flow of message from the top and feedback from the ground. Also, from Policy Research to Party Literature and Good Governance to Party Programmes, he has created 19 party departments with a clear functional mandate.

Besides, he is out to change the very culture of party mobilisation. He wants party workers to be sensitive to the agonies of the underprivileged and aspirations of all. In order to further sensitise party workers, he has also asked party units to undertake some ten projects, three of which have a clear social content.

What is remarkable is his clear vision. He understands very well the importance of groundswell of goodwill, public trust and support earned by Modi. He knows these are the best of times to build upon this capital. Setting up well equipped party offices at every district with a library and e-library, containing rich collection of books, is a key item on his agenda.

Felicitating Shah on his Rajya Sabha election, Modi pointed out that to galvanise party organisation when the party is in power is extremely difficult. But difficulties have never deterred Shah. In his view “electoral success is important, but remember we are not an election winning machine. We are a party with a mission, a mission of reconstructing a great India.”"
"Loss of smell could warn of Alzheimer’s disease, Health News, ET HealthWorld","TORONTO: People who are unable to distinguish between different smells, such as lemons and petrol, may be at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, a study warns.Damage to brain associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs up to 20 years before symptoms start showing.Scientists now believe that simple odour identification tests may help track the progression of the disease before symptoms actually appear, particularly among those at risk.""Despite all the research in the area, no effective treatment has yet been found for AD,"" said John Breitner from McGill University in Canada.""But, if we can delay the onset of symptoms by just five years, we should be able to reduce the prevalence and severity of these symptoms by more than 50 per cent,"" he said.Researchers asked about 300 people with an average age of 63, who were at risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and had a parent who suffered from the disease, to take multiple choice scratch-and-sniff tests to identify scents as varied as bubble gum, gasoline or the smell of a lemon.One hundred of them also volunteered to have regular lumbar punctures to measure the quantities of various AD- related proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Researchers found that participants with the most difficulty in identifying odours were those in whom other, purely biological indicators of AD, were most evident.""This is the first time that anyone has been able to show clearly that the loss of the ability to identify smells is correlated with biological markers indicating the advance of the disease,"" said Marie-Elyse Lafaille-Magnan, PhD student at McGill University.""For more than 30 years, scientists have been exploring the connection between memory loss and the difficulty that patients may have in identifying different odours,"" she said.""This makes sense because it is known that the olfactory bulb (involved with the sense of smell) and the entorhinal cortex (involved with memory and naming of odours) are among the first brain structures first to be affected by the disease,"" she added.The study was published in the journal Neurology"
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India’s high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM’s signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM’s housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India’s proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were “cashless”. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone’s case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government’s bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state’s chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‘Mob violence is unacceptable’ (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."
Home Minister Rajnath Singh Lauds Akshay Kumar For Extending His Support To Indian Soldiers,"Home Minister Rajnath Singh has lauded Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar’s support for the Indian Army. Singh on Wednesday took to Twitter to share a video of Akshay. The actor was seen appealing to his fans and well-wishers to help martyrs’ families in the video. “Akshay Kumarji your support to Bharat Ke Veer is commendable,” Singh said in the video-caption.

Twitter

In the over three-minutes long video Akshay said, “Friends yesterday we celebrated 70 years of our independence with great pride and honour. I want to ask you one thing -- did you celebrate the Independence Day along with people who fill you with pride and provide your security? Those who put their lives on the line to gift us this independence every year...”

Akshay Kumar ji your support to #BharatKeVeer is commendable. https://t.co/0hN47dcJQs — Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) August 16, 2017

The Rustom actor added, “Everyday in news we hear at some place or the other our soldiers have given up their lives just to protect us.”

Akshay also requested his fans and followers to contribute for the soldiers of the Indian Army. “Now it’s our turn to do something for them. This year our Home Ministry has launched a website through which you can directly donate money to the families of the martyrs -- bharatkeveer.gov.in,” he said.

Twitter

The National Award-winner said that the website has already collected more than Rs 10 crore. “Today, on August 16, the website has photographs and details of 114 soldiers. Yesterday... Rajnathji asked us to appeal that we all help the families of these martyrs. I request you all that in the next six months we have to help the families of these 114 soldiers and remove their photos from the website,” he said.

Akshay concluded by saying: “They are there that’s why we are here. Nothing is more important than respecting these bravehearts. So let’s do this together and make them proud of us. Jai Hind.”

"The real military truth: On Doklam, stop saying the Chicken’s Neck area is vulnerable: it isn’t","The Doklam confrontation is not over by any means, and no one can say how it will turn out. As the two sides reinforce their positions, the portents are not good. In the meantime, India needs to stop overplaying the vulnerability of the Chicken’s Neck, the narrow corridor between north and northeastern India.

Indian commentary has identified the Chicken’s Neck as the driving concern behind New Delhi’s insistence that it must stand firm in Doklam. The Chicken’s Neck area is the area between Bhutan, China, Nepal and Sikkim in the north and Bangladesh to the south. At its narrowest, between Bangladesh and Nepal it is 14-17 km wide. Beyond this, it is about 200 km by 60 km in area. The strategic argument is that China could use Doklam to thrust through the Chumbi Valley to sever northern from northeastern India.

This is an extremely dubious thesis. It is about as credible as arguing that the Siachen Glacier is vital to the security of Kashmir and northwestern India. For one thing, Indian forces in the Doklam-Sikkim sector are superior to their PLA counterparts, a point that Indian experts never tire of repeating. India clearly has the advantage of the heights, numbers, and logistics. If so, a Chinese breakthrough here is highly unlikely.

But assuming that the PLA does get past our defences, a thrust from Doklam or from the trijunction of Bhutan, China and India will have to traverse 100-130 km of Indian territory, with Indian forces all round. Note that the PLA will have to negotiate winding Indian roads on which there is no place to hide. It cannot get its men and equipment off the road, and Indian long-range artillery, rockets and attack aircraft will pick them off in a “turkey shoot”.

If the PLA gets to flatter land, it will be able to fan out. However, by the time it does this, Indian forces from both flanks will have massed. The Chinese may even be vulnerable in their rear, with the Indian army harrowing them from behind. Again, long-range artillery, rockets, and aircraft will have a field day.

Assuming that nevertheless Chinese forces make it to flatter ground and try to consolidate their positions, they will face an enormous logistical problem. Their supplies will have to come all the way from Tibet. In military parlance, India will have the “interior” supply lines which are much shorter while the Chinese will have the exterior lines going back to the Tibetan plateau. As a result, their logistics will be horribly exposed to Indian interdiction. The PLA forces in the Chicken’s Neck area will gradually be starved of supplies and will be destroyed or captured.

Another possibility is that the Chinese would try to take and hold this area with special forces that are parachuted behind Indian lines. Chinese special forces have grown and improved in capability over the past decade, but they are not much more than a short-operations force against paramilitary or insurgent opposition. Their ability to hold ground against regular military forces and expand their operations is extremely limited.

This then is the commonsense military truth. It is not clear why Indian analysts, including unnamed or retired military analysts, continue to propagate the myth that the Chicken’s Neck is vulnerable, but it does us no good to repeat this myth endlessly. Certainly, the PLA knows that a thrust here would be suicidal.

Having said that, there is one circumstance in which the Chicken’s Neck would be vulnerable: all-out war with China. In that case, India would be fighting desperately in many sectors, and it might not be able to defend the Chicken’s Neck sufficiently. If so, the Doklam road would be of little or no relevance since the entire border would be in flames and India’s military situation would be perilous across hundreds of kilometres."
NASA Predicts That A 4 Kilometer Wide Asteroid Will Zip Past Earth On 1 September,"Asteroids are whizzing past Earth all the time, though they don’t come too close to hitting us. NASA has now predicted another fly by the incident to occur next month, but it’s slightly different.

For one thing, the space agency is saying the rock that’ll hurtle past us is the largest near-Earth object (NEO) we’ve seen since we began tracking them 20 years ago.

Measuring 4.4 km across, asteroid Florence, as it’s called, is more than large enough to cause massive destruction, were it to hit Earth. Even the 20 m wide Chelyabinsk meteorite that made contact in 2013 wrought havoc, and any object larger than 1 km impacting Earth could cause a global extinction. And NASA has tracked over 880 such NEOs in our vicinity.

But, though asteroid Florence is about making its closest pass of Earth at a distance of 7 million km, the space agency there’s no chance of a collision anytime in the next 500 years.

“While many known asteroids have passed by closer to Earth than Florence will on September 1, all of those were estimated to be smaller,” says Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). “Florence is the largest asteroid to pass by our planet this close since the NASA program to detect and track near-Earth asteroids began.”

The rock will zip past our planet on September 1, and will be visible to small telescopes for a few nights from late August to early September.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."
"Johnson & Johnson announces partnership with CSIR-IMTECH to develop innovative new tuberculosis treatments, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi, August 16, 2017: Johnson & Johnson Private Limited today announced a new partnership with the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), part of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), to unlock the potential of Indian science and help accelerate the discovery of innovative new treatments for tuberculosis (TB).Under the Memorandum of Understanding, scientists from Johnson & Johnson’s global public health team will work closely with scientists from CSIR-IMTECH , based in Chandigarh, India, on a research and development program to explore potentially more effective, safer, all-oral treatment regimens to tackle multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), as well as new molecular entities to treat all TB patients.“We are united with India in our determination to make TB history,” said Paul Stoffels , M.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, who joined Dr Harsh Vardhan , Minister for Science and Technology, at an event in New Delhi, to announce the Memorandum of Understanding. “While we have made great advances in recent years with the approval of new TB medicines much more needs to be done. By bringing together some of India’s brightest minds with our scientists, we increase the potential to achieve major research breakthroughs that can lead to innovative new treatments for the millions of people in India and around the world who suffer from TB.”The new research program will capitalize on CSIR-IMTECH’s world-class expertise in microbial technology and research and the proven research and development capabilities of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies to strengthen the collective potential of our research efforts.“TB remains a significant challenge in India, killing approximately half a million-people in 2015 alone,” said Dr. Anil Koul , Director, CSIR-IMTECH. “The partnership we have announced today with Johnson & Johnson has the potential to accelerate our work in support of India’s National Strategic Plan, our accelerated action plan to End TB by 2025, and most importantly save lives.”Today’s announcement builds on nearly 20 years of TB research and development by Johnson & Johnson, which led to the approval of bedaquiline, the first new TB medicine in nearly 50 years, and adds to existing partnerships at central and state levels in India to increase awareness, diagnosis and care, and broaden access to bedaquiline."
"nuclear medicine: Besides newer isotopes, nuclear medicine is all set to revolutionize the diagnostics and therapeutic capabilities: Dr Mythri Shankar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Senior Consultant, Nuclear Medicine Department,, Bengaluru, talks about the role and advancements in PET-CT. Edited excerpts:PET-CT is a new hybrid imaging modality and is mainly used for the staging of head and neck cancer in particular, meaning how far the cancer has spread; looking at TNM staging, the entire T stage which is a tumour extent and the nodal involvement. Most common sites would be the lungs, the bones and PET-CT scans offer a one stop scan where we can image the entire body and check for increased focal or metabolic activity or glycolysis which indicates presence of tumour in those areas. It is also very good for restaging to assess how the patient has responded to that particular type of treatment. We look for fall in glycolytic activity which helps us assess the treatment response of a metabolic level be it partial or complete.Something that we are seeing or trying to explore in head and neck cancer is tumour volume estimation but there is a little bit more value addition that PET-CT could bring into the picture by estimating the tumour volume to be different than the CET estimated volume. It could allow us to cover more area of treatment or give lesser amount of radiation therefore preventing complication that could happen from radiation therapy.Thyroid cancers form a very important group of head and neck cancers and they are a little different when you compare them to other head and neck cancers. The point being they are excruciatingly iodine sensitive and they pick up iodine. We have a lot of scans in nuclear medicine which use iodine just like PET-CT to stage the extent of disease in the patient and that we have been using so far but now sometimes what we have seen is certain types of thyroid cancers differentiate. The differentiated types of thyroid cancer do not pick up iodine as well as some of the other common groups do. Here we need to still go ahead and check how far the cancer has spread and these cancers are not iodine avid. Such group of patients can benefit from what we call FDG PET scan which measures the glycolytic activity in the tumour cell and helps us stage and treat the patient better.Nuclear medicine is basically use of isotope within the human body, we use it both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, we can diagnoses using it in scans and we can use it in treating the patient. Radioiodine ablation has been the main stream of theranostics just like diagnostics where we use it for therapy. When we do a radioiodine ablation in thyroid cancer there is a also a concept where we use a recombinant TSH, where we use that to stimulate the uptake of the radioiodine therapy which we give and it allows us to makes the procedure faster. This is not new it has been there and more people are starting to use it. Except for the cost factor it is a great tool to have where we can use exogenous, recombinant TSH to stimulate the gland and also use radioiodine therapy in a better way.Futuristically, we are seeing a lot more nuclear medicine and PET-CT scan centres in India. Today we have close to 200 and just in Bangalore we have close to 10 combinations of nuclear medicines and PET-CT centres. We are seeing a lot of newer isotopes, lot of finer techniques with more targeted, diagnostics and therapeutic capabilities."

"Merck CEO quits Trump panel: Far-right clashes: Merck CEO quits Trump panel, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Kenneth Frazier the Chairman and CEO of pharmaceutical company Merck & Co (AP photo)

CHARLOTTESVILLE: US President Donald Trump faced renewed pressure on Monday to respond more forcefully to a violent white-nationalist rally in Virginia, after drawing a storm of criticism when he avoided explicit condemnation of far-right groups.In a strong rebuke to the president, the CEO of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms resigned from a business panel led by Trump. Merck & Co Inc CEO Kenneth Frazier cited a need for leadership countering bigotry .The president has been assailed by Republicans and Democrats alike over his handling of Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed when a man drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. James Alex Fields Jr, the driver, was denied bond on Monday .Trump met top law enforcement officials at the White House to discuss the issue.Critics said Trump waited too long to address the violence, and slammed him for stating when he did that “many sides“ were involved, rather than explicitly condemning white-supremacist marchers.Merck's Frazier, who is black, did not name Trump or criticise him directly in a statement posted on the drug company's Twitter account, but the rebuke was implicit. “America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy , which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,“ he said.Trump immediately hit back, but made no reference to Frazier's comments on values, instead revisiting a longstanding gripe about expensive medicines. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!“ Trump said in a Twitter post.In his comments on Saturday, Trump denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.“Authorities said Heyer, 32, was killed when Fields' car slammed into a crowd of antiracism activists confronting neo-Nazis and KKK sympathisers, capping a day of bloody street brawls between the two sides in the Virginia town.Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to defend the president in TV interviews on Monday in which he stressed the administration was taking a robust approach to investigations.The attack on counterprotesters “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism,“ Sessions said."

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
"diabetes: New diabetes drug reduces blood glucose by pushing it to urine: Dr Alvin C Powers, Health News, ET HealthWorld","New Delhi:, President of, was recently in India to co-inaugurate ‘ International Diabetes Update ’ 2017, which highlighted many advances in diabetes therapy and how to use these advances to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."

"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.“The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,” Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. “The only solution is our focus on improving execution.“India’s biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers’ pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma’s Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India’s pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun’s consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun’s profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun’s U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG’s blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.“Going forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters” as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. “The U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.”As prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company’s leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."

Falling in love once again at Kolkata’s Aanadi Cabin,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.

When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldn’t care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shiraz’s and the Nizam’s, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.

These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.

Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.

Let’s take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.

Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.

Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from ‘it is overrated’ to ‘the quality is not the same.’ Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, ‘its too touristy!’

Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.

At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.

I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a ‘story’. I’d been wanting to go there for a while but hadn’t been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.

It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, “can we chill a little bit more before the day starts?”.

We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.

The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.

As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.

Though the restaurant is called a ‘cabin’, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didn’t actually have cabins in the past. ‘Cabin’ refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared ‘cold drinks (sic)’ is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?

There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when ‘open kitchens’ were yet to be trendy.

The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of ‘distressed’ look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.

We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory ‘salad’, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.

Was the Moughlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?

To be honest, I don’t know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I haven’t had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.

What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture – neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.

What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?

A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.

The paratha at Anadi didn’t have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.

The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then weren’t around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.

The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.

My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.

Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.

Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.

We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniska’s wife, Manishita, who didn’t want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!

Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."
Planet of the Apps: We humans are so smart that we’ve made machines which are already outsmarting us 😜,"The bad news is that smart machines – collectively known as AI, Artificial Intelligence – are going to take over our lives and enslave us. The worse news is that this has already happened.

I try to send a text message on my mobile phone. When i key in my name, J-u-g, my phone changes it to J-i-g, or J-o-g, or H-u-g, or M-u-g. But never J-u-g. This is called a predictive dictionary, and is an inbuilt feature of the phone.

It predicts what it thinks you want to key in, and if you key in something different it automatically corrects the word to what it thinks it ought to be.

As my phone won’t let me sign off as Jug, should i change my name by deed poll to Jig, or Jog, or Hug? Or how about Mug? Which is exactly what i feel like for allowing my phone to dictate to me what my own name ought to be.

While the driverless car is yet to be mass produced, there is already a driver-less car. Driver-less in that you must obey its commands before you drive it.

You want to show off your new car to your neighbour. You switch on the engine to show him how cool the A/c and the console are. ‘Fasten your seat belt!’ ‘FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT!!’ An automotive Auntieji inside squawks at you louder and louder.

Fastening your seat belt is of course very necessary when you’re actually driving. But do you have to be made to feel like an idiot fastening your seat belt in a stationary car which you have no intention of driving? You do, if it’s a driver-less car.

There’s a gadget called a fitbit. You strap it on your wrist and it tells you how many steps you’ve walked/run and how many calories you’ve burnt.

Pretty soon you find your fitbit will give you a coronary by making you walk/run more and more. It’s called progressive training. It’s also called giving yourself a fit trying to become fit.

Thinking machines oughtn’t to be called Artificial Intelligence. Their intelligence isn’t artificial, it’s real. Our intelligence, for having invented them, is AI – Altu-faltu Intelligence."
