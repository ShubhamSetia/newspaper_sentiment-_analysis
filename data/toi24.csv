Why Siddaramaiah’s googly on Lingayats has put Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on a sticky wicket,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah’s combination of cultural nationalism and realpolitik has resulted in a disunited opposition at the national level. BJP seems to be on a new high after having tamed Bihar and Tamil Nadu to some extent. Yet there is one regional leader who has managed to keep the BJP’s nationalism at bay – Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.

Last Saturday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had exhorted the Lingayat and Veerashaiva community to set aside their differences and stay united in Karnataka. Lingayats form nearly 17% of the state’s electorate and have been BJP’s core vote-bank led by former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa. This should have had a sobering and uniting effect on both communities as per the prevailing mood at the national level. But Siddaramaiah’s Karnataka seems to defy the narrative much to the ire of BJP’s top brass.

Lakhs attend Lingayat rally, push for religion status https://t.co/u6u1AkGHta — TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) August 23, 2017

Bhagwat’s call to unite resulted in over 100 representatives of Lingayat mutts organising a huge rally attended by over a lakh people in Belagavi this Tuesday. The RSS chief bore the major brunt of the attack for his statement at the rally where BJP leaders including Yeddyurappa were conspicuous by their absence. Leader after leader appealed that the community should not adhere to any political party, instead follow the teachings of the 12th century saint Basaveshwara, the founder of Lingayat community.

Now, memo exposes B S Yeddyurappa's doublespeak on Lingayats https://t.co/5Kfaj5xbFG via @TOIBengaluru pic.twitter.com/y7wh6IpXrn — Times of India (@timesofindia) July 29, 2017

Assembly elections are due in 2018 in the only major state in south where Congress is in power and BJP is keen to regain it. But Siddaramaiah has other plans. He has tactfully supported the demand for Lingayat to be given the status of an independent religion and asked some of his ministers to gauge the mood of the community on this issue. This has put Yeddyurappa and BJP in a catch-22 situation: if they support the demand, then it will put pressure on PM Modi to take a call; and if they don’t, BJP runs the risk of alienating the community which has been the bedrock of their politics in the state.

As Congress eyes Lingayats, Amit Shah reaches out to Vokkaliga bloc https://t.co/uXG1d9dA6k — TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) August 14, 2017

Little wonder that Shah has termed this demand as Siddaramaiah’s divide and rule policy in the run up to the assembly elections."
Charge that Narayana Murthy forced CEO Vishal Sikka to resign is a lie,"By Vallabh Bhanshali

Walk away I did, but it did not mean a walk over/

Targets hiding behind the non-target/

I prefer speaking to Keeping quiet /

When will my countrymen learn to speak up

*******

These are the words that came to mind when I imagined what it must be to be in Mr Narayana Murthy’s shoes…

Omkar, I walked away. Not once. That cannot mean a walk over, allowing a walk over what was built painstakingly.

I spoke up and kept speaking up, not because I am a founder or that along with my wonderful colleagues a part of large block of voting power. I spoke up because if I noticed something remiss as a shareholder it had to be pointed out for everyone’s good. Those who take criticism and respond positively benefit immensely whereas a critic has little to gain. On the contrary, he is prone to be judged cantankerous as I have been. Worse, in both a tragic and comic manner, my motives have been questioned and I am being dictated to walk away!

All the same I must speak up. I must choose my words and target thoughtfully. One should be fair and open to admission of a mistake in doing so. These are some of the principles that I keep in mind and that also went into communication and governance policy at Infosys. In a way these were some of the pillars that held Infosys aloft.

It is obvious that the corporate governance code at Infosys wasn’t built in a day. Building it required thought, imagination and belief in fairness. The rules of governance were made as a matter of faith in them and not for instant benefits or cover ups. They were built around one simple realization, viz. when multiple constituencies are involved winning and sustaining their trust was paramount and that was possible only by transparency and exercising acute diligence.

It also required that we subjected ourselves to greater questioning, in the immediate term losing business secrets and other limitations. These restrictions did not deter us from writing in the first annual report after we became a public company that ‘ we will always be transparent and we think transparency is a competitive advantage’. Not many people understood the implication of what we said. Over time we were proven right as reflected in the growing confidence of customers, employees and shareholders.

We kept adding layers to transparency. We added the practice of giving half yearly results, quarterly results, audited results, interim balance sheet and so on much before it became law to do so. All based on the same principle that let others judge us based on data and not on certification, self or paid ones.

We did not stop there. We thought even if Indian companies did not practice it or the regulation did not require it, we thought it appropriate to give guidance so that a small investor or broker who did not have the wherewithal to do deep analysis could invest or divest based on it. Of course, our guidance had to be credible, more so in terms of downside protection.

When Sarbanes Oxley code was introduced in the US demanding that the listed companies come clean and a window of period was provided for the same we would become the first company to file ‘No change in disclosure’ statement. It was a proud moment for us and for India.

A lot of these facts are well known or are a part of Infosys legend but I felt compelled to mention by way of background to what I have to say.

I must expose the mis-statements made in utterly poor taste in the context of Vishal Sikka’s resignation as CEO of Infosys.

I thought it was patent that constant comments and questioning of governance based on public data or on a whistleblower’s report,

were targeted at the Board or its leadership. These questions cannot be targeted at the CEO. They were always targeted at the Board and or its leadership. The CEO has to be enterprising and in that process, can make a mistake. It is and was the Board’s job to keep him both motivated and discreet. The Board has to lay and enforce its guidelines in a dynamic manner.

Thomas Jefferson said in the context of democracy ‘that it is only when the government is afraid of the people and not the other way around that Democracy can be said to be successful’. The words could not fit better to a board managed company. The CEO must be bold but not so bold that he dictates the board and lays the rules of governance. It is the board that should not let that happen.

Unfortunately, this is what seems to have happened at Infosys. Amongst numerous examples of this let me take just one.

In 2016 the CEO announced goals for 2020, rather abruptly, which were ambitious by all accounts and naturally, had to be abandoned. It is strange that the while the Board has raised a finger at my motives it completely failed to question the motive or the meat of that abrupt move. What lay along that garden path and where was it leading to, should have been the most natural questions. It didn’t need great professional skepticism but the Board simply let that happen. In retrospect, everyone can see why was that announced made and what lay along that path. Equally facile and naive was the Board’s announcement of abandonment of those goals! Slightest questioning would have avoided the great embarrassment to the company, a company that met or came close to its guidance for a number of years. When track record of this kind was being trampled on, at least to the discerning, it became clear that grave weaknesses were being institutionalized.

Infosys came back from crises in 2001 and 2008 strongly because there was a sense of trust and fairness in warp and weft of the company and the crisis galvanized them into both unity and strength. Companies with weak governance and unfair practices find it difficult to survive crisis. A dam that cannot hold a flood back is a bigger curse than the flood itself. Its test lies only when a flood arises.

If I could clearly see that eventuality I had a choice to keep quiet. I could persuade myself that I had walked out voluntarily and I should treat Infosys as a closed chapter bearing its progress and distress with equanimity. It was easy but that is not me. I knew I could be misunderstood as wanting to come back or impose my nominee as the CEO. What a travesty! Someone who walked out no sooner a CEO was found with billions of dollars in the company would not do so to come back at the drop of a hat! I am old, have my own tragedies but sane enough.

I have pondered on the accusations being made against me for forcing Vishal to resign. It is a lie. It is the Board, rather its leadership that did it. The Board failed to enforce good practices and went around seeking endorsement from paid agencies instead of dealing in data and letting the world judge for itself. That is all that I demanded. It was the Infosys practice and at least some of the current directors have been party to such situations and disclosures. But that was not to be. Its attempts to strengthen itself ended in a ludicrous situation of having multiple people holding posts with the suffix chairman!

The need for a large company to have a strong CEO is unquestioned. But good governance, the fountainhead of a company, and a workforce motivated and comforted by a pervasive sense of fairness are even more important. If the board governance improves I have no doubt that the deep-rooted culture and competence of Infosys will restore its glory.

The public reactions are not lost on me. They anguish me. Not because the market capitalization has gone down. It is not the affronts to me. It is much worse. It is the deep-rooted culture of bearing what is not right, particularly in India, that is the sore point. Democracy, a company or for that matter any relationship can become and remain strong only when people have the courage to speak up. Speak up in a fair and persistent manner. Those who prefer to suffer losses than speak up are destined to do so.

At my age, I don’t know how long I will be able to speak up. My misfortune that I will die without seeing Indians having learned to speak up. Financial fortunes vanish like the privy purses of the kings when you don’t have the wherewithal to protest and protest in time.

I have restrained myself in my statement by stating the obvious to but that may have been lost to the less clued in. Lost in the din of falling share price and the statements by those hiding behind Vishal who portrayed himself to be my victim. He was never my target.

Make laws on data protection and privacy swiftly,"The old order changeth yielding place to new, concluded Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, one of the nine members of the Supreme Court bench which unanimously ruled that individual privacy is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The ruling, even if silent, will have an impact on Aadhaar, the unique identification number used by the government to disburse money for welfare schemes.

Is Aadhaar compatible or not with the Right to Privacy? That’s something another bench of the Supreme Court will rule on. Instead of waiting for the next ruling, the government should enact laws on data protection and privacy. Thats a message from the apex court as well.

Justice Kaul, in fact, mildly rapped the government for dilly dallying on the Privacy Bill in 2005. Seven years later, a group of experts appointed by the Planning Commission and steered by AP Shah gave its report on privacy. But its recommendations remained on paper.

In the course of the hearing the government informed the SC about its decision to set up the BN Srikrishna panel to identify key data protection issues in India and recommend ways to address them. No one can quibble with the government’s position that the digital economy must grow, and in parallel the personal data of citizens must be secure and protected. So there is hope! said Justice Kaul.

The Chief Justice of India also concurred with the view that data protection is indeed “a complex exercise which needs to be undertaken by the state after a careful balancing of privacy concerns and legitimate state interests, including public benefit arising from scientific and historical research based on data collected and processed.”

It makes sense for India to take a page from the European Union that has stringent laws to protect a citizen’s data. “The European Union Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data may provide useful guidance in this regard. The State must ensure that information is not used without the consent of users and that it is used for the purpose and to the extent it was disclosed”.

The SC ruling says that the concerns expressed (by privacy advocates) on the possibility of the State infringing the right to privacy can be met by the test suggested for limiting the discretion of the State. One, the action must be sanctioned by law. Two, the proposed action must be necessary in a democratic society for a legitimate aim. Three, the extent of such interference must be proportionate to the need for such interference and most important there must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such interference.

Interestingly, the EU regulation also recognises what is called “right to be forgotten”. This comes into force if, say, a person, does not wish that his personal data should be stored or processed as it has no relevance, is incorrect and serves no legitimate interest. But there are checks on exercising this right as well.

The SC’s observation on the need to have a law data protection is timely and useful. The ball is now in the government’s court."
Fashion Diaries: Here’s Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one’s fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone’s going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it’s a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

OPPO F3

Well, selfies come handy not just to change display pictures, but when we need to check our pretty faces anywhere, anytime. And if on some days, if we look a bit too extra cute, why not click a selfie and save it too, right? And if you use a Selfie Expert phone, your picture is bound to look even prettier. If you want more, nowadays they even have a beauty mode btw!

And when friends are around, the selfie-game gets even better!

OPPO F3

Because when we are with our favourites, we are always in our happy and cheerful spirits which totally reflects on our pictures too. With a wide-angle group selfie, we can even get a full-length selfie to compare each other's style quotient!

One last word: Our phone's style quotient speaks a lot about our fashion diaries.

Pinterest

That’s why, nowadays people focus not just on the colour of the phone, but even on extra-accessories for it such as phone cases, bedazzlements or extra-customizations. Recently, even Bollywood style-icon Deepika Padukone had customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as the #F3DeepikaEdition.

OPPO F3

She had designed her own icon with OPPO, which has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded along, at the back of the phone and it pretty much signifies her personality, isn’t it? The special Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie, a 16 MP selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

So, dear style-divas if you are planning on buying a new phone, go for a Rose Gold OPPO F3, it’s pretty much going to be your new personal stylist!"
"Open letter to incoming CJI: The most pressing priorities before India’s judiciary, and how to address them","Respected CJI designate,

You are about to head the world’s most populous functioning democracy’s apex court, the planet’s most dynamic judicial institution, a final court with globally the highest degree and scope of judicial review, the global inventor of basic structure theory and PIL and the Indian institution in which maximum faith is reposed by over 1.25 billion Indians. Any wish list for such a powerful and all encompassing institution is bound to be overflowing. I will, due to exigencies of space, limit mine to a few priorities.

Firstly, you and your successor Chief Justices, down to the last known one presently on the bench, should sit down together at least once every two months to create and then monitor the implementation of one, two and five year plans for the entire judiciary, including your court. It is tragic that for the last 70 years such plans have not even been formulated with a minimum perspective of five years, subsuming sub plans for shorter periods.

This is especially vital since most of you have roughly one year (or shorter) Chief Justiceships (with one exception reaching two years). On the many fundamental issues on which the brethren may and do have disagreements, you should agree to disagree and leave them aside to be decided by each incumbent CJI.

Secondly, this agreed five year perspective plan must not be changed for any reason, except fine tuning and calibration for better achievement. Synergistic results are bound to follow. The practice of each CJI anxious to stamp his own brand of policy tends to create transitory and disruptive paradigms, precluding accelerated cumulative consequences.

Thirdly, an example of Thomas Hardy’s admonition “Take care of the small things and the big things will take care of themselves” arises in the case of our collective war on the biggest scourge of judicial arrears and backlog, besmirching the otherwise glorious face of the Indian judiciary. Since your colleagues have now firmly re-established the primacy of the collegium for judicial appointments at all except the district court level, why is it not possible to establish a flow chart which is uniform, unchangeable and institutional (not personal) to expedite appointments? The single biggest reason for backlog is unfulfilled vacancies, reaching a peak of 450 out of a total 1,100 high court judges about a year ago (plus a normal 25-33% vacancy amongst the lower judiciary, where appointments fall within the jurisdiction of the respective HCs).

This flow chart must ensure throwing up names at least six months before a SC or HC vacancy. The process must be managed by a senior non-legal, non-judicial managerial officer whose only job is to see that a judicial replacement is known at least a fortnight before the incumbent’s retirement. The flow chart must factor in that there are serious delays and stalemates amongst yourselves, but that can be taken care of by constantly throwing up names at least three times the number of vacancies.

Irrespective of the merits of the appointment, the rigidity of the “pre-retirement fortnight rule” will ensure that your whole team works to a deadline. It will obviate serious hit wickets and self-goals like the apex court committed while adopting a self-defeating standstill policy of non-meeting of collegium and non-appointment of anyone while the NJAC hearing and judgment process was on for almost 18 months.

Fourthly, having reiterated the exclusive jurisdiction of the apex court regarding judicial appointments, you as a judicial collectivity cannot adopt a policy of “prepared to strike afraid to wound”. If there are deliberate and persistent government-related reasons for delay in clearing files, it is time you began to exercise coercive powers reaching upto and including contempt against secretary and even ministerial level functionaries to ensure timely appointments. There can be no dyarchy of appointment power in practice despite a definitive SC judgment asserting exclusivity of the collegium (this comes from a supporter of the NJAC Bill like me; final SC orders must be final in letter and spirit).

Lastly, it is time that the collegium started adopting a uniform marking system for HC and SC elevations, even if it is destroyed immediately after the event. My wish list would be an equal weightage on quality of judgments written, integrity issues and a residual category of all other factors like temperament, experience, etc. The headings, though important, are less important than the fact that they must be uniform and intergenerationally consistent, forcing the various collegiums to have some uniformity of focus.

Ideally, one of your Committee of CJIs or one amongst the collegium should, like the erstwhile Sultan of folklore, sit in the court of potential appointees, disguised and completely anonymous, and report back. Physical reality is often shockingly different from paper reality! Since that will never happen, a group of 10 senior advocates of each court should be informally consulted.

None of this is rocket science. It arises from the experience of each one of us who have spent a lifetime at the Bar. It presupposes a reasonably bona fide attempt to improve the speed and quality of judicial appointments. It does not presuppose an ideal world without “the politics of the judiciary” or the “politics of the political system” but seeks to accommodate those realities. It is a great opportunity for you to start. I have no doubt that you will get full collegiate support. But even if you do not, it’s is always better to try and fail rather than fail to try."

Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of déjà vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government’s apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India’s total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government’s achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi’s intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015–16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016–17 as per reports.

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 – a promise prominently mentioned in BJP’s 2014 manifesto."

Time to play the Trump card in Afghanistan,"US President Donald Trump’s recognition that India has an important role to play in Afghanistan is welcome.

Washington has signalled its willingness to end its deference to Pakistan’s sensitivities about India’s involvement in Afghanistan. New Delhi must devise a plan, based on India’s interests and one that will ensure peace, stability and progress in the region.

There has been a growing realisation in the US that Pakistan has consistently played a double game. Islamabad has successfully extracted concessions and aid from the US as a partner in the war on terror, and at the same time, it has continued to provide substantial support, including safe haven, to terrorists.

Beginning from the closing months of the Clinton administration, Washington has increasingly leaned on and called out Pakistan. What sets apart Trump’s calling out of Pakistan supporting terrorists is that it is more unequivocal than that of his predecessors.

Given President Trump’s track record, it remains to be seen if he and his administration will stay the course and follow through with concrete action. There is much that the US can do to curtail Pakistan’s continued assistance to terrorists.

Washington needs to follow its talk with action. India needs to seize this moment. Pakistan will not give up its efforts to block a greater role for India in Afghanistan; it is already unsettled by New Delhi’s $1-billion investment.

Washington needs to follow up with necessary action to translate Trump’s words into reality. At the same time, India needs to work out its interests and those of the region to map out its participation in Afghanistan.

New Delhi must seize the opportunity accorded by Trump’s calling out of Pakistan for its support of terror groups. Trump’s Afghanistan and South Asia policy gives India an opening, it is for New Delhi to fashion it."

""I have lived a very active life all this while. Being someone who loves to trek and cycle to maintain a steady weight, gaining too much weight is a big no-no. I am at 108 kg for the role and any more change might get difficult to reverse,"" Anjali said in a statement.

""Dhhai Kilo Prem"", which will be aired on Star Plus starting from April 3, is an unusual story of two imperfect individuals -- Deepika and Piyush (Meherzan Mazda).

Not only Anjali, even Meherzan has gained 16 kg weight for his role.

"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India’s freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat – today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected – political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians’ narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department’s 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations – which included Nathuram Godse’s Hindu Rashtra Sena – viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn’t ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province’s chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh’s decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government’s delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police’s fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar’s participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year’s rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh’s anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, “Of late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation’s activities.”

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman’s query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh’s mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh’s growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had “infiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes”. It further stated “the organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.”

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government’s real intention: “the holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.” Subsequently, the Sangh’s training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh’s weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists’ privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation’s history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."

"In Case You Missed It, Here Are Some Of The Most Dramatic Pictures From The Solar Eclipse","The magnificent eclipse from yesterday has, for sure, left the entire world in awe. As the moon's shadow slowly took over areas that fall around Oregon and South Carolina, everyone began basking in the glorious eclipse, touted to be one of the harshest.

For over an hour and a half, everyone took a break from whatever they were doing and took it to the streets with their gears on. Millions got outside to watch this eclipse and even a million more witness it online, making it one of the most-watched in history.

The eclipse was partially visible across all 50 states, but it was the clearest from a 70-mile-wide sliver of 14 states. This eclipse was a totality, a rare event that hasn't happened since 1979 and a coast-to-coast eclipse for almost over a century.

Faf du Plessis to lead World XI in 3 T20Is in Pakistan,"WORLD XI TOUR OF PAKISTAN, 2017

Faf du Plessis to lead World XI in 3 T20Is in Pakistan

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 07:34 PM

The World XI side that will tour Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in September, will be led by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, PCB chief Najam Sethi announced in a press conference on Thursday (August 24). The first two T20Is of the Independence Cup will be played on September 12 and 13, and the final game will be played on September 15, in Lahore.

The squad boasts of as many as five South Africa players, namely Hashim Amla, David Miller, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir, apart from skipper du Plessis himself. The star-studded 14-member squad will feature three Australians too - George Bailey, Ben Cutting and wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine. Darren Sammy, who was a part of the Pakistan Super League 2 Final, will lead the West Indian representation alongside Samuel Badree.

There is one player each from England, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, in Paul Collingwood, Tamim Iqbal, Thisara Perera and Grant Elliott respectively. The only countries which do not have a representation in the World XI squad are India, and Zimbabwe. Andy Flower was appointed coach of the touring side previously.

Faf du Plessis (C), Hashim Amla, Samuel Badree, George Bailey, Paul Collingwood, Ben Cutting, Grant Elliott, Tamim Iqbal, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Tim Paine, Thisara Perera, Imran Tahir, Darren Sammy

""I am honored to have been appointed as the captain of such a diverse, attractive and well balanced side. Like most of the players, I look forward to my maiden tour of Lahore and play my part in the safe and gradual resumption of international cricket in Pakistan,"" du Plessis said on the momentous occasion.

""All the members of the squad have complete faith in the assessment and judgement of the security experts who have assured that there will be no compromise on the safety and security of all those involved in the series. As professionals, we are being paid to play in the series but the bottom line is that if we don't feel safe, no amount of money can get us there. In this background, we will land in Lahore with nothing except cricket on our minds.

""In my career, I have featured in some very exciting matches against Pakistan but to play in Pakistan in front of its passionate supporters, will be a unique experience which I cannot wait to explain. As a player I understand the importance of playing in front of home crowds and that is something I am sure that Pakistani players will relish,"" du Plessis added.

The PCB chairman, who has been in the public eye for his constant attempts to bring international cricket to Pakistan, looked a relieved man at the press conference but didn't conceal the enormity of the efforts that they had to put in to get as close to this. ""From putting this World XI together to getting people on board, to pull in 1.2 billion dollars to put in place the requisite security plans for the security agents and officials to visit our country and assess the arrangements, all of this would not have been possible without the relentless support of Giles Clarke,"" Sethi said.

""You would know that he also heads the Pakistan Task Force unit. We are indebted to Mr. Clarke for the great effort he has put in bringing all of this together for all of us. I thank him for his support, and I know the whole of Pakistan is thankful to him too.

""The three-member security cell will arrive in the first week of September. We just finalised it over a conversation today. They will oversee all the arrangements and will discuss it with the Punjab government. Following this, the team would arrive and we get started with the series,"" he further added.

""I must confess this was a difficult project to take up. All of us wanted to make this happen but there were so many elements involved, you need assistance from the government, administration, police, rangers, army, and FICA is involved too. Getting them on board was the most difficult task. There were a lot of issues and we worked steadily towards resolving all of them. There were financial challenges too.

""See, there are only 15 odd days remaining now, and today, we have received the names of the players. Broadcasters wanted the names of the players for the rights to be sold, you can assume the challenges involved.

""Now my next challenge is to host cricket in Karachi. I have received numerous calls asking for the same, from the governor, media and so many others. That truly is my next objective. As of date, the foreign players and the security experts are not ready for it. We will look to take PSL to Karachi, once that is staged successfully, the roads to more cricket there would open up,"" Sethi noted.

Pakistan are also due to host Sri Lanka and West Indies, after the conclusion of the three-T20I series against World XI. The Windies are expected to visit Pakistan some time in late November for a three-match T20I series.

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

What the players and coach said:

Hashim Amla: I am looking forward to the trip to Pakistan. The rehabilitation of my shoulder is progressing well and I am confident of being fit for the matches.""

Andy Flower: ""I have visited Pakistan in 1993, 1996 and 1998 with the Zimbabwe cricket team. I have enjoyed all my previous tours of Pakistan and look forward to returning to Lahore next month. All the players are satisfied and comfortable with the security arrangements that will be put in place for the series and are happy to be a part of the first step towards the safe return of international cricket in Pakistan.

""We now look forward to playing some exciting cricket, so that we can entertain the Lahore crowd who have waited long enough to see local as well as international stars live in their backyard.""

Sarfraz Ahmed: ""I am really excited to see the World XI team coming to Pakistan and I keenly look forward to play in front of a committed crowd who support us. I can assure all Pakistani cricket fans that we have missed playing in front of them, like they have missed watching us live in action.

""But this wait is about to end and I am sure better times lie ahead for all of us. I am confident that through this tour of World XI, the global cricket community, including players, media and visitors will get a better understanding and perception of Pakistan, which is a peace loving and extremely hospitable nation.

""I would like to congratulate PCB and ICC for making this tour happen and I look forward to some exciting matches in front of a packed Gaddafi stadium. I am confident that following the success of these matches, Pakistan will not only host regular international series but at all international cricket centres as well.""

The OBC Category People Earning Up To Rs 8 Lakh Per Annum Would Now Get The Reservation Benefit,"The government will soon set up a commission to examine the sub-categorisation of 'Other Backward Classes', or OBCs, even as it has raised the OBC creamy layer criterion to Rs 8 lakh from Rs 6 lakh.

Reuters

This means that those in the OBC category earning up to Rs 8 lakh per annum would now get the reservation benefits. The commission is expected to submit a report within 12 weeks of the appointment of a chairperson, Jaitley added.

The NCBC has recommended sub-categorisation within OBCs into Extremely Backward Classes (Group 'A'), More Backward Classes (Group 'B') and Backward Classes (Group 'C'), MoS for Social Justice and Empowerment Krishan Pal Gurjar said.

""It has been recommended that the Extremely Backward Classes should be grouped into a separate group which could include aboriginal tribes, vimukta jatis, nomadic and semi- nomadic tribes, wandering classes etc,"" the minister said.

The recommendation was made to distinguish between extremely backward classes and 'forward' groups among the OBCs.

Twitter

“The team had been meaning to meet for a while now. Since Deepika wasn’t shooting for Padmavati and Irrfan is in town, they decided to gather on Tuesday to discuss the script, how their characters would shape up and their looks.""

Triple talaq: Removing gender injustice would only strengthen minority rights in India,"Triple talaq has been quashed by the Supreme Court. A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‘pampered minorities’ in their place.

Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.

At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.

For Muslim Women

To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.

Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world’s earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.

The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.

The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.

The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.

The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel’s statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.

Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole

Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.

Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.

When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.

In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.

And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.

The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.

Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all."

Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."
The Best Way Out,"Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape, the problems will continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life, says MARGUERITE THEOPHIL



Sometimes, it feels easier to avoid a problem or challenge — or even an opportunity that has no guaranteed positive outcome. You distract yourself, make excuses, procrastinate; do anything but enter the situation. There are times when this is simply self-preservation; nothing too wrong there — but often it keeps you from entering a space that will help you learn and grow or keeps you stuck in a place that diminishes you. Sometimes,though,you are thrown into just such a situation, ready or not. You struggle, going through most stages of what is called the ‘grief cycle’, an extended form of this being the stages of shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression — but you stop short of the last two: testing (of realistic options and solutions) and acceptance. This is because often acceptance does not mean the end of things; it is the beginning of moving into spaces, into decisions, into unfamiliar ways of being you would rather not move into. Such an attitude and the corresponding behaviours are often referred to as escapism. Escapism is when you try to avoid something. Some escape by excessive sleeping, shopping, eating, playing or inordinate time spent online. Some drown themselves in work; or alcohol or drugs. We all know people who stay in jobs or abusive marriages only because they are afraid of failure in pursuing what they love, or because they are not sure if there is another better someone elsewhere.People who avoid challenges because they are afraid of possible pain and suffering; who avoid healing their past because they are reminded of their deepest sorrows;who avoid confronting issues because they think they have no strength to face them.



‘Better the devil we know…’ they say sadly. Rather than ease your pain and suffering, this attitude prolongs and sometimes deepens them. At times people think the solution is to bury them or numb themselves to their effects — but the issue and its effects just stay dormant, silently growing until the day it will all resurface. Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape from, your issues will not miraculously disappear.They continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life — getting stuck again and again in similar situations and contexts, thinking the same things,feeling the same emotions,doing the same things, linking up with similar people. Looping patterns require conscious intervention in order to break out of them.And the best and most wise advice for these times — though not that easy to follow — is:‘The best way out is through.’ An old teaching story comes to mind: Once upon a time, there was a tortoise on a ship, and the ship sank in the middle of the ocean.The tortoise made it to a bit of land surrounded by water on all sides except for one. The strip of barren land led up to a high, steep, craggy mountain. To avoid starving to death, the tortoise decided to climb to the top,hoping that he would be able to cross, and find something to eat on the other side. You would know this would take a long, long time; not only was the terrain daunting — this is a tortoise we are talking about! When he finally got to the snow-covered summit he was freezing cold, and then a blizzard started.



He just managed to make out a narrow pathway leading down the other side of the mountain and made his way towards it. But ahead on the path was a big monster that wouldn’t stop shouting, ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ This sound and his fear almost killed the tortoise; all he wanted to do was hide his head inside his shell. But, looking around him, he noticed many other animals of all sizes lying there, frozen to death. He summoned up all his courage to move down the path towards the monster.The closer the tortoise got, the more the monster changed its shape. Then, when he was almost upon it, the tortoise realised that what he had thought was a monster, was only a great pile of rocks, what he thought were dead frozen animals were other smaller rocks. As for the ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ — the tortoise realised this was just the sound of the wind blowing through a small cave. He made his slow but determined way to the greenery that he could see ahead. Remember, in the process of working through your issues, you don’t always win quickly. Sometimes you may make some progress, only to slide back later.



Sometimes, you get beaten back down almost immediately, particularly if it involves dealing with something you have been struggling with for a long time. Don’t be afraid of asking for help or guidance; admitting you need help does not make you weak, it makes you strong.You might need help and support of others, professionals or loved ones, to ‘hang in there’, but ultimately, it is your journey. Yet being convinced that the best way out is through, you find out that as long as you keep going, as long as you keep confronting your issues, as long as you keep fighting, as long as you confront your fears, as long as you know that the way out lies through and beyond all this — you become stronger and stronger, and find a way to conquer the mess.

Implications of right to privacy go well beyond privacy,"The Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling that individual privacy is indeed a fundamental right subject to reasonable restrictions has led to celebrations across the country. But there is more to the landmark judgement that just privacy and the court has also provided a ray of hope for India’s LGBT community. This comes after the court refused to decriminalise Section 377 of Indian Penal Code which relates to consensual sex among adult homosexual men in 2013.

Page 124 of the judgement reads, “Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.”

SC’s verdict on #RightToPrivacy: Here is what the judges said https://t.co/0dBqc5O216 pic.twitter.com/Nlqv9GROKB — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 24, 2017

Similarly page 404 mentions, “As case law, both in the U.S. and India show, this concept has travelled far from the mere right to be let alone to recognition of a large number of privacy interests, which apart from privacy of one’s home and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures have been extended to protecting an individual’s interests in making vital personal choices such as the right to abort a foetus; rights of same sex couples- including the right to marry; rights as to procreation, contraception, general family relationships, child rearing, education, data protection, etc. This argument again need not detain us any further and is rejected.”

Privacy a fundamental right subject to reasonable restrictions: Government https://t.co/DeNznw203P pic.twitter.com/5vA52aqQhE — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 24, 2017

The government was hoping that a favourable verdict would help it extend Aadhaar to all essential services and even link it to some voluntary services as well. This had led to widespread criticism that the government was trying to completely monitor every individual through this move thereby violating privacy. The setback for the government could now be two-fold. Firstly the court had clarified that the right to privacy is not vague and amorphous as the government believes. Secondly, it recognises privacy interests as well."
A Riot Of Vegetables,"The vibrant colours of vegetables bring out the artist in me. It makes me internally happy, French chef ALAIN PASSARD says to RANJENI A SINGH



Till the year 2000, he cooked meat. Then began his love affair with vegetables,thanks to the garden he created in 2001. Since then, French chef Alain Passard has been dishing out vegetarian fare, with each plate turning out as a piece de resistance. Just like an artist who contemplates his palette before he paints the first stroke on the canvas, Passard takes a long look at the colours of vegetables — “a mauve, yellow, a marbly white, celadon green, a pearly orange,” to quote him — for inspiration before getting into the technical aspects of cooking.And when he is not cooking, Passard is sculpting crabs and hedgehogs in bronze or making collages. The three Michelin star chef,known as the greatest vegetarian cook in the world,says,“When I saw the vegetables in the garden, I wanted to change professions, to renew my senses,change my hand. It wasn’t so much killing animals that made me change but the excitement of travelling on a different kind of fabric.”He says that nature,too,does not like the same routine — that is why she created seasons and seasonal vegetables to fire the imagination and you can,therefore,cook up something new every day. About his relationship with his garden, Passard says,“They definitely make me a better chef.



It’s made my cuisine better, and gives value to farmers, because a garden is a playground for culinary creation.”To not let refrigeration or any such thing meddle with the natural flavour of the vegetables, his lovingly tendered vegetables are transported from his garden — located in the Eure and the Sarthe regions of France — to his kitchen in Paris, in time to make meals. And when the vegetables of a particular season are over, the produce of the next season takes over. Such is his love for vegetables that his restaurant,Arpege, also sells organically grown vegetable baskets every morning.Six gardeners work at the vegetable garden in Fille sur Sarthe.Three people look after the vegetable garden in Bois-Giroult.The latest one,the garden of Porteaux, located opposite the Mont St Michel bay, has its own orchard. For the wellbeing of the gardens as well as the earth, there are two donkeys, two foals, as well as cows, chickens, and a goat that live there.Call it total communion with nature! Passard is proud of his prized possession: His vegetable garden. And he declares on his website,“I grow my own vegetables to be able to tell a story from the grain to the plate…and to be able to combine the chef ’s touch with that of the gardener,two passionate professions.Through these gardens, I have trusted nature with my creativity;it is nature that dictates my actions. The most beautiful cookery book was written by nature itself.”



The shift from meat to vegetables has changed his perspective.“Spiritually, it brought me a lot of happiness.I reconnected with painting thanks to the immeasurable amount of colours that vegetables can offer, and this gave me a completely new perspective on what being a chef means.It helped me realise that cooking vegetables was more artistic,” says Passard and adds, “I think it’s very personal. For me, there are different kinds of cooks: one that will nourish his inspiration through colours and seasons, the shapes and colours of vegetables, and one who doesn’t have that sensitivity and who will inevitably see his cuisine as a job, not as a passion, and a source of creativity.” He likes to listen to what is cooking, hearing the subtleness of the crackling,for he says, the sound of tomatoes cooking isn’t the same as the sound of beetroot cooking. “Taste is a combination of two or three flavours and it is linked to textures,and what gets on the plate is strong,yet delicate.” Does he agree with eastern wisdom that says,‘You are what you eat’? He prefers to change the maxim to ‘You eat what you want’.“That says even more about a person, because it is a personal choice. By eating what you want, you accept your tastes, and through the effort you put into it, you can know whether you like the art of the table or not,” says the chef. Is food all about cooking up a great dish and savouring it,or is it something more? “Of course! Cooking and savouring are decisive steps, but before they can even begin to exist, you have to think.Think about what it is you want, who you would like to share it with, what techniques and touches will you use? It all revolves around your senses, and they are moments you linger and long for,moments you cherish and that lead up to cooking, then serving. It’s such a sensitive space, so large....” And in this celebration of food, the family plays a key role. Passard believes that family meals are the richest of these moments.“You share dishes,ideas,a moment where you discuss your past,your future, because a family bond is timeless. It’s an opportunity to connect through classical dishes that everyone identifies with”. (Alain Passard interacted via email).

8 Physical signs you're going through Hormonal Imbalance,"6

Thinning of hair

It all starts from head to toe, the brain first tries to send the signals from the point that is closest to it, i.e. our hair. Unlike the common loss of hair strands, you’ll find you hairline thinning and losing out hair in chunks. Some or the other part of your scalp will lose its hold on the hair and would start showing up. That’s your first signs."
Why missionary is the best position ever,"Getting all adventurous and acrobatic while trying out new positions for some mind-blowing sex is fun for sure. But the age-old missionary is a tried-and-tested formula that can never go wrong and always guarantees fulfilling sex no matter how vanilla it sounds. We give you four reasons that confirms missionary to be the best sex position ever.

It is easy

It’s simple and anybody can try and get it right in one go, be it a beginner or a pro. You don’t need any special skills or knowledge to amp up the kink factor. All that’s needed to turn up the heat is a lot of intimacy and the urge to pleasure each other as much as possible.

It is romantic

Missionary is a classic position that spells romanticism to the tee. It gives you ample opportunities to kiss, embrace and look into each other's eyes apart from, obviously, great sex. Intimacy reaches a whole new level as he gets inside you with full gusto and the two of you hold on to each other as you reach climax. It sure can’t get steamier.

It is comfortable

No special skills are required while having sex the missionary way and there are no possibilities of any discomfort. It doesn’t require bending and twisting and no matter how wild either of you are in bed, missionary sex scores high on the comfort factor.

It is customisable

A bit of tweaking here and there can add a lot of variations to the regular position. Lock his legs or bend your knees as he enters you for a deeper penetration. A bit of extra grinding and rolling from his end would be just perfect to help you both inch towards the Big O."

This Free Smartphone App Replaces Expensive Hearing Aids For People Suffering From Hearing Loss,"Losing your hearing can be a real problem, and if you’re young it’s twice as embarrassing. It doesn’t matter that it’s a medical condition, no one under the age of 50 would be comfortable being spotted with an earpiece.

And that’s exactly why MobileEars believes there’s a market out there for their unique product. The company markets it as an “affordable and attractive” solution for people with hearing loss, especially those in a younger age bracket.

“More people today will lose their hearing earlier than our ancestors’” says VP of sales and marketing for Listen AS (MobileEars' parent company), Arjun Bhatt. He believes one of the main problems with hearing aids in the market today is that they each cost between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. To top it off, hearing loss is not covered by most health insurance plans, and the doctor consults are expensive. Another major issue, is the stigma associated with wearing the earpiece needed to return hearing to the person.

Instead, MobileEars hopes to solve the problem in a cheap, accessible, and subtle fashion. Their app uses the microphone on a user’s smartphone to amplify sounds around them, and feed them back through headphones. The kicker here though is that it isn’t just an amplifier. It uses a form of speech recognition technology to pick up and amplify voices, whether a person speaking in front of you or on TV, and dim out the ambient noise.

MobileEye has also made provisions for variations in user’s extent of hearing loss, based on statistics of the condition. When you start up the app, it collects a few details like your age and gender to optimise the experience, but you can always fine tune it later.

Right now, the app needs a user to have their headphones connected, though the next logical step is improving the hardware, Bhatt says. The idea is to one day replace hearing aids entirely, though that may be a ways off.

For the time being, MobileEars is happy to just be a cheap alternative to expensive medical aids. And by cheap we mean the app is free to use on iOS, with an Android version likely incoming in the near future. It even works offline so you don’t have to worry about your data where your well-being is concerned.

And the company supposedly doesn’t have any revenue plans in the near future. If that does eventually happen, Bhatt believes it’ll either be by adding extra features to a premium version of the app, or by manufacturing companion hardware. “Right now, the focus is on getting the word out,” he says.

India needs banks of different sizes,"SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya’s caution on bank mergers has much merit, even as the Cabinet has given an in-principle nod for consolidation.

Yes, the economy does need bigger banks to meet its growing needs. A bigger bank will be able to fund large infrastructure deals, bring more efficiency in treasury operations and trim operating costs. But the need is also to ensure that it does not lead to the creation of banks that are too big to fail or are too cumbersome.

That’s a fear among regulators after the financial crisis in 2008. The country’s experience with mergers — New Bank of India with Punjab National Bank and Global Trust Bank with Oriental Bank of Commerce — has been either unhappy or under duress.

So, the ministerial panel that will be set up to supervise proposals from bank boards must exercise caution. India needs banks of varying sizes, with intense competition among them. Banks will face a threat from fintech companies, and the debt market.

Ideally, therefore, the government should allow some state-owned banks that want to merge for valid commercial reasons to consolidate, subject to their meeting tougher loss-absorbing capacity norms.

The RBI’s financial stability report is candid that the risks to the banking industry’s stability have worsened. Reportedly, the gross bad loan ratio is estimated to rise to 10.2% of the total loan book in March 2018 from 9.6% in 2017.

For public sector banks, the gross bad loan ratio could be as high as 14.2% by March 2018, from 11.4%. A resolution of bad loans is vital for state-owned banks so that capital infusion does not end up as provisioning against bad loans post the merger. Consolidation will benefit deposits growth.

The combined entity should also be well capitalised and have the capacity to raise resources without depending unduly on the state exchequer.

But there could be challenges in terms of employee integration due to the differences in the remuneration structures, and synchronisation of technology as well as accounting policies to recognise bad loans. Let there not be a tearing hurry to merge."
Are we judging a Subway sandwich boy by his ability to cook a biryani?,"Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. © Getty

Nineteen Windies wickets fell in a day of Test cricket in England recently. Sadder than the fact that it actually happened, was the fact that it didn't surprise a lot of people too much. We didn't rub our eyes in disbelief and even the narrative on whether a once great singer was singing terribly off-key is now an old one. As the emotional voice of West Indies cricket, Fazeer Mohammad, keeps telling us, this fall started a long time ago.

I have recently spent a lot of time in Sri Lanka, a place whose cricketers I have admired greatly for their skill and their modesty. Over three Test matches they were competitive for about three quarters of a day and some might say, that shouldn't have surprised me either. Maybe it just saddened me and expressing surprise was a means of lessening the impact.

Since the events have occurred simultaneously, they are a cue for a discussion on the state of test cricket. In England, where more is written about cricket than anywhere else (in India, we speak more about it, often in loud voices when the team loses; for eg. in a World Cup semifinal), there is even greater concern for Test cricket. It is understandable and yet futile. Understandable, because Test cricket still has strong roots in England; and futile, because they might be clamouring for a past that is never to return.

The grim pronouncements surrounding Windies and Sri Lanka leave me wondering if we are using the wrong metrics to judge teams now. It wasn't that long ago that Sri Lanka had mounted an outstanding run chase against India at the Champions Trophy. And the Windies are the only team to have won the World T20 twice. In Andre Russell, Dwayne Bravo and Sunil Narine, they have among the three most wanted players in T20 cricket and it wasn't that long ago that Chris Gayle was the reigning superstar of the format. Towards the end of India's short tour of the Caribbean in June and July, I saw the West Indies take apart a pretty strong Indian team in a T20 international.

The time has come then, some might say with justification that it came long ago, to ask ourselves whether the metrics we use to judge players and teams are still valid. Sanjay Manjrekar bemoans, and rightly so, the first class averages of those playing Test cricket now but maybe in the format they are more suited to play, Test and first-class records aren't the right indicators anymore. Players like Sunil Narine, and Lendl Simmons is actually a better example, have first-class records that you wouldn't glance at a second time but at what they are currently doing, they are invaluable. Dickwella and Gunathillake wouldn't have you up in worry the night before a game but they can trouble you over an hour's play.

Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way (and, dare I say, shot furtive glances occasionally), but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. Maybe cricket is running the 100 metre dash and we are judging the athletes for their endurance over 5000 metres. We don't ask Usain Bolt if he can run like Mo Farah but we want the Windies, the world champions over T20 cricket, to hang in there and fight grittily till the last man at a game that is ten times longer.

Many years ago, I had suggested that we accept that a slow cooked Hyderabadi biryani will have to live alongside a Subway sandwich. Indeed, we have accepted that but I fear we send the kid at the Subway counter to cook biryanis and bemoan his lack of skill. He might well turn around and say, as many in the Caribbean already are, that the queues outside his shop are longer.

Here's The Tentative Contestant List For Bigg Boss 11 & It Has A Lot Of Interesting Names!,"Indian reality shows come and go but the only one, people wait with bated breaths every single season, is the very popular Bigg Boss. One of the primary reasons, Indian audiences get glued to the show is because of Salman Khan and the other major reason is all the fights, sacndals and controversies we get to see between the housemates.

Youtube/screengrab

The brand new season Bigg Boss 11 is all set to make its debut. Salman Khan, who was unsure of hosting it for the sixth time, gave in yet again for this show. The actor released the teaser of the show, making us all yelp in joy!

And with the promos running on-air, speculations for the contestants have begun as well. While some reports are mentioning there might be a mix of common and celebrities like the last season, some are suggesting it's celebrity based only.

Here's taking a look at 11 such celebrity contestants who have been approached and they have reportedly given their nod!

1. Dhinchak Pooja

Well, no prizes for guessing why she has been approached. The singer shot to fame with her rap songs, Daaru Daaru and Selfie Maine Le Li Aaj and became an internet sensation. Since she has never been seen giving interviews to the media, people are looking forward to seeing her on the show. Somehow, she reminds us of Lokesh.

2. Nia Sharma

A body full of bruises..but barely any that hurts only coz u took them with pleasure🙋 #kkk8 A post shared by Nia Sharma (@niasharma90) on Jun 12, 2017 at 9:23am PDT

Jamai Raja fame actress Nia Sharma was on cloud nine when she became the third sexiest Asian woman. She beat a plethora of the most stunning actresses including Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif. Ever since then, she has been raising temperatures with her bikini photo-shoots and her Khatron Ke Khiladi show. It will be exciting to see what she brings to the show with her sexiness.

3. Riya Sen

Big things come in small sizes and this is exactly the case with Riya Sen. The actress secretly got married to her long time boyfriend recently but she was controversy's favourite child for the longest time. The most controversial episode in her life was when her MMS clip with actor Ashmit Patel was allegedly leaked. She was also spotted hitting on a girl and kissing her during a party which became headlines.

The makers of Bigg Boss 11 have approached her.

She was the famous Angoori devi from the show Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai. After gaining fame from the same, Shilpa un-timely quit the show without giving notice to the makers. Later, she held a press conference claiming the producers had not paid her. She also filed a FIR against Sanjay Kohli, the producer of her last show Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai, accusing him of sexual harassment.

6. Sana Saeed

There should be only one consideration when making any decision - Is this a statement of Who I Am? #youractionsdefineyou A post shared by Sana Saeed (@sanaofficial) on Apr 11, 2017 at 6:41am PDT

We all know her as Anjali from SRK-Kajol starrer Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. After her debut as a child artist in Bollywood, she arrived back in fame with Student Of The Year and since then she has appeared in many reality shows including Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa (2013), Nach Baliye (2015) and Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi. There is a strong buzz of her joining the show too.

7. Honey Singh

Twitter

We haven't seen him in a long long time. After his crackling music videos and hit songs, Honey Singh just suddenly vanished into oblivion. While some suspected his fight with SRK during the world tour led to his hiding, others say he got into drugs and has been in rehab since then. The singer has not sung for more than a year and people are curious to know about what really happened with him during this span.

Honey Singh still has loyal fans who are eagerly waiting for his comeback. The makers have got in touch with the 'once upon a time superstar'.

8. Bobby Deol

He was last seen in Singh Saab The Great in 2013 but came back into the news after he performed at the club as a DJ and played Gupt songs. It was so bad that people were asking for a refund. Although he opened up about being conned, Bobby became an internet sensation. There are chances he will talk about his personal life and controversies on the show.



9. Nikitin Dheer

He's the famous Tangballi from SRK starrer Chennai Express. Son of Pankaj Dheer and husband of KratikaNikitinan can spill the beans about the film and TV industry.

10 Achint Kaur

She is best known for playing the antagonists Mandira and Pallavi in Ekta Kapoor's Indian soap operas Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii. She has been associated with television since 1994 and it will be interesting to see how she is in her real life.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

OPPO F3

Fashionistas and DP fans, want to watch the lovely Deepika talking about her #F3DeepikaEdition? Watch this video right here and book one already!"
Unsafe as houses: Watch out – your dream home could become a nightmare 😜,"Most Indians dream of owning a home. And, if recent developments are anything to go by, the chances are that their dream home will remain just that: a dream.

Real estate developers – including some really big boys in the business – are collapsing like a house of cards.

Some have declared insolvency as they are unable to repay banks and others whom they’ve borrowed money from. Others have left their projects only partly finished and unfit for occupation.

Indeed, if all the delays in construction across the country were to be totted up they’d probably add up to a time when folks didn’t live in houses, but in caves.

And perhaps the time will come – if it hasn’t already – when people may have to do just that: Wanted for immediate occupation 2 BHK goofa, bijli-pani optional. Brokers welcome.

Many of those who’ve been left literally home-less have invested their life savings in a place to call their own which now seems more remote and out of reach than the surface of another planet.

In fact that unearthly analogy might be only too apt. Because one of the reasons why the real estate sector is in such a mess, that it should more appropriately be redesignated the unreal estate sector, is that many developers got so greedy that they used up all the money they’d collected for Project A to buy up land on which to start Project B, leaving Project A half-finished, if that.

This Operation Landgrab was of such a scale that the recently introduced Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) might well uncover pie-in-the-sky housing projects based on the Moon, or Mars, the Earth having run out of space.

In the meantime, many who’ve put their hard-earned money into owning a home are being made to learn the origin of the phrase to be ‘flat broke’: buy a flat, and become totally broke."
Bengaluru FC Just Defeated A North Korean Football Team,"Have you ever heard of a team called April 25? Well, it is one of the most successful teams in North Korea. This team was named after the Military Foundation Day and belongs to the Korean People's Army.

And the team has been beaten by India's Bengaluru FC 3-0 in the first leg of the AFC inter-zone semi-final match.

Star striker Sunil Chhetri was among the goal-getters. He led the charge with a 32nd minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match in front of the cheering home crowd at Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

BCCL

Heavy rains lashed the stadium an hour into the game and both the teams played under reduced visibility. Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty kick after Udanta was brought down by the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area. Chhetri stepped up and sent his shot at the center, which beat Ri Kang, who dived to his right.

Bengaluru scored their second goal through Udanta as the winger sprinted from the vacant right flank into the box and sent a superb left footer into the North Korean net.

BCCL

Lenny Rodrigues completed the route as he sent the ball past Kang who was blinded by the splash of water on his face. Chhetri broke away and ran almost 50 yards to cut in and deliver the cross from the left to Lenny who made no mistake.

Chhetri missed a chance to score his second goal in the 42nd minute after Kang, who was off the line, managed to get a finger of a the Indian striker’s shot for a corner. April 25 also had their chance in 23rd minute as Ri Hyong Jin sent an accurate freekick but An Song Il’s header hit the crossbar and the ball rebounded back into play.

They also missed an opportunity coming their way to reduce the margin in the 71st minute as Kwon Ch sent a grounded cross but An Il Bom could not connect it properly.

Soon after the half-time break, April 25 got into their act, but the smartness of the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the situation. Kim Yu Song had beaten three Bengaluru men and was going for a shot from an angle into the goal in 49th minute but Sandhu denied him.

A couple of minutes back too, Gurpreet had done well to send the ball out of danger after Kim Jong Chol had flicked to An Il Bom, who sent a cross across the goal with all the defenders falling short of pace to get hold of it.

Bengaluru FC will now travel to Pyongyang on September 13 for the second leg match.

"Founders keepers? Infosys badly hit by internal turbulence, must find a way out in tough environment","The irony of Vishal Sikka’s departure from Infosys is hard to miss. Sikka bravely led the Indian IT industry charge against unpredictable global headwinds in the form of protectionism and disruptive technological changes. But internal turbulence within Infosys proved too difficult to negotiate. When NR Narayana Murthy and the other founder-promoters exited Infosys’s board in 2014, it was hailed as a talismanic moment for corporate governance. After all, it’s not often that Indian promoters turn over their companies to professional managers. Having decided to let go, Murthy should have resisted the temptation to interfere.

Ultimately, Infosys’s stock and Murthy’s reputation took a beating. Sikka was brought in after slowing revenue growth from outsourcing, high attrition rate, and top-level exits dimmed the aura that Murthy and co-promoters assiduously built up over two decades. If the Murthy era focussed on paring down costs to maximise labour arbitrage, Sikka loosened purse strings and utilised cash reserves to fund overseas acquisitions and offer very generous salary and severance packages. Murthy took offence to these changes in corporate culture forcing the Infosys board to play a delicate balancing act between shareholders and its chief executive.

But that restraint ended with the board’s statement accusing Murthy of a “misguided campaign”. After such acrimony Infosys may not attract a top-notch technology leader from outside. Sikka placed his bets on artificial intelligence, automation and cloud computation to improve productivity and sustain Infosys’s edge. This strategy demands a CEO focussed on technology and innovation. The Elon Musks come at a high premium but offer the hope of creating new business and employment opportunities to offset the job losses from AI and automation. Murthy must take a page out of Bill Gates’s playbook. He must allow Infosys to reinvent itself in a changing business and technology environment."

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

"New Afghan Strategy: For it to work, Trump must recalibrate approach to Iran","US President Donald Trump has finally articulated his new Afghanistan strategy that reverses the Obama administration’s focus on withdrawal of American troops. Instead, the new plan seeks to increase troop deployment up to 4,000 additional soldiers who will now work closely with Afghan security forces on the ground. The thinking in Washington today is that Obama’s focus on wrapping up operations in Afghanistan during the final years of his tenure emboldened the Taliban who have slowly clawed back the advantage. Therefore, if the Americans completely pack up now it will be tantamount to handing over Afghanistan to the Taliban.

This assessment is not without merit. The Taliban have proved to be a hardy lot. Plus, there is now a consensus that peace without any participation of the Taliban is impossible. Whether one likes it or not, the Taliban do represent a significant section of the Afghan population. Add to this the fact that the Pashtun group has been cleverly positioning itself as the only force capable of fighting the growing presence of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. Taken together, the Taliban has to be part of the political solution in Afghanistan.

So the question now is: How much space should the Taliban be given in future peace negotiations? Ideally, the US would want to negotiate from a position of strength and create a situation where the Taliban is one of many balancing forces in Afghanistan. This means denying the Taliban an overwhelming role in the future Afghan state structure. And that would require militarily beating the Taliban into an acceptable shape. Hence the focus of the new strategy on boosting American troops.

That said, the part of the equation that the US really needs to solve is Pakistan. There’s no denying the fact that Pakistan has a vested interest in supporting and sustaining the Taliban for strategic depth in Afghanistan. It has been doing this all this while, proffering a dubious ‘Good Taliban, Bad Taliban’ line to keep its own strategic assets intact. Washington’s failure has been its inability to see through Islamabad’s duplicity. While Trump has called out Pakistan for sheltering terrorists and asserted that things can’t remain the same, there’s no clarity on the way forward. Given Afghanistan’s geopolitical reality, Pakistan has a natural influence on Afghanistan. But if this has become a problem for the US, then Washington must look for another country to help actualise Afghan stability.

It’s welcome that Trump has recognised India’s role in security and development of Afghanistan. New Delhi has already done a lot in terms of infrastructure building in that country, as exemplified by the construction of the new Afghan Parliament. Of course, it can do much more. However, given its geographical proximity, Iran too is crucial for ensuring stability in Afghanistan. This is where Trump is missing a trick. If he is serious about putting Pakistan under the cosh, for the sake of Afghanistan he must recalibrate his approach to Iran.

Treating Iran as the enemy, threatening to rescind the Iran nuclear deal, and giving into Saudi insecurities won’t help the US with Afghanistan. If Washington is truly thinking of bypassing Islamabad, it must establish a credible working relationship with Tehran. The latter has enough stakes in the Afghan situation to help the Americans create the right balance between Pashtun and non-Pashtun groups. This approach will dilute Pakistan’s influence on Afghan polity, check the Taliban’s power, and allow countries like India to do more in Afghanistan. Besides, Iran today has a moderate President who is seeking to open up his country and modernise its economy. This is the worst time for Washington to adopt an adversarial position with respect to Tehran. Trump should not allow his foreign policy to be guided by Saudi paranoia."

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, put to rest all speculations regarding the World XI tour to Pakistan, confirming on Monday (August 21), a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in Lahore, starting September 10. A 15-member squad led by former Zimbabwe great Andy Flower will take part in a seven-day long camp in Dubai before heading to Lahore for the series. However, the bigger news is Windies is set to tour the cricket-starved nation for a three-match T20I series in Lahore in late November.

Sethi also stated that the three games against World XI will be played across four days, but refused to divulge the dates citing security reasons.

""CWI and PCB are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies play three T20I matches in Lahore in late November,"" read the statement. ""In September, October and November, we'll have the World XI, we'll have Sri Lankan team and then the West Indies (come play in Pakistan).

""We just hope that the security we've promised, we'll keep it up. Sri Lanka have said they'll come after the World XI, provided the security is fine. It will be fine, Punjab government has indicated that the preparation are in full swing. At the end of this month, ICC's security team is also arriving. So far all signals are good,"" Sethi added. He also stated that talks with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were still on over the number of games to be played.

While the Punjab Government approved 'Presidential level security' for the week-long World XI series in Lahore, Sethi expressed his desire to host a few games in the other cities too, notably Karachi. ""I have the desire to take some games out of Lahore and host them in Karachi, but everyone I speak to reject that idea. They tell me that we've succeeded in hosting something well in Lahore (PSL 2 final) so keep that going. First host the PSL in Karachi, then we will come there.""

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

""This is my objective. I had given myself a mission statement - to organise PSL, to bring it to Pakistan, to bring international cricket to Pakistan. Game development needs to be done, fund raising needs to be done - and all that we're going to do slowly. And I also want to try to professionalise PCB,"" Sethi said.

Fear to tread: Should the travel advisory for every place on earth be ‘Don’t’?,"Only the date line changes. Exactly a week ago, London, Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Delhi, Islamabad respectfully made way for Barcelona. ‘Mowing down tourists is the new normal’ despaired the Evening Standard while Londoners sat transfixed to the too- familiar photograph of a bloodied avenue. Las Ramblas, the very metaphor of hedonism, had been bustling with carefree crowds when a van emerged like a bat out of hell – driven with a fervour linked to the promise of heaven. The next Monday, a bomb alert evacuated the same stretch.

East and West have met in terror. True, each had had enough of its own, but now it’s of a common genre. What demons – or angels – drive 22-year-olds to get behind a wheel and ram coldly into unsuspecting strangers? And how alert can we be when jihad comes via such everyday objects as a van, kitchen knife – or the tiffin box bombs of Mumbai and Delhi.

This column swells from my time on the Ramblas, my awe over something as civilised as a 1.2 km thoroughfare dedicated to pedestrians, leaving vehicles to fend for themselves on its margins. My first encounter with this incredible boulevard came at an international AIDS conference in 2002. It was where India’s HIV-afflicted finally found their voice, and through which a flamboyant Shatrughan Sinha swaggered as health minister. So the many stories to be filed kept me away from Las Ramblas’s tireless blandishments. But my hotel was right on it, and i went to bed with riffs of laughter and the weeping of violins. In the morning when i walked to catch my tube, it lay exhausted from its multiple orgasms.

Two other visits allowed a more touristy appreciation. Of the Ramblas’s gilded ‘statue’ men, the segueing of the world’s accents, the flowers, food and baubles, the eccentric Gaudi architecture just off it, and suave Hispanics seducing over La Riojas or returning from a late-late concert, the men in long formal skirts (you read that right).

Now in London, my two always-must-dos are also stained by recent attacks: the Borough market and Westminster bridge. But the crowds still mill undaunted. It’s the most effective thumbed-nose to terror. Or so they say.

‘In India-China standoff all sides know that going beyond point of no return will cost everyone and destroy all our dreams’,"As China becomes more aggressive in its external posture, the India-China standoff in Doklam is being watched closely across the Asean region. Thailand’s ambassador to India Chutintorn Gongsakdi spoke to Jiby J Kattakayam about how the border confrontation in Bhutan is being perceived in the wider region, India’s Act East policy and why, despite ancient civilisational linkages, it has taken 70 years of Indo-Thai diplomatic ties for trade and cultural exchanges to enter a higher trajectory:

Does the Indo-China standoff in Doklam on the eastern front worry Asean?

It is a standoff where all sides know that going beyond a point of no return is going to cost everyone and is going to destroy all our respective dreams. I believe that people have the good sense to not go beyond a standoff. Coming from an economics background, it does not make any sense to me for any of these flashpoints to explode.

How do you see the atoll-building activities of China in the South China Sea?

We always like to see countries resolving issues on the negotiating table. It is difficult to have black and white outcomes in border issues, but it has been shown in the past that we can live and work amicably and in the spirit of good neighbourliness. It is not in anyone’s interest in the region or outside for potential flashpoints to explode. People have tested each other, but have not come to blows.

Where is the India-Myanmar-Thailand tri-lateral highway at?

While maritime and air connectivity are important, the highway has great symbolism. The political leadership is visualising our people driving and visiting each other by road. Some road stretches still need improvement. Customs and immigration quarantine facilities still need upgrading. I have been to the border. Trucks queue on the road, taking up valuable space and time. As things stand, the borders cannot support the trade we are visualising.

The highway can also connect India to Laos and Cambodia as well. Border posts and truck stops in Europe and in some parts of Asean are like mini cities. Once the highway is ready we cannot have all these trucks parked along the road creating huge roadblocks.

How are Thailand’s relations with China evolving?

We are a small country. We maintain good relations with all the players in the region. We have a longstanding and strategic relationship with the US. We have a long and close friendship with China. India is a more recent player. The relationship with India has more potential to develop. The relationship with China has developed over the years. As nations grow and find their own place in the global stage, the relationship will also reflect that. Our position is to maintain friendly relations with all and to see them play an appropriate and balancing role in the region.

In the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business index, why is Thailand at 46 and India at 130?

One factor is Centre-state relationships. With GST, India will improve its rank massively next year because it unifies markets. We are unifying the Asean market as well. India is a good example of a government responding to people’s needs through reforms and not protectionism. The other problem which everyone has is corruption. Some Thai businesses ended their investments because of corruption and local people of influence.

We recently had a particularly bad experience with one Indian state. We haven’t given up on that state. The evolving nature of India is such that we do not give up on the country, or a state, but we will return when the state is more ready. We also advise Thai investors to have a local partner. It makes it easier to adapt to local business culture. While there is competition between Indian states, it is important to choose the right state where the chief minister has the attitude and willingness to help business.

How is Indo-Thai trade progressing?

Indo-Thai trade is doing well. It stands at around $7-8 billion per year which appears satisfactory. However, it can improve to $20 billion considering India’s and Asean’s massive markets. Thailand should be seen by India in the context of the Asean market of 600 plus million people. In this context, any country in Asean is a staging point for the whole Asean market.

I find our economies neatly complimenting each other. Manufacturing is our strength and is of interest to India. At the same time, Thailand needs services and information technology where India is ahead. I keep pointing out to Thai stakeholders that India is an emerging power. So my time in India is spent 40% on marketing Asean, 50% on marketing India and 10% on marketing Thailand, because when I am marketing Asean and India, I am serving my country’s interests."
The Hacker Of GoT Season 7 Episode 4 Leaked It Because He Wanted To Please His Girlfriend!,"It happens only in India?!

The first time it happened with the fourth episode of Game of Thrones, the most hyped and loved American series that the entire episode was leaked online before its official release, and it happened in India.

The leaked episode had Star India’s watermark on it, which means that Hotstar who is HBO’s partner in India for airing the episode was responsible for the leak. Later it turned out that Prime Focus Technologies—the agency which manages Star India Private Limited’s data, is the root of the entire problem. Four people were arrested in the same regard and now one of them has revealed how it got revealed.

What was supposed to be a grave severe affair turned out to be rather funnier and realistic, to say the least.

So, now it has been revealed that one of the IT professionals named Alok Sharma who was under arrest in the same regard had sent the episode to his girlfriend in order to please her, and that is from where it was leaked and later uploaded online.

Twitter

“Initially, there were suspicions that one of the accused had accessed the episode as his girlfriend wanted to see it. The girlfriend had then passed it onto others, one of whom uploaded it online,” revealed an official to Indian Express who was part of the probe earlier.

“The investigation is still in progress. However, so far, it appears that they had leaked it for self-consumption. We are now trying to find out who uploaded it online,” another senior officer added.

ytimg.com

According to the report, first Alok had accessed the episode and it is he who shared it with the other four who are also under arrest. Police is trying to find out who uploaded it online.

Meanwhile, hackers responsible for the leak of the sixth episode have warned HBO that the finale episode will also be leaked before the actual air date.

Can Yogi do more for electricity than gau raksha?,"Uttar Pradesh has long been one of the worst administered states. Children’s deaths in Gorakhpur recently hogged the headlines, but are hardly new. Ex-bureaucrat V Ramani has unearthed an RTI response showing that between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2011, 31,791 children were admitted to the Gorakhpur hospital, and no less than 3,745 died, 1,311 of encephalitis. Half the qualified medical posts and 40% of nursing posts were vacant. Similar problems afflict every sector in UP.

Like many predecessors, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to overhaul governance. During a recent visit to Lucknow, two senior bureaucrats told me the Yogi was more serious than any chief minister for decades, and was not simply a Hindutva fanatic. Yet UP’s history has long been one of broken promises and dismal outcomes. Poor governance is deeply embedded, and will resist overhaul.

There are some green shoots. One of the most difficult areas to reform in any state is electricity. Huge subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers have plunged most state electricity boards deep into the red. Chief ministers need to bite the bullet and push through major tariff hikes and reductions in theft.

The Yogi has bitten the bullet. The state has proposed tariff hikes of up to 360% for different categories of rural and urban domestic consumers, the average hike being 22.6%. Industry rates have not been raised at all — the state wants to attract industry, and its rates are already high. This is the very opposite of the populism typical of a new chief minister.

Can UP follow the Gujarat model? There, companies in generation, transmission and distribution all show profits. As Chief Minister, Modi cracked down on power theft, raised tariffs, metered and supplied power to almost all villages, and bifurcated electric feeders to villages. This enabled him to supply 24×7 power for domestic use and six hours per day for agricultural pumps.

Profitable industrial and commercial consumers account for 52% of consumption in Gujarat, against only 30% in UP, which cannot therefore depend on cross-subsidies from industry for farmers. It currently loses Rs 2.07 on every unit of power supplied. Apart from subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers, power theft and corruption are rampant. The state’s Aggregate Commercial and Technical (ACT) losses average 31% across its distribution companies. The Yogi seeks to slash this to 23% in a year, a huge challenge.

Technical losses in transmission should not exceed 8-9% of supply. Anything more represents theft and corruption. ACT loss is a whopping 60% in Meerut, where politically powerful vote banks and industries have long siphoned off power in collusion with corrupt electricity officials.

Checking theft requires strong police support. But police stations in UP are under-staffed and fully occupied with major crimes and public order. They have no time or staff to check electricity theft: unfilled vacancies for constables exceed one lakh.

Yogi’s radical reform proposal is to create one new police station in every district dedicated to checking electricity theft. That can be a game changer. A senior official says, “This is the first government in my time to say we should go after all thieves without exceptions or mercy.” Brave words, but implementation has never been the state’s strong point.

Following court orders, exams are being held to hire one lakh constables. These will be based largely on objective questions in a written exam, not school marks, since cheating is so rampant that school marks mean nothing.

The state’s ‘Electricity For All’ scheme aims to electrify every household by October 2018. That means doubling the current number of connections: an additional 1.12 crore rural and 15 lakh urban consumers are to be covered. Up to 10 lakh diesel gensets of farmers will also be converted to electricity. The Yogi claims rural power supply is up from 12 to 18 hours per day. Grassroots reports suggest substantial improvement though not to the extent claimed. Critics, including buffalo traders and meat processors, say the Yogi is keener on cow protection than electricity.

Officials claim that in four months, the BJP government has metered 3.25 lakh unmetered connections, and provided 12.5 lakh new connections. They say in the April-June quarter, electricity supply rose 18% while revenue jumped 30%, reflecting better collection.

Will this be sustained? Will the BJP resist the temptation to waive rural electricity dues when the next election approaches? Is the Yogi serious enough, and bureaucracy honest and efficient enough, to stop power theft and collect bills? Let’s see. The Yogi’s power reforms have started well, but have miles to go."

"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys — starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka’s resignation on August 18 — need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I’ve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India’s boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect — one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal’s remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn’t end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company’s board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company’s website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn’t, as you didn’t in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here’s my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys’ share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn’t end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka’s pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal’s task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don’t I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren’t needed.

Omkar

"Bill Gates Invests In A Startup That Grows Meat In A Lab, Trying To Solve The World Food Crisis","Bill Gates has joined forced with Cargill Inc, one of the world’s largest agriculture corporations, and other major business, to invest in technology that endeavours to develop meat from self-producing animal cells.

Consumers are demanding more and more protein that’s less reliant on food, grazing land, and water than livestock, and the coalition believes the answer lies with San Francisco-based startup Memphis Meats.

Memphis Meats produces beef chicken, and duck meat directly from grown animal cells, completely bypassing the need to raise and slaughter poultry and cattle. The startup recently raised $17 million in funding from investors like Cargill, the world’s richest man Gates, and billionaire Richard Branson.

“I’m thrilled to have invested in Memphis Meats,” Branson said in an email in response to questions from Bloomberg News. “I believe that in 30 years or so we will no longer need to kill any animals and that all meat will either be clean or plant-based, taste the same and also be much healthier for everyone.”

The move is a response to increasing demand for meat that is organic, and more sustainable than current systems, as well as doesn’t involve cruelty to animals “The world loves to eat meat, and it is core to many of our cultures and traditions,” co-founder and CEO of Memphis Meats Uma Valeti said in the statement. “The way conventional meat is produced today creates challenges for the environment, animal welfare and human health. These are problems that everyone wants to solve.”

Memphis Meats has so far raised a total of $22 million in funding."
Spare the taxpayer: Recapitalisation of public sector banks needs to come with governance reforms,"Financial results of public sector banks for April-June quarter show that they remain fragile. Collectively, they made a loss when their private sector peers turned in profits. This performance was not a one-off. Three years ago, a Reserve Bank of India committee concluded that government as shareholder has suffered negative returns over decades. If this situation prevails in public sector banking, a commercial endeavour, it is because successive governments are able to pass on losses to taxpayers. This cannot continue any longer.

NDA has promised to recapitalise its loss making banks and merge some of the weaker ones with sound banks. This is inadequate to deal with a systemic problem where banks flounder once every decade. Recapitalisation, therefore, must be accompanied by deeper banking reforms or else hapless taxpayers will soon be presented with another bailout bill. The primary cause for the current state of affairs is government’s majority stake in banks. This forces public sector banks to deal with an additional regulatory layer in the form of the finance ministry. This also leads to attendant problems such as banking heads with too short a tenure, low pay scales and fear of multiple investigators scrutinising commercial decisions in hope of unearthing ‘corruption’. A commercial enterprise cannot be run this way.

Around 17 years ago in an earlier NDA government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha proposed lowering government’s stake to 33% which would have removed some constraints public sector bankers work under. This would have provided bankers space to be more nimble and take timely decisions. It is time for current finance minister Arun Jaitley to actualise his predecessor’s plan. The government should also allow banks to rework their recruitment practices and pay scales as they need to attract the best talent in the job market."
"Company Dumps Tons Of Orange Peels On Barren Land, Decade Later It Turns Into A Thriving Forest","Back in 1997, ecologists Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs ventured on an idea that turned a barren land into a thriving forest.

Dan Janzen

Both the ecologist approached a juice company and asked them to dump tons and tons of orange peels, obviously coming from the juice they've churned on the barren land.

The barren land was a nature preserve in the country's northwest region. Over 12,000 metric tons of sticky, mealy, orange peels were then dropped.

Dan Janzen.

The site was then left untouched for over 16 years with a mark for the future scientists to work on it. Timothy Treuer, a graduate was then asked to examine the site after all these years and see how different it is from its surrounding.

Upon his arrival, Timothy was surprised to see that the land where peels were dumped bears no similarity from its vicinity.

Leland Werden

""It was just hard to believe that the only difference between the two areas was a bunch of orange peels. They look like completely different ecosystems,"" he explains, reports Upworthy.

The entire area was thick and thriving with vegetation. Timothy along with other researchers then studied the site over the course of three years and examined the difference. The studies and observations were then published in journals of Restoration Ecology that claimed these discarded fruit parts assisted the area's turnaround.

Dan Janzen.

Compared to its vicinity, which has a single variety of tree, the site had two dozen species of vegetation. In addition to that, it had better soil, greater biodiversity, and well-developed canopy.

""You could have had 20 people climbing in that tree at once and it would have supported the weight no problem,"" says Jon Choi, co-author of the paper, who conducted much of the soil analysis. ""That thing was massive.""

F1 Champ Lewis Hamilton Is All Set To Match Legendary Michael Schumacher’s Record In His 200th Race,"Three-time world champion Lewis Hamilton will start his 200th Grand Prix in Belgium this weekend, seeking to match German legend Michael Schumacher's record of 68 pole positions.

With the summer break out of the way, the British driver will be chasing his fifth win of the season as he bids to claw back points on title-race leader, four-time champion Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari.

AFP

Back in Europe after spending F1's now-traditional European summer break in the Caribbean, Hamilton, who gave up third for his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas in Hungary, lies 14 points behind Vettel.

Hamilton won at Spa in 2015, but was beaten by team-mate and 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg last year and has had mixed results at the famous old sprawling and high-speed circuit.

AFP

In 2008, when he won his first title, he was relegated from first to third for cutting a chicane, and he has suffered in other incidents including a collision with Rosberg, that left him with a puncture, in 2014.

Seeking his third Belgian win, Hamilton will be the pre-race favourite to win again, but knows that Ferrari have regained the momentum in the title race following their dominant one-two finish led by Vettel in Hungary.

AFP

Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff has already warned his squad not to take anything for granted.

""Assumptions are dangerous,"" he said. ""We have seen too many times already this season that the form book can be rewritten from one weekend to the next.

""So we will be making no assumptions.""

The race may also be affected -- as often in the past -- by the capricious micro-climate of the region, which can mean parts of the track are under water in rainfall while others remain dry.

That, for Max Verstappen, may be a bonus as he bids to put a mixed season to date back on the road.

""I just love the track and it'll be nice seeing so many orange fans in the stands,"" said Red Bull's Belgium-born Dutch driver.

""Spa is my favourite track -- you have to get everything right, but when you get a good lap, it's very rewarding.""

That could also be said of Ferrari's second driver Kimi Raikkonen, a four-time Spa winner, who has been confirmed on the team's roster next year.

AFP

""It will not be easy for us, as Mercedes has the horsepower, but we will do what we can and who knows? Let's see what happens.""

A big crowd is expected to camp out and herald Formula One's ""return to work"" from the beach at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix where Stoffel Vandoorne will hope to mark his retention by McLaren with a strong showing in front of his home fans.

Don’t allow Pakistan to get away with false promises now,"By G Parthasarathy

Indians and Afghans went ballistic with joy and Pakistan fretted and fumed after President Trump spelt out his “path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia”. Trump minced no words about Pakistan-sponsored terrorism saying: “Today, 20 US designated foreign terrorist organisations are active in Pakistan and Afghanistan— the highest concentration in the world. For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence and terror”. He added: “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations (like) the Taliban”. He signalled a number of changes in US—Afghanistan policies, warning that it was time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to ”civilization, order and to peace”.

It is clear that the heat is going to be turned on Pakistan by the Americans. The US Congress is proposing to enact a legislation to progressively reduce/cut off economic and military aid and supplies to Pakistan. America’s allies, notably UK, Germany, and Japan will supplement the American effort.

The US will also be enhancing its military presence in Afghanistan. The proposed US Congressional Legislation requires the administration to deny economic and military assistance to Pakistan, if it does not mend its ways.

Trump has indicated that while it “may be possible” to have a political settlement with ”elements in the Taliban”, this can take place only after it ends violence.Secretary of State Tillerson has stated: “This entire effort is intended to put pressure to have the Taliban understand that you will not win a battlefield victory and we may not win one, but neither will you”.

He added: “At some point in time, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end”. Tillerson also made it clear that the US could revoke the status of “Major Non-NATO ally” that Pakistan enjoys, clearing the way for stringent restrictions on arms supplies and economic assistance. It is now evident that the US intends to link arms and economic assistance to Pakistan ending support for terrorism in Afghanistan, through the Taliban and Haqqani network. It is also possible that US drone strike on the Pakistan -based, ISI supported Taliban and its leadership will be stepped up.

How will Pakistan react to these new US policies? Rawalpindi will protest loudly at US policies. The message will be quietly sent to the US that if it turns the squeeze too much, Pakistan will be forced to deny use of its soil to American military supplies and aid to Afghanistan. The aim will be to force the US to cool off on sanctions, by holding out promises of Taliban good behaviour, in the event of the US agreeing to continue economic and military assistance. This is something, which India and Afghanistan should ensure does not happen. There will substantial pressure on the US to agree to an early resumption of “unconditional dialogue” with the Taliban. This should, however, remain conditional on a verifiable end to Pakistan support for cross-border terrorism. China has already made noises of support for Pakistan.

Beijing has made it clear that it will back Pakistan on its position regarding a role for the Taliban, which equates the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Trump has made it clear that India remains a “strategic partner” not just in South Asia, but across the entire “Indo-Pacific” region. The old hyphenation between India and Pakistan has been eroded, but India has to be careful on this score. We also need to bear in mind that Russia, Iran and China have close contacts with the Taliban. Economic cooperation and military training for Afghanistan has to be quickly stepped up.

SC issues show cause notice to BCCI top brass,"BCCI VS LODHA REFORMS

SC issues show cause notice to BCCI top brass

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 08:53 PM

The Supreme Court, on Wednesday (August 23), issued a show cause notice to the top brass of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, namely acting President CK Khanna, secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, asking them to personally appear on September 19 (next date of hearing) and offer their explanation to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) for the continued resistance towards the implementation of the Justice RM Lodha panel reforms.

While the CoA reiterated to the apex court that not a single recommendation had been implemented till date, the Supreme Court asked the CoA to prepare the draft constitution in line with the July 24, 2017 order.

However, the apex court didn't heed to the request made by the CoA in its fifth status report regarding their expulsion.

The hearing on the latest status report submitted by the CoA on BCCI's functioning was originally meant to take place last week, before it was adjourned to Wednesday (August 23).

Earlier, in its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Vinod Rai-led Committee of Administrators was scathing in its criticism of the BCCI. The CoA had called for the expulsion of the current office bearers of the board for non-compliance of the court's orders to implement the Lodha reforms. Taking into account the court's order dated January 2, that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their positions with the board, the CoA requested the three-member bench for the removal of acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry and acting president CK Khanna.

The CoA had also noted that in the absence of a working committee, administrators, and not the office-bearers needed to be given the authority to manage the board's affairs. The CoA had also added that the office bearers were limiting the role of the board CEO Rahul Johri.

Incidentally, during the Special General Meeting (SGM) held on July 26 this year, Johri wasn't allowed to partake in the meeting under intriguing circumstances. Choudhary had then observed that the Apex Court in its judgment dated July 24 had ruled only office-bearers with regard to state associations eligible to attend the SGM. Therefore, the board claimed to have been following the order of the Supreme Court ""in letter and spirit"".

The ruling that was taken into account to deny Johri's participation in the meeting was related to CoA's objection about N Srinivasan and Niranjan Shah attending BCCI's meetings. The apex court had stated on July 24 that only the office bearers of the state associations can attend BCCI's meetings.

CoA had also stated in its report that the board was impeding the implementation of the 'new administrative structure' which is based on accountability and clarity. The Supreme Court, on their part, had asked the BCCI to identify those ""exceptional and extremely limited areas of difficulty"" in relation to implementation of the Lodha reforms.

At its Special General Meeting held on July 26, the BCCI had then said the following needed to be re-examined: one state-one vote policy, the number of members in selection committees (which had been reduced to three from five), the concept of associate membership, the segregation in relation to functions executed by office bearers and paid professionals, disqualifications or restrictions on office-bearers in terms of age cap, tenure, cooling-off period and the formation of Apex Council.

The three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud had given its nod to reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership.

In its Status report, the CoA, however, had quoted Rai and said, ""the heart, kidney and lungs are being taken out of these reforms"" in relation to the board observing that the crux of the reforms approved by the Supreme Court was ""impracticable.""

Last year, in a landmark judgment on July 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had approved majority of the recommendations put forth by the three committee, led by retired Chief Justice RM Lodha. The board, on the other hand, was given a deadline of six months to implement the accepted reforms.

Not Everything Green Is Natural Or Herbal. Watch Akshay Kumar Reveal True Ayurveda,"PARTNER

Bollywood’s torch bearer of fitness and a humble activist, Akshay Kumar believes in talking about anything and everything that is relevant to the masses. From educating people about fitness and self-defense to promoting the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, he has done it all. And once again, Akshay is back with an important message for his fans.

An avid user of Ayurvedic products, Akshay truly believes that Ayurveda is the answer to most of the modern lifestyle problems that we face. Using natural remedies have always been a part of our culture and is the way to go for him. But with the rising trend of using natural products, a number of ayurvedic products have cropped up in the market and not all of them are made using pure ayurvedic means.

In a new commercial for Lever Ayush, Akshay goes all out to point out the naïve ways in which we categorize ayurvedic products like skin care creams, soaps, and toothpaste. He points out that not every product that has a green packing or leaves on its packaging are essentially products made of Ayurveda. In a bid to educate us about the Sahi Ayurveda, Akshay talks about Lever Ayush that makes a range of Ayurvedic products using original, time tested ingredient and recipes from ancient ayurvedic texts and granthas. Lever Ayush brings alive ayurvedic recipes from over 5000 years to help solve modern-day beauty problems with their skin care, hair care, oral care products and soaps. Watch the video to know more!"

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"Vegetarians Not Vegetarian Anymore? Turns Out, Plants Knew All Along They Were Being Eaten","Well, we all know that vegetarians take a lot of pride in the food they eat. They leave no stone unturned when it comes to giving a shit for eating meat as if it's a crime and as if the animals knows they are being eaten.

Well hey vegetarians, in your face because plants know it too.

Leaf&wood

A new research shows that plants know when they're being eaten and they don't like it when you do that. According to o Modern Farmer, a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri claims that all the plants possess some sort of intelligence and know it when you're approaching them to put them in your mouth.

They even send out defence mechanisms to try to stop you from doing that. The study was carried out on thale cress, which is closely related to broccoli, kale, mustard greens, and other members of the family. They are commonly used for experiments because they have genome sequenced, and scientists are intimately familiar with how it works.

vegetables

Researchers took audio recordings to understand vibrations a plant does when it's being eaten. They studied these vibration patterns, that released another shake like wind noise.

Modern Farmer claims ""the thale cress produces mustard oils that are mildly toxic when eaten and sends them throughout its leaves to try to keep the predators away.""

""Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,"" said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU.

""However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found that feeding vibrations signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars,"" he added.

A look into the role of the Port Chairman,"“The chairman of the ports should not merely be involved in the management of a port,” said Amitabh Kant CEO of Niti Aayog. He was speaking during a workshop on ‘Accelerating Sagarmala Implementation, organised by the Ministry of Shipping. He should also be involved in boosting exports, he said. Has the time come for a relook in the traditional role of the Chairman of the Major port of India?

If India were to scale up its exports and reach out to global markets, the ports should not only be linked with the sprawling manufacturing units that have come up around the port, but also be capable of handling non core activities of manufacturing.

Currently the brief of the chairman of a Major port in India is primarily to manage the port and oversee maritime activities that fall within his province. However a number of minor ports or private ports have come up along the peninsular region. The areas around these ports, in Mundra for instance, have expanded industrially, so much so that a considerable volume of exports is generated from these areas. Conversely a substantial volume of imports pass through these ports for the industries around it.

The southeast asian countries had consistently clocked a GDP growth of 10% for a considerable period of time. Much of their development could be ascribed to their policy of port led Industrialisation. The emphasis was on exports to reach the global markets. The domestic consumption alone was not enough to propel the country over the crest to sustain an impressive GDP growth.

In Shanghai and other ports in China, the port manager does not limit his role as its manager. He is responsible for industrialization, manufacturing and export of commodities that take place in the outlying areas around the port. In Shanghai the port Chairman looks upon himself as the man changing China, said Kant.

China has a lower container exporting cost than India, due to proximity of industrialized zone to the port area. The presence of major manufacturing and industrial zones in coastal regions developed as part of the Port-Led Policy of the government.

In Hong Kong, the entire process of production of an item to be exported takes place within the port area. Packaging, labelling, sorting- all the activities take place in the port area. Likewise in the case of re export, the item was imported, value added and then re exported -all activities were done within the port area.

For the first time the ambitious Sagarmala project has Port led Industrialisation, as one of the pillars underpinning its implementation. The programme envisages 14 Coastal Economic Zones. SEZ is being planned at the largest port in India, JNPT. Smart Port Industrial cities are under development at Kandla and Paradip. The port should be the hub, the nerve centre for the entire process of manufacturing activity.

Likewise in the hintertland regions, the Container Freight Stations (CFS) should take on more comprehensive role rather than being mere custodians of the cargo. The CFSs should be bigger in area that could take on the peripheral activities of manufacturing.

All these developments call for an expanded role for the Chairmen of the port or CFS. The time has come to review/amend their functions as administrators to take on a more broader role that would significantly contribute to India’s trade."
Yogi Govt Makes Aadhaar Card Must For Patients Who Need Govt Ambulance Service In UP,"The Uttar Pradesh government has made Aadhaar card mandatory for anyone wanting to avail its free ambulance service. Now, if a patient calls an ambulance to his home, his relative or he will have to produce their Aadhaar card. According to officials, this is being done to clamp down on anomalies in ambulance trips, including duration and distance, which have occurred. The recording of Aadhaar numbers of patients will help reduce fraudulent use of the vehicles. However, with large numbers of people, particularly in rural areas, still without Aadhaar cards, residents are expected to face considerable problems.

PTI/Representational Image

Health department officials pointed out that ambulance services provided by the government had several loopholes and flaws. Drivers sometimes made fake trips and wrote fraudulent details of patients to siphon off money for fuel. The drivers sometimes made fake calls themselves to make the trips. To stop such irregularities, the state government has sent a letter to all chief medical officers of districts in UP stating that Aadhaar is now a must if someone wants an ambulance.

BCCL/Representational Image

Bijnor CMO Suhveer Singh said, ""There are total of 53 ambulances, including those which can be called by dialling 102 and 108, in the district. 'Dial 102' ambulances are reserved for pregnant women, while other patients can dial 108 for an ambulance. No documents were required from the patient to avail the services earlier. Now the state government has instructed us that whenever anyone calls for an ambulance, his Aadhaar card must be produced.""

Representational Image

Singh added, ""The government has not declared the exact date to make Aadhaar card compulsory. For the time being, if a patient's condition is serious and he has no Aadhaar card, he can be carried to hospital. But soon the card is set to be compulsory for all patients.""

However, in the rural parts of the state, Aadhaar cards have still not been made by everyone. With the poor healthcare infrastructure already an issue, residents said the new rule would make the situation even more difficult for patients to reach hospital on time.

Punam Chaudhary, a resident of Puranpur village, said, ""It is a good move to curb corruption in the ambulance service. But if someone does not have an Aadhaar card, what will he do? In villages like ours, ambulances don't even arrive on time and we have to manage on our own.""

Will India shake off its grand delusions?,"‘Tis the season for chest-thumping. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unquestionably on top of the heap. But what a heap it is. Over the past couple of weeks, quite a bit of nasty triumphalism has been on display. Such eruptions need a trigger, and a handy one was provided by the departing remarks of Vice-President Hamid Ansari.

The amount of opprobrium heaped on Ansari was astonishing and disproportionate. Just two weeks before Ansari’s retirement, President Pranab Mukherjee, in his own farewell speech, had said India’s soul resides in pluralism and tolerance. “We may argue, we may agree or we may not agree. But we cannot deny the essential prevalence of multiplicity of opinion. Otherwise, a fundamental character of our thought process will wither away.” Mukherjee also spoke of the rising tide of violence: “At the heart of this violence is darkness, fear and mistrust.”

These are stark and unambiguous statements, but they did not draw the kind of vitriol that Ansari’s “sense of insecurity” remark did. In the days since, the BJP’s op-ed writers have weighed in with what can be charitably described as selective intellectualism. This is happening alongside a continual re-telling of history. Both strands converged in a column by the BJP’s national general secretary Ram Madhav titled ‘Coming Full Circle at 70’.

Madhav wrote about the “genius of our country, which is rooted in its religio-social institutions like state, family, caste, guru and festival”, and went on to rubbish Jawaharlal Nehru’s leadership after independence, comparing him unfavourably with strongmen like David Ben-Gurion in Israel, Mao Zedong in China and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey.

Quoting from a sharp exchange of letters in 1945 between Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru over ‘native wisdom’ and village life as the centrepiece in new India. Nehru was peddling his colonial masters’ views, Madhav said. He ignored the fact that the two men may have differed, but were extraordinarily close – Gandhi did not disavow Nehru as the best choice to lead independent India or waver from naming Nehru his political heir.

Nehru may have been westernised, but he certainly had deep connections with rural India, travelling often into the countryside from his 20s. In the first years after independence, he wrestled with food scarcities, a better deal for farmers, and the abolition of the zamindari system so the share-cropper would get to till his own land. “For the Congress the agrarian question was the dominating social issue and much time had been given to its study and the formulation of policy,” Nehru wrote in The Discovery of India. Twelve years later, the then prime minister wrote to a chief minister: “I would repeat that the keystone of our planning is agricultural production. We can never have surpluses for industrial growth unless these come from agriculture.”

Ironically, to underline his point Madhav quoted a Western writer. “The liberal unease is palpable. Their plight is best described by Edward Luce in his book through a less-used Greek word demophobia — fear of the mob. The mob, humble people of the country, are behind Modi. They are finally at ease with a government that looks and sounds familiar. They are enjoying it,” Madhav wrote.

Madhav is being disingenuous. Luce has used ‘demophobia’ in his new book The Retreat of Western Liberalism to highlight the anxiety of the elites in western democracies. In a recent interview on Vox.com, Luce says that the United States and Britain are more vulnerable to populism because of their triumphalist and complacent stand on their economic and political models, “so it’s not a surprise that wealthier people in the West, who are doing better than they’ve ever done before, are feeling way more demophobic”.

When there was dismay at his apparent endorsement of vigilantism, Madhav responded that he had meant the humble masses, “not the mob in conventional sense”.

In another celebration of cultural nationalism, Delhi University professor Rakesh Sinha criticised Ansari’s ‘binary’ view of majority and minority and noted: “From 2014 onwards, there has been a marked consolidation of saffron politics as India’s political executive is completely Congress-mukt — the offices of president, vice president and prime minister are held by RSS men.”

He quoted Tajamul Hussain, a lawyer and member of the Constituent Assembly, as saying there had never been a tyranny of the majority in India. True – but that was because the subcontinent had allowed itself to be ruled by tiny minorities – the Mughals and the British – for four centuries. In the Assembly, Hussain fought long and hard against a proposal to set aside reserved constituencies for Muslims. This was understandable – he was the only Shia among 31 Muslim representatives from the provinces. On 26 May 1949, for example, Hussain argued that no ‘speck of separatism’ ought to be permitted in the new Indian constitution: “Other minorities will also be encouraged to demand it. Minority within a minority must be logically entitled to it and thus, far from adding and aiding unity, it will only serve to promote separatism and create sectional strife, leading to untold religious, social and political complications.”

The makers of our constitution decided wisely in the end against constituencies reserved for minority religions. That has stood us in good stead. The same Nehru who is now being air-brushed out of our history and political discourse said in the Constituent Assembly on August 14, 1947, hours before independence: “At a time when we are on the threshold of freedom, we should remember that India does not belong to any one party or group of people or caste. It does not belong to the followers of any particular religion. It is the country of all, of every religion and creed. We have repeatedly defined the type of freedom we desire. In the first resolution, which I moved earlier, it has been said that our freedom is to be shared equally by every Indian. All Indians shall have equal rights, and each one of them is to partake equally in that freedom.”

Seventy years after independence, we are still struggling with many of the fundamental questions the Constituent Assembly grappled with. We have still not fulfilled Article 44 in our Directive Principles of State Policy: “The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.” Bigotry and bias still stalk our land. But we deceive ourselves that we are an egalitarian democracy. I remembered Adi Shankaracharya, the genius who in his very brief life (788-820 CE) cemented Advaita philosophy and sanatana dharma (eternal duties) and wrote numerous treatises while criss-crossing India. In his Maya Panchakam (five verses on delusion) the refrain is: “Aghatita ghatana patiyasi maya” (that is the unique effect produced by deceptive delusion). When will we emerge from our delusions?"
Realist strategy: Trump’s new Afghanistan plan puts much-needed squeeze on Pakistan,"In a marked departure from his campaign rhetoric, US President Donald Trump has outlined his new Afghanistan strategy that favours realism over politics. Reversing the previous Obama administration’s approach that was focussed on drawing down American troops, the new plan authorises the deployment of an additional 4,000 soldiers to train and buttress Afghan forces. Trump is right in assessing that a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan would create a vacuum for terrorists, including the Afghan branch of Islamic State (IS), to fill. This is precisely what happened with Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq that led to the rise of IS.

Obama’s Afpak policy didn’t work for a number of reasons. Announcing deadlines for a drawdown made it easy for the Taliban to wait out the Americans. Secondly, it is next to impossible to defeat an insurgency which has safe havens, and Pakistan provided those havens. The new Trump policy seeks to address both. It will not focus on deadlines but on actual ground conditions. Thirdly, Trump put Pakistan on notice for providing safe havens to terror groups. Part of the problem of the US policy in Afghanistan has been Washington’s over-reliance on Islamabad. This has allowed the Pakistanis to shelter terror groups.

Trump has said this situation needs to change. It is in Pakistan’s best interest that it stops providing safe havens and succour to terrorists. If it refuses to do so, the Trump strategy promises that the full panoply of available diplomatic, economic and military instruments will be used in concert to achieve this outcome. Sustained pressure along these lines is bound to yield results. It’s good that Trump has acknowledged India’s role in Afghan stability and development. To buttress the new strategy Trump should also not rock the boat with Iran, which too has a stake in Afghan stability."
"From Shabana Azmi To Farhan Akhtar, Bollywood Applauds Supreme Court's Ruling On Triple Talaq","For long, Muslim women have been fighting against the Triple Talaq attempting to seek justice, and yesterday when the Supreme Court ruled the practice as unconstitutional, it seemed like the women of the nation achieved a milestone in their fight for their rights.

While there were some people who weren’t happy, others hailed the decision of the Supreme Court. And so did the Hindi film industry. From Shabana Azmi to Farhan Akhtar and others, the entire Bollywood industry applauded the decision.

wikimedia.org

“The Supreme Courts judgement against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have religious sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in secular India,” Shabana Azmi told TOI.

Farhan Akhtar also expressed his happiness on the same.

“The way the society is moving forward, the focus that is there on women’s rights and equality, and the fight for gender equality. It is very healthy that such a decision has been made. Now there is a six month window to figure out how it should be translated into a law, I hope it happens. Because it is a very archaic practice, it is time for it to go.”

Several other celebs also tweeted about the SC’s judgement.

"Time for UCC: If unifying India is Modi’s mantra, uniform civil code with minority backing will transform Indian society","The Supreme Court judgment outlawing instant triple talaq was a landmark decision but it also highlights difficulties faced by judges in resolving thorny issues that overlap between civil matters and personal laws. Justices Nariman, Lalit and Joseph took the stand that triple talaq is not integral to the practice of Islam and isn’t protected by Article 25(1) safeguarding religious freedoms. But Justice Joseph disagreed with the Nariman-Lalit view that a colonial-era legislation surrendering “marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq” to personal law regulated triple talaq, and hence must be tested against Article 14 guaranteeing equal protection of the law.

Instead Justice Joseph, like Justices Khehar and Nazeer, reaffirmed that the law applicable to Muslims “shall only be their personal law namely Shariat” and then proceeded to ascertain whether triple talaq was sanctioned by Quran. But should judges be forced into laboured interpretations of religious laws in matters like marriage that fall within the domain of civil law? All three judgments on triple talaq conducted their own inquiries into Muslim laws, on essentially theological issues, and arrived at different interpretations.

For women coping with marital, divorce, inheritance and alimony disputes, vacuum in the statute on grounds of primacy of personal laws is a gross violation of Article 14. Justices Khehar and Nazeer, with qualified support from Justice Joseph, implored Parliament to extend the codification of laws, “an issue of paramount importance”, to Muslims too. But codification of personal laws will not end discrimination if the personal law is fundamentally discriminatory. Even the Hindu codes still have provisions that favour men over women. A Uniform Civil Code (UCC) would bring clarity, cut through the messiness necessitated by dealing with abstruse theological matters, and actualise Article 14’s promise of equality.

But UCC seems tough to achieve in today’s fractious political climate. To bring it closer, every party must drop the selective secularism it currently practises and move towards genuine secularism. This responsibility falls especially heavily on BJP and NDA as they are politically dominant in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is best placed in decades to take the initiative. He has parliamentary backing and his party manifesto promised a UCC if elected. But Modi must first win minority backing by propounding an inclusive agenda in all walks of public life. After GST on the economic front, UCC is the ultimate measure to “unify” Indian society."

7 Fruits That Can Boost Your Iron Levels Similar To How Vegetables And Supplements Do,"The benefits of increasing the intake of iron in your diet are no longer a mystery. From keeping your energy levels high to preventing hair loss or even tackling conditions such as anaemia; we cannot function without adequate levels of iron in our body.

chesterbennington.tk

We've been harping over vegetables like spinach and supplements that boost your intake of iron for decades now. But did you know that not only are some fruits loaded with iron they also help your body absorb it better from other sources. If you’re a lover of fruits though, these are some potent options you can try out:

Raisins

picturebritain.com

This easily accessible fruit is one of the most potent fruit sources of iron, with around 1.6 milligrams of iron in it. Raisins can be mixed with almonds, cashews and pistachios or mixed with sweet dishes.

Figs

fitbody.ro

The beauty about figs is that they can be eaten fresh or dried. Their iron content is amplified when they are soaked overnight.

Dates

media24.az

Not only are these fruits super-sweet a cup (250gm) of dates contain up to 3 milligrams of iron. Add it to salads or sweet dishes like ice creams.

Pomegranates

greek-gourmet.gr

You can literally never get bored of having pomegranates in any form you like every day. Whether it be in a salad or as fresh juice they are loaded with iron and can help you fight blood-related such as anaemia or iron deficiency.

Citrus fruits

slurrpy.com

Although the citrus fruits are an excellent source of vitamin C, the citrus in the fruit is ideal for absorbing the iron in the greens and the nuts.

Tropical fruits

healthexcellence.net

Fruits like guava, papaya, kiwi’s and mango contain copious amounts of vitamin C as well; thereby helping with the absorption of iron.

Berries

wallpapershome.ru

Berries such as raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and especially strawberries are also great sources of vitamin C, which can further help with the absorption of iron."
Is our criminal justice delivery system finally becoming tech-savvy?,"The federalisation, centralisation, or unification – call it what you may – of the country, despite all the divisive political rhetoric and polarising acts, is proceeding on multiple tracks as we speak. The assumption of power by a majority government in 2014 gave impetus to this process. The successful rollout of GST best exemplifies this. There is talk of bringing more entries on the state list to the concurrent list to create centralized processes that ensure economies of scale, uniformity, and “nationalist” outlook. Suddenly, even the Uniform Civil Code looks possible. No less in import and impact is the launch of the Digital Police Project under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) database. This is despite police being a subject in the State List of the Constitution and many states suspecting that CCTNS was a Union ploy to annex their police powers. But good sense prevailed and the imperative of cyber networking progressed, albeit at a slow pace.

CCTNS now allows citizens to register FIRs online, a landmark move which saves complainants, especially those grievously wronged or injured, the suffering and trauma of visiting police stations. In one stroke it inverts the colonial legacy that made the police station an object of fear and resentment and makes it just another public service which citizens can avail of from any location. The Kerala Police admitted as much when it categorized certain police stations as “Jan Maitri” police stations were citizens are guaranteed to receive exemplary courtesy and service from police officers. Feudal tendencies like prostrating before the daroga to plead for registering an FIR now give way to an e-mail alerting the daroga that an FIR has already been lodged without His Majesty’s permission.

The CCTNS will also offer seven other important services in 34 States relating to person and address verification. Verification of employees, tenants, nurses, seeking permission for hosting public events, tracking lost and found articles, and following up on vehicle theft can now take place through CCTNS without mandatory visits to the police station. The home ministry also claimed that police verification of passport applications will also proceed online. Taken together all these measures are convenient and save time for citizens and cops. CCTNS will hopefully ensure foolproof verification of criminal antecedents. This is an important step which can help net repeat offenders like the Uber taxi driver Shiv Kumar Yadav who raped a 27-year-old woman executive and was a suspect in another rape case.

At the launch, Union home minister Rajnath Singh said the CCTNS portal will provide investigators with a complete history of any criminal from anywhere across the country. Often police forces struggle to identify inter-state criminal networks or criminals who ensure that they do not repeat a crime in the same police station precincts to prevent police officers from creating a pattern of crimes. Rajnath also claimed that steps were being taken to integrate different organs of the criminal justice delivery system like the police, courts, prisons, prosecution, forensic laboratories, and juvenile homes through the CCTNS.

This can help significantly expedite trials. Currently, when court issues warrants and summons these are executed through the police. But until the next date of hearing judges and magistrates have no idea whether the summons/warrants have been executed. Often when they return without being executed, hearings become infructuous and have to be adjourned. The case with forensic labs is no different. Trial court judges and police wait inordinately long periods for testing of samples and return of results. A centralized system that can help judicial and police staff monitor progress and demand expedited disposal will help. Equally important is the integration of prisons with courts and police stations. A central system that can coordinate prisoner information, dates of their hearing, number of days, months and years they have lived in prison under trial, or under sentence makes for progressive reform and may help address the unacceptable fact that two-thirds of our prisons are choked by long incarcerated under-trials.

It is important to free police personnel from needless paper work and help them focus on their law and order and crime detection tasks. The CCTNS is not just a digital initiative but can turn around the image of police forces if it meets the vision enunciated by Rajnath Singh. It is important that the data is jealously guarded, does not fall into the hands of hackers, and does not violate the privacy of suspected criminals. While I am not certain whether the colonial legacy of the police force will retreat with digital initiatives like CCTNS such modernisation is always welcome."
Why Men Are More Likely To Be In A Grumpy Mood At Around 2pm In The Afternoon!,"As a guy, you’re prone to be a little a grumpy in the afternoon as compared to in the morning or evening hours. Not because we assume so because science says so!

cementmarketing.com

A recent study claims that men find their mood most slumped at around 2 pm in the afternoon!

Scientists from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia came up with this conclusion after taking the brain scans of men during various times of the day.

yamuzhchina.ru

The reason the researchers stated was due to of the activation of the reward-processing brain regions of the brain at different times of the day.

The findings showed that activation of a reward-processing region of the brain peaks in the morning and evening and dips at 2 p.m.

For the study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the team compared activation of the brain's reward system in young men during a gambling task at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.

trend.ge

They found that activation in the left putamen was lowest in the early afternoon. This finding may parallel the drop in alertness people tend to feel in mid-afternoon, the researchers said.

""While the left putamen had the greatest activation at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., it had significantly lowered activation at 2 p.m.,"" Jamie Byrne from the varsity was quoted as saying to Daily Mail.

""The left putamen is particularly responsive to unexpected rewards, so our data suggest that the brain's reward centres might be primed to expect rewards in the early afternoon and be surprised when they appear at the start and end of the day,"" Byrne added.

Understanding how activity in the brain's reward system changes throughout the day could have implications for depression, substance abuse and sleep disturbances, said Greg Murray from the Swinburne University in Australia.

Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Demonetisation revealed Rs 3 lakh crore black money, says PM @narendramodi https://t.co/LtJmN0RgzE pic.twitter.com/j26ALppVor — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 16, 2017

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

Infosys’s driverless golf cart versus Google’s autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google’s autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, which “rather than simply copy Glaxo’s migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).” The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural — software and hardware — support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."

Placebo As Real Remedy,"Your attitude, lifestyle, mental balance and emotional harmony are the best placebos, writes MUKUL SHARMA



Although mentioned in this column earlier, but to reiterate in a revised context, Norman Cousins was a distinguished editor of the Saturday Review for the better part of 40 years, author, professor, political activist and world peace advocate. During the course of his long career he won several accolades including the United Nations Peace Medal, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and Pope John XXIII’s personal medallion. In 1964, however, his life took an unimaginable turn which was to ultimately make him far more famous — and controversial at times too — than he could ever arguably have been otherwise. After returning from a trip to the former USSR, he fell ill and was diagnosed as suffering from a suddenonset case of the crippling connective tissue disease which is also referred to as a collagen disease. Experts at more advanced clinics confirmed this and added a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as well.He was told he had one chance in 500 to survive and given a few months to live, at that. Now Cousins who dabbled in biochemistry and behavioural medicine from time to time read and discovered that both his disease and the medicines were apparently depleting his body of vitamin C, among other things.



He decided to develop his own recovery programme. Accordingly he did three things. One, he got out of hospital against the advice of his doctors and checked himself into a hotel suite nearby; two, he started watching huge amounts of comedy films like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Candid Camera; and, three, he began taking daily megadoses of vitamin C — way above the recommended dosages and in life-threatening proportions. But within six months he was back on his feet, and within two years he was able to return to his full-time job at the Saturday Review. He chronicled his experiences in the best-selling 1979 book Anatomy Of An Illness As Perceived By The Patient. When Cousins had a heart attack 15 years following his earlier illness,he wondered whether it would be possible to recover from two life-threatening conditions in one lifetime, but he was determined that he could. As he was brought into the hospital on a stretcher following the attack, he sat up and said, “Gentlemen, I want you to know that you’re looking at the darnedest healing machine that’s ever been wheeled into this hospital.” Once again Cousins recovered fully and wrote The Healing Heart: Antidotes To Panic And Helplessness.



He finally died in 1990, ten years after his first heart attack, sixteen years after his collagen illness, and twenty-six years after his doctors first diagnosed heart disease. So what’s the new context we’re talking about here now? Well, since Norman Cousins’time it has been unequivocally demonstrated by experiment after experiment that taking hefty outsized doses of vitamin C could have had no effect whatsoever on ankylosing spondylitis.And though laughter can help boost the immune system, it can’t possibly do so to such a ridiculous extent. The incredible effects had to be the result of the placebo effect where if the patient sincerely believes in the efficacy of a surreptitiously administered fake medicine — it still works. When Cousins was later confronted by this scientific evidence, he simply said that given another similar health problem, he would do exactly the same even if he knew it was a nonfunctional medication. Turns out he wasn’t wrong. Recent research at the Harvard Medical School has shown that even when people know they’re getting a fake medication — like being told upfront that it’s a placebo — they get better nonetheless and actually prefer it over what physicians would normally prescribe. It seems one’s attitude, lifestyle, outlook,mental balance and emotional harmony make the best placebo of them all.Yoga teachers and Zen masters have been saying the same thing all along.¦"

"Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar mastermind Pallekele miracle","INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar mastermind Pallekele miracle

Kaushik Rangarajan • Last updated on Fri, 25 Aug, 2017, 12:25 AM

Dananjaya picked up 6 for 54 leaving India reeling at 131 for 7 before Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar guided the team home. © AFP

Just like that, Kandy found its voice. A small group that had joined the beeline to leave the picturesque stadium rushed back to their seats. On the field, bodies in deep blue jerseys cascaded atop one another. When the cameras eventually caught a glimpse of young Akila Dananjaya, he offered a beaming, toothy smile.

KL Rahul became the third Indian batsman - after Kedar Jadhav and Virat Kohli - to be bowled by a Dananjaya wrong-un in the 18th over of the chase. Something extraordinary had transpired. India had fallen to 119 for 5. But something more utterly implausible was to follow. Something that would have made Sir Alex Ferguson exclaim, 'Cricket, bloody hell'.

India took a 2-0 lead in the five-match series as was widely anticipated before the game and when Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan put on their 11th century stand for the first wicket. But they got to the target, in a manner very few enviosioned. MS Dhoni - yes, him again - and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (58 not out) put on a miraculous unbeaten 100-run eighth-wicket stand that annulled Dananjaya's six-wicket wizardy before that. When Dananjaya took the sixth wicket with India at 131 for 7, their end seemed nigh and Sri Lanka's drought looked set to finish at last. When he returned a couple of hours later, the dip mysteriously disappeared and the wrong-un sat up for Bhuvneshwar to slap home a couple of boundaries to leave India 14 runs away.

By all means, this was an epic ODI, truncated to a 47-over chase after a brief spell of rain between innings. It was cruel to see a 23-year-old spinner, who'd helped his team belie their status as whipping boys and sent thousands in the stands and the grass banks into raptures, walk off with his head down. His bag of tricks had sent India spiralling into a dizzying collapse and thus he deserved all the hugs and the player of the match trophy that came his way at the end of the game.

Only 22 overs had been bowled when Axar Patel missed a skidder to be trapped LBW to become the seventh Indian wicket to fall. So purely from a time perspective, the story of Pallekele, 2017 had enough time for another chapter. And so, Bhuvneshwar joined forces with Dhoni in an attempt to script it.

They batted and batted, ignoring the fact that there was such a thing called a boundary. A nudge to the leg followed by a tap to the off. That Sri Lanka kept two of Dananjaya's overs for later helped. What also helped was the Sri Lankan pacers' benevolence. Malinga (none for 49 in 8), Vishwa Fernando (none for 32 in 6.2) and Dushmantha Chameera (none for 45 in 7) offered little in terms of control, forcing Upul Tharanga to slowly move his fielders from single-saving positions. The trio also contributed to 12 of Sri Lanka's 14 wides thereby allowing easy dissipation of pressure.

That Dhoni didn't see the need to farm the strike over at any point in the chase allowed Bhuvneshwar to grow in confidence through the innings. By the end, he was slog sweeping Gunathilaka for six over midwicket and rocking back on the backfoot to drive Dananjaya's leg break through extra cover. The partnership had it's moment of fortune too, after Dhoni was reprieved with the heavy zing bails refusing to dislodge despite getting the ball rolling back and hitting the base of the stumps after a failed Dhoni front-foot defence. He was on 30 then but more importantly, Bhuvneshwar was on 14 and still just about finding his way

For a long time in this nine-hour classic, this game seemed like another of dispiritingly one-sided games that have so become the norm in the series. More so when Rohit shrugged off his Sri Lanka hoodoo his fastest ODI fifty (off 43 balls). India were 109 for no-loss and heading home with room to spare before the first of the unthinkables happened. Gunathilaka, the part-time left-arm spinner, denied Shikhar Dhawan his seventh successive 50+ score against Sri Lanka when he had the southpaw caught brilliantly by a diving Angelo Mathews at short fine-leg for 49. The other six, including the opening partnership breaker, came courtesy Dananjaya's wizardry.

Rohit reviewed in hope to missed sweep and took with him the only available review. India tweaked their batting order to send KL Rahul and Kedar Jadhav at Nos. 3 and 4 only to see them cleaned up by Dananjaya, who between these two scalps also had Kohli fall to his mystery. An over later, a dumbfounded Hardik Pandya danced down the pitch and was stumped. It proved futile at the end as Dhoni took control of another chase with Sri Lanka struggling to back the 23-year-old's efforts.

If it's some consolation, although Sri Lanka would pay no heed right now, two of the hosts' three new inductees for this game (Dananjaya and Milinda Siriwardana) came so close to playing the decisive hand in the game. The hosts though did their recent reputation of indulging in self-destructive tendencies little harm as they let slip another strong start from Niroshan Dickwella with their strange shot selection. After slipping to 121 for 5, Siriwardana scored a run-a-ball 58 in a 91-run stand with Chamara Kapugedara to take Sri Lanka closer to a 250-plus total. That they fell short of what could have been a potentially match-winning total was Jasprit Bumrah's sensational final spell. The seamer, bowling his assortment of yorkers and slower deliveries, finished with 4 for 43 and Sri Lanka finished with 236 - a total that proved to be beyond their defence even after a dream spell from Dhananjaya.

Brief scores: Sri Lanka 236/8 (Milinda Siriwardana 58, Chamara Kapugedara 40; Jasprit Bumrah 4-43, Yuzvendra Chahal 2-43) lost to India 231/7 (Rohit Sharma 54, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 53*, MS Dhoni 45*; Akila Dananjaya 6-54) by three wickets (D/L/S Method).

"Morocco’s Africa Vision: Shun politics, shared development is key to continental prosperity","The recent speech of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and People – an important event in Moroccan history – laid out a grand vision for Africa. It will be recalled that Morocco returned to the African Union (AU) earlier this year after more than three decades of self-imposed exclusion. But the Kingdom’s return to the African institutional family is not going to be an end in itself. This is something that King Mohammed made amply clear in his speech that dwelled on the need to unite Africa for shared security and prosperity.

King Mohammed said, “Now is the time for action. And Morocco keenly looks forward to continuing the efforts it has been exerting in Africa for more than fifteen years”, adding further, “Reintegration into the AU is but the start of a new era of joint action with all African countries in order to build a genuine, solidarity-based partnership, ensure – together – our continent’s development and meet the needs of African citizens. We are currently in the process of building an Africa that believes in itself, is committed to solidarity and rallies behind concrete projects while being open to its surroundings”. In fact, Morocco has been championing South-South cooperation for some time now. The idea here is to build mutually beneficial partnerships and find African solutions for African problems.

The implied meaning of King Mohammed’s speech is that Morocco’s return to the AU will galvanise the institution as the Kingdom will leave no stone unturned to facilitate common development, transfer of knowledge and boost intra-regional investments. Morocco has already demonstrated its resolve in this direction by conceptualising and actualising significant development projects like the proposed Morocco-Nigeria Trans-African gas pipeline, the construction of fertiliser plants in Ethiopia and Nigeria, and the myriad human development initiatives in the countries of the Sahel.

Why is this important? Africa is the place from where the next global growth push will come. The continent’s rising middle class combined with improving governance structures lays the foundation for solid consumption/investment-driven development. However, there are challenges that Africa must overcome first. These range from security threats and political instability to basics such as insufficient food production and clean drinking water. But today the technology is available for Africa to leapfrog some of the stages of development and catapult itself into a veritable growth hub. It is here that Morocco’s technical knowhow and experience come in handy.

What Morocco is seeking to do is plug the gaps in Africa’s development. It’s doing this through boosting fertiliser production in sister African nations, strengthening healthcare facilities in partner countries, and financing entrepreneurship in brotherly states. Further, it has been providing huge scholarships to African students as an investment on the youth of the continent. All of these measures go to show that Morocco is serious about shared African prosperity and will continue to power African growth from within the AU.

African nations ought to realise that they can’t succeed as individuals. The only way they can move forward is through genuine win-win partnerships. Hence, they would do well to heed Morocco’s vision for Africa, set aside differences and artificial disputes, and fulfil their destiny as a continent of prosperity."
Samsung Just Launched The Successor To The Galaxy Note 7 With A Massive Price Tag!,"After scores of leaks, rumours, and lots of hype, Samsung finally launched its latest flagship yesterday, the Galaxy Note 8. The device is a thing of beauty with a gigantic display, rounded edges, and the S Pen stylus that’s a joy to use. But there’s a major problem that could hinder Samsung in certain markets.

Look but don't touch

We’re talking about the price of course, the Galaxy Note 8 starts at a base price of $930 (approximately Rs 60,000) in the US. That price is obviously expected to be higher once the device hits Indian shores, likely somewhere in the Rs 65,000 to Rs 70,000 region. The question is, is Samsung’s flagship worth it?

The Galaxy note 8 features a 6.3-inch QHD+ (1440x2960) Super AMOLED display, with a 12MP dual camera system on the rear and a 8MP f/1.7 selfie camera. Of those rear shooters, one is a f/1.7 wide angle lens, and the other is a f/2.4 telephoto lens. The device packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in the US, or a Exynos octa-core processor everywhere else, paired with 6GB of RAM and 64GB (US), 128GB, or 256GB of internal storage. It runs on a 3300mAh battery, and has USB Type-C, wireless charging, Bluetooth 5.0, and LTE support.

So, the question here is, do all of those features justify Samsung pricing the Galaxy Note 8 at Rs 60,000? Perhaps.

The perfect honeymoon and the agile stump master

Dickwella vs Bumrah

In the first match, Niroshan Dickwella had scored a half-century but had also struggled against Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the initial stages. There were plenty of edges and plays and misses for the left-handed Sri Lankan opener, who was living dangerously. But having a fifty under one's belt can do wonders to a batsman's confidence. Barring an inside edge off the first delivery, off Bhuvneshwar, Dickwella was pretty much in control of his shots. A short-arm jab over mid-on earned him his first boundary and he also hammered a couple of sixes off Bumrah. But the shot of the day was his four off Bumrah that came in the fourth over. The batsman backed away and the bowler, identifying that, tried to cramp him for room. But Dickwewlla managed to execute a shot that would have made the likes of Brian Lara proud. It was just a punch off the back-foot with the bat perpendicular to the ground and the end result was the ball racing past point and rocketing to the fence. But his entertaining innings came to a premature end and it was Bumrah who had the last laugh in the contest. Dickwella again tried to back away and Bumrah followed him again but this time, foxed him with a slower delivery and had the batsman flick the ball tamely to square-leg.

The stump master

Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a wicketkeeper par excellence, especially when it comes to his stumpings. Be it keeping to the likes of Harbhajan Singh, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja or the latest bunch like Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, one thing that the bowlers are assured - if a batsman steps out and misses the ball - is a dependable entity behind the stumps. Only two wicketkeepers have effected more than 90 stumpings in ODIs and Dhoni is one of them. Today, he equalled Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara's record of most stumpings in ODI cricket. Dhanushka Gunathilaka stepped out of the crease in an attempt to take on Chahal. But so far down the wicket had he come that the batsman ended up yorking himself and missed the ball. Meanwhile, Dhoni appeared to be blind-sided a bit and fumbled with his first take. But he managed to regain control of the ball quickly and brought down the bails well in time to record number 99 on his wicketkeeping resume in the stumping section.

Mixed day for Pandya

The first ball that he bowled, when he was introduced into the attack at the start of the 11th over, was a short one that travelled well over the bowler's head. Luckily for him, the umpire did not signal a wide. But persisting with his short tactics, Pandya conceded two wides. Yet, his idea materialised when he managed to send back Tharanga with a full delivery after a few short ones. While that was a moment of joy for the Indian all-rounder, some disappointment followed. Having been struck for a four by Angelo Mathews in the 28th over, Pandya went down in pain, having some trouble with his left calf. After the physio attended to him, he was back on his feet and bowled the next ball, only to walk off the field soon after. Even when he was back on the field in the latter part of the first innings, Pandya was still struggling, his movements while fielding being hampered by cramps. Nevertheless, he was still diving around and trying to save runs for the team, although he didn't bowl another over in the day. When he would later come out to bat, Pandya got out for a duck for the first time in his career.

The same old story

In the first ODI, after a strong start, the Sri Lankan batsmen failed to consolidate, throwing away their wickets in a jiffy after attempting ill-advised shots like sweeps, reverse-sweeps and jumping down the track. It was no different in the second game too as their shot selection caused their downfall. While Dickwella was done in by some clever thinking from Bumrah, the ones that followed gifted their wickets away. While dancing down the wicket led to Gunathilaka's departure, Upul Tharanga seems to choose different ways to get out. Having fallen to a full-toss in the first game, the Lankan skipper played away from his body with no movement of his feet, a basic mistake that led to an edge to second slip. And then came out the sweep, to a full straight delivery from Chahal, causing Kusal Mendis to be trapped in front and the batsman also needlessly ended up depriving his team of their review. Mathews followed a short while later, failing in his attempt to execute a sweep to a full delivery from Axar Patel. The basics of playing straight, waiting for the ball, rotating the strike, etc. seemed to be lost on the Sri Lankan top-order batsmen before Milinda Siriwardana reminded them of that with a run-a-ball 58. But the damage was done already and the left-hander's knock only ensured that Sri Lanka bettered their first ODI efforts by 20 runs and batted their full quota of overs.

Unmatched efficiency from unsung heroes

During the course of the first innings, a few dark clouds passed over the Pallekele stadium, threatening to disrupt the match. The groundsmen, watching all the action by the sidelines, remained alert. Sometimes sitting down and watching the game with one eye above and sometimes standing up with their hands on the covers, waiting to swoop in at a hint of a rain drop, the groundsmen were going through their routine. And then during the innings break, a small drizzle began and in no time, the full force took over, covering the entire ground in a jiffy. They had to wait for a while to remove the covers - a slight but persistent drizzle putting things on hold - but once it stopped raining completely the groundsmen were just as efficient in removing the covers to let the players take centre stage again.

A bowler on the wane

There were two shots that stood out at the start of India's reply. The first one was a nonchalant flick off Rohit Sharma's bat which travelled over mid-wicket, and such was the timing that the ball cleared the fence with ease. The second was a full delivery which was craved away past the point fielder by Dhawan, again with supreme timing. At the receiving end on both occasions was Lasith Malinga, whose fortunes have been on the wane in recent times. It was an unimpressive first spell from the slingy pacer, who continued to leak runs as India got off to a good start yet again. In the first seven overs, six fours and a six were scored by the Indian openers, with Malinga alone conceding four fours and a maximum, going for 32 overs in his first four overs upfront. When he came back to bowl later in the innings, Malinga managed an economical over before straying all over the place, conceding three wides in an over.

Rohit ends a lean patch

Before this match, Rohit, in his last 10 innings in Sri Lanka, had reached double digits only once, which was a score of 11 seven years back. ""I have had some good times against Sri Lanka and at the same time I have had some terrible times against Sri Lanka, in 2012 which I clearly remember,"" Rohit had mentioned before the ODI series.Keen to make amends, having failed to do that in the opening ODI, Rohit went about his task steadily and free-flowingly as he always does. His innings was glittered with varied hues of shot-making. A flick for a six off Malinga, an audacious scoop shot off Dushmantha Chameera that went over the boundary and throwing his bat at one that again travelled over the fence, Rohit's three sixes had variety written all over. So too were his fours, be it punches to the off side, going down the ground, or a short-arm pull. These were some of the shots Rohit played to bring up his second ODI fifty in Sri Lanka in 23 games here. Although he fell soon after, he did manage to end his string of below-par performances in Sri Lanka and set a possible template going forward in this series.

A remarkable honeymoon

Virat Kohli wasn't even padded up and was seen having tea in the dressing room when Rohit made his way back after becoming Akila Dananjaya's first scalp of the day. Little would the captain or India have fathomed what would follow. KL Rahul came in at No. 3, and after Dhawan fell to Siriwardana - thanks to an acrobatic effort from Mathews - it was Kedar Jadhav who made it to the crease. And then followed a remarkable 18th over by Dananjaya. Jadhav failed to pick a wrong 'un, Kohli too couldn't read the bowler, as was the case with Rahul. All three witnessed their stumps being disturbed, off alternate deliveries in the same over. The bowler wasn't finished yet - Pandya came down the track, played down the wrong line and was out stumped as Dananjaya picked up his maiden fifer and went on to pick up his sixth with an off-spinning action, producing a slider to send back Axar. Six wickets when he should have been honeymooning elsewhere. Yes, that's right - he only got married last night. Here was a newly wed, joining the team's cause and triggering a collapse of epic proportions, leaving the opposition bamboozled with his mix of off-spin and wrist spin. Sadly for Dananjaya, his efforts went in vain as Dhoni's finishing prowess came to the fore and India unearthed a new batting hero in Bhuvneshwar.

De Villiers gives up ODI captaincy; available to play all three formats

South African batsman AB de Villiers has stepped down as the captain of the One-Day International side with immediate effect. With so much speculation surrounding his Test future, de Villiers also made it clear on Wednesday (August 23) that he will be available to play in all three formats of the game from late September when South Africa begin their home season.

He last led South Africa in ODIs during the Champions Trophy in May-June, which ended in major disappointment as the side couldn't even make it past the Group Stages. Following the tournament, he had to fill in temporarily for Faf du Plessis as the T20I skipper for the series against England.

Making the announcement through a video released on his app, de Villiers felt that it was time for someone else to take over the role. He also pulled his weight behind Faf du Plessis, who has done a good job leading the Test and T20I teams.

Looking forward to a great summer #ProteaFire pic.twitter.com/yojybIrvjZ — AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) August 23, 2017

""Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I've informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,"" de Villiers said. ""It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for somebody else to lead the ODI team forward.""

There has been a lot of speculation and even disappointment among fans, about him opting out of Test matches. It has led to much concern over his future in the longest format of the game. De Villiers last played a Test in January 2016, against England, and has since been unavailable due to either injury or workload concerns. Addressing those doubts, de Villiers completely dismissed suggestions that he was putting himself before the team.

""A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,"" de Villiers stated. ""Over the past year or so, I've tried to manage my commitments. I've felt mentally and physically tired. Playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll. Together with Cricket South Africa, we've tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say that I'm picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas and even to suggest I'm somehow putting myself before the team. This is simply not true. Playing for South Africa is and will always be the greatest privilege of my life.

""Following this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived. I want to get back on the field and I have assured the national selectors that I'll be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly. But I'll be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.""

South Africa's next assignment is against Bangladesh, when they come touring in late September. The tour begins with a two-Test series, followed by three ODIs and two T20Is.

"During Arguments On Aadhaar Card, Govt Tells SC That Right To Privacy Not A Fundamental Right","The Centre has told the Supreme Court since privacy was multifaceted, it could not be treated as a fundamental right.

Attorney General K K Venugopal who on Thursday resumed his arguments before a nine-judge bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar, stressing that it was not a fundamental right.

""There is no fundamental right to privacy and even if it is assumed as a fundamental right, it is multifaceted. Every facet can't be ipso facto considered a fundamental right,""

Venugopal told the bench, which also comprised Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Abhay Manohar Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer.

He said ""informational privacy"" could not be a right to privacy and it could not ever be a fundamental right.

The Attorney General had on Wednesday told the bench the right to privacy could be a fundamental right, but could not be ""absolute"".

The contentious issue of whether the right was a fundamental one was referred to a larger bench in 2015 after the Centre underlined two judgements delivered in 1950 and 1962 by the apex court that had held it was not a fundamental right.

The apex court had earlier observed the State could seek information such as details on the number of children a woman had, but but at the same time could not force her to answer a question on how many abortions she'd had.

The court had asked the AG the difference between the right to privacy being considered a common law right and a fundamental right.

He had replied that the common law right could be enforced by filing a civil law suit and if it was considered a fundamental right, the court could enforce it like any other writ.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, while representing four non-BJP ruled states -- Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab and Puducherry -- had Wednesday argued that these states supported the contention that the right to privacy be held as fundamental in the age of technological advancements.

Giving the example of the Global Positioning System (GPS), Sibal had said the movement of person could be tracked and misused by the State as well as by non-State actors.

The apex court had on July 18 set up the Constitution bench after the matter was referred to a larger bench by a five-judge bench.

The petitions had claimed the collection and sharing of biometric information, as required under the Aadhaar scheme, was a breach of the ""fundamental"" right to privacy.

‘SC’s decision will liberate Muslim women … if Parliament wants to reform personal laws it has full rights to do so’,"Arif Mohammad Khan famously quit in protest as minister of state in the Rajiv Gandhi government after the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986, which overturned the Supreme Court’s historic Shah Bano judgment giving maintenance to a divorced Muslim woman. He made an impassioned parliamentary defence of the Shah Bano judgment, the last such landmark case on Muslim women preceding the Supreme Court’s latest 3:2 judgment which has ruled instant triple talaq as unconstitutional, before resigning. Khan spoke to Rohit E David and Nalin Mehta on how ‘talaq-e-biddat’ violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women, gender equality and reforms in Muslim personal laws:

How do you read the Supreme Court’s judgment on triple talaq?

The abolition of triple talaq by the Supreme Court is a big victory. I welcome this verdict. I honestly feel that we are not in a position today to make a realistic assessment of the positive fallout this judgment would have on the future of Muslims.

If a divorce between a Muslim man and woman has to happen, it will take place. The real problem was that a Muslim girl grows with this consciousness that after marriage her husband can turn her out of the house by simply saying triple talaq. This was really oppressive for Muslim women. This apparent law on triple talaq had distorted the minds of the Muslim world. Now, they will see a new Muslim community growing up in India which will not have the fear of triple talaq among them.

With the abolition of this law, Muslim ladies will have the courage to report against their husbands, if they abuse or mistreat them.

Is the Supreme Court’s ruling that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women a great victory for progressive Muslims?

This is a great victory for every Muslim woman. The Supreme Court has held this decision to be arbitrary. Now, when it comes under the arbitrary category, this cannot come under the fundamental rights of a Muslim. I have not read the judgment in detail but there is six months’ time for the government to bring up detailed legislation.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been opposing the abolition of triple talaq. Do you think they are on the wrong side of history?

In 1986, their decision was different but in the Supreme Court whatever Kapil Sibal has said on their behalf, particularly the affidavit which was submitted when the arguments were concluded, is different. They have also recognised that it was an unjust practice and they want to abolish this practice.

The Muslim Personal Law Board had said that Parliament has the authority. If it wants to reform the laws, it has full rights to do so. Their new stand is totally different from the position they took in 1986.

Isn’t this decision a great step for gender equality?

Yes, absolutely. It will not only liberate Muslim women from the threat of triple divorce but it will also impart a sense of equality and empowerment.

Doesn’t this judgment by the apex court make Indian Muslim personal law more compatible with personal laws relating to marriage and divorce in orthodox Islamic countries?

Of course. Almost all Muslim countries have already got rid of this practice. Triple talaq was undoubtedly part of their practices earlier. Now, this law finds no standing in any court. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh which had the same laws on triple talaq had reformed their laws in the 1990s. It was high time, and thankfully India has done this now.

The last time triple talaq was held problematic in the Shah Bano case, it was overturned by Parliament and you resigned. Have your views been vindicated?

I don’t look at this whole issue from the view point of my personal vindication. I’m very happy that oppression and suppression which was being practised in the name of religion has come to an end.

Do you think that a section of Muslim clerics is holding back progressive reforms?

Try to understand the Muslim religion. My message is we should not hold back progressive reforms."
Watch A Cyber Security Team Hack An Adorable Robot And Turn It Into A Tomato-Stabbing Psycho,"Elon Musk and other leaders in robotics have already warned the world about what kind of damage rogue robots can do, but this video indicates the problem could be much worse.

If the footage is to be believed, a team from cyber security research firm IOActive hacked into a home assistance robot and turned it into the nightmare from a slasher horror flick.

Alpha 2, produced by UBTech in China, is an adorable little bot designed to help around the house in a small capacity. What IOActive did is update the bot’s firmware by accessing the USB port on its back, and tweaking it to give them control of its functions. So yes, the most explicit way to demonstrate that probably would be with flashing red eyes, an evil cackle, and a load of tomato stabbing.

The worst part is that the Alpha 2’s Android OS doesn’t use code-signing to verify the signature of the update being installed, making the entire process ridiculously easy. It’s how any average hacker could gain access to your Internet-connected device, and install a malware of their choice.

“This attack serves as an example of how dangerous these systems can be if they are hacked,” IOActive’s principal security consultant Lucas Alpa said in a post. “Manipulating safety limits and disabling emergency buttons could directly threaten human life”

So if you think a loophole in an AI’s code making it go rogue is the bigger problem in the future, there are also malicious actors looking to actively sabotage your robots."
Google Is Smartly Using A Medical Quiz In Search Result Cards To Help Diagnose Depression Query,"Most people who suffer from depression never get the help they need, sometimes because they don’t even know what they’re dealing with is a medical condition and not just “the blues”.

Now, Google is determined to increase the number of depression sufferers worldwide who get help.

Starting today, it’s offering a professionally-backed anonymous questionnaire online, that lets you know if you show depression markers.

Validated by medical professionals, the quiz shows up on the results page when you search for information about depression. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it can let you know whether you should seek a professional consult. More importantly, it raises awareness of the condition and encourages viewers to seek help.

The questionnaire looks to achieve similar results to other companies’ initiatives; Facebook is testing a neural network that could detect suicidal tendencies from posts and comments, while Instagram recently began offering support to users when friends report worrisome posts.."
"Food Is Going To Be Flying Through The Skies In Iceland, Thanks To This Drone Delivery Service!","Even as Amazon experiments with drone deliveries in the US, Iceland is about to flag off drone delivery within its borders.

It’s interesting to note that the company responsible for that to happen doesn’t even make drones!

Israeli-based drone logistics company Flytrex partnered with a local on-demand goods service AHA in Reykjavik, to set up a small delivery route in the country’s capital.

Flytrex doesn’t make the drones that’ll conduct the deliveries. Instead, it’s responsible for enabling the service itself. The company has spent the last few years working with local policy framers and authorities, training AHA employees, and setting up a cloud-based network to run the drone service.

Because this is a trial run, there’s only one delivery in the works right now. Flytrex and AHA will be using a hexacopter to fly food and other goods across a bay that drivers normally have to drive around. A driver from AHA will bring the goods to one side of the bay, where it will be loaded onto a drone, flown across the bay, and then loaded onto another truck to complete the journey. The entire delivery, which would normally take hours, could be completed within minutes.

The modified drones being used can carry packages up to 3kg across 10 kilometres, though this particular trial only requires them to travel 2 km. The setup is perfect for AHA, which usually delivers things like groceries, food, and alcohol. There’ll be about 20 of these deliveries every day, until they can be expanded to multiple routes around Reykjavik by the end of the year."
Seeing rail safety as a systemic factor,"Yet another rail accident points to the pressing need to revisit the issue of safety from an organisational perspective. As former General Manager Sarabjit Arjan Singh said on this page (February 11, 2017), the Railways must move away from inquiring into the chain of events that led to an accident to identifying what, in the structure and functioning of the organisation, led to decisions that produced the accident. Human error is identified as the culprit in most inquiries. But why do Railway humans err repeatedly in this disastrous fashion? Does the Railways specialise in recruiting bad apples?

In the recent Utkal Express derailment, the tracks under repair were not closed for traffic, and the train was allowed to speed along. In the Kaifiyat Express accident, a dumper was left on the tracks. A culture of safety is conspicuous by its absence. Once the Railways operate more trains than the tracks can handle, complete with the capacity reduction that accompanies periodic track repairs, its minders are constantly called upon to make trade-offs between safety and making the trains run on time. Block off traffic, so that the track can be repaired thoroughly, or do a hasty job of the repair so as to spare Railways the flak for late trains? If someone gets the trade-off wrong, it is easy to send him off on leave or premature retirement. But what of the decision to allocate less money to extending track capacity and more to running new trains, while the overall budget for investment stands constrained because of the fear of raising fares? There is little point in fixing blame on some individuals.

Just as sending a hundred satellites into space makes India’s brand value rise, frequent rail accidents dent it too. It is in everyone’s interest to overhaul the culture of the Railways to make safety an integral part of all decisions."
Her Past With Ranbir Is The Reason Why Katrina Asked Makers To Change Title Of Her Next Film!,"Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma's next with Aanand L Rai has been in news since very long. The trio, who was last seen in Jab Tak Hai Jaan is coming together for another film and the project was initially titled Katrina Meri Jaan, claim reports.

Pinterest

However, just a few days ago, it was confirmed that the title of the film has changed. Katrina clarified rumors related to the film and said,

Tiger shoot ......... 44 degrees 😎 play time with @biancahartkopf and @zahirabbaskhan A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) on Aug 4, 2017 at 9:41pm PDT

“I play an actress in the film, but I don’t play myself. I’m not Katrina Kaif. My character has a different name in the film. So, it obviously cannot be called Katrina Meri Jaan.”

But now reports claim that it was Katrina who wanted to change the title of the film. It was after noticing the similarities between her real life, her affair with Ranbir Kapoor that Katrina didn't want her name to be used in the title since she didn't want people to notice that it was based on her life.

Constantly torn between "" if it's meant to be it will be "" and "" if you want it go get it "" ..... 🤔 A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) on Aug 14, 2017 at 12:42am PDT

A DNA report has quoted a source saying, ""Especially, because the character of the actress in the film goes through a terrible breakup with her actor-boyfriend. Given that Ranbir and Katrina’s breakup is still being talked about, she wasn’t comfortable with the similarities being drawn between her reel and real life. It was too close to reality, so she requested Aanand to use a different name for her character.”

And that's when the entire team of the film was convinced and decided to not name the film Katrina, Meri Jaan. Umm, okay then. We understand the x-factor here, Kat!

"Triple Talaq: Time to divorce religion from inequality, exploitation and discrimination","The verdict of a five-member bench of the Supreme Court – the members representing five different faiths – marks a milestone in India’s legal history and has been widely hailed by all those who acknowledge that inequality, exploitation and discrimination, on the basis of gender or religion or social mores, has no place in a society which proudly proclaims itself to be the world’s most populous democracy.

The judgment, delivered by a 3:2 majority, ruled that triple talaq was open to ‘arbitrary and whimsical’ misuse and violated Muslim women’s constitutional right to equality.

Though two of the five judges recorded dissenting remarks – citing Article 25 of the Constitution which guarantees the fundamental right to religious freedom – it was deemed that triple talaq, whereby a man can divorce his wife by merely repeating the word ‘talaq’ three times, was not an integral part of Islam and as such could not be defended on the grounds of the liberty to follow the faith of one’s choice. Indeed, Islamic states like Pakistan and Bangladesh have abolished the practice.

The government is said to be unlikely to ban triple talaq, but in individual cases the matter can be taken up courts of law.

The SC ruling comes as a political plus point for the BJP government, and could prove to be a stepping stone to introducing a uniform civil code, which has long been on the lotus party’s agenda.

Even those who disagree with the BJP’s saffron ideology will agree that a common civil code, which doesn’t discriminate between religions, is not only appropriate but necessary in a polity which deems itself to be a secular republic.

While a consensus about a common code needs to evolve within the Muslim community, the debate should not be restricted to those of that particular faith but should involve all citizens of our diverse society which is bedrocked on the right to universal equality.

A common civil code is – or ought to be – above partisan politics. Because the right to equality is – or ought to be – common to us all, irrespective of faith or ideological hue."
Tiger Shroff Saves Rumoured Girlfriend Disha Patani From An Embarrassing Moment On The Ramp!,"It has, for long, been rumoured that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been dating but the couple has kept what's between them under wraps. Often they have been spotted together and the rumours thereafter spread like wildfire.

Recently, the alleged couple attended the Lakme Fashion Week together, and what happened there was rather cute that fans have been fawning over.

Just like Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani was also supposed to walk the runway but she didn't. Why, you ask? Because Tiger saved her from what could have been a major embarrassing moment.

So, before the diva walked the ramp, Tiger figured out that the stage was made up of a reflective glass, and her alleged girlfriend was wearing a short dress. Being a keen observer of thing or just being a caring boyfriend, Tiger was seen muttering something into her ears and thereafter she decided not to walk the ramp.

Isn't that cute?

Earlier as well, the alleged couples of the B-town have saved their girlfriends from such awkward moments. Remember, how once, Salman told Katrina to cover up her neck while at a press conference through Alia Bhatt.

Also, how once Singh Rajput saved Kriti Sanon from a probable wardrobe malfunction?

That's indeed cute, isn't it?

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

Edulji lashes out at BCCI, labels it 'male chauvinist organisation'

Diana Edulji, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, lashed out at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), calling it a ""male chauvinist organisation"". Edulji alleged that the success of the Indian Women's team, that fell nine runs short in the 2017 ICC Women's World Cup finale at Lord's a month ago, and the growing popularity hasn't been ""accepted too well"" by some of the board members.

Edulji, along with India's World Cup stars Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, was a guest at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday (August 22).

""I've always been a BCCI basher, right from the day women's cricket came into the BCCI fold in 2006,"" Edulji said at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday. ""BCCI is a very male chauvinist organisation. They never wanted women to dictate terms or get into this thing. I was very vocal right from my playing days, from when I started,"" she added.

""Even now, I would still say that it is not yet well accepted within BCCI that women's cricket is doing well. It is very difficult for them (some BCCI members) to accept the fact that this team has done very well,"" Edulji elobrated.

Recalling her first meeting with the ousted BCCI president N Srinivasan after he took charge in 2011, Edulji said, ""When I went to congratulate him at the Wankhede Stadium, he said, 'if I had my way, I wouldn't let women's cricket happen'. He hates women's cricket.""

Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, who were among the outstanding performers during India's memorable World Cup run, said they were surprised yet humbled by the overwhelming reception upon their return home from England despite the lack of the trophy. Raut acknowledged the sudden growth in interest in women's sport and recalled how it was quite the opposite when she took up cricket as a career choice.

""There's so much passion for cricket within us that we don't ever think about getting tanned. There were many people in our society and some of my mother's friends who would keep saying, 'Isse ladki ki tarah thoda rehne ke liye sikhao. Ladki ke kaam sikhao' (Teach her to behave like girls, encourage her to learn what girls are expected to do). They used to ask my mother to teach me to dress up like a girl. My mother would then scold me. I would complain to my father and then they would end up arguing,"" the 27-year-old revealed.

""There are many parents who still think along those line.. You'll get dark if you stay under the sun for six hours. Who'll get married to you? I've seen today's parents only encourage their daughters to study and say that you'll have to get married at a fixed age and get settled."" Raut, however, encouraged young girls to chase their dreams. ""I believe if any girl likes playing, or if sport is her passion, then they should be allowed to play and be supported too,"" she said.

Vice-captain Harmanpreet, who captured the imagination of the youth with her blistering 171 not out to knock out defending champions Australia in the semifinal, stressed on the struggles she had to go through to play the game in her hometown Moga, in Punjab. ""When I was young I would have to beg the girls to play with me so that we could form a team of 11 players. Eventually, I would have to gather girls who were good at other sports. Cricket has become their No.1 priority now. When I started, there wasn't a single academy in Moga. My coach started one just for me. Now, there are three exclusively for women,"" Harmanpreet said.

While Edulji said it might be too early to introduce Women's IPL in India, Raut and Harmanpreet advocated for the need to have a domestic league of their own to tap the talent. ""I feel like even after all that's happened, there are a lot of changes that still need to be made for women's cricket. I hope we don't end up saying many years later that 'we also used to hit sixes during our time'. So, I feel if IPL starts now, then it's great,"" said Harmanpreet.

"Man Stabbed To Death In Broad Daylight In Delhi, Onlookers Didn't Help Him And Just Made Video","A man in his 20s has died of multiple wounds after he was stabbed by two attackers in west Delhi’s Khyala on Wednesday. The victim, identified as Akbar Ali was stabbed with knives multiple times on Tuesday allegedly after a fight over money.

Though over a 100 people had gathered there, no one came forward to help him despite his repeated cries for help. The two men who had stabbed him were arrested later.

While no eyewitnesses came forward to give their statement to the police, a 57-second video shot by a bystander showed the bleeding man lying on the road, a knife sticking out of his ribs on the right side.

In the video, people are seen asking the injured man, identified as Akbar Ali, for his home address. Ali mentions that he lives in B-Block, but doesn't give the complete address. He then asks for water.

""By the time a police team reached the spot, someone had taken Ali to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital,"" said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.

Ali succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday.

Two suspects, Mohd Shubhan and Mohd Afzal, were later arrested from the neighbourhood for the murder. Shubhan, a welder, and Afzal, a painter, told police that Ali also worked as a welder, but he extorted money from them. Cops found out that Ali was also a snatcher.

Timorous Windies stride out to avoid embarrassment and series loss

• Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 08:43 PM Rob Johnston in Headingley

""It was totally embarrassing.""

That was the great Curtly Ambrose's reaction to West Indies' defeat by an innings and 209 runs inside three days of the first Test at Edgbaston last week. The tourists lost 19 wickets on the third day which compounded an abject failure with the ball and in the field during England's first innings. In body language and spirit, they looked disinterested. Inexperienced they may be, but West Indies were inexcusably poor.

Given the tourists' abysmal performance in Birmingham, there is a real fear for their prospects in the remaining two matches of the series. A win in the second Test at Headingley, beginning on Friday (August 25), is perhaps unlikely but an improved performance is a must if simply to restore some pride in the battered West Indian team. They can take heart from their victory over Pakistan in Barbados in April which followed a similarly chastening defeat in the previous match in Jamaica.

If there is any hope for an improved performance, it is that West Indies are probably not as bad as they showed in the first Test. In Kraigg Brathwaite, Jermaine Blackwood, who scored an impressive half-century at Edgbaston, and Kemar Roach, there is proven Test match talent and there is promise too in Shai Hope and Roston Chase. With the genuinely quick Shannon Gabriel set to return to the side, the missing aggression that Ambrose said was sorely lacking from the visitors' display at Edgbaston, should be evident too.

West Indies coach Stuart Law and the young captain Jason Holder have had a job on their hands to raise the morale of their team in the lead up to the game and there has not been much time for them to do so. According to Law, the squad have had some honest sessions since their Birmingham defeat but he may be worried that Holder struggled to rouse any sort of reaction from his men at Edgbaston. He also erred tactically in a number of areas including not taking the new ball straightaway on the first evening when the lights were on. The captain surely needs to lift his game.

Unusually, England will probably want to see some improvement from their opponents too. With an Ashes series looming and a number of untried players at Test level in their side, a more demanding workout in Leeds will be just what the doctor ordered. Mark Stoneman, a debutant at Edgbaston, got an excellent delivery from Roach in England's first innings and will want a longer stay in this Test to show what he can do. So too will Tom Westley who suffered another dismissal playing across his front pad in Birmingham.

Headingley has not been a happy hunting ground for England of late which may give the visitors hope. England have won just two of their last seven Tests at the venue although they beat Sri Lanka comfortably last year and thrashed West Indies on their last tour in 2012. Then, England won the Headingley Test by an innings and 283 runs in the face of a similar hapless performance by the men from the Caribbean to the one last week. West Indies, and maybe England, will hope history doesn't repeat itself.

When: Friday, August 25, 2017. 11 AM Local Time

Where: Headingley, Leeds

What to expect: Headingley traditionally favours the seam bowlers and with plenty of wet weather in the build up to this match, there could be some grass left on the pitch for them to exploit. A Mohammad Amir-inspired Essex bowled Yorkshire out here twice inside two days, a couple of weeks ago. The forecast for the match is mixed with some rain forecast on a couple of the days and some sun on others.

Team News:

England:

At some point in the next two Tests, England would have looked to give both all-rounder Chris Woakes and legspinner Mason Crane a game ahead of the Ashes tour and that they did by handing Woakes a return, by replacing Toby Roland-Jones.

Probable XI:

Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (c), Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson

West Indies:

Fast bowler Shannon Gabriel should return to the side following an injury lay-off and will add much needed pace and aggression to the West Indian attack. There may also be a place for legspinner Devendra Bishoo who was surprisingly left out at Edgbaston. Miguel Cummins and Alzzari Joseph are the two bowlers most at risk from the last Test. Despite the brittleness of the West Indian batting, there is little depth in that part of their squad, although 20 year-old Shimron Hetmyer, who captained West Indies Under-19s to a World Cup win in 2016, could come in at the top of the order.

Probable XI: Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich (wk), Jason Holder (c), Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo/Miguel Cummins

Did you know?

Joe Root is one fifty away from equaling AB de Villiers's record of scoring 50-plus in 12 successive Tests.

The last time Windies played at Headingley (in 2007), they faced their heaviest Test defeat - by innings & 283 runs. They were bowled out for 141 & 146 and in comparison Kevin Pietersen alone scored 226 for England.

James Anderson is eight short of becoming the sixth bowler to take 500 Test wickets.

"Let’s talk about discrimination: Supreme Court outlawing triple talaq was no surprise, it should have gone further","There is something naturally perverse about a husband being given the right to annul his marriage unilaterally by merely uttering the word ‘talaq’ thrice. It does not require an Islamic cleric or a constitutional scholar to find this practice abhorrent, discriminatory and disrespectful of women. It was thus little surprise that the Supreme Court outlawed instant triple talaq, a judgment hailed for empowering women in their struggle for gender equality.

But that is unfortunately where praise for the judgment must begin and end. Scarcely has a judgment with such a progressive outcome been underpinned by such regressive reasoning. The dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Khehar and Justice Nazeer considers triple talaq, despite being discriminatory, to be protected by freedom of religion in the Constitution. To offset this result, they recommend legislation by Parliament on this issue and before such legislation, prevent Muslim husbands from pronouncing triple talaq.

Justices Nariman and Lalit, in their majority view, consider Sharia law to have been statutorily incorporated by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937. Given that all laws enacted by the legislature have to be in conformity with the Constitution, they hold Section 2 of the Act, to the extent that it enforces triple talaq, to be arbitrary. Justice Kurian, the swing vote, agrees with the conclusion of the majority that triple talaq is invalid. However he comes to this conclusion not on constitutional grounds, but pursuant to an ecclesiastical finding that triple talaq has no basis in the Quran.

The dissenting opinion is surely astonishing. If personal law can be constitutionally protected, then it is commonsensical that such personal law can also be challenged on constitutional grounds. Further, if it is constitutionally protected, neither can a Muslim husband be disallowed from exercising his fundamental right to pronounce triple talaq nor can Parliament be expected to come up with a law that says otherwise.

On the contrary Justice Kurian’s swing vote holds, arguably correctly, that instant triple talaq is against the tenets of the Quran and consequently not part of Sharia law. Given it is not part of Sharia law, he considers it outlawed by the Act and hence invalid. To resolve the matter at hand, this is sufficient. However, as an approach to resolving knotty questions of personal law, this enquiry would require judges to delve deep into religious texts to ascertain their true meaning.

The hazards of such an exercise are well-known to the judiciary from what followed in the aftermath of the Shah Bano judgment (1985). Sacrificing constitutional adjudication at the altar of religious pontification from the Bench is an unwitting dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution.

In contrast, a more conscious dilution of the supremacy of the Constitution takes place in the majority opinion of Justices Nariman and Lalit. By holding that the Court has the power to strike down parliamentary legislation as arbitrary under Article 14, it has converted a question of the rights of Muslim women into a contest for one-upmanship with Parliament. This is not what a landmark judgment for gender equality looks like – on the contrary its express silence on the core question of discrimination, speaks louder than its words.

Even when it has spoken – to partially outlaw Section 2 of the Act as arbitrary – it is conceptually flawed. Its finding compounds a conceptual misadventure that began with Justice Bhagwati’s view in Royappa (1973). Royappa held that governmental action could be challenged as arbitrary under Article 14 because the right to equality, enshrined in Article 14 mandated the rule of law, which was the antithesis of arbitrary state action.

Two examples demonstrate why bringing arbitrariness in through the backdoor of equality in Article 14 was faulty. If all spectrum licenses are cancelled with inadequate reasons by the state it is arbitrary, but hardly an act of inequality; conversely if universities have different rules for men and women in the interest of safety, the rules are unequal, but hardly arbitrary. Simply put, equality and arbitrariness are not the same thing.

Using arbitrariness as a sword to scythe through parliamentary legislation, risks the danger of collapsing the whole of the Constitution into one article. If Article 14 means arbitrariness and arbitrariness means nothing but the rule of law, then simply replacing the mass of provisions with Article 14 should do. This result means that the Damocles’ sword of a free-floating judicial determination of arbitrariness now hangs over every parliamentary and state legislation in this country.

In terms of upsetting separation of powers and arrogating powers to itself, this judgment trumps even the NJAC case. Politicians in a celebratory mood would be well-served to recognise that the Constitution is no longer supreme, the judges are.

In the final analysis, it is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women’s rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women. On a matter critical to the lives of women in India, when five male judges of the Supreme Court rule on arcane questions of constitutional and ecclesiastical law instead of calling out personal laws as discriminatory, one knows that even if a victory has been achieved, the battle for gender equality will continue to remain a long and hard one."

Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it’s a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there’s one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it’s Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India. Super-cool isn’t it? Watch the video to virtually experience this cool augmented reality battle with the chilly monsters!"

Worship Is Work,"Does God favour those who attend to their work in factories and offices, or those who sit for long in puja, wonder UMA RAM and K S RAM



Afavourite home-assignment for pupils in schools till some decades ago was to write an essay on ‘Work is Worship’. The teacher made the task easy by describing the contours of the essay:True worship lies in doing work.We should work hard.We should not waste time in idle (idol?) worship.She almost suggested that God favours those who bend their backs and attend to their work in the factories and offices,rather than those who sit for long in puja. Few of us (including the teachers who set the assignment) ever suspected the politics that went into this seemingly simple exercise. Few of us could have suspected that it was part of the Macaulian manipulation of education in India that aimed to produce an army of ever-ready servants for the government. In a land known for sedentary ways of life revolving around stretched pujas and innumerable special days for festive duty and special service, such spiritual re-engineering was necessary for developing human resources to uphold the Raj. There is probably nothing in our scriptures or in the scriptures of any major religion anywhere to support the idea that work is worship. In fact, there is good evidence to suggest the opposite: that worship is work in the real sense.Krishna describes this in his discourse on action and inaction.



‘He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action truly sees, he tells Arjuna. Sarva’rambha parityaga, renouncement of all initiatives is declared a virtue in one who is coursing ahead on the spiritual highway. Let life unfold itself and do with disinterested diligence the tasks that such unfolding presents for you. Religion began as magic.It,in fact, continues to be so. An incense stick waved around a symbol of godhead is essentially an act of waving the magic wand for a good day ahead.The day unfolds the will of God. Work presents itself and it is perfectly in order to perform it to the best of one’s ability as service in the will of God.To initiate work, or to avoid the task that has presented itself before you would mean meddling with God’s action plan. He knows, we don’t.To surrender to his action plan is true work. Work, as we understand it, is the elaborate, tedious striving to secure livelihood. Our ancients realised that there can be another way of securing it. This is through symbolic action, a kind of magic, better understood as worship. The Karma Kanda in the Vedas is essentially a manual of magic to help achieve life’s purposes. Creation itself is magic. In the Book of Genesis, God sees darkness and says, let it be day, and it was day. To say is to do.Worship is a mild simulation of such magic.Worship is not counter to work.Worship is work.To learn this is to learn the art of living. The real challenge, though, lies in understanding worship.Worship can be self-defeating if it is fruit-centric. One can be damned by getting one’s prayers answered. Rabindranath Tagore thanks God for the blessing of frustrating his prayers time and again. True worship lies in joyous surrender to the will of God.



Again, it is important to know as to who is the object of worship. Hinduism is often criticised for entertaining numberless demigods. What is missed is that there exists a great unity among this seeming diversity. All services reach the One God. But the results are according to the intermediate demigod to whom the service was directed. The message is clear:focus on the Ultimate One God, even as you worship and propitiate a demigod. Worship need not always be physical. Ideal worship is mental, whether accompanied by physical acts or not. And, a subtle instruction is that worship is not for one’s own pleasure but for the pleasure of God.And it is an incessant engagement, not a fixed hour ritual.The comfort God promises to such an unwavering devotee — nitya’bhiyukta — is: ‘Securing your mundane well-being is my concern — yoga’kshemam vahamyaham.’

Is The Possibility Of A Hybrid Flu Pandemic A Reality? Here’s What You Need To Know,"Flu viruses have been a global threat in modern history ever since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 killed 40-50 million worldwide and infected at least 500 million. And now recent history continues to see the evolution of swine flu into different strains.

holahola

The 2009 swine flu pandemic saw the demise of over 200,000 people worldwide; marking another monumental unprecedented death toll due to a flu virus. India itself has already recorded 1,094 swine flu-related deaths this year.

healthshlok.com

Flu pandemics such as these from the past have shown us that different strains can mix and evolve into new strains of viruses that we have not had answers to. As we face another strain of an avian Influenza Virus (H7N9) that inflicted China not too long ago, scientists are taking matters into their own hands by testing for new viruses that can cause havoc to prepare themselves for the worst.

dailystar.co.uk

One such landmark study mixed a bird flu virus and a human flu virus giving birth to a hybrid flu virus as published in the journal Science.

Why is this important?

ftwonline.co.za

The study was conducted in an effort to understand how bird flu viruses naturally mix with mammal-infected viruses that are present in livestock who act as a host, which then trigger human pandemics.

What strains of viruses did the researchers mix?

mintmochamusings.com

The researchers mixed the deadly ‘swine flu’ virus (H1N1) and a subtype of the ‘influenza A’ virus (H5N1) a bird flu virus to check the potency of the resultant virus.

What is the motive behind creating such a virus?

ikon.mn

The researchers claim they are conducting these tests to help develop preventative vaccines for future to avoid pandemic breakouts. Lord May of Oxford, a former government chief scientist and past president of the Royal Society told the Independent UK, “They claim they are doing this to help develop vaccines and such like. In fact, the real reason is that they are driven by blind ambition with no common sense whatsoever”.

What was the outcome of the experiment?

vanguardngr.com

They came up with a total of 127 virus combos; some of which were able to spread through the air. The researchers were trying to emulate a realistic scenario where animals such as pigs get infected with a strain of the virus. The bird flu viruses that were made airborne were able to inflict mammals, including human beings.

Is safe to run such an experiment?

wsau.com

The study was conducted in a laboratory with the second highest security levels in order to ensure that there are no accidental escapes. However, May claimed, “The record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring. They are taking it upon themselves to create human-to-human transmission of very dangerous viruses. It’s appallingly irresponsible.”

So how dangerous is such a virus then?

vustug-info.ru

Since the experiment proved that the bird flu virus (H5N1) was able to mix with the swine flu (H1N1) virus to create a strain that can infect human beings, it doesn’t hurt to pay caution to the wind. Professor Simon Wain-Hobson, an eminent virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said it is likely that some or all of these hybrids could pass easily between humans and possess some or all of the highly lethal characteristics of H5N1 bird-flu, as reported in the Independent UK. “We don’t know the pathogenicity [lethality] in man and hopefully we will never know,” added Hobson.

The result of the experiment still remains unclear, however.

sulnews.com.br

“It’s a fabulous piece of virology by the Chinese group and it’s very impressive, but they haven’t been thinking clearly about what they are doing. It’s very worrying,” added Professor Wain-Hobson said. “The virological basis of this work is not strong. It is of no use for vaccine development and the benefit in terms of surveillance for new flu viruses is oversold”.

Virologist Dr Vladimir Blinov had predicted next hybrid flu (swine flu and bird flu) after one that appeared in 1957, the H2N2 that took 2 million lives, can come from CHINA this year in a report by Daily Star.

Let’s hope that scare doesn’t materialise into reality!"
Why Trump is right on Pakistan and Afghanistan,"On Monday night, the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, asked Pakistan to knock it off. He vociferously declared that America’s future involvement in Afghanistan will be result-based and not time-based. A timetable for withdrawal was not even mentioned as Trump announced his Afghanistan strategy, which deserves the praise of being one of the best policies designed by the White House. Let´s be clear: Obama´s strategy of “surge and exit by 2014” was a disaster. If you tell the terrorists that you are going to leave, they will wait till you leave.

Afghanistan is viewed as America´s longest war, now in its 16th year. Trump´s speech is bad news for Taliban supporters and those elements in the military in Pakistan, which for a very long time have been allowed to get away with their attempt to play the double game of verbally supporting the war on terror and simultaneously supporting Islamic terrorist groups like the Haqqani network.

The most important conclusion to be drawn after listening to Trump´s announcement is the recognition of the fact that abandoning Afghanistan is not the solution, even though he may have hinted at that during his election campaign. More important than this approach to Afghanistan is his clear statement with regard to Pakistan. Unlike Barack Obama, Trump has decided to directly address the issue of Pakistan´s double game in his address to the nation. He unequivocally condemned Pakistan´s support for Taliban and the Haqqani network while simultaneously receiving large-scale military assistance from US.

Since the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, Pakistan has received billions of dollars in aid from USA alone. But in the future that aid will be directly linked to Pakistan´s willingness to cut its support for the jihadi groups that have killed scores of American soldiers in the past.

What one could hope is that further sanctions would be applied directly to those sections of the Pakistani military and intelligence services which play a direct and indirect role in the clandestine support for the jihadi groups. Pakistan has a difficult case to prove as Osama Bin Laden was caught and killed in Abottabad close to a military garrison. Here the European Union could also co-operate with US and impose travel bans on top military generals who make life miserable for people on the south Asian continent while basking in the sun on the beautiful beaches of Europe and America. No holiday for them if they are caught red-handed.

Lastly, there is no reason to fear the Chinese influence in Pakistan. Pakistan is well aware of the consequences of choosing China over America. Pakistani generals and the elite in Pakistan would rather send their children to US and Europe for further studies than to China.

If Pakistan and India co-operate and see Afghanistan as a territory to be developed and not as an area of contention and competition, much of the conflict in the region can be reduced.

India, Pakistan and Afghanistan can become a strong economic zone, where growth and development would mean improvement of the standard of living for all of its citizens. But it requires a willingness to accept a reconciliation process and give the power back to the common man. The common man in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan does not want war. He wants co-operation.

Trump finally got America’s policy on South Asia right. The million-dollar question is if he will be allowed to walk the talk. Since the time of Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan, India has been voicing its concern. It kept warning Washington that Bin Laden was in Pakistan and of its double game. The big question is: Will India now trust America? The proof of the pudding is in the eating. If America keeps its promise of demanding closure of all terrorist networks, also those affecting India, then the demand put on India of further engagement with Afghanistan will be seen as positive.

America also needs to put pressure on Europe to get straight with China, which is trying to fill in the gap in Pakistan and doing roaring business in Europe. When it comes to South Asia, America has finally got its policy right. The same cannot be said of the European Union."
"Why People, Who Swear, Stay Up Late And Tend To Be Messy Are Deemed More Intelligent","If you’ve always been called out for living out of a messy room, have a dirty tongue and tend to stay up longer than most people you know, you might be better off than your parents or well wishers ever thought. You may actually be smarter than them!

We don’t just want to make you feel better for your seemingly ‘destructive’ qualities (or so you’ve told most of your life), but because science indicates that all these qualities are a sign of higher IQ levels.

Swearing is a sign of rhetorical ability

blog.4psa.com

People often think that swearing indicates a weakness in your vocabulary. The logical assumption being that if you swear a lot you probably don’t know how to construct your thoughts using a whole lot more words. But a study published in Science Direct that those who use the maximum number of swear words within a minute scored higher on an IQ test. The test was indicative of the fact that a rich vocabulary of swear words equated strong rhetoric ability and not a compensation for a lack of vocabulary.

If you have a messy setting, chances are you are more creative

botasot.info

So you’ve been accused of leaving a messy desk/room behind all your life? Well, the chance that you're more creative and a genius in comparison to your prim and proper counterparts is much higher. A study conducted by the University of Minnesota concluded that if you’re not spending too much time cleaning and organising your settings your mind is obviously preoccupied with thoughts that are more important. The researchers claimed that it led to better creative output.

Being a night owl has long been linked with intelligence

If you prefer staying up late chances are you fit within the intellectually brighter lot of people that history has witnessed. Research such as this one in Psychology Today reveals that night owls are linked to higher IQ levels as compared to morning larks. People like J.R.R. Tolkien, Pharrell Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, Charles Darwin and President Obama were nocturnal beings.

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
SRK's Gorgeous Blue Villa In Dubai Will Not Be Taxed Despite Being For Rs 15 Crore. Here's Why,"Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan is one of the richest celebs in the world. And expectedly, he has properties across the globe, one of which is the stunning Dubai villa along the Palm beach.

It recently came under the radar for not being income taxed for so many years. However, the income-tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) has rejected the tax department's view that a villa in Dubai gifted to Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan a decade ago was a camouflage to evade income tax. The tribunal has held that the value of the villa cannot be treated as the actor's taxable income.

The villa had been gifted to Khan under a formal gift deed in 2007 after he obtained the RBI's approval.

I-T authorities were of the view that the donor, Nakheel PJSC, a Dubai-based company known for the famous Palm Projects, had gifted the villa as it was keen on using the actor's image and brand. The actor is a globally known figure and has endorsed various foreign brands for remuneration running into a few crores. Thus, the gift was seen as remuneration to Khan for utilising his brand image and in lieu of his stage performance at the company's annual day event. In light of this, the I-T authorities sought to tax the value of the villa as income in SRK's hands.

Twitter



During the assessment for the financial year 2007-08, I-T officials added the value of the villa — Rs 17.85 crore — to the income of Rs 126.3 crore declared by Khan in his I-T return. The actor would have had to pay I-T on this additional sum. At the first stage of appeal, the commissioner (appeals), agreed with the I-T authorities. Based on a valuation report, though, he reduced the addition to Rs 14.7 crore.

Twitter



Appealing before ITAT, Khan, through his counsel, said the chairman of the company, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, was his friend and thus wished to make the gift. He admitted to attending the annual day event but said he merely addressed the employees and did not perform on stage, which would have amounted to brand endorsement. On taxation of a gift in kind, ITAT pointed out that for the relevant financial year, gifts of immovable property made without any consideration were out of the tax ambit.

The real luxury in life is doing nothing,"It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that you’ll brush your teeth tomorrow morning. You don’t squander precious mental space evaluating whether or not brushing your teeth is worth the opportunity cost of let’s say, another five minutes of sleep. The same is true for showering, going to the bathroom, grooming your nails and facial hair. We clean our homes with a myriad of dust-sucking devices and chemical concoctions, or hire people to do so more thoroughly than we can. We even make sure to wash the car every so often.

As a people, we seem to be pretty vigilant about physical hygiene. We clean and cream our bodies, and take them out for a walk, much like we do for our dogs. We do so robotically, without wasting time in evaluating questions like, “Should I take out the trash today?” Even if we don’t do it today, you can bet it’ll be done before the week is out. Sadly, the same cannot be said for our mental hygiene. When was the last time you really cleaned the crevices of your mind?

And in this day and age, boy, do we have dirty minds. Between jobs, responsibilities at home, nights out, baby-talk and toddler tantrums, must-read blogs, email upkeep, spritely posts and timely tweets, we’ve stuffed our minds with more content than it can hold. Our minds run a marathon a minute. We swallow countless videos, movies and entire seasons of television shows with abandon, and these stimulating stories stick to our soft and once-supple consciousness. It’s a more-more-more world and our mind’s had enough. Simply put, we are mentally obese.

And then we wonder why we can’t still our minds and find some semblance of peace. We read self-help manuals, eat more organic greens and practise various forms of sweat-inducing yoga. We buy softer clothes, sniff scented candles, wear noise-canceling headphones and track our daily step count. We run away to exotic islands and true stillness evades us even under the palms.

The ubiquitous sentence we’ve all uttered, heard and repeated is — “I’m so tired”. We keep going like that poor Energizer bunny, but deep inside we feel kind of exhausted. Even the pursuit of higher echelons of fun becomes somewhat tiring by the time you’re thirty-five. And if not by then, by forty-five, for sure. “What’s the point?” we start to wonder.

And this is precisely where meditation saved me. Some people meditate with a mantra from a Master, some listen to meditation music, some watch their breath until they can override mental chatter, while others go for a nature walk. Even big-shot billionaires meditate with requisite meditation apps on TV these days.

The result is the same — in meditation, we do absolutely nothing for a few moments. We achieve nothing, we stop trying so damn hard. And unlike in sleep, we are restfully awake to witness the passage of time. We are completely present for ourselves — for doing absolutely nothing with ourselves — much like we make sure to be present to watch our children play soccer or perform in a school play.

In meditation, we become the witness. We become the one who watches patiently as time marches on, moving and twisting as it does. We don’t react or move an inch. We watch our thoughts go by like trains at a busy train station. We don’t hop on board. Like the statue of Buddha, we learn to embody peace and let go of past and future worries. We are the now. Like rock climbing, scuba diving, skiing, or even learning to read as children — learning to meditate takes some level of dedication and practice.

It’s a skill worth acquiring as soon as humanly possible. Even a momentary brush with wakeful nothingness — doing nothing, being nothing, wanting nothing, all while being there with the Self here and now — is a deep-clean steam shower for our mind. It refreshes us considerably and reminds us that there is more to life than chasing more."

Mamata Does It Again: Prohibiting Durga idol immersions on Muharram neither helps security nor ensures communal harmony,"In a re-run of last year, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has ordered that no Durga idol immersions will take place on Muharram which falls on October 1, a day after Bijoya Dashami. Idol immersions will resume from October 2 thereafter and continue till October 4. Mamata has justified this decision on security grounds, saying that it is necessary to facilitate Muharram processions and prevent clashes between Hindus and Muslims. She had passed similar orders last year which were challenged in the Calcutta high court on grounds of minority appeasement. However, it’s also true that small communal clashes did take place last year across various districts of Bengal when Muharram and celebrations for Durga Puja overlapped.

There’s no denying that Mamata’s order is upsetting a significant section of the Hindu population in Bengal. Durga Puja is the biggest festival for Bengalis. If in future Muharram were to fall bang in the middle of the four-day festivities, would Mamata call a halt to all celebrations? The state government is responsible for security for all. It should ensure both Durga Puja rituals and Muharram processions are carried out smoothly. By being hypersensitive about Muharram, Mamata herself is stirring up the communal cauldron.

On the security front, she is actually increasing the risk of clashes by imposing a moratorium on Durga idol immersions on Muharram. For, such a moratorium is bound to rub Hindus in Bengal the wrong way, creating an atmosphere of resentment. And communal clashes are much more likely to take place when people are resentful. Hence, Mamata’s order fails on the security logic. This leaves one to conclude that Mamata is doing all this to appease the minority vote bank. And that gives an opening to BJP which is looking to make inroads in Bengal on the strength of Hindu grievances.

Let’s put things into perspective. Muharram is essentially observed by Shia Muslims. And Shia Muslims are a minority in Bengal. According to some estimates, there are only one lakh Shias in the entire state. Hence, managing Muharram processions shouldn’t be such a big deal. However, in making it a big deal Mamata is fanning the flames of communalism. She must remember that she is the chief minister of all peoples in Bengal and guard against the appearance of favouritism no matter how well-intentioned her decisions are."
"Debate On Privacy Ends, Supreme Court Rules That Right To Privacy Is A Fundamental Right","In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court has ruled that the individual's right to privacy is a fundamental right. The SC order has finally put to rest the debate over individual's right to privacy, especially in the context of Aadhaar.

The order was delivered by a nine member bench comprising of Justices JS Khehar, J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, R F Nariman, A M Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay K Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer.

The apex court ruling came in a bunch of petitions challenging the government's decision to introduce the biometric data-enabled Aadhaar ID for citizens.

BCCL

The question of whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution was first raised in the apex court before a three-judge bench.

It was referred to a five-judge Constitution bench on August 11, 2015.

The five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice J S Khehar, met on July 18 to decide the issue, but was told by the Centre that the strength of the bench was inadequate as an eight judge bench in the M P Sharma case in 1954, and a six judge bench in the Kharak Singh case in 1962, had ruled that right to privacy was not a fundamental right.

AFP

The Centre, through attorney general K K Venugopal, had said, ""Privacy, even if assumed to be a fundamental right, consists of a large number of subspecies... It will be constitutionally impermissible to declare each and every instance of privacy a fundamental right. Privacy has varied connotations when examined from different aspects of liberties.

If the SC wants to declare it a fundamental right, then it probably has to determine separately the various aspects of privacy and the extent of violation that could trigger a constitutional remedy.""

AFP

The Unique Identification Authority of India, too, said privacy was not a fundamental right and there were sufficient safeguards to protect data collected from the people -- their iris scan and fingerprints.

Even though the government and the UIDAI continue to stand by their claim that Aadhaar data is safe, in May, security researchers discovered that the Aadhaar information of as many as 135 million people had leaked online.

Since then there have been a number of incidents from various parts of the country where people with malicious intends managed to break into the database and steal data."
Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India’s current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country’s stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers’ productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a “development” prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."
What Supreme Court and AIMPLB obviously have in common: Male dominance,"After its long campaign for non-interference in Muslim personal law, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is in a quandary now. It will meet in Bhopal on September 10 to formalize future strategy, in response to the Supreme Court striking down instant triple talaq as violative of the fundamental right to equality.

This is amidst mounting criticism of its failure to take the leadership on reforming the Muslim community from within. It doesn’t help that the representation of women in the 301-member board is less than 8%. Actually women may have even lesser strength in the executive panel of the board. AIMPLB women members who took a position against triple talaq were reportedly sidelined or shown the door by the male-dominated religious body.

Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which was one of the six petitioners along with the valiant Shayara Bano, is convinced that AIMPLB itself will grow more sidelined as women become more informed and determined: “We don’t trust them. They have been denying rights granted by the Quran and the Constitution to the Muslim women. If it was indeed relevant, women would not have felt the need to move court.”

If women had had greater representation on the AIMPLB board, it would have been more responsive to their concerns. This is a simple enough logic, and interestingly enough it applies as much to the Supreme Court that has put AIMPLB in such a quandary. Not only is only one of the 27 apex court judges today a woman, it has had a grand total of SIX women judges since Independence. The high courts boast 10% women judges, which is quite similar to the 8% women membership of AIMPLB!

Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Uday Umesh Lalit in setting aside talaq-e-biddat concluded, “This form of talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it … It being manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of discrimination.”

On the TOI edit page today Arghya Sengupta draws attention to this strange hesitation of five male judges of the Supreme Court on a matter critical to the lives of women in India: “It is a telling comment that in a judgment celebrated as a landmark victory for women’s rights, none of the judges find the provision of triple talaq discriminatory against women.”

A lady on the bench you can bet would have delved into discrimination."
11 Heartwarming Instances Which Prove That Humanity Trumps Every Religion & Caste,"Indians always get smitten by the momentous consequences of secularism in our country. Amid the murmur and babble that goes around validating the comeuppance of those asserting within religion, society, and groups, lies a society that's bonded.

We have instances where altercations between two people have led to communal unrest, where a word-war has lead to haggling of family members or mob lynching and where a 'rapist' from a different community is seen as community agenda.

But who is to say that India is a land of diversity and this multifariousness thrives in every part of the nation. We have people from Sikh community who have gone over and beyond their code of conduct to help distraught people, we have Hindus assisting Muslims during Ramadan and Muslim men risking their lives to save victims or Muslim women who have been making Shiva Lingas for 17 years.

Aim is to win both Tests: Shakib

Atif Azam • Last updated on Thu, 24 Aug, 2017, 07:02 PM

Sakib al Hasan believes that Bangladesh are capable of beating Australia by a big margin in the upcoming Test series. The hosts will take on Australia at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday in the two-Test series opener while the series concludes with the last game in Chittagong from September 4.

Sakib, who will be playing his 50th Test for Bangladesh, acknowledged he's excited and determined to make a mark. ""I think it is possible to win both Test matches,"" Sakib told reporters in Mirpur while pointing out his ambitions against the Aussies on Thursday (August 24). ""There is no reason why we can't do that.

""If you ask me about my own expectations then I would say with it would be to win both Tests.""

Shakib made his Test debut in 2007 but in the last decade has played just 49 Tests. He has established himself as a vital pillar in Bangladesh cricket in all formats. The allrounder, though, said he doesn't regret not getting more Tests.

""I don't have much regret in my life. I am very much happy with what has happened with me. I would feel much better if I could play more matches,"" he said. ""Those matches I have played and had a good performance, all are important to me.

""I would say the Test match against England in 2016 is the most memorable one. As my individual performance, I can remember my 92 runs against West Indies. Scoring 217 against New Zealand was a big achievement for me.""

Sakib will be joined by Tamim Iqbal to play 50 Test matches for Bangaldesh. Shakib went on to warn the visitors about Bangladesh's intentions and said the conditions won't make it easy for the Australians. ""They are one side who they have a culture to adapt in every condition in a quick span of time,"" Shakib pointed out. ""Although it will very tough considering there will be rain as well as heat but they will try to cope with it as they had done previously.

""We have to play our best cricket if we want to defeat them. We have to do well in every aspect if we want to win a Test match. We have to bat and bowl well. Whichever team they may send, they are a difficult opponent in every condition. They can cope with the conditions around the world very fast and no other team can do better than them.

""They are the strongest opponent for us although they are, for now, an inexperience side. They didn't perform well in India and Sri Lanka in recent times. I hope that they will continue the streak and we'll do well against them.""

Shakib felt having spinners, who know the conditions better, will help their cause. ""I think our spin attack is better than theirs,"" he said. ""Not in all conditions but in Bangladesh, we are better than them. Taijul and Miraz [Mehidy] have been bowling well for some time now. I believe they will do something fantastic in this series.""

Sakib added he's excited finally able to play a Test against Australia. ""It's exciting that I will be playing a Tes against Australia as I've played already played a few ODI's and T20s against them. It will be an experience and it is really thrilling,"" he said. ""Australia and England take Test matches differently from what others do and playing against such opponent is really a awe-inspiring experience.""

"Trump’s Afghanistan strategy, if followed through, opens a window of opportunity for India","Donald Trump’s gut instinct had said something else, but the demands of the Oval Office prompted him to deliver a “presidential” South Asia strategy. If it is followed through it can have wide-ranging implications for the region. Most important, it gives India a small opportunity to reshape the region and its role in the larger Asian geopolitics.

The good: US understands Pakistan is the problem, and for the first time we saw language on Pakistan that we would have liked to see a decade ago, both from Trump as well as Tillerson. For the second time since 9/11, Pakistan appears to be at a “with-us-or-against-us” moment.

Even more important, US apparently no longer believes, as generations of Pak-hugging Americans did, that Pakistan can be incentivised towards better behaviour if India could be kept out of Afghanistan or more lenient on Kashmir. Not that long ago, US was asking India how many consulates we had in Afghanistan, asking us to “do less”. Thankfully Osama bin Laden, Mullah Mansour and a host of other terror notables chillin’ out in Pakistan contributed to a change of heart, at least among the generals if not in Foggy Bottom.

The new strategy, as Tillerson clarified, will focus on not allowing Taliban/ al-Qaida to win, or the US to “lose”. Through that deliciously vague strategy, Washington is signalling they now “have the watches and they have the time”, opening up the space for a whole range of options to be exercised on Af-Pak in the coming months from drones to economic sanctions, CT operations, etc. Nobody knows the winning combination, but the generals who have skin in the game, McMaster, Mattis and Kelly, may do what they have always wanted to. By not releasing troop numbers, they have allowed themselves a degree of flexibility while keeping political pressure at bay.

On the ground, the situation is dire. The alphabet soup of terror groups from al-Qaida to Haqqanis, Taliban and LeT are not distinct entities, as Bill Roggio points out, they are closer today than they have ever been. It’s not for nothing that Sirajuddin Haqqani is the deputy chief of Taliban, and Haqqanis have been close to al-Qaida just as LeT, which was born in Kunar, is close to Taliban. In some areas Taliban have even worked together with Islamic State.

Afghanistan has got one more shot at getting things right. Ashraf Ghani’s dysfunctional government has to get its act together as well. Apart from building infrastructure India can play a role here, to beat some sense into the feuding boys – Ghani and Abdullah – with Hamid Karzai on spoiler alert.

Yes, India can invest a lot more in Afghanistan. More infrastructure, more development projects will undoubtedly follow after the Indian government completes its own Af-Pak review, which was waiting for the US one. But India cannot deliver governance. It’s an issue India has always skirted around, but it needs to be addressed.

India has an opportunity to work with both Russia and Iran to revive the spirit of the 90s, when all three faced a common enemy. In fact, the speech gives India an opening – the stabilisation of Afghanistan should be seen within the larger regional matrix involving China, Iran and Russia, all of whom can play negative roles as Russia and Iran show. This is not in India’s interest, and India needs to work harder to offset US-Russia, US-Iran hostility.

Neither Trump’s speech nor Tillerson’s reading of the riot act to Pakistan’s foreign minister in the coming days will change Pakistan’s behaviour or strategy substantively, or, for that matter Taliban/al-Qaida’s – yesterday’s suicide attack in Lashkargah showed the enormity of the problem. Pakistan will bank on China to offset the pressure the Americans will undoubtedly exert, and hope their nukes will do the rest. Pakistan will continue to bet on the US giving up before they do. Which is possible, and Indians will be watching out for US/Trump giving up before Pakistan/Taliban.

As for re-hyphenation with Pakistan, India remains the world’s biggest “hyphenator”, so don’t lose too much sleep over it. Instead, we should reflect on this unexpected window of opportunity and make the most of it before things start going south, as they inevitably will."
"Japan Now Has Robot Priests For Funeral Services, If You Desire A Tech-Savvy Death Ceremony!","In a classic case of first world trend-setting, Japan has started a truly unusual first-of-its-kind robot service.

A robot priest unlike anything you've ever seen before / REUTERS

At its ongoing Life Ending Industry EXPO 2017 -- yeah, let that sink it in for a moment, the fact that Japan has an expo for everything related to death -- a 'robot priest' wearing a Buddhist robe was unveiled, one that's programmed to conduct the end of life rites at funeral services.

Nissei Eco, a plastic moulding company in Japan which also offers funeral services, is putting the Buddhist robot priest up for sale. The robot is nothing but SoftBank's Pepper brand of humanoid robots which was first launched in 2014 -- this is just a new avatar in which the robot is programmed to carry out a specific function.

The robot priest will be able to chant Buddhist sutras, bang drums and livestream the funeral ceremony.

The robot priest will also cost less at 50,000 yen (about $450) per funeral compared to 240,000 yen ($2,200) or more charged by a human priest to perform the same traditional Buddhist funeral service in Japan, according to Reuters.

Anyone dead yet for me to rock and roll? / REUTERS

This robot priest also solves a crucial demographic problem which is gripping Japan, whose population is not only aging fast but also shrinking. Due to this phenomenon, many Buddhist priests are finding that their services are less in demand, making the profession financially unsustainable in the long run. Buddhist priests are forced to find part-time work to survive financially, requiring them to take up jobs outside of their core temple duties.

The robot is yet to be hired to conduct a funeral service in Japan. Whenever that happens, it will be a watershed moment for humanity. After all, we gave birth to robots in the first place, and to think robots will preside over death ceremonies of humans very soon, isn't without a sense of irony.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

Who divided India? Jinnah or Nehru?,"What led to India’s Partition? Could it have been avoided? If not Partition, the bloodbath that claimed the lives of more than 1 million people?

In a brilliant, must-read effort, noted military historian Barney White-Spunner recounts what happened in 1947, freedom and its aftermath, in 12 riveting chapters, each earmarked for a month from January, in Partition: The Story of Indian Independence And The Creation of Pakistan in 1947 (Published by Simon and Schuster, Pages 419, Price Rs 699).

How much of Mahatma Gandhi’s famed non-violence was a sham or an ineffective ploy could be understood from reading this brutally honest account of Partition. The killings had begun much earlier than August 15, 1947.

It is important to give the background of the author. White-Spunner has commanded British and allied troops at every level from troop to field army, including the elite 16 Air Assault Brigade, whom he took into Kabul in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. He has also led operations in the Balkans and Iraq, as well as Africa and Asia. The robustness of his prose in Partition—clear, sympathetic but unsentimental—is a testament to his qualities as a fighter. He enters where it matters, the end of the Raj.



White-Spunner picks up his pieces from the time Field Marshal Lord Archibald Wavell, Viceroy of India, gets his marching orders from the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee on January 31, 1947. On February 20, Attlee made a statement to the House of Commons announcing that Britain would leave India by a date not later than June 1948. He also announced that Earl Mountbatten would take over from Wavell as viceroy.

White-Spunner offers us a soldier’s perspective. He says it is important to accept that events of August to November 1947 were a terrible tragedy, not just in bloodshed and human misery but in their consequences. Were they avoidable and who was responsible for them?

He says Britain should have handed over power to Indians in 1919 after the end of the first World War as recognition of India’s extraordinary generous contribution to the British war effort, both in the number of men who volunteered and in money. The call for Pakistan had not become shrill or sharper at that time. But White-Spunner points out that Britain’s refusal to leave while not having the resources nor the real willingness to administer and develop India in the way the country so badly needed, was the main cause of the tragedy in 1947. He also says the year 1935 presented another opportunity when the government of India Act offered the logical moment to grant Dominion status but again it was missed. “By 1947 there was little of the Raj still functioning apart from the army. India was disintegrating.”

Many have said, including Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal, that it was Congress’s hunger for power that led to the Partition. But White-Spunner makes the picture clearer when he writes that Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had their own reasons for rebuffing Muhammad Ali Jinnah. “Had Congress reacted more favourably to Jinnah’s approaches in 1937, then things might have turned out differently but their (Nehru and Patel) experience in the Interim Government had shown them that they were better without the League. For Congress, it was essential to maintain that strong central government without which they feared they could not keep the country together. For Jinnah, whose vision was a federal India with the League sharing power and exercising control over the Muslim majority provinces on the original Palestine model, this was a bitter blow. He never got what he wanted.”

White-Spunner has relied on many sources—books, interviews, newspapers—to write his account of Partition but chief among them is The Transfer of Power papers, a massive twelve-volume compendium of all official correspondence relating to Indian Independence and Partition between 1942-47. Published by the British government between 1970 and 1983, it is a godsend for a historian, gathering as it does all the government documents in one well-edited series. There is no doubt that the strength of White-Spunner’s account is ToP papers.

So instead of blaming Jinnah for the Partition, he says it was Nehru and Patel who decided to get on with it quickly. It may be stunning to know that Nehru, with Mahatma Gandhi’s support, even tried in May to get the British to hand over in June. Congress was impatient for power.

But it was not the rush for power that caused the slaughter but the inability by all the key players to foresee it. Nehru did not believe religion held such sway in India. Jinnah did not understand Punjab. Mountbatten hardly knew India.

White-Spunner says that the only way to prevent the slaughter was to police the Punjab properly. He significantly points out that there is no excuse for not using British and Gurkha troops and deploying alongside them those non-communal units of Indian troops who would not be affected by local affiliations.

Mountbatten was against it. White-Spunner argues that there was ample time to brief and deploy the army, with the accompanying air power in July. He notes that while Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims slaughtered each other in August 1947, over half a million servicemen stood idle.

But there are other views as well. A K Damodaran, the Congress activist and a future Indian diplomat, differed with the view that Mountbatten rushed it. In 1988 he told the BBC that “despite the Calcutta killings, the cosy Delhi elite had an overromantic view of the Punjab. They never expected what happened. We took a very purist Hindu logical view of partition. In retrospect we were being too clever by half.”

So while India had its heroes during its struggle for Independence and during its hour of freedom, it had none during the terrible days of Partition. A tragedy, indeed."
