Country-wide assessment of learning outcomes on November 13: HRD Ministry,"HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar(Express photo) HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar(Express photo)

The union government will conduct its first country-wide assessment of learning achievements on November 13 in which over 30 lakh school students of Classes III, V and VIII in 35,000 government schools will participate. This will be the world’s largest sample survey of learning outcomes, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a meeting with state governments on Wednesday.

Learning outcomes are assessment standards which help teachers to understand the learning levels of students in their respective classes individually as well as collectively. Earlier this year, the union government amended Rule 23(2) under the Right to Education (RTE) Act making it compulsory for all state governments to codify expected levels of learning which students in Classes I to VIII should achieve in different subjects.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has drafted learning indicators for eight subjects — English, Hindi, Urdu, Mathematics, EVS (Environmental Science), Science and Social Sciences — based on which states can finalise their own indicators.

For instance, as per the NCERT document, learning indicators in writing for a Class I student will assess not just the student’s ability to recognise letters A to Z, but also his/her ability to carry out simple instructions such as ‘shut the door’, ‘bring me the book’. In Class II, a student should be able to compose and write simple, short sentences with space between words. The levels gradually increase so that by Class VIII, a student cannot only read and write, but also use his or her faculties to read between the lines, understand new concepts and explore and read other areas of knowledge.

The learning outcome test on November 13 is being conducted to implement the amendment of Rule 23 (2) of the RTE Act. The National Achievement Survey or NAS, which is being held since 2001, has been tweaked by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to now test a student’s competency instead of her knowledge of the school curriculum. Also, earlier only 4.5 lakh students across Classes III, V and VIII were being assessed through NAS. Starting this year, 30 lakh government school kids will be tested.

“NAS will now produce district-wise comparison within each state as opposed to the state-to-state comparison that it is doing since 2001. The learning outcome test will be administered in 19 languages and the government will propose short, mid-term and long-term interventions including policy changes to the state governments based on the results of this assessment,” NCERT chairman Hrushikesh Senapaty told The Indian Express.

On Wednesday, Javadekar held a meeting with all state government representatives via video conference to brief them about the learning outcome test in November. It will be a pen-and-paper test in which students will have to attempt multiple-choice questions. Students will have to fill in their choices on an OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheet which can be scanned for quick processing of results.

"Indian smartphone market shows signs of revival; Samsung still no 1, Xiaomi no 2","Samsung emerged as the number one smartphone vendor in India in Q2, 2017 with 24 per cent share. Samsung was followed by Xiaomi, which retained its number two position with 17 per cent share. Samsung emerged as the number one smartphone vendor in India in Q2, 2017 with 24 per cent share. Samsung was followed by Xiaomi, which retained its number two position with 17 per cent share.

About 28 million smartphones were shipped to India in Q2 and the industry registered 3.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth, according to International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker report. Thanks to Goods and Services Tax (GST), smartphone vendors experienced weak sales in second quarter.

“The third quarter of the year started slowly as the sales channels adjusted to the new taxation system but they quickly recovered within a few weeks. The Indian smartphone market is now preparing for the biggest quarter so far; offline channels have already cleared the old stocks, eTailers are getting ready for mega online festivals, and vendors are set to launch new models in the Diwali festive period,” the report read.

Samsung emerged as the number one smartphone vendor in India in Q2, 2017 with 24 per cent share. The Korean company witnessed a decline of four per cent from the same period of last year thanks to growing competition from Chinese vendors who’ve now started to focus equally on offline segment as well.

Samsung was followed by Xiaomi, which retained its number two position in Q2 as well with 17 per cent share. The Chinese smartphone maker experienced 25 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth. IDC attributes this growth to Xiaomi’s expansion in offline segment such as opening of Mi homes, Mi authorised stores and partnering with the key large format retail stores.

Xiaomi tripled its offline shipments in Q2, added the report. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is now the highest shipped smartphone in a single quarter with over two million smartphone units sold in Q2.

Chinese vendors Vivo and Oppo grabbed the third and fourth spot with 13 per cent and eight per cent shares respectively. Thanks to above-the-line marketing activities and promotions, Vivo made a significant jump from four per cent market share in the same period last year to 14 per cent now. Vivo saw 26 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth. Oppo’s shipments declined by 13 per cent quarter-on-quarter.

About 28 million smartphones were shipped to India in Q2 and the industry registered 3.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth, according to International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker report. About 28 million smartphones were shipped to India in Q2 and the industry registered 3.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth, according to International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker report.

Lenovo and Motorola together are the fifth largest smartphone vendors in India with seven per cent market share.

Coming to Indian smartphone vendors, they registered 18 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in Q2, though the market share remains limited to 15 per cent. Chinese smartphone makers, on the other hand, contribute to 54 per cent market share with 9 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in Q2.

“Indian vendors have shown an early sign of recovery and now when most of them are ready with their 4G product portfolio, a new set of China-based competitors have entered in the sb-US$150 segment” says Upasana Joshi , Senior Analyst, IDC India. “Indian vendors are putting all their efforts and second half of year will be crucial, either it will see a revival of Indian vendors or emergence of new dominance in the sub-$150 segment from China based vendors,” added Joshi.

As per the IDC report, the third quarter is the biggest quarter for feature phones as festive season in India approaches. Reliance Jio JioPhone 4G feature phone, which is expected to hit the shelves in September, will most likely contribute to stabilising feature phone market in the short term.

About 34 million units of feature phones were shipped in Q2, and the segment saw 6.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth after declining consecutively for two quarters. “Experience of early adopters will be crucial for the 4G feature phones in the 2G dominated category. Network connectivity, battery performance, and internet enabled multimedia experience will carve the path to the next phase for this category,” said Navkendar Singh , Sr. Research Manager, IDC India.

"Deepika Padukone, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kangana Ranaut: Who aced the airport style?","Aishwarya Rai Bachchan spotted with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan at Mumbai airport. (Source: Varinder Chawla) Aishwarya Rai Bachchan spotted with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan at Mumbai airport. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

We love spotting celebs at airports, as we believe it’s a good way to keep a check on the latest trends and also learn a few tricks on how to style the basics in a way that can instantly elevate a look. Deepika Padukone and Kangana Ranaut are two Bollywood celebs known for their super-cool and comfortable travel styles, but Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, not so much. It won’t be an understatement to say that the Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star has given us really bizarre looks in the past, but this time it’s different.

Seen returning from Australia with her daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, the former beauty queen picked up a smart sweatshirt from Monisha Jaising with gold embossed rock n’ roll written on it. She paired it with simple black jeans, and Nike sneakers and complemented it with a black Gucci handheld bag.

We love the touch of the blazing red pout and those cat-eye sunglasses. She did good!

Meanwhile, Deepika Padukone aced her fashion game in basics. The white top (from Purple Paisley) and blue jeans (From Zara) combo is a classic and we love the way she casually shrugged on that denim jacket to add oomph to her too-cool-for-school look.

The statement, ankle length boots and a pair of blue aviators made all the difference. It’s something we would definitely like to try the next time we are jet-setting.

Another Bollywood beauty who inspired us is Kangana Ranaut in casuals while on her way to Hyderabad.

The monochrome polka print, smocked waist dress by Prada looked comfortable for a flight and she accessorised it well with nude peep toes from Miu Miu and a tan Chloe sling bag.

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

"India Inc calls for strengthening policy reforms, job creation","CII President Shobana Kamineni (File) CII President Shobana Kamineni (File)

Lauding the government’s efforts to deal with corruption and black money, industry chamber CII on Tuesday called for strengthening policy reforms, including a new industrial policy, creating jobs and empowering women at the workplace. It said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, has “outlined a vision of a secure, prosperous and capable nation by 2022”.

“While welcoming lower inflation and downward interest rate cycle, CII called for strengthening policy reforms including a new industrial policy, entrepreneurship and employment creation, and empowerment of women in the workforce,” the industry body said in a statement.

CII President Shobana Kamineni said, “The development task to 2022 is challenging and will require strong policy action across multiple economic and social sectors. The government has made a significant beginning, and all of us will need to put our hands together to move the needle of development.” “The Prime Minister has outlined a vision of a secure, prosperous and capable nation by 2022, driven by the collective power of 125 crore citizens of India,” she said.

CII’s India@75 campaign launched in 2008 is in line with Prime Minister’s objectives and emphasises crowd-sourcing of ideas and spread of volunteerism to build a developed India, she added. “The government has taken multiple steps to address corruption and black money which are delivering notable results.

“CII believes that reforms such as GST and ease of doing business will further contribute to formalisation of the economy and widening the tax net, and we look forward to a more transparent and efficient economy by 2022,” added Kamineni.

Commenting on the Prime Minister’s speech, industry chamber Ficci said, “The Prime Minister clearly articulated a new narrative for India – a country which is strong, where people have economic opportunities, where there is no room for corruption or nepotism, and where the binding factor for all is Indianness.”

CAT 2017: This is how you need to start preparing for exam to get admission in IIMs,"CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination

CAT 2017, which is going to be held on November 26, is now just three months away. CAT consists of three sections which are Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR) and Quantitative Ability (QA). Each of these sections is allotted one hour and there are 100 questions altogether.

Important topics in each section

Quantitative Ability (QA): In QA, the majority of the questions come from algebra, number system and permutation and combination. Make sure that these topics are covered thoroughly by solving as many questions as possible from them. Getting comfortable with these topics would help you in boosting your confidence. Questions from geometry mostly have a short-cut method to solve them. Try to learn different short-cut methods to solve them while giving sectional tests.

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC): In VARC, the majority of questions come from para-jumbles and Reading Comprehension (RC). Try to solve RC of different domains like psychology, science, economics, medicine. Getting comfortable while reading those passages from unfamiliar domains would help you in brushing up your understanding skills and help you prepare better.

Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR): LR & DI is all about practising and increasing your speed of solving. Try to sharpen up your mind by solving as many diverse questions as possible.

Keep these tips in mind while preparing for CAT 2017

Study regularly: In case you started your preparation recently, you need not worry. Instead, just focus on your preparation, without getting stressed out. Make sure that you study on a regular basis. It is important to study a minimum of 3-4 hours per day. In case you are doing a job along with your preparation, try to cut down on your sleep at night and study during that period.

Balance speed and accuracy: CAT is about balancing accuracy and speed at the same time which can be achieved only through maximum practice. In the initial phase of your preparation, try to focus more on accuracy rather than speed. Gradually, with time, try to increase your speed keeping your accuracy constant. Do not just focus on one section and prepare for that. It is important to solve questions of every section on a daily basis. It helps in keeping the speed and comfort with all the topics intact.

Cover all topics: Leaving out certain topics for CAT might not be a good strategy. You may lose out on an opportunity to score easy marks. In case you want to leave any topic during preparation, make sure that the topic should is not a very important one, for example, para-jumbles or permutation & combination.

Understand your strong and weak areas by giving sectional mocks: Since every section has its own cut-off, therefore it is important to know your strong and weak areas. In case you have just started your preparation, for the next couple of weeks, work on your concepts and understand them thoroughly. Also, give sectional mocks of these topics to understand how well acquainted you are with those topics. Just giving sectional mocks won’t help you a lot. It is even more important to see the solutions and analyse your performance and learn from your mistakes.

Attempt full-length mocks: The same thing goes for full-length mocks as well, where just giving too many mocks isn’t the best way to prepare. A substantial amount of time should be given to the analysis of those mocks. Also, the learning from those mocks should be absorbed and they should be carried forward into the next mock. You can practice sectional and full-length mocks on the gradeup app.

Look for the simplest method: At times, there are multiple ways to solve the same question. Try to solve the question by the shortest method using tricks and short-cuts. Make sure that you keep those tricks in mind for future use. Just solving a question by using a long method doesn’t do any good.

Take small breaks in between: It is sometimes necessary to take breaks in-between study while practising. This helps you to freshen up your mind and improve your efficiency.

Make a weekly study plan: Make a thirteen-week study plan in which the first six weeks should focus more on concept building and giving sectional mocks. The next seven weeks should focus more on giving full-length mocks and analysing them in detail. This would include working on your weak areas and making sure that you develop a certain level of comfort with those topics.

Sincere and dedicated efforts along with a smart study plan during these 3 months will surely help you get a seat in your dream B-school.

Cristiano Ronaldo five-game ban upheld by Spanish FA,"Cristiano Ronaldo was banned for five games on Monday after shoving a referee following his red card. (Source: AP) Cristiano Ronaldo was banned for five games on Monday after shoving a referee following his red card. (Source: AP)

Cristiano Ronaldo’s five-game ban has been upheld after Real Madrid’s appeal to overturn it failed, according to multiple reports.

The Portugal captain was out of Spanish Super Cup second leg after he was booked twice in El Clasico at Camp Nou, where they defeated rivals Barcelona 3-1. He was then charged a further four match ban for shoving referee De Burgos Bengoetxea for booking him.

According to an ESPN report, the Royal Spanish Football Federation upheld Ronaldo’s five-game ban after he was sent off in the first leg at the Camp Nou. Other than the Spanish Super Cup second leg, he will also miss the first four matches of the La Liga.

The forward came as a substitute in the second half to score the second goal for Los Blancos after Gerard Pique’s own goal and an equaliser by Lionel Messi. Ronaldo, however, got booked for taking off his shirt during the celebration.

An apparent dive saw Ronaldo being awarded with a second yellow. Ronaldo, expecting a penalty, appeared to shove the referee in disbelief and disagreement for his decision. Even though the referee did not react at the time, the 32-year old’s behaviour was included in the official’s report. “After being shown the red card, the player pushed me gently to show his dissent,” De Burgos wrote in the document that covers all the incidents that occurred in the match.

Madrid will play their first match on Sunday at Deportivo La Coruna.

Reaching out to the Valley which has been wracked by violence for months now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday said the problems there cannot be resolved through “gaali” (abuse) or “goli (bullets) and change can only come by embracing Kashmiris.

In his fourth Independence Day address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, the Prime Minister said: “On Kashmir, there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people (Algavwadi, mutthi bhar algavwadi, ye algavwadi jis prakar ke naye naye paintre rachte hain).”

“Na gaali se samasya sulajhne waali hai, na goli se samasya sulajhne waali hai, samasya suljhegi, samasya har Kashmiri ko gale laga kar sulajhne waali hai. Na gaali se, na goli se, parivartan hoga sabko gale lagakar (The problem will be solved neither by abuse or bullets, it will be solved by embracing all Kashmiris). Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians. Neither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all. And we are moving forward with this resolve.”

Underlining the country’s connect with Jammu & Kashmir, Modi said: “For the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and fulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government, but we, as responsible citizens, also have a responsibility. We are committed to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that it was, once again.”

In the same breath, he sent out a tough message on terror. “We shall take strict steps against terrorism. There is no question of being soft on terrorism or terrorists. We have been asking the separatists to join the mainstream. Democracy provides an equal opportunity and rights to be heard for all. The process of engagement can take place only by their joining the mainstream.”

Amidst criticism against his government for its handling of Kashmir issue, Modi said his government is committed to the “lost glory” of Kashmir. Amidst criticism against his government for its handling of Kashmir issue, Modi said his government is committed to the “lost glory” of Kashmir.

“I deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing Left wing extremism who mobilised a lot of youth from these regions to surrender and join the mainstream. Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders. I am delighted to announce that today the government is launching a website which will give an account of the valour of the gallantry award winners. A portal is also being launched which aims to provide entire details of these bravehearts who have brought pride to the nation. The story of sacrifices made will certainly inspire the younger generations.”

The Prime Minister made a brief mention of the surgical strikes against terror camps across the Line of Control last year. “When the surgical strike was carried out, the world had to acknowledge I’dia’s capability and strength.”

In the backdrop of renewed incidents of cow vigilantism and violence against Dalits, the Prime Minister spoke out against the “poison of casteism and communalism”.

“Sometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end up destroying the social fabric. The country is governed by peace, harmony and unity. The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the country. This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward taking everyone along. This is a part of our cou’try’s culture and tradition. We have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of faith, violence cannot be allowed.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacting with children after addressing the nation from the ramparts of Red Fort in New Delhi on the occasion of 71st Independence Day.“If something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt down; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people launch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free India? It is the property of 125 crore Indians. Whose cultural legacy is this? This is our cultural legacy, the legacy of 125 crore people. Whose faith is this? This is our faith, the faith of 125 crore people; and that is why the path of violence in the name of faith can never succeed in this country. The country will never accept this.”

“And that is why I would like to appeal to all the countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chhodo’ and today’s slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’. We have to take everyone and every section of the society along to take the country forward.”

Modi referred to the death of children in a Gorakhpur hospital. “Several parts of the country faced natural calamities recently. Besides our innocent children lost their lives in a hospital. Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief. I assure the countrymen that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the well-being of all.”

Listing his govern’ents’ initiatives for the empowerment of women, the Prime Minister also lauded the campaign by some Muslim women against the practice of triple talaq. “I would like to honour those sisters who have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to triple talaq. There is no recourse for them, and such victims of triple talaq have launched a massive movement in the country. They shook the conscience of the intellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them and a movement against triple talaq was started in the country.”

“I heartily commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been fighting against triple talaq and I am confident that the country will help them in this struggle. The country will help these mothers and sisters in securing this right. India will fully support them and they will ultimately achieve success in this very important step in the direction of women empowerment. I am fully confident about this.”

Towards the end of his speech, Modi took a vow with people to make a New India by 2022 which, he said, will be free of terrorism, communalism and casteism, where there will be no compromise with corruption and nepotism, where every poor will have a pucca house and drinking water, where farmers will have double income by 2022 and youths and women will have full opportunities to realise their dreams”.

How is Indira Canteen different from Amma canteen?,"Rahul Gandhi said that it is designed to make sure that not a single person in Bengaluru goes hungry. (Source: Twitter/ @OfficeOfRG) Rahul Gandhi said that it is designed to make sure that not a single person in Bengaluru goes hungry. (Source: Twitter/ @OfficeOfRG)

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday launched ‘Indira Canteen’- a flagship programme of Karnataka government which will provide food at subsidised rates. Indira canteens will serve lunch and dinner for Rs 10 and breakfast for Rs 5.

The Siddaramaiah government had announced setting up of the Indira canteens in the state budget for 2017-2018 apparently taking an idea from the ‘Amma canteens’ in Tamil Nadu which was introduced by then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.

Congratulating Karnataka government for this initiative, Rahul tweeted: “Indira Canteen is another step towards the “Food for All” commitment of the Congress. I congratulate the Karnataka Govt for this initiative.” He also said that it is designed to make sure that not a single person in Bengaluru goes hungry. Leaders including Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Congress General Secretary in-charge of the state K C Venugopal, the party’s state unit chief G Parameshwara and Bengaluru in-charge Minister K J George were present at the event.

However, in a slip of tongue, Rahul called the ‘Indira Canteen’ as the ‘Amma Canteen’.

How is Indira canteen different from Jayalalithaa’s Amma Canteen

Amma Canteen:

In 2013, J Jayalalithaa had announced the setting up of a chain of highly-subsidised restaurants across Tamil Nadu named- ‘Amma’Canteen’ aimed at aiding economically disadvantaged sections of society. The canteen is popular for low-cost eateries and serves “Pongal” and sambar for Rs 5, idlis for Re 1. For lunch it serves lemon rice or curry leaf rice for Rs 5.” The canteen also provides chappatis, curd rice and side dish for Rs 3, sambar rice for Rs 5.

‘Amma Canteen’ went on to acquire immense popularity not just in Tamil nadu, but all across the country as an ideal example of welfare schemes.

The scheme generated also resulted into employment of a large number of women who were needed for the cooking and cleaning. (Source: Rakesh Reddy) The scheme generated also resulted into employment of a large number of women who were needed for the cooking and cleaning. (Source: Rakesh Reddy)

After its success, Jayalalithaa also launched schemes like subsidised salt, mineral water and cement, all under the brand name Amma.

Indira Canteen:

The Indira canteens will serve breakfast for Rs 5 and lunch and dinner for Rs 10. Initially, 101 canteens will be opened. More will be opened in 97 wards from October 2 to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birthday. An amount of Rs 100 crore was provided in the budget to set up these canteens in at least 198 wards of Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. Rahul Gandhi said that the canteen is targeted at the working class like construction workers and auto rickshaw drivers. He also said that the intention behind this initiative was that the quality of food and cleanliness should be same as in the most expensive restaurants in Bengaluru.

A total of 27 kitchens will be set up across the city to cater to these canteens, of which 14 are ready and six are currently in working condition. According to officials, the canteens as of now will serve 500 plates of food, keeping in mind the budgetary allocation, and this is likely to be increased in the future.

Initially referred to as ‘Namma Canteen’, the name was later changed to ‘Indira Canteen’ as Congress legislators sought to give a political touch to the populist announcement ahead of the Assembly polls early next year by naming it after former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

"Mumbai University misses August 15 deadline too, 1.5 lakh answersheets yet to be assessed","Of the 1.5 lakh unassessed answersheets, officials said, the largest chunk was from the commerce stream. Of the 1.5 lakh unassessed answersheets, officials said, the largest chunk was from the commerce stream.

THE UNIVERSITY of Mumbai has missed yet another deadline to declare the final year results. With around 1.5 lakh answersheets yet to be assessed and only 330-odd test results being declared so far, the university failed to meet the August 15 deadline that Vice-Chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh had committed to agitating Yuva Sena members earlier this month.

Of the 1.5 lakh unassessed answersheets, officials said, the largest chunk was from the commerce stream. The number of teachers assessing the papers is low compared to the large number of students in the stream. Moreover, assessment of taxation papers were pending as chartered accountants were not available until last week. A five-day period of holidays has furthered slowed down the process with few teachers reporting for assessment.

While Deshmukh has been sent on forced leave by Governor and Chancellor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, acting V-C Devanand Shinde said new strategies had been implemented with the help of a new technical taskforce. “We cannot commit on a deadline but we are doing our best. Our focus is to get correct results,” he said.

With the current rate of assessment — a few hundred teachers assessing 15,000 papers a day — the work could drag on till the end of August, said sources. The assessment had picked up pace during the non-instructional week with over 3,000 teachers assessing 1.5 lakh papers a day. However, the university cannot afford to announce any more non-instructional days as it would affect the current academic calendar, said Shinde.

Teachers, however, are worried that with the spillover of assessment work, the existing students would suffer. “The academic calendar and teaching period has been reduced drastically, especially with a week-long non-instructional period. We will have to rush through our portions to be able to complete the syllabus for the semester exams,” said a professor of the university on the condition of anonymity.

The university has already missed two deadlines. Following the delay, the Governor had set July 31 as the deadline for all results. Thereafter, Deshmukh sought an extension till August 5, which was then extended to August 15.

Shinde, however, is positive that from Wednesday, as the holidays come to an end, the assessment work will resume at full strength. “The technical problems have now been addressed. The results will be out at the earliest,” he said.

Watch: Sidharth Malhotra’s rap and Jacqueline Fernandez’s moves are highlights of A Gentleman song Bandook Meri Laila,"A Gentleman: Sidharth Malhotra, Jacqueline Fernandez sizzle up the screen. A Gentleman: Sidharth Malhotra, Jacqueline Fernandez sizzle up the screen.

We are still not over Jacqueline Fernandez’s “Chandralekha” performance but it seems her upcoming film A Gentleman is not yet done with giving us reasons to celebrate the film. Now, the makers have released another song, “Bandook Meri Laila”, which marks the debut of Sidharth Malhotra as a rapper. The actor has rapped for the first time along with Raftaar. While that is one of the highlights of the song, the leggy lass Jacqueline will make you sweat with her hotness. We are definitely envious of her sex appeal and glamour!

In the video of the song, Jacqueline and Sidharth are seen running away from the henchmen and taking them on with guns. If you listen to the song carefully, you will realise the actor has used the gun as a metaphor for Jacqueline. Well, a lot of guys would say the same thing from now on.

The trippy song, by music composers Sachin-Jigar, will definitely become a hit. The earlier tracks from the album, “Chandralekha” and “Baat Ban Jaaye”, are already a hit among the audience, and “Bandook Meri Laila” is going to be no different.

A Gentleman will present Sidharth Malhotra in a never seen before avatar. The actor plays a double role in the Bollywood thriller.

The film is a Fox Star Studios production, starring Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez, and is written and directed by Raj & DK. It is set to release on August 25, 2017.

Teen who saved 10-year-old girl from drowning felicitated,"A Class Vth student, Muskan Pathan, fell into the flooding Kukadi Canal when Vaibhav jumped to save her. Express A Class Vth student, Muskan Pathan, fell into the flooding Kukadi Canal when Vaibhav jumped to save her. Express

Vaibhav Gaikwad (13), who was in the news recently for saving a 10-year-old girl from drowning in Kukadi Canal, Junnar, has been felicitated by the USK Foundation. A Class Vth student at Jagdamba School, Jadhavwadi, Muskan Pathan, was passing near the Kukadi Canal on her way back home from school.

The canal was flooded due to heavy rainfall and she fell into the waters. While other students raised an alarm, Vaibhav flung into the water and saved Muskan. Dr Usha Kakade of the foundation said, “Instead of just being a spectator, Vaibhav took a major step and saved Muskan from drowning. I will recommend his name for the national awards.”

Expressing his gratitude, Vaibhav said, “When I saw Muskan drowning, I jumped into the water without a second thought. I could see her hands in the canal. While saving her, I held a nearby tree but that too was uprooted due to the force of water. Later, I managed to hold on to another tree and brought Muskan out of the flow. The strong flow of the water was tiring but I am happy that I could save her life.”

"What makes Britain’s biggest ever warship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, special","The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is towed by tugs as it arrives at Portsmouth Naval base, its new home port, in Portsmouth, Britain. (REUTERS) The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is towed by tugs as it arrives at Portsmouth Naval base, its new home port, in Portsmouth, Britain. (REUTERS)

Thousands of enthusiasts on Wednesday lined up at the Portsmouth seafront, to welcome what is said to be the biggest-ever warship of Britan. Named HMS Queen Elizabeth, the 280 meters long vessel weighing 65,000 tonnes cost more than 3 billion-pound to build.

The vessel that was in construction since 2009 has been training at sea since June after setting out from Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. Built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, the vessel also has an identical sister ship called HMS Prince of Wales, which will be commissioned three years later. Both the carriers built for the Royal Navy will replace the now-decommissioned HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious and will lead the UK’s Naval Force for the coming years.

HMS Queen Elizabeth has a speed of 25 knots per hour that can help it to cover a distance of 500 miles per day. The gigantic ship weighs three times the size of its predecessor, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal. Few of the on-board features include a hospital, a police office, commanding officer’s suite and a bakery as well. The ship is also equipped with 1,000 twin propellers that generate power that can run 1,000 cars.

The vessel also has an in-built reverse osmosis equipment that can produce 500 tones of fresh water each day. As a result, the ship can play an essential role in providing humanitarian relief in cases of a crisis. The carrier will also provide a four-acre military operating base to the armed forces.

The war ship is also equipped with a fully integrated waste management system that ensures proper sanitary processing, storage and destruction of any kind of waste for the next 50 years. It also comes with a Glass Processing Equipment that helps in crushing compact glass products that can be further recycled.

The war-ship is also equipped with a cutting-edge 3D radar system known as Artisan 3D that makes it capable of detecting tiniest objects at a distance of 25 km. According to the builder Aircraft Carrier Alliance, the radar system can monitor more than 800 objects simultaneously from 200 to 200,000 metres and cut through radio interference equal to 10,000 mobile phone signals. The radar system has already proven its capability to deliver uncompromising air defence and anti-ship operations on the Type 23 frigate and helicopter carrier. The system will also be used for the first time to deliver air traffic management, providing the aircraft carriers with unparalleled awareness and control of the skies around them.

The range of the ship is 10,000 nautical miles. Few of the works for which the ship will be used include high intensity war fighting, disaster management and providing humanitarian aid.

“She is Britain’s statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role,” Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said while welcoming the ship at its home port in southern England.

"Donald Trump, PM Modi agree to elevate strategic talks, new mechanism ready","US President Donald Trump shakes hands with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Reuters photo US President Donald Trump shakes hands with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Reuters photo

Listing diplomatic and strategic interests as top priorities, the Trump administration and the Modi government are going to establish a new dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries. This assumes significance since India and US share similar views on major global challenges such as terrorism, Indo-Pacific region and bilateral defence ties.

This is a shift from the previous US administration’s policies and will replace the existing dialogue format between foreign and commerce ministers of the two countries, which was started by the Obama administration.

The name for the new dialogue format is likely to be “2 by 2”, much like the India-Japan 2+2 dialogue format between foreign and defence secretaries of the two countries. This dialogue puts defence and security issues at the front and centre of the relationship between India and US.

The new mechanism was also discussed between External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during a phone conversation Tuesday.

The White House, in a statement about President Donald Trump’s phone call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of Independence Day, hinted at the new format: “The leaders resolved to enhance peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region by establishing a new two-by-two ministerial dialogue that will elevate their strategic consultations.” It gave no details of the mechanism.

Top government sources told The Indian Express that a preliminary conversation took place during Modi’s visit to Washington DC this June, and has been worked on in the last month and half.

The idea, sources said, came during the conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and his American counterpart Gen (retd) H R McMaster in the early months of the new administration, given the convergence in views on security, defence, regional and global situation. The conversation was followed up by Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar who met US officials during his trips in the last six months.

It was felt by both sides that the the current format of the Strategic and Commercial Dialogue is not living up to its promise and potential, despite the efforts to put together scheduled meetings of four top ministers in both governments.

“The thought was that it takes a lot of effort to coordinate the schedules of four leaders — two from each side — but the commercial issues take up too much of space during the meetings, and the strategic and security aspects are not getting enough attention and space in a dedicated manner during the Strategic and Commercial dialogue,” sources said.

In 2015, Modi and Obama had elevated the India-US Strategic Dialogue to a Strategic and Commercial Dialogue, and it was attended by Sushma Swaraj and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, US Secretary of State John Kerry and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. The last meeting took place in New Delhi on August 30, 2016.

With the change in the US administration, the new format has been looked at and was approved by both governments. According to sources, familiar with this format, this new format has worked well between the US and China — it also moved away from the Strategic and Economic dialogue. “There is so much of common interests between Indian and US officials when it comes to Afghanistan, Pakistan and China. The 2 by 2 format between foreign and defence ministers is just inevitable,” sources said.

“But this does not mean that commercial and economic issues are not important. They will be dealt separately in a dialogue between the two commerce ministers, and will not clog the 2 by 2 dialogue process,” sources said.

There is a possibility of the first meeting of Swaraj and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley with Tillerson and Defence Secretary James Mattis in late September or early October in the US. Much will depend on their schedules.

"For Metro rail, states must bring private players: Govt","The JV model was first successfully executed in case of the DMRC. The JV model was first successfully executed in case of the DMRC.

In a marked shift in approach to urban mass transit projects, the Union Government has made it mandatory for state governments seeking central financing for their proposed Metro Rail to involve private players in the execution and running of the system. The Union Cabinet approved the New Metro Rail policy on Wednesday, which states that ‘’Private participation either for complete provisioning of metro rail or for some unbundled components will form an essential requirement for all metro rail project proposals seeking central financial assistance”.

The three broad PPP models detailed in the policy include constructing new Metro Rail systems through the Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer mode, allowing private players to operate the service as well as supply rolling stock, and involving them in the maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure. The new policy, however, was described as “the most disastrous and retrograde urban transport policy’’ by E Sreedharan, who successfully headed the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) since its inception and is currently a principal advisor to it.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Sreedharan, who has consistently advocated against the PPP model in Metro rail, said, “The policy seems to have been framed by someone sitting in the NITI Aayog with absolutely no experience of how metro rail is built and operated. As it is, in India, all 12 such projects put together, only 20-25 km of new metro rail is made operational every year. China is galloping way ahead at 300 km of metro rail being opened every year. We are already moving at a snail’s pace. Now with this policy, everything will come to a standstill.’’

In March, The Indian Express had reported on the proposed move to reduce the Centre’s role in funding metro projects through a push for privatisation. India has, so far, steered clear of PPP in its metro rail projects due to the exigencies of keeping fares of public transport low. Moreover, the capital-intensive nature of such projects do not allow private firms to get a return on their investment unless they hike the fares steeply. Most of the metro rail projects so far have therefore been executed on the joint equity model with the costs being equally shared between the state and central governments.

The JV model was first successfully executed in case of the DMRC, followed by Mumbai Line-3, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Kochi. PPP, with Viability Gap Funding from the Union Government, has been tried out only for Mumbai Metro Line-1 and Hyderabad metro rail both of which saw severe cost escalations and delays.

In the case of Mumbai, the private player raised fares steeply. In the Airport line of Delhi Metro, the private concessionaire abandoned the project mid-way forcing the DMRC to step in and take over operations.

CoA demands BCCI office bearers be removed for non compliance,"Committee of Administrators (CoA) have demanded current BCCI office bearers be removed. (Source: PTI) Committee of Administrators (CoA) have demanded current BCCI office bearers be removed. (Source: PTI)

The Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators has demanded that BCCI office-bearers CK Khanna, Amitabh Choudhary, Anirudh Chaudhary be removed from office for non compliance of the directives.

In their status report submitted to the Apex Court, the CoA also demanded forensic audit of each state association under 3-member committee of a former Supreme Court judge on the lines of Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) and Hyderabad. The status report further says, “It’s clear state associations have no desire to implement reforms.”

CoA also observed that Johri was prevented from attending the board’s SGM on July 26 where decisions were taken on implementation of the reforms. In their status report, the CoA observed the SGM as “…nothing but an exercise in self-perpetuation by vested, interests…”.

In the fifth status report, the CoA suggested:

– more empowerment to finalise the text of the new BCCI constitution;

– bring into effect the new BCCI Constitution immediately upon the CoA;

– bring in a new funds disbursement policy with funds from BCCI to state associations only made according to that;

– create a separate committee to commission a forensic audit of each state association;

– appoint an administrator a month before elections in a state association to oversee the preparation of electoral polls;

– direct the existing office bearers of BCCI – CK Khanna, Amitabh Choudhary and Anirudh Chaudhary be disallowed from being associated with the working of the BCCI – and hand over control to the CoA headed by the BCCI CEO (Rahul Johri) until elections are held.

The initial committee comprised of Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikram Limaye, and former Indian women cricket captain Diana Edulji. They all interacted with Rahul Johri, CEO of BCCI, for supervision and functioning of the cricket Board. Guha and Limaye had stepped down from their roles.

Maharashtra govt may raise bonds to fund irrigation projects in areas prone to drought,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Express photo by Prashant Nadkar Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Express photo by Prashant Nadkar

With more than Rs 80,000 crore required to complete ongoing irrigation projects in Maharashtra, the state’s water resources department wants the Chief Minister’s Office to consider allowing it to raise money through tax-free bonds.

Kicking off this financing plan, the department has submitted a proposal to raise Rs 3,000 crore through this route, said sources in the government.

The proposal is to permit irrigation development corporations to raise resources through such bonds, with the state government issuing guarantees for them.

Sources confirmed that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was in favour of the proposal, and is likely to approve it soon. Incidentally, it was during the previous Sena-BJP rule in Maharashtra in 1995-99 that the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) became the first state undertaking to similarly raise bonds.

This time, besides the MKVDC, the department is pushing to let other irrigation development corporations, including the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation and the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, which are overseeing a number of irrigation projects in drought-prone and suicide-prone belts, to raise bonds.

While Maharashtra has the largest number of dams in the country, its cultivated area under irrigation is far below the national average, with less than 20 per cent of the cultivated area brought under irrigation so far.

In 2017-18, the department has been allocated a budget of Rs 8,000 crore.

But irrigation department officials said that more than 360 major, medium, and minor irrigation projects, involving an expenditure of close to Rs 84,000 crore, were ongoing.

Apart from the state’s own budget, the Centre has pitched in, committing funding support of Rs 4000 crore for 26 crucial irrigation projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY).

Further, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has also extended a soft loan of Rs 12,000 crore for these 26 projects.

The department’s plan behind exploring the external funding option is to further. bridge the resource gap, said government sources.

The plan is to use the money raised through bonds to fund ongoing projects in drought-prone regions in areas where there was no irrigation backlog. As per Governor’s directives, a bulk of the public sector investment in this field from the state’s own budget is to be utilised for completion of projects in the irrigation backlog areas.

Britain’s most advanced and biggest warship, the 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, berthed for the first time at its home port of Portsmouth on Wednesday. The 280-metre (920-foot) vessel entered the harbour on England’s southern coast at 0610 GMT, greeted by thousands of spectators. HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy, according to the Ministry of Defence.

“Today we welcome our mighty new warship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, to her home for the very first time,” said Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. “She is Britain’s statement to the world: a demonstration of British military power and our commitment to a bigger global role.”

The ship is currently undergoing sea trials. It cannot yet deploy planes, but flying trials from its deck are due to begin in 2018. It took eight years to build HMS Queen Elizabeth, with construction taking place in six cities and involving 10,000 people.

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 6: Akshay Kumar film inching towards Rs 100 crore,"Toilet:Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 6: It wouldn’t be surprising if Akshay Kumar’s film manages to cross or reach somewhere close to the Rs 100 crore mark by tomorrow. Toilet:Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 6: It wouldn’t be surprising if Akshay Kumar’s film manages to cross or reach somewhere close to the Rs 100 crore mark by tomorrow.

Much like Akshay Kumar’s career graph, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha has also been witnessing a massive upward trend. It has left fans in awe of Akshay Kumar, who earlier this year gave another blockbuster hit. It is evident that this film too is not going to settle for anything less than Rs 100 crore by the end the of the first week. “#ToiletEkPremKatha is a ONE-HORSE RACE… Does MASSIVE biz on Independence Day… Crosses ₹ 80 cr, racing towards ₹ 100 cr… #TEPK,” wrote Bollywood trade analyst, Taran Adarsh.

The film had already crossed the Rs 50 crore mark on its first weekend and now it has collected as much as Rs 83.45 crore till now. Hence, it wouldn’t be surprising if the film manages to cross or reach somewhere close to the Rs 100 crore mark by tomorrow.

” #ToiletEkPremKatha Fri 13.10 cr, Sat 17.10 cr, Sun 21.25 cr, Mon 12 cr, Tue 20 cr. Total: ₹ 83.45 cr. India biz. FABULOUS… #TEPK,” wrote Taran Adarsh on Twitter. On Monday, the film had slightly dipped, but all the loss for it got covered up on Tuesday-the Independence Day holiday- when the film, earned as much as Rs 20 crore. Toilet: Ek Prem Katha also marked has also been the sixth highest opener of 2017.

The film has been declared tax-free in BJP ruled states. This Friday, Gurinder Chadha’s Partition: 1947 starring Huma Qureshi will release in theatres. Will it pose as a competition for Toilet: Ek Prem Katha? Only time can tell. However, going by the popularity of Khiladi Kumar, we can safely presume, even if Gurinder Chadha’s Partition:1947 flourishes with excellent reviews, it won’t pose to be a massive threat to Akshay Kumar’s film.

‘Jail bharo’ agitation: 700 farmers held in Haryana,"The agitators are demanding that the debt of all the farmers should be waived as they are “unable to repay their loan because of inadequate rates of their crop.” (File Photo) The agitators are demanding that the debt of all the farmers should be waived as they are “unable to repay their loan because of inadequate rates of their crop.” (File Photo)

Nearly 700 farmers have been arrested so far owing to a ‘Jail Bharo’ agitation in Haryana that began on August 9 to push for farm loan waiver. The agitation will continue on Monday, the concluding day of its current phase.

The farmers, in groups, have been courting arrests at mainly four places Pipli (Kurukshetra), Karnal, Uklana (Hisar) and Sirsa, apart from other regions in the state.

The agitators are demanding that the debt of all the farmers should be waived as they are “unable to repay their loan because of inadequate rates of their crop.” Farmers are demanding crop price as suggested by the Swaminathan Commission report, which had recommended 50 per cent profit over and above the cost of production.

Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) state unit acting president Karam Singh Mathana told The Indian Express on Sunday that the most of the farmers courted arrests during the stir are still lodged in jails. BKU state president Gurnam Singh Chaduni is lodged in Yamunanagar jail since August 9 when he had led a group of farmers to offer arrest at Pipli.

“We are forced to court arrest because the farmers are still facing economic crisis even 70 years after Independence,” said Rakesh Bains, spokesperson of BKU, while addressing a group of farmers who had reached Pipli to court arrest under the movement on Sunday. “The farmers have produced foodgrains for the country but they are still facing tough times for their livelihood. Earlier, the farmers had helped in bringing Green Revolution but now they are gearing up for a Kisan Revolution,” he added.

According to Bains, thousands of farmers in 21 other states apart from Haryana have also participated in the ongoing Jail Bharo agitation by offering court arrests. “If the government doesn’t make clear its policy on the issue of farm loans, the farmers will be forced to launch a bigger agitation,” he warned.

"Rahul Gandhi mocks Modi’s Independence Day speech: PM silent on unemployment, Doklam, Gorakhpur","Congress-Vice President Rahul Gandhi. Congress-Vice President Rahul Gandhi.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for limiting his Independence Day speech to just 57 minutes, his shortest in four years. Speaking at an event in Bengaluru on Wednesday, Gandhi said: “Mr. Modi is reducing the duration of his speeches, as now he has nothing to talk about.”

The prime minister promised two crore jobs yearly, Gandhi said, but the unemployment rate is the highest in eight years. “The PM did not tell you on Aug 15 that the rate of unemployment is highest in 8 years…,” he said.

Gandhi then blamed PM Modi for undoing the UPA government’s hard work in restoring peace to Jammu and Kashmir. “We worked hard in 10 years to bring peace to Jammu and Kashmir, it was all destroyed in one month by Modi government,” he said.

PM Modi, on August 15, reached out to the Valley saying Kashmir’s problems can only be resolved by embracing its residents, not through abuse or bullets. “On Kashmir, there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people. The problem will be solved neither by abuse or bullets, it will be solved by embracing all Kashmiris,” PM Modi said.

On the two-month long ongoing standoff at Doklam, Gandhi said: “Some time back Chinese president came to India. While our PM was hugging him, a thousand Chinese soldiers entered our territory. Yesterday, did anyone hear the PM say that the Chinese forces are still sitting inside Bhutan?”

Referring to the Gorakhpur hospital deaths, Gandhi claimed that the Modi-led government slashed the healthcare budget, leaving no money for the hospital to buy oxygen cylinders. “The PM did not tell you that more than 90 babies died in Gorakhpur due to his healthcare policies,” he said.

How to Be More: 70 defining moments in Indian history,"Acting President BD Jatti administering the oath of office to Morarji Desai as Prime Minister of India at Rashtrapati Bhawan, New Delhi on March 24, 1977 Acting President BD Jatti administering the oath of office to Morarji Desai as Prime Minister of India at Rashtrapati Bhawan, New Delhi on March 24, 1977

In 1948, Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination sent shock waves across newly independent India. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was banned by Sardar Patel, the then Home Minister and a committed Gandhian, who called it a “cult of violence”.

India’s central banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India, was nationalised in 1949.In 1950, India became a republic upon the enactment of the Constitution and guaranteed universal adult suffrage to all its citizens.

The Planning Commission was set up on March 15, 1950, and the first Five Year Plan, the bedrock of how development was to be planned, pushed and executed in the country, got underway.

From 1951-59, the first Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Kharagpur, Chennai, Powai and Kanpur were set up. This enshrined the idea that technical education was not a luxury, but a necessity for a newly independent, even if poor country, like India.

India started work on what Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first Prime Minister, called the “temples of modern India” — large hydro-electric projects such as the Bhakra Nangal Dam (completed in 1963), Hirakud Dam (completed in 1957) among others.

The first democratically elected Communist government in the world assumed office in Kerala in 1957. It was dismissed by the Centre in two years, but it made history, nonetheless.

K Asif’s magnum-opus Mughal-e-Azam released in August 1960. Asif, apparently, came upon the idea in 1944, after reading a play and had to wait for a long time to get financiers for the film.

Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, became the first IIM to be set up on November 13, 1961. Like in the case of the IITs, the idea that the state could subsidise higher education was an audacious one.

The 1962 India-China War over Aksai-chin led to a defeat for India and had serious internal consequences. Nehru’s health took a beating, never to recover, and the non-Left Opposition in the country gained ground. Thousands of Communist members and supporters were arrested.

Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre was set up in 1963.

Another war with Pakistan a year after Nehru’s death in 1964 kept the country on tenterhooks. Lal Bahadur Shastri, the then Prime Minister, mindful of the food crisis as well as the mood of the country, coined the slogan, ‘Jai jawan jai kisan’.

1966 saw the then PM Indira Gandhi devalue the Indian rupee by one-third. The move came under heavy criticism, but it was done in the context of a very shaky balance of payments situation and food insufficiency. Droughts that year resulted in massive food shortage and India had to shop for food in the international world market. The move was criticised heavily, but the devaluation managed to reduce the astronomical fiscal deficit at the time.

Dr Reita Faria became the first Asian woman to win the Miss World pageant in 1966. It would be nearly three decades later that Sushmita Sen would win another beauty pageant in 1994.

The Green Revolution was ushered in in the early Sixties, with the introduction of high-yield variety of crops, eventually leading India to food self-sufficiency.

India won its first Test cricket series in New Zealand in 1968.

Banks were nationalised in 1969 by Indira Gandhi. This was a landmark moment in Indian economics and politics and earned Gandhi her spurs as a pro-poor Leader, which reaped results in the 1971 elections.

India won its first World Cup in 1983; Rakesh Sharma was the first Indian to travel in space in 1984; Jyoti Basu with Harkishan Singh Surjeet. Basu was the longest-serving chief minister of an elected Communist government lll India won its first World Cup in 1983; Rakesh Sharma was the first Indian to travel in space in 1984; Jyoti Basu with Harkishan Singh Surjeet. Basu was the longest-serving chief minister of an elected Communist government lll

Dr V Kurien launched a cooperative milk revolution, the White Revolution, in Gujarat in 1970, enabling women to share the economic prosperity ushered in by their efforts. It was memorialised in the Shyam Benegal film, Manthan (1976). In 1988, the World Bank published an audit which “revealed that of the Rs 200 crore the World Bank invested in Operation Flood (Kurien’s project), the net return on India’s rural economy was a massive Rs 24,000 crore each year over a period of 10 years, to which no other dairy programme has ever matched.”

In 1970, the Department of Electronics (DoE) was set up to “promote the rapid growth of electronics and computers”. Between 1971 and 1978, a company called the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) was set up to lay emphasis on the indigenous design and development of computers, using primarily India-made components. ECIL made the TDC 312 and TDC 316 computers.

Bangladesh was carved out of East Pakistan after a civil war, in which India sided with the Mukti Bahinis of Bangladesh. The Simla Agreement was signed after the conclusion of the India-Pakistan war in 1971, laying the basis of peace with Pakistan for nearly three decades.

Project Tiger was launched in 1973. Its main objective was to ensure a viable population of tigers in India and to preserve areas of biological importance as a “natural heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people”.

The Kesavanand Bharati case was heard before the Supreme Court in 1973. It gave birth to the crucial “basic structure” doctrine of the Constitution. If it did not tamper with India’s “basic structure”, any law could be legislated and could pass muster.

Pokharan nuclear test in 1974 led to the formation of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group internationally to try and restrict India after its show of strength.

Aryabhata, India’s first satellite, was launched in 1975. Built by ISRO, it was launched from Kapustin Yar in the then-USSR. RBI kept the image of Aryabhata on the reverse of the Rs 2 note from 1976 to 1997.

Ramesh Sippy’s Sholay was released in1975, a landmark multi-starrer that became the benchmark for decades to come. Four of the top stars — Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Jaya Bhaduri and Hema Malini – went onto become Members of Parliament. The film launched Amjad Khan as the very impressive villain, Gabbar Singh.

The Constitution was amended very significantly in 1976 and the words “secular” and “socialist” added to the Preamble.

The first non-Congress government was formed at the Centre in 1977. Several parties came together as the Janata Party to fight Emergency. Jayaprakash Narayan was the central figure and leader of this anti-Congress formation. Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister after the electoral win.

Jyoti Basu became the chief minister of West Bengal in 1977 and helmed the longest-serving elected Communist government in the world.

On April 23, 1977, World Health Organisations’s International Smallpox Assessment Commission declared India to be free of small pox.

India won its last hockey gold at the Olympics in 1980.

In 1982, the concept of a low power transmitter (LPT) gained ground and television broadcast became possible to the remotest parts of India. Colour telecast and the reach of television became truly broad-based.

In 1983, India won the Cricket World Cup under Kapil Dev.

On April 2, 1984, Rakesh Sharma became the first and only Indian to travel in space aboard the Soyuz T-11. When asked by PM Indira Gandhi about what he thought of India from space, he famously replied, “Saare jahan se achha.”

India moved into Siachen, the highest battlefield in the world, in 1984. This is a disputed glacier in Kashmir and while a ceasefire was declared in 2003, it remains a battleground to date.

Operation Blue Star, a campaign by the Indian Army against separatists demanding Khalistan under the leadership of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, attacked the spiritual nerve of the Sikh community — the Golden Temple in Amritsar in June 1984. The extensive damage caused to the shrine, shattered Sikhs, mostly not sympathetic to the Khalistan cause.

In July 1984, India’s first soap opera, Hum Log, scripted by well-known Hindi writer Manohar Shyam Joshi started being telecast on Doordarshan. This was said to have been inspired by a Mexican soap but its portrayals of a middle-class Indian family remain memorable.

Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her security guards in 1984, as revenge for Operation Blue Star. What was shameful for independent India was the organised anti-Sikh pogroms that followed. In 2005, then PM Manmohan Singh would apologise to the nation for the “the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our Constitution”.

In 1986, Harsha Chawda became the first Indian test-tube baby. She made Dr Indira Hinduja, an in-vitro fertilisation expert, a star at the time. Chawda, incidentally, became a mother last year.

In 1987, the Parliament enacted a special law to reverse a Supreme Court order around maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman, Shah Bano, to restore what was the primacy of Muslim Personal Law over the lives of Muslim citizens. This gave the Hindu right wing a loud campaign message.

After two decades of conflict between the Mizos and the Indian state, in June, 1986, the Mizoram Accord was signed between Rajiv Gandhi and Laldenga. This had a very significant bearing on peace in the north-eastern states.

1989 saw Salman Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses banned in India. It was the first country to do so, but several others followed suit. It eventually led to a fatwa by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini against Rushdie. This was a dark moment and an indication how plural democracies would not commit to freedom of expression.

In the early Nineties, the situation in Kashmir deteriorated with Kashmiri Pandits being forced to leave the Valley as murderous attacks on them made their stay impossible.

The Mandal Commission, arguing for the need for special quotas for Other Backward Classes in government jobs, was submitted to the government in 1980, but was gathering dust till VP Singh decided to implement it in August 1990. The move was to result in a huge tumult, especially in north India. First, anti-Mandal protests and then pro-Mandal protests erupted across the country. Leaders who made a mark in the anti-Mandal and pro-Mandal protests would go on to dominate Indian politics for the next three decades.

In Kerala, the total literacy movement was first initiated in Ernakulam district and Kottayam municipality in the late ’80s. On 4th of February 1990, the then Prime Minister Shri VP Singh declared Ernakulam as the first totally literate district in India.

Economic liberalisation was kicked off formally by then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the first budget after the Congress returned to power in 1991. It was a move that transformed India’s economy, politics and society.

Former PM Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in May 1991, while on campaign in Sriperumbudur. It would go on to change the course of Indian politics.

Panchayat elections became mandatory in 1992, kicking off a silent revolution as elected leadership at local levels provided a basis for deepening democracy in the years to come.

Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was pulled down by a mob, mobilised over months in 1992. It opened up a communal fault line that continues to divide Indian politics.

Satyajit Ray, the legendary Bengali filmmaker, was awarded an Honorary Oscar in 1992 for Lifetime Achievement by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In 1995, Aditya Chopra’s Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge was released both in India and internationally. It would establish Shah Rukh Khan as an enduring star.

After 1948, Leander Paes won the first individual medal for India in Olympics in 1996.

The cellphone came to India in 1996. West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu held the first mobile phone conversation in the country.

In 1999, following massive cross-border infiltration, India and Pakistan would face off at Kargil. Pakistan was led by General Pervez Musharraf, who went on to become President of Pakistan.

The hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane flying into Delhi from Kathmandu by the Taliban in 1999 remains one of India’s most dramatic stories of a negotiation gone wrong. Eventually, three terrorists in Indian jails had to be released in exchange for the safe passage of passengers aboard the ill-fated IC 814.

In the late Nineties, Cable TV connected India in a way few things have done. BBC, CNN were all bold and beautiful and put India, slowly but surely, on a path of irreversible information and media integration.

After the attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the biggest military build-up along the border with Pakistan took place, an “eyeball to eyeball” confrontation, as India held Pakistan repsonsible for the assault on the Parliament complex. This was termed Operation Parakram. It finally ended in 2004, with PM Vajpayee’s visit to Pakistan in January and the start of a cross-LoC bus.

In 2002, RSS flew the tricolour for the first time at its headquarters in Nagpur. Till then, it had not recognised the national flag.

Nearly 2,000 people died in the 2002 Gujarat riots, triggered by the burning of a train in Godhra, killing kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya. Retaliatory anger and an administration, either unable to control the situation or complicit in it, watched as Muslims were killed in mob attacks.

India became free of leprosy in December 2005.

India’s space programme came of age as the first unmanned space mission Chandrayaan-1 reached the moon on November 8, 2008. It included a lunar orbiter and an impactor launched by a modified version of the PSLV on October 22, 2008.

The Right to Information Act and NREGA (now, MNREGA) were enacted in 2005 and 2006 respectively. MNREGA and RTI are among the world’s most progressive laws and are recognised by the United Nations as such. Right to Education became a universal right in 2010 and India became one of the 135 countries to adopt it.

India-US Nuclear Accord between Manmohan Singh and George Bush in 2006 broke the nuclear apartheid in place after Pokharan 2 and allowed (at least, in principle) access to crucial civilian and military technology. This came at a price in domestic politics as the Left parties withdrew support to UPA and led to series of unintended consequences politically.

In 2006, Maqbool Fida Husain, among the greatest painters in the world, was forced into exile until his death in London for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiment through his paintings. The Supreme Court though, in the end, defended artistic expression, in a much-discussed verdict.

In 2008, 10 gunmen travelled to Mumbai in a dinghy and killed nearly 200 persons across south Mumbai in one of the worst terror attacks on India.

India won its second cricket World Cup in 2011 under MS Dhoni.

India Against Corruption, a movement launched by a group of citizens, NGOs and other anti-Congress groups in 2011, was able to force issues with the elected government of the day and score vital political points.

On March 27, 2014, India was declared polio-free.

Narendra Modi was elected Prime Minister in 2014 after the most expensive campaign in Indian political history. He became the first chief minister to directly campaign as a PM-candidate and make it.

VIP 2 movie review: The sequel to Velai Illa Pattadhaari, this film has Dhanush, Amala Paul, Samuthirakani and Vivekh reprising their roles in addition to Kajol making a comeback in Kollywood.

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 movie cast: Dhanush, Kajol, Amala Paul, Vivekh

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 movie director: Soundarya Rajinikanth

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 movie rating: 2.5 stars

Velai Illa Pattadhaari 2 aka VIP2 was one of the most awaited movies of the year. The sequel to Velai Illa Pattadhaari, this film has Dhanush, Amala Paul, Samuthirakani and Vivekh reprising their roles in addition to Kajol making a comeback in Kollywood after almost two decades. Directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth and penned by Dhanush himself, the film is all about Raghuvaran and how he deals with unemployment. The plot then proceeds to build around Raghuvaran’s company and him locking horns with corporate honcho of sorts, Vasundhara. All of this was already known before. It was, however, interesting to see how all of this translated on the silver screen.

Story:

The most important factor of any sequel is the continuity. Soundarya Rajinikanth and her team have done it beautifully. Tiny things like Raghuvaran’s pet and his tent office on the terrace, to the the big things like the VIP boys who supported him in Part 1 – the flow is almost flawless. Vasundhara’ s entry was stylish, every bit as arrogant as we expected and in a way, unsurprisingly impressive.

The massy elements, the entertaining song and dance numbers, stunts that are sure to impress Dhanush’s fans made up the rest of the plot elements. It made the usual conflict between an antagonist and his counterpart interesting. But in the end, the potential was lost. One must mention that the plot was an interesting try.

Screenplay and direction:

There is an art to screenplay and direction. Even commercial films have the potential to become a cult classic. VIP was one such film. Sadly, VIP 2 isn’t so. While everything was close to great, the fact that the film was stretched too much did make one anxious. Also, what is with the shots where we can’t see an actor as he performs?

Cast:

Dhanush is a star, and a performer who has won people over with his modesty and acting chops. He has done it again, and it is no surprise. Kajol, on the other hand, was spectacular in each frame. From her looks to the way she complimented Vasundhara, it did look like a part written for her. The only problem was the voice. At places, in the back of your mind, you have this irritation at the voice and the face not being a perfect match. Other than that, she got a rousing reception from the audience too. Amala Paul as the cranky and nagging wife plays her part well. Saranya Ponvannan’s appearance was unexpected and, in a way, nostalgic. Samuthirakani as the supportive and friendly father has done his part well.

Cinematography:

Sameer Thahir has done a sound job. Especially, the shots of Dhanush and Kajol locking horns is stunning in places. The style with which the scenes have been executed and edited is notable.

Music:

Sean Roldan is making a name for himself as a composer to look out for. Anirudh Ravichander’s BGM is unforgettable, and when we hear it at the beginning, the recall value reaches a different level. Sean Roldan’s music is beautiful, but will it ignite the same passion? After watching the film, it seems doubtful.

"More accountant, less visionary","Some of the statistics the PM used are simply beyond the realm of possibility. (PTI/Atul Yadav)) Some of the statistics the PM used are simply beyond the realm of possibility. (PTI/Atul Yadav))

Independence Day speeches are nearly always a joint manifesto. They give an account of what has been done, and they lay out a vision for the future. This is especially true when prime ministers address the nation in the middle of their term, not at its beginning. More than three years into his rule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today had to be an accountant and a visionary at the same time. He had to chronicle what his government had done, and outline where he wishes to go.

However necessary, accounting is nearly always a pedantic, even boring, exercise. Captivating poetic phrases can easily mark a statement of vision, but it is hard to attach poetic elegance to an account of how many toilets have been built, how much black money has been unearthed, how many villages have electricity, how farmers have produced a record pulse harvest, etc.

Even so, this I-Day speech by the prime minister had an uncharacteristically prosaic character. He is by now justly famous for his oratorical eloquence in Hindi. Indeed, since Hindi is my first language, I have often marveled at how phrases and images emerge in his Hindi speeches with masterful ease. That eloquence was missing today. Leaving style and manner aside, let us now concentrate on the substance of the two analytically separable parts of the speech — the accounting and the vision. Let us start with accounting.

The prime minister perhaps gave his most data-filled speech ever. Among other things, he gave an exact count of the following: How many villages were without electricity when he came to power and how many have electricity today; how much black money has entered the banking mainstream after demonetisation; how many income tax payers have been added to the historically slender direct tax base of India; how many fake shell companies existed and how many have been shut down (including the statement that 400 shell companies until recently had the same address); how many tonnes of pulses the government had procured from the farmer at remunerative prices; how many farmers had used the crop insurance scheme for the first time.

The prime minister even recounted a remarkable rail track building story. For 42 years, somewhere in India, the railways department could not put down a 70-72 km track. That is how slow and cumbersome, he said, the administrative procedures were, which his government has simplified. For so many approvals, 80 forms were necessary. Under his regime, often only five forms have to be filled. When a train changes its track, he contended, it slows down before picking up speed. He said his government has taken countless decisions, changed the direction of the country, but it never slowed down.

The nation should indeed be made aware of such developments. The trouble is that as commentators, we also have to check the veracity of his statistics. It is not our job simply to accept what the government is saying. It is doubtless true that GST would enhance the efficiency of inter-state road transport. But is it true that with the arrival of GST, transport efficiency has gone up by 30 per cent, as he put it? It is too early to tell.

Moreover, some of the statistics the PM used are simply beyond the realm of possibility. Yet again, he repeated the argument that by 2022, farmers incomes will double. To double incomes in five years, we need an annual growth rate of a little over 14 per cent. I have studied agriculture, and written and published on it. At least since the early decades of the 20th century, nowhere in the world has agriculture grown at 14 per cent annually for a five-year period, unless war temporarily devastated the economy and the growth process resumed after such devastation. For a whole variety of reasons understood well by economists, industry can grow at 14 per cent per annum, but for agriculture to grow at that rate is virtually impossible.

Let us now switch to the vision part of the speech. For many, it is the core of an Independence Day address. A sharp formulation on how to solve Kashmir will undoubtedly make the headlines the day after. Naa gaali se, naa goli se, bus gale lagaane se (neither invective, nor bullets will solve the Kashmir problem; we need a warm embrace).

Generally speaking, large narratives define a vision. Prime Minister Modi emphasised two such narratives in his speech: Corruption and economic progress. I have already commented on some economic issues above. More can be said, including a decline in growth rate, as the latest Economic Survey of the government makes clear. But let that not detain us here.

The PM repeatedly pointed to how India under his leadership was incentivising honesty in citizen and business conduct, how ab beimaani ke liye jagah nahin (no room for dishonesty any more), how an imaandari ka mahotsav (“festival of honesty”) had commenced in India. This formulation, of course, took its sharpest form during demonetisation, and has continued ever since.

That some cleaning up has taken place is beyond doubt. That the top layers of Central government in Delhi have had no corruption scandals is also clear. But two things bedevil this narrative: Little investigation of BJP corruption at the state level (for example, the Vyapam scandal in MP), and political finance (who paid for the purchase of Congress MLAs in Gujarat recently).

But most important was the relative neglect of a crying need of the hour. India badly needs communal peace. Lynchings have shaken the Muslim community. If not stopped, it is not clear what domestic peace India can obtain. Over the last two months in India, I have traveled a lot, talked a lot, listened a lot. I have not come across a single Muslim who is not feeling insecure. The outgoing vice president publicly spoke about it — not without reason.

PM Modi spent not more than a minute on this hugely important matter in his hour-long speech. It was perfunctory. This is not a matter that grabs his attention. But it may be among the most significant emerging issues in the nation’s politics. After all is said and done, in this day and age, no democracy can afford to ignore its minorities.

Vadodara residents displaced by demolition to restart stir,"A protest held by Muslim families of Kalyannagar in Vadodara in March this year. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana/File) A protest held by Muslim families of Kalyannagar in Vadodara in March this year. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana/File)

Close to six months after an in situ rehabilitation project under Rajiv Awas Yojana for the displaced of a November 2014 demolition drive in Kalyannagar here was stalled for want of funds — as claimed by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) — the 550 families, mostly Muslims, are gearing up to restart their agitation for “justice”.

The VMC has, however, proposed the residents to consider relocation to Tandalja, which the families see as being “pushed into a Muslim ghetto”. Besides, they claim that the VMC has not given their rental allowance for June and July.

In a memorandum submitted to Vadodara Municipal Commissioner Vinod Rao on Tuesday, their representative J S Bandukwala demanded that their rehabilitation be done in accordance to the word given by the VMC and the local MLAs in 2015.

Bandukwala also raised the issue of rents. “Most families are poor and pay high rents in Fatehgunj, Gorwa and Navayard.” The memorandum reminded the VMC of maladministration and possible corruption in the use of funds meant for construction of the in situ homes, as cited by the civic body, bringing the project to a halt.

Rao had instituted an inquiry against F J Charpot, then executive engineer of affordable housing scheme, for escalation in the project cost, which went up from Rs 80 crore to Rs 150 crore.

When contacted, Rao said, “The discussion (about shifting the families to Tandalja) is on. Some families have agreed to shift and others will agree in coming days.”

Regarding the site at Kalyannagar, Rao said, “We will have to begin a process for cost recovery through auctioning. Any party, who is interested in completing the project, will be considered so that the project can be put to use.”

Raja Mandala: Undoing the economic partition,"This drift was accelerated by the new Indian emphasis on economic self-reliance and a deliberate disconnection from the global markets in the immediate aftermath of Independence. This drift was accelerated by the new Indian emphasis on economic self-reliance and a deliberate disconnection from the global markets in the immediate aftermath of Independence.

Seven decades after Independence, transcending the tragedy of Partition remains the single biggest national challenge for India. The structural religious tension, engendered by Partition has been aggravated by the unending conflict between India and Pakistan, the successor states of the undivided Subcontinent. Few had expected the conflict to last so long. Nor did the second partition in 1971, that seemed to decisively shift the balance of power in favour of India, create the conditions for enduring peace.

In fact, the vivisection of Pakistan in 1971 set the stage for the politics of revenge in Rawalpindi, the headquarters of the Pakistan army. It acquired nuclear weapons to restore a measure of balance with India. As nuclear weapons gave it a credible assurance that Delhi will no longer be able to embark on a major military adventure, Rawalpindi saw a new opportunity for permanent destabilisation of India through low intensity conflict.

Three decades and more of cross-border terror has not forced India to yield, but only help congeal the conflict. Despite the on-again off-again peace process of the last few decades, there is no hope of any early resolution of any issues involved. Pessimists have begun branding the India-Pakistan conflict as a “Hundred Years War”. Extremists may say it might be too optimistic to expect India and Pakistan will find peace in the next 30 years.

The messy consequences of dividing the Subcontinent — included the hurried drawing of boundaries between India and Pakistan in the Punjab and Bengal by the departing colonial power, the complex inheritance in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and the steady militarisation of these borders — were not going to be easily overcome under any circumstances. But coping with the division was made a lot more difficult by one factor that is not usually discussed in relation to the Partition of the Subcontinent — economics.

It was by no means pre-ordained that the political division of the Subcontinent should be followed by economic partition. The political division did not demand that the new states should stop trade and commerce between them or shut down their frontiers or limit people to people contact. In fact, the borders remained relatively open in the first two decades after Independence. The 1965 war, followed by the 1971 conflict, saw the closing of post Partition frontiers and with it the sundering of coherent economic spaces like the Punjab and Bengal.

This drift was accelerated by the new Indian emphasis on economic self-reliance and a deliberate disconnection from the global markets in the immediate aftermath of Independence.

The grand strategy of “socialism in one country”, whatever its ideological sources and economic merits, did not at all understand the long-term consequences of that policy for the natural economic interdependence of the state system in the Subcontinent. Not all frontiers shut down like those between India and Pakistan. Some remained open, as in the case of Nepal and Bhutan, but India’s deepening protectionism and the perception of neighbours as aliens, made it harder to sustain the regional interdependencies.

The great regional junctions and trading centres like Lahore and Amritsar turned into terminals at closed frontiers. India and Pakistan made it ever harder for movement of goods and people between the two countries. Entrepôts like Calcutta steadily began to lose their centrality in the vast hinterland in the eastern Subcontinent and beyond. Economic partition of the subcontinent made regions like the Northeast “land locked”.

India’s smaller neighbours tried different ways to cope with India’s deregionalisation. Sri Lanka, in the late 1970s, turned to the ASEAN and the West. Businessmen in Nepal sought arbitrage between the tariff levels of Delhi and Kathmandu. The political liberation of Bangladesh in 1971 had little economic consequence, thanks to shared commitment to state socialism between Congress and the Awami League. When Dhaka tried to promote regionalism and SAARC in the 1980s, Delhi viewed the initiative with great suspicion.

It was only after 1991 that India put regionalism back on the policy radar. India’s new commercial interest in the neighbourhood was very much a consequence of the turn towards globalisation. But it has not been easy to translate India’s new commitment to regional economic integration into effective policies. Internally the resistance to regionalism in India’s economic ministries remains strong. If India has belatedly returned to regionalism, the Subcontinent was not ready to celebrate and embrace Delhi. For much water had flown down the Indus and the Ganges. Pakistan is just not interested in putting economic cooperation as priority in bilateral relations. Worse still, it is determined to block India’s effort to promote regionalism under the SAARC banner. In smaller countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka, the politicisation of economic cooperation with India means knee jerk opposition to all projects involving India.

The smaller neighbours had also long discovered the joys of non-alignment and “strategic autonomy” from India now find an economically powerful and outward-oriented China as a valuable partner. While economic geography might still favour India, China operates with larger financial resources and greater purposefulness.

Overcoming the economic partition of the Subcontinent has become at once urgent and more difficult to achieve. Yet, the problem is not about the lack of ideas or resources. It is about mobilising all of Delhi’s political will to force the pace and raise the intensity of India’s regional economic engagement. Delhi’s decisions to look beyond SAARC, modernise border infrastructure, promote connectivity, open up its markets are all important steps forward. The challenge now is to get a few specific projects off the ground to demonstrate India’s new credibility as a champion of South Asian regionalism.

Toilet Ek Prem Katha movie review: This Akshay Kumar film is derailed by clunky execution,"Toilet Ek Prem Katha movie review: The movie wastes much of its initial bits in creating a romance between the middle-aged Keshav (Akshay Kumar) and the sprightly Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar). Toilet Ek Prem Katha movie review: The movie wastes much of its initial bits in creating a romance between the middle-aged Keshav (Akshay Kumar) and the sprightly Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar).

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha star cast: Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar, Divyendu Sharma, Sudhir Pandey, Anupam Kher

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha director: Shree Narayan Singh

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha rating: 2 stars

The noblest ideas are very often derailed by clunky execution. This is the problem with Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, which had the potential to become a deep, dark satirical take on one of the biggest problems that still shamefully plagues India: defecation in the open.

The film which has to contend with a clunky title in the first place, wastes much of its initial bits in creating a romance between the middle-aged Keshav (Akshay) and the sprightly Jaya (Pednekar), which derails as soon as the latter turns into a ‘nai-naveli dulhan’ and discovers that she has to be part of a ‘lota party’ at the crack of dawn to complete her ablutions.

If the conflict had stayed personal, this could have been something to watch. Because both Akshay who admits to looking his age, and Pednekar who steps into her second film pretty much like she did in her first (the wonderful Dum Laga Ke Haisha), spark well together. And the reason for the conflict, a basic human need, should have taken us down a new path in mainstream Bollywood cinema. If only the treatment hadn’t been so heavy handed, and bent upon underlining the obvious.

But the film is after something larger. It is after society. It is after culture. It is so busy pointing fingers at the Indians, good people but blinded by tradition of ‘jis aangan mein tulsi hai, usi mein shauchalaya kaise ban sakta hai’, who will still go out into the open, that it forgets that polemics make good academic papers. They do not necessarily make good films.

A still from Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. A still from Toilet: Ek Prem Katha.

It’s fitting that Akshay Kumar has greenlit and played the lead in this film, which is more a primer on How To Break Social Taboos and Make Toilets rather than a powerful social drama. The moment a film succumbs to being the carrier of a Message as opposed to a message, it becomes burdened.

Akshay has been playing the nationalist hero in his last few films, filling in the space that Manoj Kumar had left vacant. And he’s done a good job with it: there’s something in the way he comes at being earnest that you want to believe.

Here too, he tries hard to get past the heavy-handedness and the clunkiness and the leaded messaging which engulfs the second half, when you have to go looking for the movie from under the message. And you have to look for a long time, because the film feels so stretched: a `lath-maar’ Holi sequence is bunged in, because a) it’s Mathura and b) well, because it’s a song-and-dance.

This kind of film, where the s**t literally hits the fan, where you can see real turd droppings, and the dialogue is filled with such ‘sanskaari-sarkaari’ words like ‘soch’, ‘shauchalaya’ and ‘sandaas’, needs a light touch. You need the ‘khadi boli’ of Mathura, where the film is set, spoken with a great deal more authenticity. And above all, if you are going to give me a feisty heroine who is happy to throw off her ‘ghoonghat’, and rail against patriarchy, you should not make her touch anyone’s feet. If you are making a film that hoists a flag for a strong feminist ideal, then don’t waver, and confuse it with stuffing the film with too many issues.

Otherwise, you dilute and confuse things, especially because your lead actors have stayed the smelly course.

School run by Rajinikanth’s wife shut over rent; management to file defamation,"About 400 children of the Ashram school run by Latha Rajinikanth have been subsequently shifted to another institution. (Source: Facebook) About 400 children of the Ashram school run by Latha Rajinikanth have been subsequently shifted to another institution. (Source: Facebook)

The school run by the wife of Tamil superstar Rajinikanth was locked by the landlord of the building on charges that the rent agreed to was not being paid. The school authorities said they have decided to file a defamation case against the landlord for creating “immense agony to the school and issuing false statements to the media.”

About 400 children of the Ashram school run by Latha Rajinikanth have been subsequently shifted to another institution. Venkateshwaralu, the landlord of the school, claimed the management agreed to pay the rent as per a court directive till they vacate the premises by May 2018 which they had not adhered to fully.

He said the school authorities did not pay the quantum of rent as agreed to.

Later in a statement, the school management said it would file a defamation case against the landlord.

Stating that the school has been operating in the existing premises for more than a decade, the management claimed it has faced lot of harassment in the recent past due to the “family dispute” of the landlord.

“It is not just about the rent but it is about their exploitation of the situation and it is about asking unfair, unreasonable and exorbitant increment in rentals which we have been negotiating and speaking with them (landlord)”, the statement by the management said.

Stating that the management decided to “vacate” the premises and negotiations were on to settle the matter, the statement alleged that the landlord “harassed them by using the media continuously” when a civil dispute was pending in the court.

“Since the matter is sub-judice, we would like to record this statement. Taking law into his hands and without any information, once again the landlord has created immense agony to the school, children, parents and to management today,” it said.

“We will be filing a defamation case against the landlord for making false statements to the press. Apart from that, we will wait for the law to take its own course,” it said.

“We request the media and the public to understand the truth,” it added.

71st Independence Day: CM Devendra Fadnavis promises to free farmers of loans,"The CM at Mantralaya’s I-Day celebration. Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar The CM at Mantralaya’s I-Day celebration. Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Tuesday reiterated his stand that loan waiver was not a long-lasting solution to farmers’ problems, even as he said his government was working towards freeing all farmers of debts.

“The government has given a Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver to 89 lakh farmers. But we are not going to seek solace and rest. It cannot provide permanent satisfaction. We will continue to strive to make farmers loan free forever, which would require greater empowerment and sustainable agriculture practices through scientific approach and higher capital investments in the sector,” he said after hoisting the national flag at Mantralaya.

In his Independence Day address, the CM called upon the people to work towards making a “modern Maharashtra”.

Fadnavis said the government would build 12 lakh houses in rural and 10 lakh houses in urban areas under affordable housing project by 2019. “We have started work on 3 lakh houses,” he said.

Listing the achievements of his government, the CM said, “Maharashtra is the first state that has set up a separate ministry for the OBCs. In the last two-and-a half years, we have introduced several social and economic schemes for the OBCs. Under the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj scheme, we have provided Rs 1,200-crore scholarships to economically backward students. The state has included 605 new courses under the scheme to help students representing Maratha and other communities almost on the lines of OBCs.”

Based on the theme of freedom, Fadnavis administered seven pledges to the gathering. Making farmers free from debt by providing loan waiver and higher investments in agriculture, making all drought-prone villages water reliant through Jalyukta Shivar, planting 5 lakh trees to help tackle pollution and working towards making Swachh Bharat Mission a success were some of them.

He praised the Centre’s move to introduce Goods and Services Tax, and said the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act would give people freedom from corrupt builders.

"Former-MLA writes to CM Kejriwal, asks exemption of women from toilet fee","Former Rajinder Nagar MLA and BJP leader RP Singh has written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal demanding that women be exempted from paying a fee to use toilets. “…Poor jhuggi dwellers are forced into open defecation largely because of the fee charged for toilet usage. This

fee can be more than Rs 300-400 per month for women in a family and becomes unbearable if the toilet is used by all the women and girls at home. Sir, this Independence Day, can your good office set these poor women free from paying usage charges in all the public toilets,” he said in his letter to Kejriwal.

He has also asked the Delhi government to arrange for spaces where women can bathe securely. “During my 10-month tenure as the MLA, I had similarly arranged for eight public bathing spaces in Sangam Colony cluster (near Naraina Bus Depot),” he said.

The Delhi government has built several toilets for residents of JJ Clusters over the past two years. However, thousands of women and men are still forced to defecate in the open for the lack of clean and safe public toilets.

Five more encephalitis-related child deaths were reported from the Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital since Tuesday, taking to 71, the number of persons who have died here of the disease since August 7, officials said today.

“As many as 14 fresh cases of encephalitis were admitted on August 15 and August 16. At present, there are 64 patients undergoing treatment in the hospital,” the office of the additional director health said giving details.

With the five deaths reported since Tuesday, the toll since August 7 in the state-run hospital has risen to 71, according to officials. Overall, since January 1, as many as 144 encephalitis-related deaths have taken place in the hospital, they said.

In Lucknow, amid allegations that shortage of oxygen cylinders at the hospital had led to the deaths, UP Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that loss of life due to such a reason was nothing less than a “heinous crime”.

He, however, added that all aspects related to the deaths at the state-run BRD medical college hospital were being probed by a panel led by the UP chief secretary. Those found guilty would be punished, Singh promised.

“Any death due to oxygen shortage is a heinous rime…Any laxity on this front is also a crime,” the UP health minister told reporters.

Singh said that “on the basis of a primary inquiry”, action was taken against the principal of the college. The deaths also led to a war of words between BJP and the Congress.

The Congress accused the Yogi Adityanath government of not accepting its responsibility on the issue. UP Congress chief Raj Babbar said that his party will fight till the victims get justice.

The BJP hit back accusing the Congress of playing politics over deaths. “The Congress is trying to exploit children’s death for politics. This is ridiculous and shameless,” BJP spokesman Rakesh Tripathi told reporters.

BSP chief Mayawati also targeted the government over the incident.

Meanwhile, UP Health Minister Singh said that a report had been sought from all the medical colleges and hospitals on the availability of oxygen or payment issues and added that everything had been found in order.

The minister said that hospitals and community health centres in the area were being provided all necessary facilities so that they are well equipped and patients do not have to run to the BRD medical college.

Kumkum Bhagya 16 August 2017 full episode written update: Pragya is alive,"Kumkum Bhagya 16 August 2017 full episode written update: Pragya (Sriti Jha) is alive but unconscious. Kumkum Bhagya 16 August 2017 full episode written update: Pragya (Sriti Jha) is alive but unconscious.

Abhi tells Dadi and Dasi that he finds Pragya’s behaviour strange and as if… and Dadi completes his sentence… as if she doesn’t believe that she is his wife. Abhi asks them if they also feel the same. Dadi and Dasi say that they sometimes feel this strongly that this is not Pragya. Abhi says even he feels so. Dadi says she neither wears sindoor nor the mangalsutra and earlier she used to strongly believe in these things. Dadi asks Abhi to talk to Pragya and make her understand that she should wear all these.

There Munni is getting ready and trying all those ornaments and Abhi gets back to the moment while he was standing outside her room. Abhi walks in and pulls out “Sindoor” box from the drawer and Munni gets conscious seeing this and gets it that Abhi will ask her to wear that. Abhi tells her that he’ll put the sindoor on her but she says she isn’t ready yet and he need not bother she’ll do it herself. Abhi says he’ll wait but she then says she has got allergy with this sindoor. Abhi says she didn’t have it earlier. She says it’s this particular sindoor she is allergic to and she’ll get new one from the market and then she’ll wear that. Abhi takes a pinch and asks her to wear it today and he’ll get the new one later but Munni pushes the box and spills the sindoor on the floor and she goes out of the room.

Abhi is completely shocked and sits on the floor while Munni runs to the temple and cries there to take her out of all this mess. She prays to the goddess to send Pragya as Abhi and his family need her. She says she can’t come between Pragya and her husband as she must have invested a lot in her relationship. She says she is doing this for her chutka and chutki and she has no clue where they are and how they are. Meanwhile a hand with drip is shown whose finger moves a bit. Munni prays to send Pragya to her family.

Next a servant runs downstairs shouting for her employer and tells her that the girl upstairs is getting conscious. The employer who is a doctor runs upstairs and we see Pragya lying unconscious on the bed with all those heavy machines around. The doctor asks Pragya about her name and her family but Pragya doesn’t open her eyes. She tells her servant that she must be mistaken and she wouldn’t have moved but the servant stresses that she saw her finger moving.

The doctor says only a miracle can save her. The servant asks her where did she find her and the doctor says she was in some village for some medical camp and there she saw her in the river. She says she succeeded in removing the bullet but couldn’t get her conscious and she is in same stage since then. She says there must be a strong will power which is keeping her alive for someone and the servant prays to god to make Pragya healthy again and make her meet her husband.

"Gujarat: Nitin Patel finished second and now, a ‘cold war’ brews","State Minister Nitin Patel. (File Photo) State Minister Nitin Patel. (File Photo)

For the Gujarat BJP, appointing a deputy chief minister was unprecedented. But ,the manner in which Nitin Patel got the post last August, spoke a great deal about the machinations that go on in the BJP. His announcement as Rupani’s deputy came in the wake of “almost confirmed” news that he will succeed Anandiben Patel as chief minister. Nitin Patel, 61-year-old leader of Mehsana, had also started giving interviews to news channels which began flashing news about the “impending announcement” as he began accepting congratulations from anchors and reporters alike. It seemed politically logical too — the Patidars were angry with the BJP government over quota demand and the police action they faced. This, however, didn’t happen. BJP president Amit Shah prevailed over other senior leaders at a meeting in Gandhinagar, and Rupani was given the top job.

The news surprised all. Rupani was a first time MLA unlike Nitin Patel who had served in various BJP governments since 1995.

One year down the line, sources say, a “cold war” is still brewing between the CM and his deputy. The sources give accounts of Cabinet meetings where the “differences” between the two leaders frequently surface. And, on most occasions Rupani manages to ignore it.

“Yes, a cold war is definitely there between the two. And many a times, even government officers face the brunt of it,” says a source close to the functioning of the offices of the CM and the Deputy CM.

Indicating the strained relationship between the top two in the government, an official said, “Take the recent floods in Banaskantha and Patan districts for example. The CM has taken a lead in relief and rehabilitation of the affected areas. Nitinbhai has remained almost aloof from the relief operations.” The latest issue of the state government’s fortnightly magazine — Gujarat, which was devoted to the flood — is full of pictures of the chief minister, whereas the presence of the Deputy CM is almost negligible.

“The Deputy CM did not participate much, so how can there be his pictures in it (the magazine),” said a government functionary.

Even as Rupani was camping along with his 10 ministers in the flood-affected areas for five days, Patel was also not handling the day-to-day government in Gandhinagar in CM’s absence. When reached, Nitin Patel dismissed talks of his differences with the chief minister or the brewing cold war between them.

“I have been in public life for the last 30 years. I do not pay heed to such bogus talks,” he said, dismissing claims that he did not visit the rain-affected areas. “I visited Radhanpur and Kankrej. As far as photographs (in Gujarat magazine) are concerned, I do not go to such places to get photographed…I had the responsibility of coordinating the entire state. While Banaskantha and Patan received heavy rain, so did places like Kalol. But, due to the intense gravity of flood situation in Banaskantha and Patan, they (Kalol and other places) got eclipsed… I was also actively involved in finalising the relief package,” said Patel.

The BJP on Wednesday attacked the Congress accusing it of playing politics over the death of several children in a state-run hospital in Gorakhpur. The Congress is trying to exploit children’s death for politics, this is ridiculous and shameless, BJP spokesman Rakesh Tripathi told reporters in Lucknow.

“The Yogi Adityanath government is firmly determined to provide best healthcare facilities in the state. It is taking time due to a collapsed system but the government is working in the right direction,” he claimed.

Terming the agitation by UP Congress chief Raj Babbar as “drama”, Tripathi said, he should have sung ‘Ram Dhun’ when his party president Sonia Gandhi was taking AIIMS to Raebareli and when there was loot of NRHM money in the state.

Babbar should have protested when money was spent in ‘Saifai Mahotsava’ by the Akhilesh Yadav government, he said. Earlier, the Congress attacked the Adityanath government claiming it was accepting responsibility on the issue pertaining to the death of children in a Gorakhpur hospital.

UP Congress chief Babbar said on Wednesday that his party will fight till the victims get justice. Babbar was held today as he tried going towards the secretariat annexe here singing ‘Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram’ to commemorate the attack on Mahatma Gandhi on August 16, 1947. He and a number of other party leaders were later released.

Sensex spikes 235 points as geo-political heat eases,"(Photo for representational purpose) (Photo for representational purpose)

Stocks today rose for the first time in six days, with the benchmark Sensex rebounding over 235 points to end at 31,449 as investors took comfort from tentative signs of tensions easing between the US and North Korea. Chinese president, for his part, urged both countries to restrain from activities that would raise geo-political temperature.

Weak US inflation numbers tamped down fears that the US Fed would rush into policy tightening any time in the near future, traders said.

The 30-share Sensex after opening higher settled up 235.44 points, or 0.75 per cent, at 31,449.03. The gauge had lost 1,111.82 points in the last five days. The 50-share Nifty bounced 83.35 points, or 0.86 per cent, to 9,794.15 at the close. Stock exchanges will remain closed tomorrow for Independence Day.

“Slight ease in tensions between North Korea and the US excited the market. Mid and small cap outperformed the market as participants used the bargaining opportunity. Weak US inflation data may influence the Fed to hold its dovish tone, which eventually adds positive vibes to the emerging markets like India,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Broader markets such as mid and small cap indices beat the flagship counterparts by a mile, jumping by up to 2.49 per cent.

Asia ended firm and European shares opened in the positive zone, relieved that there is lowering of exchange of threats over North Korea’s missile programme.

According to analysts, the likely delay in US rate hike is positive for emerging markets, especially India, triggering a fresh round of purchase by retail and institutional investors looking for higher returns.

Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth Rs 2,016.84 crore while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 1,943.86 crore last Friday, provisional data showed.

Drug major Cipla went up the most among Sensex constituents by climbing over 5 per cent after the company reported 24 per cent cent growth in net profit for the June quarter, followed by Sun Pharma at 4.70 per cent.

The key indices derived support from Tata Steel (4.21 per cent), Adani Ports (3.07 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (2.87 per cent), too.

Coming to sectors, realty hit it off with a gain of 5.95 per cent. Metal, consumer durables and power did not disappoint either. But IT and technology indices wobbled, ending in the red.

Shares of DLF Ltd soared 16.51 per cent, largely driven by speculative buying.

Rare photos of Jawaharlal Nehru from the archives of photojournalist Kulwant Roy,"Rare photos of Jawaharlal Nehru from the archives of photojournalist Kulwant Roy

A selection of historical images of Jawaharlal Nehru from Kulwant Roy’s work, as documented by Aditya Arya in the valuable visual archive History in the Making.

Kulwant Roy (1914-1984) was among the handful of Indian photojournalists who lived and worked through the exciting times before and after India’s Independence, yet his contributions seemed all but lost in the annals of time until relatively recently. His valuable archive of unpublished prints and negatives lay forgotten in boxes for more than 20 years after his death in ’84 until they were discovered by the man who was a close family friend and to whom Roy had left his work.

While Roy’s photographs which allow us into old cities and towns when they were less crowded, to ride in outmoded means of transport (Royal Enfield motorcycle or a car with a short license plate: DLB 300), to listen to a giant radio set or discuss old sartorial trends in India’s diverse society, are fascinating in its entire breadth, it is politics which Aditya Arya describes as the spinal cord of his story. Roy’s photographs recorded and captured events preceding and following India’s independence, in the true spirit of the medium, without reconstruction, manipulation or staging. “Kulwant’s Roy’s photographs never make us feel that history is headed in the wrong direction,” writes historian Indivar Kamtekar, “On the contrary, they declare that the world was progressing. In doing so, they embody the optimism of the first decades of independent India”.

Here is a selection of historical images of Jawaharlal Nehru from Roy’s work, as documented by Arya in the valuable visual archive History in the Making.

BJP leader arrested from airport in over Rs 1 crore cheating case,"Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

BJP LEADER Anupam Dutta was on Saturday arrested from the Dum Dum airport for his alleged involvement in a

cheating case worth over Rs 1 crore.Police said Dutta, a former Trinamool Congress councillor, had allegedly duped Salt Lake resident Dipti Sen to sell her deceased sister’s house.

“Anupam Dutta was arrested in a cheating and forgery case. According to complainant Dipti Sen, she had sold

the property through a third person, Madhusudan Chakraborty, who was introduced to her by Dutta. Madhusudan, who is currently out on bail in connection to the case, had prepared the forged papers,” said DC (DD) Santosh Pandey. In the complaint lodged on July 3 at North police station, Sen had said that she wanted to sell her sister Bani Dey’s house in Salt Lake following her death.

“While trying to do so, she came in contact with Dutta, who introduced her to Madhusudan Chakraborty. Madhusudan reportedly told Dipti that her sister did not probate her will before she died,” said a police officer.

Probate is the process of proving and registering in the Supreme Court the last will of a deceased.

“As the legal will was not in place, Madhusudan told Dipti that he will take care of the documents needed to sell the house. A deal was struck between Sen and Chakraborty at Rs 1.1 crore. But Madhusudan only handed over Rs 69 lakh to the seller and also allegedly forged all documents to sell the house in 2015,” the officer added.

“The accused had joined BJP around seven months ago and has no connection with the party,” minister and Trinamool leader Jyotipriya Mallick told mediapersons at North-24 Parganas.

Dutta, who has been been remanded to five-day police custody, told mediapersons while being taken to court: “This is a political game, I have been framed and everyone knows why this is not the right time to speak.”

"VIDEO: Woman’s public PROPOSAL goes ALL WRONG, after she refuses to give him the ring","Oops! Public proposal goes wrong! (Source: World Viral videos/YouTube) Oops! Public proposal goes wrong! (Source: World Viral videos/YouTube)

What if you got down on your knees but were rejected and left all alone? Isn’t that a scary situation to imagine yourself in? Well, a woman faced that same situation when she held out a ring to a man in Santiago, Chile. A 1-minute 22-second clip is doing the rounds on the Internet in which the very public proposal went terribly wrong, and has gone viral.

“A loved-up girlfriend’s public proposal to her partner went horribly wrong after she was left heartbroken sitting in the street alone. In dramatic scenes the raven-haired woman holds a ring up to her partner in Santiago, Chile.

Her boyfriend, dressed in jeans and a black jacket, stares at her as she can be heard saying ‘are you going to marry me? yes or no’ in Spanis (sic),” the video has been captioned.

Oddly enough, the man does say yes several times, but she continues to yell her love for him and refuses to give him the ring. He finally gives up, and leaves.

Watch the video here.

We can’t decide whether it’s weird or sad! Or… orchestrated?!

In a major success for the Army in the Valley, the self-styled district commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Ayub Lelhari, was on Wednesday gunned down in an encounter at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. The gun battle between security forces and terrorists at Kakpora’s Banderpora in Pulwama began in the evening. However, within few minutes, the forces were able to gun down Lelhari. The operation began after security forces received information of the presence of militants in the area.

J&K DGP SP Vaid said, “He (Ayub Lelhari) was one of the most wanted terrorists. It’s a great success for the forces.”

“Ayub Lelhari, district commander LeT, was killed in the”Ayub Lelhari, district commander LeT, was killed in theencounter with security forces in Pulwama. Lelhari’s death is yet another success in the fight against militancy,” a police spokesman said.”

"Nokia 8 launch today: Specifications, expected pricing and everything else to know","Nokia 8 will be officially launched later today, and here’s everything we know about the flagship smartphone. Nokia 8 will be officially launched later today, and here’s everything we know about the flagship smartphone.

HMD Global is gearing up to launch the Nokia 8 later today in London at 7:30pm BST (12:00 am IST, August 17). Nokia 8, or whatever the Finnish company chooses to call the smartphone, will be a big update. The phone has been the subject of rumours and leaks. From the design, to the specifications and dual cameras, Nokia 8’s key features are pretty much confirmed. However, these rumours and leaks should be taken with a grain of salt until HMD Global confirms them. That said, here’s everything we know about the Nokia 8, HMD Global’s first ever flagship smartphone for the year.

Nokia 8 launch time and live stream

Nokia 8 will be officially launched later today in London. The launch event will kick off at 7:30 pm local time (12:00 am IST, August 17). Unfortunately, there will be no live stream available for the Nokia 8 launch. However, you can tune to indianexpress.com for the latest updates, hands-on, and pictures directly from the venue.

Nokia 8 release date and price

Since the Nokia 8 is being positioned as a top-tier smartphone, it will cost a premium. While the price of the smartphone is still not out, some reports suggest that it will going to cost above €500 (or approx Rs 37,552). According to Vodafone Romania, Nokia 8 will be priced at €434.81 (or approx Rs 32, 656), excluding tax. After tax, it will cost somewhere around €517 (or approx Rs 38,829). So yes, Nokia 8 is going to be an expensive smartphone. Nokia 8 is expected to be made available in Europe in September. As for the India launch, we can expect the announcement to happen at a later date.

Nokia 8 design and display

VentureBeat’s Evan Blass has already shared an image of the smartphone, which he claims to be of the upcoming Nokia 8. A good look at the leaked Nokia 8 image tells a lot about the design of the smartphone. The phone is not going to look like the Galaxy S8, but yes, one can expect a slightly improved finish as compared to the Nokia 6. The side bezels of the Nokia 8 will be thin, but the top and bottom bezels are going to be thick. The home button of the phone will be present on the front, while the back looks refreshing. Unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the metal and glass design, Nokia 8 will be carved from a single piece of aluminium.

Various reports in the past have claimed that the Nokia 8 will get a 5.7-inch QHD display, and more recently we’ve heard that the screen is likely to around 5.3-inches (2K) in size. That’s fairly small in size in comparison to the iPhone 7 Plus, which offers a 5.5-inch display.

Nokia 8 camera and battery

There’s no hidden fact that HMD Global is bringing back the Carl Zeiss-branding on Nokia-branded smartphones. So yes, we can expect a great camera experience on the Nokia 8. Most likely Nokia 8 will feature a dual-camera setup on the back, complete with the Carl Zeiss-branding. We’ve been hearing that there will be a dual 13MP+13MP camera setup on the back. Meanwhile, a 13MP camera will be housed in the front for selfies and video calling. We don’t know anything about the battery just yet, so we have to wait until the company launches the smartphone.

Nokia 8 hardware and software

Speaking of the hardware, we can expect a Snapdragon 835 processor with either 4GB or 6GB RAM. The phone will be come with 64GB storage, however, some reports claim the 128GB model is also on the cards. The phone is likely to run Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box.

The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Wednesday said it has asked 21 smartphone makers across the world, of which majority are Chinese, to share the security procedures and processes they have undertaken to ensure security of mobile phone devices.

The government has asked the companies to furnish the information by August 28 next. “There have been some reports that some mobile phones leak data. The government is taking all steps to see how that leakage of data can be prevented,” the official said.

“The first step in that direction is that we have asked the mobile companies to inform us what are the security procedures and processes that have been taken by them to ensure the security of the data of the users and their privacy… We want to make sure that any device that is sold in the country should be safe.”

The official mentioned that the scope of security measures verification will include the device, its operating system, the pre-loaded applications that it comes with, and also the browser of the device. The IT ministry said there will be unlimited compensation depending on the extent of damage caused.

According to the IT Act, Section 43(A), a ‘body corporate’ is accountable to protect the privacy of data of the users and it is their responsibility to make sure that they take reasonable security measures and these provisions have to be complied with.

The testing and verification of devices will be done in the country itself, the official said adding that the government is upgrading testing facilities in the existing labs and additional capabilities are being created for further testing.

"To boost jobs, Gujarat govt to give Rs 730 crore to MSMEs","Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani (File Photo) Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani (File Photo)

The Gujarat government will disburse Rs 730 crore as “capital incentives” to over 16,000 MSMEs, a year after 42,500 units were reported sick in the state. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani will disburse the checks at an event on August 19. “Every year, the government gives an assistance of about Rs 300 crore. We will give a total of Rs 730 crore this year as capital incentives to 16,000 MSMEs to help them expand or set up new units. This will create over 1.6 lakh new jobs,” said M K Das, Principal Secretary, Industries and Mines Department.

This disbursal will be done as per the Industrial Policy-2015, under which the state government had promised to provide financial assistance on term loans provided by banks to the MSMEs. The government is also providing 50 per cent capital subsidy on investments in clean technology, which includes purchasing equipment to meet national and international safety, energy and pollution standards.

The 16,000 MSMEs are expected to make a cumulative investment of Rs 19,000 crore for which they have sought Rs 11,000 crore loans from various banks between April and July, added Das. The aid has come at a time when the number of sick MSMEs has been rising. From 20,452, that were reported sick in 2013, the number has risen to 42,500 in 2016. Gujarat currently has the third highest number of sick MSME units in India, just behind UP (95,989 units) and Maharashtra (52,576).

Civic polls in West Bengal marred by isolated incidents of violence,"Bengal municipal elections: The Left Front has demanded a repoll in Haldia Municipality. Bengal municipal elections: The Left Front has demanded a repoll in Haldia Municipality.

Isolated incidents of violence has been reported in Durgapur and Haldia, which went to polls on Sunday. Civic elections are being held in Durgapur Municipal Corporation, Dhupguri Municipality, Buniadpur Municipality, Coopers’ Camp Notified Area, Nalhati Municipality, Panskura Municipality and Haldia municipalities in East Midnapore district on Sunday. Municipal bypolls are also being held for two wards in Champdani Municipality (ward no. 12) and Jhargram Municipality (ward no. 7).

BJP’s state unit alleged that Trinamool Congress workers captured booths in Durgapur Municipal Corporation and attacked its candidates. “TMC workers have captured booths in wards 1, 3, 4, 11, 15, 18, 21 and 23 in Durgapur. Our candidates have been attacked in wards 4, 15, 18, 21 and 23. We strongly condemn this. We are also getting reports of violence from Haldia municipality,” state BJP General Secretary Sayantan Basu told The Indian Express.

THE INDIAN Army demonstrated its combat potential during the Southern Command Gold Cup horse race in Pune on Sunday. Southern Army Commander Lieutenant General PM Hariz, along with other senior army and civil dignitaries, schoolchildren attended the event, organised at the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) Race Course.

As a prelude to the race, the audience witnessed a thrilling demonstration of the combat potential and adventure activities, displayed by the Army. The action-packed demonstration had all the ingredients of an integrated battlefield environment, with the inclusion of various weapon platforms and machines of war.

Mafia — an army dog — won the hearts with his display of a daring attack on an intruder.

The warriors of the Madras Regimental Centre performed the Kalaripattu martial art display, while the cadets of the National Defence Academy displayed their physical strength and horse-riding skills. The Southern Command Gold Cup 2017 was won by Forest Fairy, which was ridden by A Imran Khan (jockey) and was trained by Bezan Chenoy.

"England vs West Indies, Day-Night Test, Preview: England take on West Indies in ‘unknown territory’","England’s Alastair Cook trains under floodlights at Edgbaston in Birmingham ahead of the first Day/Night Test against West Indies. (Source: AP) England’s Alastair Cook trains under floodlights at Edgbaston in Birmingham ahead of the first Day/Night Test against West Indies. (Source: AP)

As England takes on West Indies at Edgbaston on Thursday in a three -match Test series, history beckons itself. However, all the limelight has gathered around the first Test since it will be the first day-night Test on English shores. This will also be the fifth Test to be played with a pink ball.

To quote Stuart Broad England are stepping forth into unknown territory. The Three Lions have never played pink ball cricket on the international stage whereas West Indies have the advantage of the prior experience of playing the longer format under lights.

While this is sure to ruffle up the selection strategy of the home side, what England has on their side is confidence up to the brim after beating South Africa in the previous series. While the top order continues to look fragile with Mark Stoneman set to make his debut, the onus will once more be on Alastair Cook, Joe Root and Moeen Ali to bat at the top of the order. Among the seamers, James Anderson and Stuart Broad are set to lead the attack. After an impressive outing in the last series, Toby-Roland Jones seems likely to be the third seamer. However, whether Chris Woakes gets a look in still remains to be seen. Riding high on an incredible form Ben Stokes is another player to watch out for. What works in England’s favour is that the last time these two sides met was in an ODI series and England defeated the then home side 3-0

West Indies, however, have a miserable away record and hence will be looking to improve upon it. Kieran Powell will have to shoulder the responsibility at the top of the order with the likes of Shai Hope, Roston Chase supporting down the order. However, West Indies will be bolstered by the return of fast bowler Kemar Roach. In conditions suitable to seam and swing Roach will be quite a handful.

Meanwhile, as far as the pink ball is concerned it will provide a unique experience for the 70,000 odd crowd. The key session will be the final session which will witness the period around sunset. The blending of natural light and the floodlights is known to be a testing time for batsmen.

Squads:

Departments to share load to make plastic ban a success,"Authorities in the capital are planning to divide responsibility to check plastic usage, following the National Green Tribunal’s order to ban the plastic less than 50 microns. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee has been put in-charge of large manufacturers and vendors who deal in bulk plastic, while the municipal authorities will go after retailers. “The NGT has given us a week to seize plastic stocks,” said a senior Delhi government official. “We will allow vendors and retailers to implement the ban on their own till Friday. After that, we will impound stock.”

On August 10, the NGT once again imposed a ban on non-biodegradable plastic less than 50 microns. The city government and municipal authorities were asked to implement the ban and seize stock within a week. The Delhi government has responded by forming five teams to check plastic usage, Delhi Environment Minster Imran Hussain told The Indian Express. “These teams comprise officials from the environment department but after a high-level meeting with the chief secretary in a day or two, the teams will include officers from other city authorities as well,” he said.

Hussain said the government is deliberating on purchasing machines that will check the measurement of plastic bags to see if they are less than 50 microns. The government is also implementing the environment compensation of Rs 5,000 on violators.

Senior pilots will now have to serve one-year notice period before quitting,"The new rules will be applied with immediate effect. (Source: Thinkstock Image/For representation only) The new rules will be applied with immediate effect. (Source: Thinkstock Image/For representation only)

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday cleared a proposal that makes it mandatory for the senior pilots to serve a one-year notice period before quitting the job. The co-pilots will also have to wait for six months before making a shift to a new employer.

“It has been decided that pilots working in an air transport undertaking shall give a ‘Notice Period’ of at least one year in respect of commanders, and six months in respect of co-pilots to the employer indicating his intention to leave the job,” the DGCA said in amended Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR), which was issued on Wednesday.

The notice period, may however be reduced if the air transport undertaking issues the pilot a no objection certificate and also accepts his resignation earlier than the period stipulated by the DGCA.

“During the notice period, neither the pilot shall refuse to undertake the flight duties assigned to him nor shall the employer deprive the pilot of his legitimate rights and privileges with respect to the assignment of his duties,” DGCA said in the CAR.

The proposal was mooted by the DGCA in May after multiple domestic airlines, under the banner of Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA), had approached it urging it to increase the notice period for pilots from six months to one year arguing that a lot of resources, time and efforts are spent on training them. Many domestic pilot bodies had, however, opposed the proposal saying that it is “exploitative” as longer notice period will mean airlines can be “vindictive” to those quitting.

The new rules will be applied with immediate effect.

Sweet shops to go on strike on August 21 to protest 5 per cent GST,"Sweet industry is a part of the unorganised sector, most shops don’t have the infrastructure to deal with the complexity of GST. Sweet industry is a part of the unorganised sector, most shops don’t have the infrastructure to deal with the complexity of GST.

Following the footsteps of the textile industry, sweet shops in Bengal are set to go on a strike on August 21, protesting against 5 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) being levied on sweets.Sweet shops owners maintained they are yet to implement the new tax regime and are still charging old rates from their customers. Moreover, they claimed that as the sweet industry is a part of the unorganised sector, most shops don’t have the infrastructure to deal with the complexity of GST.

The general secretary of Pachim Banga Mishtanna Vyavsaye Samiti — a state body of sweet traders — Rabin Pal, said: “Around 20 years ago, Chief Minister Jyoti Basu had lifted sales tax on sweets. About eight years ago, sweets were brought under ambit of VAT. After we protested, the government lifted VAT too. At present, there is no tax on sweets.”

“The government has not imposed GST on milk products like paneer. But as soon as you use paneer to make sweets, we have to pay GST. This is a problem because most sweets in Bengal are made of chhana. We will be on strike on August 21 and for the next two days, we will wait for the government’s stand. If there is no action from the government’s side, we will go for a three-day strike from August 24, which may also be a hunger strike,” he added.

According to shopowners, over 7,000 shops in Kolkata and about a lakh across Bengal will be on strike.

Not only sweets, shops selling snacks like kachori and samosas are too up in arms against the government.

“We have learnt that the government has imposed 12 per cent GST on such items. If we pay GST, what will we be left with?” asked Rajiv Desai, a roadside snacks and sweet seller.

“We have written several letters to the Centre. There is confusion over GST. The government has to understand the industry… it has levied 5 per cent GST on all sweets. We deal with highly perishable items, which has a lifeline of 12 to 18 hours. A large number of sweet sellers in Bengal are illiterate and don’t have the required infrastructure. How will they cope up with the new tax regime?” asked Jagannnath Ghosh, secretary (Kolkata unit) of Pachim Banga Mishthanno Vyavsaye Samiti.

Voices of Partition: A Dhaka Hindu and a Kolkata Muslim recount what Independence meant to them,"Hossainur Rahaman (left) and Basanti Roychowdhury (right) (Express Photo) Hossainur Rahaman (left) and Basanti Roychowdhury (right) (Express Photo)

The Radcliffe Line cut through the heart of the subcontinent and was clearly the biggest cost of Independence. As the line cut through lives across India and the newly-created Pakistan, there emerged bone chilling accounts of deaths, violence and suffering from the North West and Eastern quarters of India.

However, there was a significant difference between the way Partition took place in Punjab and in Bengal. While the former represented a sudden cataclysmic division of territories, the latter was a long drawn slow process lasting even several years after independence.

Accordingly, the partition of Punjab was way bloodier than what its counterpart in the East witnessed. Though less dramatic, the partition of Bengal, however, was no less disturbing. Less about blood, the division of Bengal was more about displacement and the crisis of migration and property loss, that went on for the next several years.

An estimated 30 lakh Hindu refugees had entered West Bengal by 1960 as close to 7 lakh Muslims left for East Pakistan. The refugee influx in Bengal was also accompanied by the fact that the government was less prepared to rehabilitate them, resulting in huge housing and sanitation problems for the millions, most of whom were owners of large property back in East Bengal.

If the incoming Hindu population faced the bitterness of displacement on one hand, then the Muslims who stayed on in West Bengal were equally distraught. Overnight their homeland had turned unfamiliar with questions over their plans for leaving being raised too often as a reminder of their uneasy presence in India. While on one hand the political elite of the country unfurled the Tricolour, announcing to the world India’s achievement of freedom, what did independence mean to those in Bengal and Punjab, stuck in the aftermath of a line being drawn across their homeland? Here are two voices that help us get a sense of the insecurity and pain.

Basanti Roychowdhury: We never thought we would stay permanently

Basanti Roychowdhury (Express Photo) Basanti Roychowdhury (Express Photo)

“The word swadhin (independence) was something we barely understood. We just knew that Pakistan was getting formed and the Muslims would kill us,” says 85-year-old Basanti Roychowdhury as she reminisces over the days of horror she went through in her teens. A migrant from East Pakistan, Roychowdhury is currently residing with her son and his family in Kolkata. Daughter of a well-off zamindar in Dhaka (currently in Bangladesh), she recounts that for her, 1947 and the years preceding were all about the fear of Hindu-Muslim riots, her father’s hatred towards the nationalist leaders and the uncertainty about whether or not they would have to leave their palatial home.

“Our house was beside Buriganga river. It was a huge house. The surroundings were so beautiful. There was greenery all around. From the window in my bedroom, we could see paddy fields, all green around. There were barely any construction around. I could never imagine leaving Dhaka. My parents would come to Kolkata during vacations, but I hated going anywhere from Dhaka.

My father was a zamindar and we were more or less well off. The house was huge. I have been told you can still find it on Wikipedia. It was called Rooplal house.

When I was in my early teens one my brothers died out of typhoid. The grief of his death led to my mother falling very ill, and during this same time another brother of mine also caught typhoid. We were in fact planning on taking my brother and mother to Calcutta for his treatment. During this time, there were discussions of Pakistan being formed and a date being fixed. Everything was so uncertain, we were scared that we might have to leave our house. But my father was very hell bent that he won’t leave the house in Dhakha.

This was the time when Dhaka saw a large number of Hindu-Muslim riots. Ours was a Hindu locality so it was not that bad. But the Muslims would attack us frequently. We were very scared of Muslims and when they would attack. I have heard they had attacked our house once before I was born. This is why we had a large number of guards. I have heard that the Muslims had arrived at house in a bus, but before they could enter they had been pushed back. After that incident, they had never attacked the house.

I had once seen a large number of Muslims gathered on the other side of the river and crying slogans, about to attack us. I used to shiver with fear on hearing this cry. I was just 6-7 years old then and would start crying every time I heard them shout. The servants would pick me up and all my brothers would stand on guard on the stairs with guns in their hands.

On August 15, we were so scared all day because Pakistan was being formed. There was no happiness about anything at all. There was just fear. The Hindus were so scared as if we were getting finished now. There was no joy of the British leaving. There was just fear of Pakistan. Flag hoisting had taken place at night. I had seen the flag hoisted on my terrace on waking up. All the houses had flags hoisted. We had to hoist it, otherwise the government would suspect us of being anti-nationalist. We were very upset on seeing the flag. We were scared that we would be under the Muslims now.

My father was also very scared. Yet he did not want to leave. He felt that no one would know him in Calcutta. In Dhaka, he had the pride of being rich and well known and he did not want to leave that.

He used to hate Nehru and Gandhi. He was anyway pro-British, most zamindars were pro-British during those days. He used to hate all this rhetoric around the freedom struggle.

My elder brother on the other hand was very involved in the freedom struggle and was very anti-British. He was a student that time, doing his graduation in commerce. Alongside he would be secretly involved in nationalist politics. During that period, the younger generation was very stirred up to free the nation and my brother was also involved in it. He was arrested by the police once. My father had to somehow free him. My sister-in-law used to tell me that my brother used to get guns and arms and hide it under the bed. Generally the police would never suspect members of Zamindar families. But he was caught in a meeting once and got arrested.

We were in Dhaka during Partition and came to Calcutta in August 28 or 29. When we came here we never thought we were going to stay permanently. We had thought of going back after the treatment of my brother and mother. But once we came here people started pouring in heaps and bounds from East Bengal and so we decided to stay on.

When we first came to Calcutta, first of all there was the sadness of leaving our country. Then there was the grief of leaving that huge house and living in a small hut in Calcutta. The Calcutta house appeared like nothing more than a hut to us then. I missed the greenery of Dhaka and still miss it often.”

Dr. Hossainur Rahaman: Jinnah’s name could not be uttered in the house

Dr. Hossainur Rahaman (Express Photo) Dr. Hossainur Rahaman (Express Photo)

“Muslims are expected to fast each year during the month of Ramzaan, but I have fasted only once in my life and that was on the day of Partition. Such was my grief at Bengal being divided,” remembers 83-year-old Dr Hossainur Rahaman who has been residing in Park Circus in central Kolkata for the past several decades. A retired Professor of History from Chandannagar college and belonging to a family of “old school Congress supporters”, Rahaman recounts how his majority Hindu locality turned into a Muslim habitation overnight during Partition and how his father was pressed about leaving India soon after.

“Growing up, we were five sisters and four brothers. Now I am left with one sister. My eldest sister, Dr. Anwara Khatoon was the first female Muslim doctor to have passed out from Calcutta Medical College. She was quite a well known name in Calcutta.

As a young boy, I never joined politics. But I was well known as a follower of Nehru and Bose. My family was very much old school Congress supporters. In my school days I had a library in my home which I named “Netaji library” and had works of Gandhi and other Congress leaders in it. On the other hand, my father was in ardent opposition to Jinnah. I remember once my brother had gone to see Jinnah giving a speech and when he came home my father gave him a harsh scolding. He made it very clear to my brother that Jinnah’s name will never be uttered in the house.

The area in which I grew up, only 2 or 3 houses were occupied by Muslims. Rest all were Hindus. I was close to just one Muslim family. We were very friendly with the Hindus and did not for once feel that they were different from us in anyway.

On August 15, I was in Parbatipur in present day Bangladesh. I had no idea at that moment about whatever was happening at home. I came back home 2-3 days later. I reached Sealdah station and took a bus from there towards Ballygunj. The bus was absolutely empty. When I was about to get down at Park Circus people around me started screaming. “Jaben na, Jaben na, eita Muslim para (Dont go here, this is a Muslim area)” I was quite surprised but I got off and went home. When I reached home everyone was surprised that I came all alone. When I went out later to meet my friends I was shocked to see that everyone had left and suddenly this area had become a Muslim locality.

I was aware of the announcement of Partition but not about the riots. Once I came back home I became aware of what all had taken place. There was a temple at Kareya road right behind my house. My father got news that Muslims were about to destroy the temple. My father immediately took out his rifle and warned everyone that he would shoot down anyone who would try to touch the temple. Hindus had stayed at our house for a long time as well to hide from the riots. Hindus never attacked our house because my sister was a very important person in Calcutta that time.

I have a significant memory of a relief camp in Brabourne College. My sister was the only lady doctor there and I went with her there. I used to wait outside while she tended to the patients all day long.

After the riots, my father was asked over and again if we would leave. But he decided to stay on. Despite the fact that my sister was offered a job at Dhaka college and one of my brothers was offered a position in the post commission at Karachi, we never for once thought of leaving India.

"Doklam standoff: Indian, Chinese patrols clash on Ladakh lake, PLA skips Independence Day meets","Doklam standoff: As tensions mount over the standoff at the trijunction with Bhutan, the PLA skipped the ceremonial border meetings on Independence Day. Doklam standoff: As tensions mount over the standoff at the trijunction with Bhutan, the PLA skipped the ceremonial border meetings on Independence Day.

Their ties already strained over the two-month Doklam standoff in the east, boat patrols of Indian and Chinese armies clashed on the Pangong lake in Ladakh Tuesday. And for the first time since 2005, the People’s Liberation Army declined the Indian invitation to participate in ceremonial border meetings on the occasion of Independence Day.

The incident at Pangong Tso occurred at 7.30 am near the Finger-6 part of the 135-km long lake, one-third of which is in Indian control and the rest under Chinese control. The standoff led to jostling and exchange of blows between soldiers of the two armies although no shots were fired.

Sources said 52 trucks of the Chinese army were later spotted parked on the road built by the Chinese on the side of the lake but they moved out by the evening. The Indian Army refused to comment on the incident.

As tensions mount over the standoff at the trijunction with Bhutan, the PLA skipped the ceremonial border meetings on Independence Day. This is the first time since 2005 that this meeting on August 15 was not held. Another ceremonial meeting, which used to be held on the Chinese side on August 1, the founding day of the PLA, was also not held this year.

Sources told The Indian Express that the ceremonial border meetings did not take place at any of the five designated border meeting points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Indian Army, sources said, had sent an invite to their Chinese counterparts as per past practice but there was no response from the Chinese.

Not only did the Chinese army not participate in the ceremonial border meeting at Nathu La, the meeting point closest to the standoff site in Doklam, they also extended their non-participation to four other border points across the LAC.

The Army refused to comment on the cancellation of the meetings but government officials said that this meeting provided an opportunity for a thaw between the two sides, as part of a system that had been useful in building confidence over the years. Adherence to these established practices, officials said, is in the interest of both sides in reducing tensions on the border.

The two ceremonial meetings every year between the armies were first held in 2005, following the signing of the Protocol on Modalities for the Implementation of Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field Along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas. As per Article V of the Protocol, “Both sides shall hold two additional border meetings each year at Spanggur Gap in the Western Sector, Nathu La in the Sikkim Sector and Bum La in the Eastern Sector respectively in celebration of the National Day or Army Day of either side.”

The two sides then mutually decided to host these ceremonial border meetings on August 1 and August 15, as other national or army days fall during the winter months when holding a ceremonial meeting is not possible in snow-bound areas. These ceremonial meetings include a small cultural show, a sporting contest and a meal, in a climate of bonhomie and friendliness.

Of the five border meeting points, three — Spanggur Gap in the western sector, Nathu La in the Sikkim sector and Bum La in the eastern sector — were mentioned in Article VII of the Agreement on Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field along the Line of Actual Control in India-China Border Areas signed between the two sides in November 1996. The other two meeting points — Kibithu-Damai in the eastern sector and Lipulekh Pass/Qiang La in the middle sector — were mentioned in the 2005 Protocol.

Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie review: This Rana Daggubati film is a missed opportunity,"Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie review: It was very evident that Rana Daggubati’s character was not an ideal hero, who could never make a mistake. Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie review: It was very evident that Rana Daggubati’s character was not an ideal hero, who could never make a mistake.

Nene Raju Nene Mantri movie cast: Rana Daggubati, Kajal Aggarwal, Catherine Tresa

Nene Raju Nene Mantri director: Teja

Nene Raju Nene Mantri stars: 2 stars

In Nene Raju Nene Mantri, Radha Jogendra (Rana Daggubati) is introduced as a death row convict, whose last wish is to televise his life story. So, it begins, the story of an unambitious money lender, whose world revolves only around his beautiful wife Radha (Kajal Aggarwal).

Jogendra is a smart and cunning businessman. He is harmless until his wife is happy. But, if someone causes inconvenience to his wife, he or she must die. And he makes sure of it. Even it means playing the long game. Kajal suffers an abortion after her village Sarpanch’s wife pushes her down the stairs for lighting a lamp at a temple. It seems that lighting that lamp is a special privilege only enjoyed by Sarpanch’s wife. Now, one would expect Jogendra to lose his cool and storm the house of his village Sarpanch, played by Pradeep Rawat. But, instead, he decides to become a Sarpanch himself so that no one can stop his wife from lighting lamps at the temples. Thus, begins Jogendra’s tryst with politics.

After becoming sarpanch, Jogendra takes out the MLA of his constituency and assumes his office. He later replaces the home minister with the silliest plot that one could come up with. And now he aims for the chief ministership. Ask him, why is he doing all this? He will say that he’s doing it for Radha.

Jogendra began to play the power game in the politics to avenge his unborn child and for Radha. But, his actions that followed were purely out of his own ambition and greed. Jogendra’s justification that “Everything I did, I did for the family” (Radha) reminds me of Breaking Bad’s Walter White. A chemistry teacher with cancer begins to produce drugs to make just sufficient money so that his family can take care of themselves when he’s gone. But, he loses the way in the process. He does some horrible things for the sake of his family. But, eventually, he confesses to his wife that “All the things I did. I did it for me. I liked it.” The film lacking such a moment of truth, where Jogendra realises himself, leaves a big void in the story.

Kajal Aggarwal has delivered a convincing performance in the given role. While Catherine Tresa as Devika Rani, an owner of a news channel, is not explored to her full potential. Her role is meant to add scandal to this political drama. But, again Teja’s reservations has kept him from taking that character to a logical end.

It was very evident that Rana’s character was not an ideal hero, who could never make a mistake. The audience knew that Jogendra was morally corrupt and he was ready to do wrong things to get what he wants. So, we expect him to up the ante in being the ‘bad guy’ and surprise us by doing some shocking things. But, director Teja, for some reasons, has not gone all the way in exploring the possibilities of things a character like Jogendra, who is drunk on power, greed and arrogance, could do.

Teja rather tries to sort of justify all the wrong actions of Jogendra. And blames the corrupt system of the country for all his crimes. It seems like Teja sort of lost his vision for Jogendra’s character. The film suffers from the director’s reservations to show what Jogendra really is, a power-hungry monster. He hurts his wife by sleeping with some other woman. He kills his close confidante, who saved his life multiple times, without even giving him a chance to explain his story. He kills cops. He murders anyone who stands in his way. He blows up a building full of politicians. And eventually, he is portrayed as people’s man.

The viewers who heard his life story on television are now convinced that he is the right person for the Chief Minister’s chair and wants the President to pardon him for killing the MLAs. Teja’s attempt to underplay the gravity of crimes Jogendra committed leads to a cringe-worthy climax and leaves the audience confused as to what the director was trying to establish.

"China urges US, North Korea to ‘hit the brakes’ on threatening each other","China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer. China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer.

China has urged the United States and North Korea to “hit the brakes” on threatening words and work toward a peaceful resolution of their tense standoff created by Pyongyang’s recent missile tests and threats to fire them toward Guam. The dispute has also raised fears in South Korea, where a conservative political party today called for the United States to bring back tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula.

In a sign of growing concern on the part of Pyongyang’s only major ally, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that the two countries should work together to contain tensions and permit no one to “stir up an incident on their doorstep,” according to a statement posted on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website.

“The most important task at hand is for the US and North Korea to ‘hit the brakes’ on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent the emergence of an ‘August crisis,'” Wang was quoted as saying in yesterday’s conversation.

The ministry quoted Lavrov as saying tensions could rise again with the US and South Korea set to launch large-scale military exercises on August 21.

“A resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue by military force is completely unacceptable and the peninsula’s nuclear issue must be peacefully resolved by political and diplomatic methods,” Lavrov was quoted as saying.

China is North Korea’s main economic partner and political backer, although relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated amid the North’s continuing defiance of China’s calls for restraint.

In recent months, China has joined with Russia in calling for the US to suspend annual military drills with South Korea in exchange for Pyongyang halting its missile and nuclear tests as a first step toward direct talks.

Today, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, continued a visit to China following talks the day before with his Chinese counterpart that touched on North Korea

Tricolour and some relief for flood-hit in an Assam village,"The Tricolour hoisted at the flooded Jakhalabandha police station in Assam on Tuesday. Express photo by Dasarath Deka The Tricolour hoisted at the flooded Jakhalabandha police station in Assam on Tuesday. Express photo by Dasarath Deka

Living just four kilometres from the Brahmaputra, this is not the first time that Abani Sarma, 78, has been forced to flee home and take refuge in a relief camp. But this time, he says, he did not get enough time to grab his possessions — his diaries in particular, all carefully preserved in three steel trunks since 1962.

“I began writing my first diary in November 1962, when the Chinese marched into India through the Kameng frontier. Since then, I have recorded all important events, including their local implications. I managed to save those diaries during the last big flood of 1973, because we got enough time to escape,” says Sarma, a resident of Bor-Bhakati village.

Sarma is among the over 1,200 people from five neighbouring villages — Bor-Bhakati, Dulal-Madhav, Miribheti, Sonaribagan and Nagshankar — who have taken shelter at the Sonari-Kamakhya MV School here, after their villages were submerged soon after midnight on Saturday. The school was converted into a relief camp by residents of Sonarigaon, about 180 kilometres from Guwahati.

On Tuesday morning, as school headmistress Labanya Saikia hoists the national flag, Sarma and the others gather around to sing the national anthem.

“On August 15, 1947, I accompanied my father to witness the first flag hoisting at Silghat,” recalls Mohan Bordoloi, the gaon burra (village headman) of Sonarigaon.

Old timers recall how then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru walked through Sonarigaon in 1959. The neighbouring village, Kamakhyagaon, has a library named after his sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit.

“I clearly remember a local girl, Bhogila Hazarika, garlanding Nehru near a gate that the villagers had erected to welcome him,” says Bordoloi.

After the brief ceremony, the conversation returns to the Brahmaputra.

“When a neighbour, Jitumoni Saikia, called me up at around 1:30 am on Saturday and told me to run for my life because the Brahmaputra had breached the embankment at Hatimura, I did not believe him. But, even as I heard other villagers shouting, the flood water had already entered my house. We just flung open our doors and ran towards Sonarigaon, which is higher than the surrounding area. We ran, carrying just one or two items that we managed to pick up,” says Chandra Mahanta, also of Bor-Bhakati village.

Like Mahanta and Sarma, most of the other villagers at the relief camp were unable to grab anything much from their homes as they fled for their lives.

“I heard that my house, which the government gave me in 1986 under the Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY), has been destroyed. I and my wife somehow managed to reach this school, wading through neck-deep water,” says Lakhidhar Gohain, 55, a vegetable vendor from Dulal-Madhav.

“I had a mekhela-chadar-riha set made of muga silk that my mother-in-law had inherited from her mother-in-law. The almirah in which I had preserved the family heirloom for about 40 years is now under four feet of water, as our house is still submerged,” says Gita Mahanta, 77, of Bor-Bhakati village.

While there have been reports of some flood-affected districts not getting timely relief material, the 27 camps in Kaliabor are better off, partly because the local MLA, Keshab Mahanta, is also the state water resources minister.

The camp in Sonarigaon is managed by members of the local youth club. “Our gaon burra, Mohan Bordoloi, is working almost round the clock, maintaining the records of people as well as relief material coming from the government and voluntary groups,” says Kaustabh Hazarika, secretary of the club.

“While the residents of Sonarigaon contributed rice, dal and vegetables for the first two meals on Sunday, we received relief material from the government by Sunday evening,” says Prasanta Pathak, a club member.

The government has provided 12.5 quintals of rice and 80 kgs of dal, while a Guwahati-based NGO has sent 75 kgs of rice, 40 kgs of dal, 1,500 bottles of water and 600 eggs. “Bhaiti Bora, a local grocer whose shop was submerged, managed to save 40 kgs of rice, which he donated to the camp,” says Pathak.

“One NGO sent 100 packets of sanitary napkins, an item that is not included in the government relief manual,” says Ghanakanti Borah Saikia of Miribheti, a weaver who lost two looms in the flood.

"Toilet Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 5: Akshay Kumar film continues to rule, collects Rs 83.45 cr","Toilet Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 5: The film’s standing at the box office is on the up and up ever since its release on August 11. Toilet Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 5: The film’s standing at the box office is on the up and up ever since its release on August 11.

India’s Independence Day and its corresponding holiday has worked wonders for Akshay Kumar’s film Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. The film has crossed Rs 80 crores within five days of its release, and is doing great business. The movie, which highlights the issue of open defecation in rural India earned Rs 20 crores on Tuesday alone, which was also the Independence Day. And, we can safely say that the film would not take much time to cross Rs 100 crore at the box office.

Trade analyst Taran Adarsh shared the film’s box office collection figures on Twitter. The film, which minted Rs 13.10 crores on Friday, Rs 17.10 crores on Saturday, Rs 21.25 crores on Sunday and Rs 12 crore on Monday, has earned Rs 20 crores on Tuesday, taking the total to Rs 83.45 crores.

It seems there’s no stopping Akshay Kumar and his film’s success. At a time when films are struggling at the box office, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha is showing an upward trend on a daily basis. In fact, Akshay has surpassed Salman Khan’s Tubelight and Shah Rukh Khan’s Jab Harry Met Sejal’s performances at the theater.

Taran wrote, “#ToiletEkPremKatha is a ONE-HORSE RACE… Does MASSIVE biz on Independence Day… Crosses ₹ 80 cr, racing towards ₹ 100 cr… #TEPK. #ToiletEkPremKatha Fri 13.10 cr, Sat 17.10 cr, Sun 21.25 cr, Mon 12 cr, Tue 20 cr. Total: ₹ 83.45 cr. India biz. FABULOUS… #TEPK”

"Broken vows, court wars on ‘special status’","Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and Jawaharlal Nehru at Srinagar’s Lal Chowk in 1949. Archive photo Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and Jawaharlal Nehru at Srinagar’s Lal Chowk in 1949. Archive photo

Sixty four years ago — on August 9, 1953 — police arrested Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah from Gulmarg, and his government was dismissed on the concocted charge that he had lost the confidence of his cabinet. The Sheikh had been key to Jammu & Kashmir’s accession to India at the time of Independence. His arrest, ordered by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, marked the beginning of a long process of betrayal, in the course of which almost every commitment made by India while negotiating J&K’s entry into the Union was rescinded.

The ouster and imprisonment, initially for 11 years, of Abdullah was especially important because here was a mass leader of a Muslim-majority state, bordering Pakistan, who had taken the unimaginable decision to go with India at a time the subcontinent was partitioned along communal lines. Contrary to what is often argued, Abdullah’s personal political ambition would probably have been better served if he had gone with Pakistan, where there was no rival to his leadership after Liaquat Ali Khan, that country’s first Prime Minister.

But Abdullah was fundamentally opposed to the two-nation theory, Partition’s driving principle. He had a socialist dream — his land-to-tiller plan aimed to lift landless peasants out of centuries of misery — and he wanted to make education free and universal. In his vision, Kashmir’s many Lal Chowks would be the Red Squares of revolution. He put his trust in the commitments that the Indian leadership made, and the guarantees enshrined in the Indian Constitution. He believed that J&K could survive and prosper as an autonomous entity within a secular, democratic Indian Union. But Abdullah’s hopes were misplaced.

***

Nehru handpicked Abdullah’s deputy, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, to replace him. Bakshi remained in charge until 1963; a year later, the post of Prime Minister was abolished. For years thereafter, successive central governments organised sham elections and mounted sustained attacks on J&K’s special status. Abdullah was released from prison in 1964, only to be incarcerated again, and even exiled from the state. He became Chief Minister again in 1975 and 1977, and passed away while in office in 1982.

Unlike other princely states, J&K negotiated the terms and conditions of its entry into the Union. It wanted its own Constitution, drafted by its own Constituent Assembly. Article 370, which determines the contours of J&K’s relations with the Centre and exists as the constitutional cord between Kashmir and Delhi, was introduced in the Indian Constitution after Abdullah and Nehru discussed it for five months between May and October, 1949.

According to Constitution expert A G Noorani, Article 370 “exempted the state from the provisions of the (Indian) Constitution providing for the governance of all states; J&K was allowed to have its own Constitution”. While Parliament’s legislative power over J&K was restricted to Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communication, Noorani says, “if other constitutional provisions or other Union powers were to be extended to Kashmir, the prior “concurrence” of the state government was required”. This provision, he says, was “strictly provisional, and had to be ratified by the J&K Constituent Assembly”.

Read | Seventy years on, digging a deeper hole in Kashmir

The first Presidential Order, extending provisions of the Indian Constitution to J&K, was issued in 1950, but was replaced by another Order issued in 1954. This Order — which became the ‘mother’ order subsequently — had the concurrence of both the state government and the J&K Constituent Assembly. Since then, 42 Presidential Orders have been issued, which were amendments to the 1954 mother order. All these subsequent amendments to the 1954 Order could not fulfill the requirement of being ratified by the J&K Constituent Assembly, which had dispersed in 1956. Nonetheless, the Centre kept using these Orders to hollow out J&K’s autonomy and special status.

Through these Orders, Delhi extended 94 out of 97 entries in the Union List to J&K, and 260 out of 395 Articles of the Indian Constitution were made applicable to the state. These amendments to the 1954 Order overrode the Constitution of J&K. The Prime Minister of J&K became Chief Minister, the elected Head of State, called Sadr-e-Riyasat, was replaced by a Governor chosen by centre, and the powers of India’s Supreme Court and Election Commission were extended to the state. One Presidential Order was issued to prevent the state Assembly from making any amendment to the J&K Constitution. When Jagmohan was Governor in 1986, the Centre extended Article 249 to J&K, thus allowing Parliament to legislate even on issues in the State List. The constitutionality of this Presidential Order was immediately challenged by two senior National Conference leaders, Abdul Rahim Rather and Mohammad Shafi. The case is still pending in court.

Unlike in Punjab, where Parliament had to amend the Constitution repeatedly to impose President’s Rule, in J&K, the Centre imposed direct rule by simply issuing amendments to the 1954 Presidential Order.

***

Delhi’s attitude towards J&K’s special status has been evident ever since Abdullah was arrested in 1953. On November 27, 1963, Nehru told Parliament that the government did not want to completely end Article 370, rather, it would allow its gradual erosion. “Nehru was conscious of the indelicacy of the metaphor,” says Noorani. “Article 370 was not ‘eroded’ by the efflux of time or the ravages of the elements. It was denuded of content by conscious executive acts on his (Nehru’s) advice through one Presidential Order after another,” he adds. A year later, Home Minister Gulzari Lal Nanda candidly admitted that Article 370 had been emptied of its contents, and only a shell remained.

***

While Congress governments chipped away at J&K’s constitutionally guaranteed special status by emptying out Article 370, the BJP government seeks the state’s complete assimilation into India. The Sangh and its affiliated groups have long viewed the Muslim-majority demography of J&K as the primary problem — and believed that settling people from outside the state, with rights to acquire land and property, and the right to vote in Assembly elections, is the only way to permanently end the Kashmir dispute. This is why they see Article 35A of the Indian Constitution, a provision that empowers the J&K legislature to define “Permanent Residents” of the state, as a major hurdle.

The political reaction in the state has been along expected lines. Barring the BJP in Jammu, no major political voice anywhere has supported the removal of Article 35A. Arch rivals PDP and NC have said there would be no J&K left if this provision is tampered with, and have vowed to fight the battle together. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned that if Article 35A is removed, there won’t be anyone left to carry the Tricolour in Kashmir; Omar Abdullah has called it the death knell for pro-India politics in the Valley. The separatists have called a hartal in protest — like the NC and PDP, they too look at the move as an attempt to change Kashmir’s demography.

To be sure, this isn’t the first time that such issues have reached the Supreme Court. The difference this time lies in the support the Centre — the primary respondent — has extended to such moves.

"Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina failed ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the NCA","The acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. (Source: File) The acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. (Source: File)

The failure to clear the ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the National Cricket Academy was the primary reason why Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were not considered for the Sri Lanka limited overs series.

The Indian team regularly undergoes a series of fitness tests with ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test being the most important of them. It is an advanced version of the ‘beep’ test that was used by teams of earlier generations. The current Indian team is considered to be the fittest by a fair distance.

It has been learnt that for the current Indian team, the acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. Captain Virat Kohli, easily the fittest Indian cricketer, scores around 21 in the test.

However, both Yuvraj and Raina have scored well below the permissible level of 19.5 with Yuvraj barely managing to touch 16, which was the biggest reason for his ouster.

“The current team think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, skipper Virat Kohli and chairman of selectors MSK Prasad have made it clear that fitness standards are non-negotiable.

“On an average, the Australian cricketers score 21 in Yo-Yo test. Here Virat, Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey regularly hit that score while others are either touching 19.5 or is hitting above that score,” a BCCI official, who cannot come on record, told PTI today.

“In an earlier era, when the traditional beep test was in vogue, the Indian players of the 1990’s would have scored around 16 to 16.5 barring a few like Mohammed Azharuddin, Robin Singh or Ajay Jadeja.

“But now it’s different as the skipper himself is hitting the benchmark, which the Australian cricket team sets it,” the official added. Just for understanding, how the Yo-Yo Test works.

Cones are placed to mark out two lines 20 meters apart. A player starts with his foot behind one of the lines, and begins running when instructed. The player continues running between the two lines, turning when signalled by the recorded beeps.

After each minute or so, the pace gets quicker. If the line is not reached in time, the player must run to the line turn and try to catch up with the pace within two more ‘beeps’. The test is stopped if the player fails to catch up with the pace within the two ends.

The entire process is software-based where the results are recorded. It must be noted that the same test for football and hockey team will produce entirely different results have higher benchmarks, considering the speed and endurance level involved with the sport.

Coming full circle at 70,"History shows that even the Congress party was never at ease with that discourse. Illustration: C R Sasikumar History shows that even the Congress party was never at ease with that discourse. Illustration: C R Sasikumar

This Independence Day is different. For the first time in 70 years, the high constitutional positions are all held today by individuals subscribing to a non-Congress ideology. When NDA 1 was in power, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat became the vice president and Atal Bihari Vajpayee was prime minister. But this time around, the president, vice president and prime minister are all from the same ideological fraternity that is broadly, not necessarily correctly, described as the Conservative Right.

The jostling is discernible. The outgoing vice president had observed in an interview that Muslims in the country are feeling insecure. The incoming vice president responded by calling it a political view. The leader of the government, welcoming the new vice chairman of the Rajya Sabha, underscored the fact that Indian democracy has matured, with people from humble backgrounds occupying the top constitutional posts. The leader of the Opposition rose to his feet to contest that view, claiming that the contribution of people with affluent backgrounds like Motilal Nehru shouldn’t be forgotten.

So, we have a new scenario where the ruling party would champion the cause of the “humble” citizens and the Opposition that of the “affluent”. But it will be a mistake to assume that the new difference is such a narrow one. It goes much deeper. It symbolises a more profound and fundamental transition of ideas and ideals.

In their thought-provoking book The Right Nation, editors from The Economist magazine, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, describe America as essentially a nation with a conservative ethos. It might alternately throw up Republican and Democratic governments, but the core of America is right, the authors argue.

In a way, this is India’s case too. Many eminent leaders, from Swami Vivekananda to Anne Besant to Mahatma Gandhi, viewed India in ideas that a westerner would perceive as conservative right. Swami Vivekananda described India in beautiful terms as “Dharma Praana Bharata (Dharma is the soul force of Bharat)”. Gandhi always spoke in his discourses and dissertations about Ram Rajya. They were not theological ideas promoting a theocratic polity in the country. They represent the genius of our country, which is rooted in its religio-social institutions like state, family, caste, guru and festival. There is even an economic idea centred round work, sharing, happiness and charity.

These ideas are quintessentially Indian. Naturally, at the advent of independence, we ought to have had a leadership that understood and appreciated the value of this Indian genius and built institutions in the light of native wisdom. David Ben-Gurion did it in Israel, Mao did it in China and Kemal Ataturk did it in Turkey. All of them had an opportunity to guide the destinies of their respective nations at a critical juncture in history. And they chose to uphold their native genius.

Unfortunately, at the dawn of our independence, conflict arose between the ideas that have their roots in this country’s age-old wisdom and those that were transmitted by the colonisers from the west. Jawaharlal Nehru represented the colonisers’ view, while Gandhi became the voice of native wisdom. The conflict reached a flashpoint a couple of years before independence when a sharp exchange of letters took place between the two tall leaders of our freedom movement.

“The first thing I want to write about is the difference in outlook between us,” wrote Gandhi in a sharply worded letter to Nehru on October 5, 1945. He reiterated in that letter his belief that village life in India should get more focus as “crores of people will never be able to live at peace with one another in towns and palaces”.

Nehru replied from Allahabad four days later on October 9. His retort was also strident. “I do not understand why a village should necessarily embody truth and non-violence. A village, normally speaking, is backward, intellectually and culturally, and no progress can be made from a backward environment. Narrow-minded people are much more likely to be untruthful and violent,” he wrote.

“If the difference (in our outlook) is so fundamental, then the public should also be made aware of it,” pleaded Gandhi. Nehru knew the pitfalls of letting people of the country know that he and Gandhi had fundamental differences in their outlook about the direction of our nation. He requested Gandhi not to insist upon making the differences public at this juncture and let them be resolved by the people after independence.

Sadly, no discussion happened after independence. Nehru sought to take the country in the direction of the ideas he had inherited from the colonial masters and from his personal experience in Europe. The crucial formative years after independence were thus dominated by a western liberal discourse that had very little Indian content.

History shows that even the Congress party was never at ease with that discourse. After Nehru, its politics oscillated between right of centre and left of centre, largely catering to its power interests. Micklethwait’s description of the American Democrats as LINOs — “Liberals In Name Only” — fits the Congress as well.

But for the first time in 70 years, the idea with a reference point in India’s genius has become the dominant idea under Prime Minister Modi. Just as Nehru never shied away from exhibiting his fascination for western ideas, Modi is ever ready to wear quintessential Indian ideas on his sleeve.

The liberal unease is palpable. Their plight is best described by Edward Luce in his book through a less-used Greek word demophobia — fear of the mob. The mob, humble people of the country, are behind Modi. They are finally at ease with a government that looks and sounds familiar. They are enjoying it.

Living With The Deluge,"The dominant narrative of flood protection includes measures such as embankments, dredging rivers and bank strengthening (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) The dominant narrative of flood protection includes measures such as embankments, dredging rivers and bank strengthening (AP Photo/Anupam Nath)

During his recent visit to Assam, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a Rs 2,000 crore package for relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation in the flood-affected states in the Northeast. A corpus fund of Rs 100 crore will be used to set up a high-powered committee that will work on finding permanent solutions to the flood problem. There is, however, a need to shift the focus from flood protection to flood governance. Hopefully, the high-powered committee, whenever it is constituted, will make this paradigm shift.

This would require a shift in the understanding of floods from being an extreme weather event, to a hazard that is partly natural and partly anthropogenic. Flooding is natural because the rivers in the Northeast, mostly originating in the Eastern Himalayas, experience a sharp fall in gradient as they move from Arunachal Pradesh and Bhutan to reach Assam’s floodplains. This fall in altitude causes a large volume of water to gush to the floodplains.

Most of these rivers carry large amounts of sediments, which then get deposited on the floodplains, reducing the storage capacity of the river channels and resulting in inundation of the adjoining floodplains. Flooding is partly anthropogenic as the sediment load carried by the rivers is accentuated through “developmental” interventions in the Eastern Himalayas that result in deforestation.

The dominant narrative of flood protection includes measures such as embankments, dredging rivers and bank strengthening. In a study spread over 96 villages in Assam, Bihar, UP, and Bengal, we found embankments are cost-intensive options. The focus here has been more on construction and less on maintenance. The scope of storage dams in Arunachal Pradesh is limited, given the region’s geology and the ecology. Proposals for dams have been a matter of serious debate in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

Shifting the focus of action towards flood affected people will require building resilience of these communities. Access to schools during the flood months is restricted, because the schools are either inundated or are make-shift relief centres. Water and sanitation issues require attention during the flood months. Floods are accompanied by outbreaks of diseases such as diarrhea. Access to veterinary services is limited resulting in high cattle mortality and morbidity. People in the flood-prone areas in the Northeast, by and large, practice subsistence agriculture. While the land remains inundated for an extended period in the monsoons, limited irrigation coverage (less than 10 per cent in Assam, compared to 49 per cent as an average for the country) constrains intensification of agriculture in the dry months.

Flood governance through resilience building could bring about sustainable change in this situation. This could be an outcome of three broad sets of action: Reducing vulnerability, increasing access to services, and maximising productivity through optimal use of available resources. Community-based advance flood warning systems, for example, have been successfully piloted in parts of Assam. Providing adequate number of boats — the most important, yet scarce resource in the villages — will enhance access to developmental activities during floods and also facilitate safe commute for schoolchildren.

Usual toilets are of limited use in flood-prone areas. Elevated toilets, ecosanitation units — promoted in the flood-prone areas of North Bihar — and elevated dugwells or tubewells with iron filter need to be installed in the Northeast. These are more expensive than the Swachh Bharat toilets and wells or handpumps. But if promoted on a large-scale, they will reduce the public health challenges in the flood-prone areas.

Productivity can be maximised by giving people access to cheaper sources of irrigation, research on short duration boro paddy, and innovative agriculture techniques like floating vegetable gardens. Scientific fish farming on the waterbodies and the inundated land can ensure that inundation, when it cannot be avoided, is put to optimal use.

Flood governance would require innovative combination of these initiatives. Strategic environment assessment of development activities, a practice followed in several countries, needs to be undertaken in the Brahmaputra basin. Strengthening planning authorities like the Brahmaputra Board and flood control departments by staffing them with scientists from a wide range of disciplines is essential. The flood-prone regions of the country require a focused approach from the Centre and state governments.

"Chandigarh geri route: Where boys routinely follow girls, and no eyebrows are raised","Girl students of Arts College in Sector 10, adjoining the Leisure Valley Park, are the most vulnerable. Express photo by Jasbir Malhi Girl students of Arts College in Sector 10, adjoining the Leisure Valley Park, are the most vulnerable. Express photo by Jasbir Malhi

YOUNG COLLEGE boys in flash cars, loud music reverberating from their vehicles, squealing rubber on tar and catcalls, as the vehicles stop-start at the sight of the other sex — it’s all too common in Sector 10, the heart of Chandigarh’s infamous geri route.

And what’s common too is the view that there is nothing wrong about this activity. The word geri literally means “round” or roam, but over the decades, Chandigarh has embraced and normalised the “boys follow girls” routine that takes place on this route through sectors 8, 9, 10 to 11. This is also where DAV College, Home Science College for Girls in Sector 10 and Government College for Girls in Sector 11 are located. “We come to relax our eyes here,” said one male college student.

Varnika Kundu’s ordeal took place late at night, but on the geri route, stalking takes place in broad daylight, is a public activity, and treated as if it is a coming-of-age ritual.

The men are all in swanky cars or on motorbikes. And perhaps it’s no coincidence that the ritualisation of stalking and ogling on the geri route grew as car ownership became common among youth in the late 1980s, and moved to a new level in the 1990s.

Girl students of Arts College in Sector 10, adjoining the Leisure Valley Park, are the most vulnerable. The men mostly drive Punjab-registered cars.

“We have heard a lot about geri route and this Leisure Valley route. We are hostellers and students of a private college and we are here just for a drive with friends,” said one man, who was there with his friends last Thursday.

The activity peaks at the beginning of each academic year, as well as on Valentine’s Day and Holi, two occasions when men seem to think they have the licence to cross all lines of decent conduct, and with women they do not know.

The police are mostly onlookers, holding that they cannot act until someone complains. But so normal has this activity become that there are few complaints from women of harassment on the geri route.

What they didn’t tell you: Coming out is a never-ending process,"What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

What do you want to be when you grow up?” a ninth grade English paper once asked me. It was a 20-mark essay, and I had 20 minutes to earn them. I rolled up my sleeves, and pulled out my cursive best.

The thing is, I wanted to be a great many things.I wanted to be a chef, an actor, a painter; I wanted to be an astronaut, and, for two weeks after I turned 11, I wanted to be a National Geographic correspondent — if only because my older sister said that she wanted to be one. From the age of six to 16, I raced through changes. My styles, my sexual leanings and my haircuts changed, and so did my dreams.Only, what did I never dream of being? Myself.

I was so used to pushing my problems under a hypothetical carpet, that I never realised the lies I was hoarding. It was an easy, lazy life. Through adolescence, I used this complacency as a security blanket, and wound it around myself whenever thoughts of the future terrified me. What would coming out (as a gay man) be like? Would I have to talk about my feelings? Would I have someone to talk about my feelings to (a fair question, because I grew up thinking that you were only allowed to talk about your feelings at expensive therapy sessions, sappy book clubs or when watching romantic tearjerkers)?

Growing up signified independence — no more staying at home, no more rules, no more restrictions, no more getting worried over your mother’s 18 missed calls (well, almost). But I didn’t know what I would do with all the freedom. Independence petrified me. What would I do being free? Would I finally have to be myself?

People are terrified to be themselves, especially when bravery is an option, and not an obligation. I’ve been called manipulative, selfish, a coward and a sore loser. Why would I want to be myself then? I’d rather be someone nicer and more admirable; I’d rather be someone else.

Some enjoy the peace that comes with accepting who they are, but most of us get stuck on the fence in the middle. Take sexuality, for instance. We can stir ourselves to walk free and fabulous, but we’d rather stay safe and sound in the cage of heteronormativity. I made myself feel at home in the cage till I was 21. The thing about independence, though, is that it doesn’t come gift-wrapped and express delivered to your front doorstep. It needs to be earned, or fought for.

Coming to terms with your sexuality and stepping out of the closet isn’t easy — especially in a country like India, where minds can be as narrow as Bandra’s bylanes, even if you are an upper-class, well-educated man (and sometimes, especially if you an upper-class, well-educated man). As countless films and American television shows have told us, you don’t just wake up one morning and walk out into the sunlit world. To reach the closet door, you need to push through your woollens, those “buy-one-get-one-free” shirts you bought on an impulse, and the odd tangle of smelly socks, greying underwear and smutty novels you don’t want your mother to find. It will be tough, especially if you’ve been hoarding — and holding back — all your life.

And even when you do, it’s a never-ending process. Those closet doors that everyone talks about? They are revolving. Week after week, you will find yourself coming out to friends, family, acquaintances, and (occasionally) drunken strangers at the bar. Perhaps, one day it will not be the big deal that it is today, and you won’t have to worry about whether your words are followed by a kiss to the cheek or a punch to the mouth. Every new acceptance is a fresh slice of independence, and you’ll wolf it all down.

Fortunately, my personal coming out story reeks of acceptance and Hallmark cards. I sat my parents down and told them everything in a diligently rehearsed 17-minute monologue. In 18 minutes, it was done. Questions were asked, hugs were exchanged, a tear was shed (that would be me). My mum went for a walk with her friends and my dad continued solving the crossword puzzle. They accepted it with a simple shrug (and lots of love and support over the next couple of years, but this is not that story). My sexuality was just another fact.

What about the war of words I had been expecting? The emotional bloodshed? The years of torment at the hands of society? They never came, even though history books said that they would. Times are changing, and somewhere over pop culture references and more inclusive media representations, my parents and peers had changed as well. The history books had it wrong.

What they did get right was this — freedom felt liberating. The freedom to stay single. To be a sexual deviant. The freedom to wear a skirt (if you are a man) or a jersey (if you are a woman). The freedom to wear both, or neither. The freedom to never find your way back home.

What do we do with the freedom then? Do we let it consume us? Terrify us into never seeking it out? We do neither. We simply unwind and enjoy it with a cup of tea. Preferably, chamomile.

Former US President Barack Obama’s tweet just became the most ‘Liked Tweet’ ever. Obama tweeted an anti-racism post in the backdrop of the Charlottesville violence that touched the hearts of many. Within hours of putting out his message, Obama’s tweet, in which he quoted iconic South African anti-Apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, garnered more than 2.9 million likes, at the time of writing this article.

“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion,” the

tweet read. It was posted on Saturday along with a photo of 56-year-old Obama looking up to a window of children of different ethnicities and races.

Obama’s tweet became the most liked ever, taking the top spot from pop sensation Ariana Grande’s tweet with 2.7 million likes, followed by popular American talk show host Ellen DeGeneres’ 2014 Oscars selfie tweet with 2.4 million likes. Grande’s heartfelt tweet had come in response to a terrorist bombing that killed 22 people after she performed a concert in Manchester, England, in May.

In an official statement, Twitter said: “It is also currently the 5th most Retweeted Tweet ever.” Another Silicon Valley-based social media company told PTI, “This Tweet from @BarackObama just became the most Liked Tweet ever. It set the record at approximately 10:07 EST.”

“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion…” pic.twitter.com/InZ58zkoAm — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 13, 2017

The tweet has been endorsed by more than 2.9 million social media users and has also been retweeted by over 1.2 million times.

Obama’s tweet, which quotes a line from Mandela’s autobiography “Long Walk to Freedom” came after a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 others were injured when a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters at a white supremacist rally Charlottesville. Two police officers also died on Saturday when their helicopter monitoring the rally crashed.

I will be very excited to step on to the field as vice-captain of India: Rohit Sharma,"Rohit Sharma was part of the Test squad didn’t play in the three Tests. (Source: File) Rohit Sharma was part of the Test squad didn’t play in the three Tests. (Source: File)

Ten years after making his debut for the Indian cricket team, Rohit Sharma was finally in the leadership group when the opener was appointed the vice-captain for the five ODIs and only T20I against Sri Lanka. The right-hander was honoured to get the position and is looking forward to it.

“It’s an honour to be appointed vice-captain. Ten years ago, I was only thinking about playing for India. Being vice-captain now feels really good,” Rohit said at a press conference in Pallekele. Rohit didn’t play a single Test in the visitors’ 3-0 sweep of the hosts but was part of the squad.

“Whenever the opportunity comes, in the first one-day international on August 20, there will be some sort of role I have to play. I’m looking forward to it. Rather than thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment.”

Captaincy is nothing new to Rohit as he has successfully led the Mumbai Indians to three IPL titles in five years. He understands the difference between IPL and international cricket but asserts that the excitement and energy remain the same.

“IPL is a completely different ball game and international cricket is completely different,” he said. “But, yes, the excitement and energy remain the same, so nothing changes too much. In the IPL, I was captain, so I was more in front; here, I have to play a little behind-the-scenes role, but yes, I’ll be very excited to step on to the field as vice-captain of the Indian team.”

Rohit is yet to cement his Test spot and has been in and out of the playing XI. He was looking to make the no.6 position his own in the home season last year but an injury hurt his cause and he was ruled out for the remainder of the long home stretch. He did return for the Lanka tour but the management went ahead with Hardik Pandya.

“Nobody likes to sit out, but it all depends on the team dynamics, and what the captain and coach want, and you got to accept the fact and move forward,” Rohit said. “I kept working on my skills and tried to see where I can improve as a cricketer. You can’t sit here and waste time. All I was trying to do these past three-four weeks was to just improve my skills, see where things are going wrong, and try and strengthen the strengths I have talking to all the coaches there. They’ve been looking after us for a long time and they know what exactly has been going on with each individual. You always try to improve as a cricketer. It was great to watch everyone displaying their skills and winning 3-0 outside India. Great achievement.”

With Sri Lanka going heavy on spin, picking as many as five spinners in their ODI squad, Rohit gave extra importance to the sweep shot during the team’s training session on Wednesday.

“It’s something that the game demands these days, you’ve got to be innovative and play different kinds of shots to get maximum results,”Rohit said. “Like I said, you keep learning every day, so I have been trying to see what I can bring into my armoury. Every addition to your armoury is a good thing, and what better place than coming here and doing it. That’s what training sessions are for – to improve your skills and try and get better as a player.”

Rohit recalled his ten years in international cricket and said the time flew but made him experience various ups and downs. “It’s gone very fast, those 10 years. Of course, there have been ups and downs, but that’s how it is for any sportsman. That’s how it should be, you get to learn a lot more from ups and downs, it teaches you lot many things.

“Every day is a learning day. Today, I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse sweeps. That’s the opportunity I always wait for, to get on to the field and learn something. Initially, in limited-overs, I used to play too many shots at once. Now, I have realised it cannot be just about going out there and slogging every time, you’ve got to understand the situation and conditions. That is something I have learned these few years with the help of so many coaches around. I will continue to learn, you never stop learning. That’s the greatest part about this sport. There’s lot more to do and I look forward to it.”

Only the fittest of the lot will survive and thrive going forward: India coach Ravi Shastri,"Ravi Shastri feels that only India’s fittest players will get a chance to showcase their performance in the 2019 World Cup. (Source: AP) Ravi Shastri feels that only India’s fittest players will get a chance to showcase their performance in the 2019 World Cup. (Source: AP)

After thrashing Sri Lanka 3-0 in the Test series team India has maintained their good run of form in Tests. The focus now shifts towards the one-day series which starts from August 20 in Dambulla. Ahead of the first ODI, India’s coach Ravi Shastri spoke to the Times of India where he revealed his thoughts regarding India’s preparation for 2019 World Cup, India’s excellence in Test cricket and the performance in the Sri Lankan Test series.

Stating that only India’s fittest players will get a chance to showcase their performance in the 2019 World Cup, Shastri said, “When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding XI in the world walking out. Only the fittest of the lot will survive and thrive going forward and that’s right up there in the list of priorities.”

Shastri said that his long term goal is to focus on 2019 World Cup but also feels that India should continue to excel in Test matches as well, “The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, a fact also remains that if India needs to show their real might in the game, then achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle,” he opined.

Shastri also feels that preparation for the World Cup and continuing the good form in Tests, both require a different level of preparation. “Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with an equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it’s Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year”, he said and added, “A disciplined approach is what counts.”

“For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik and one in the third game from Shami, we’ve not faltered. How many catches did we drop? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid altogether. It’s the effort that counts. If we have to look at the bigger picture, we’re taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.”, he signed off.

Three members of Manipur-based terror outfits arrested in Delhi,"Representational Image Representational Image

Ahead of the 70th Independence Day, Delhi Police Special Cell has arrested three alleged members of different factions of Manipur-based terrorist outfit Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP-PWG), including its commander-in-chief. “The three men — Laishram Ranjit Meitei, the 45-year-old commander-in-chief of KCP-Tamnganba faction; Khumanthem Naobicha Singh (36), finance secretary of KCP (Lamyanba Khuman faction); and 30-year-old Thoidam Chaothoi, a member of KCP-LK — were arrested on Sunday. They were planning to set up hideouts in the national capital,” said P S Kushwah, DCP (Special Cell).

A team of Delhi Police’s Special Cell was working on inputs that Meitei is hiding somewhere in Delhi. “We had learnt that he had been staying in Kakarbeta near West Bengal-Nepal border but had plans to set up a secret hideout here. On the basis of a tip-off, Meitei was arrested from near Tibetan Market, ISBT, along with two others,” he added. During interrogation, Meitei told police that he is the commander-in-chief of the organisation and had earlier been arrested by the Manipur Police. He was on the run for five years.

“The second accused, Naobicha, had recently come in contact with Meitei. He also has a police record and was earlier associated with other banned organisations in Manipur. Before coming to Delhi, the three were operating from their base at Kakarbeta area near West Bengal-Nepal border. They had been living in Nepal for the last three years to evade arrest from Manipur Police,” Kushwah said, adding that they used to extort money from different government authorities, local businessmen, private schools, leaders of political parties and operators of oil tankers by sending them threat mails, said Kushwah.

Police said that their cadre based in Manipur used to collect extortion money from the victims. Later, the money was distributed between different wings of the outfit. A part of the extorted money was also received by the Nepal-based leaders of these outfits. KCP (People War Group) was formed in January, 2016 by members of KCP-Poirei faction, KCP-Tamnganba faction and KCP-Paikhomba faction under Meitei. In January, the Special Cell had arrested the self-styled convener of KCP-PWG Ranjjet Singh Porai alias Rocky. The KCP-PWG had carried out attacks by firing on oil tankers in April and June after the oil tankers’ association refused to give extortion money to them.

How technology can deliver freedom from male calf,"A farmer in a village near Anand, Gujarat, feeding his young calf. Express photo by Bhupendra Rana A farmer in a village near Anand, Gujarat, feeding his young calf. Express photo by Bhupendra Rana

In these times of gaurakshak activism, there can be nothing worse for dairy farmers than their cows or buffaloes delivering male calves. Fortunately, technology is now available to address the problem to an extent — in the form of ‘sexed semen’ having 90%-plus sperms carrying the X-chromosome, and capable of producing only female offspring.

A bull’s sperm has 30 chromosomes, including one which is either an X- or a Y-chromosome whose genes code for sex. The egg of a cow, too, contains 30 chromosomes, one of which is, however, always an X-chromosome (just as the human sperm and egg have 23 chromosomes each, one of them either an X- or a Y-chromosome in the case of the former, and one only an X-chromosome for the latter).

When a sperm and egg unite, and the former carries the X-chromosome, the resultant offspring is female (XX). When a Y-chromosome-bearing sperm fertilises an egg, the result is a male calf (XY).

Sexed semen technology is about preselecting the sex of offspring by sorting or separating the X-sperms from Y-sperms. The aim is to deliver freedom from male calves, by ensuring that cows are inseminated by semen containing only X-chromosome-bearing sperms. The sorting process basically involves exploiting the differences in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content between X-chromosome-bearing and Y-chromosome-bearing sperms. The former contains slightly more DNA, with the difference ranging from 3.6% to 4.2%, depending upon the breed of the cattle or buffalo.

In 2004, a Texas-based company, Sexing Technologies (ST), commercialised sexed semen production using a procedure to stain the sperm cells with a fluorescent dye that binds to their DNA. The dyed cells are made to pass through a laser beam from a machine (flow cytometer) that can sort the sperms based on the amount of fluorescent light they give off. As the X-chromosome-bearing sperms contain more DNA, these cells absorb more dye and emit more light. That, then, allows for separation of the X- and Y- sperm fractions in the semen.

ST’s sperm-sorting technology is claimed to be 93% accurate. Thus, if a cow is inseminated using such sexed semen, there is a 93% chance that the calf produced will be female. With ordinary semen used in artificial insemination (AI), that probability is 50-50.

Sexed semen’s usefulness is obvious, particularly in a country where even male calves cannot be sent freely to the slaughterhouse. That freedom has been further curtailed in a regime of empowered gaurakshaks on the prowl. If a cow after insemination and 9-10 months of pregnancy produces a male calf, the loser is the farmer who will have to rear an animal that’s not going to yield him either milk or an income. Worse, he can’t be sure that the same cow 13-14 months down the line — assuming 3-4 months of post partum rest and 9-10 months’ pregnancy — will deliver a female calf.

But the issue here is cost, which, for AI using conventional semen frozen in 0.25-ml vials (‘straws’), is just over Rs 50 per insemination dose. The comparable cost of sexed semen to the farmer is now anywhere between Rs 1,200 and Rs 2,600 per straw.

“Semen cost goes up if it is from a bull with higher genetic merit (evaluated in terms of milk yields, number of productive lactations, fat and protein content, etc.) that can also be transmitted to the progeny,” notes Daljeet Singh, president of the Progressive Dairy Farmers’ Association (PDFA) of Punjab, which annually imports 15,000-20,000 frozen sexed semen doses on behalf of its members. The semen is sourced from bovine genetics firms such as World Wide Sires, Genex and ABS Global of US, and Semex of Canada.

The high cost is due to two main reasons.

The first is the virtual monopoly over knowhow. Sexed semen — even that supplied by global animal genetics majors — is produced from raw ejaculate, largely using ST’s proprietary sperm-sorting technology. The parallel one could cite is the near-stranglehold enjoyed by Monsanto vis-à-vis Bt cotton.

Secondly, the sexed semen currently being used by farmers like those affiliated to PDFA is entirely imported, and based on 100% Holstein Friesian (HF) or Jersey bulls. Semen imports are, moreover, subject to cumbersome procedures entailing approvals from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade and animal husbandry departments, both at the Centre and state levels.

There have been some recent encouraging developments, though, on both counts. In April, ABS Global was granted an injunction by a US court against ST, after the latter was found to have “wilfully maintained monopoly power” in the market for sexed bovine semen processing. It paved the way for ABS to commercially launch its own Genus Sexed Semen technology, which the Wisconsin-headquartered firm plans to introduce worldwide, including in India.

“Indian farmers at present have access only to imported sexed semen from HF and Jersey bulls abroad. From September 1, we will offer them sexed semen also from local HF-Sahiwal and HF-Gir crossbreds; 100% indigenous Sahiwal, Gir and Red Sindhi bulls; and pure Murrah buffaloes. Since the semen is being processed domestically, the cost would be half that of the imported sexed material,” says Arvind Gautam, managing director of ABS India, which has a stud farm facility at Bhilwadi in Sangli (Maharashtra), housing over 100 bulls with annual semen production capacity of 70 lakh straws.

R G Chandramogan, chairman of Chennai-based Hatsun Agro Product Ltd — India’s biggest private sector dairy that undertakes 5.5 lakh-odd AIs a year — believes the domestic market is large enough for sexed semen to be made available at well below Rs 500 per straw.

In 2015-16, about 670 lakh AIs were carried out in India, covering an estimated 30% of its breedable cows and buffaloes. “No country will give you this kind of volumes for sexed semen, even if fewer AIs are required to produce the same number of female calves,” points out Chandramogan.

But pricing is only one part. The conception rate — chances of the animal getting pregnant — from sexed semen is 10-20% lower compared to conventional semen. The reason for it is lower sperm count (machine sorting speeds and efficiency aren’t high enough) and possibility of damage to the cells during the sorting process (from staining with dye, exposure to laser light beam, etc.).

As a result, sexed semen is more effective in inseminating young heifers and cows that have calved only once. The older animals may require more AIs relative to insemination done using normal semen. That raises costs further, even if there a greater likelihood of a female calf getting delivered.

But for all its drawbacks, this is a technology still evolving and destined for improvement. ABS claims its new product is gentler on the sperm cells, with lower processing pressures. There is no doubting sexed semen’s utility to the Indian dairy farmer today — with or without the gaurakshak.

Disha Patani is a gorgeous showstopper for Ritu Kumar at LFW W/F 2017,"Disha Patani looked radiant as she walked down the ramp for designer Ritu Kumar on the first day of Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. The actor wore a beautiful, breezy outfit with bright floral embroidery on it. We love how the designer added a touch of modern element to the look while retaining the feminine elegance with the ruffle work. It's kind of unusual to mix a corset top, shorts and a sheer dress together to create an outfit, but it's ace designer Ritu Kumar we are talking about. We thinks she pulled it off beautifully. The stylists did a brilliant job too by giving Patani lovely tousled hair and sun-kissed make-up. (Source: Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

Meanwhile, Masaba Gupta presented her bridal collection inspired by Himalayan Orchard Pure at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Fruity colours of apple, strawberry and peach dominated the ramp. Also, green and yellow balanced the blues with rich shades of berry, ivory and hints of gold and silver touches.

Masaba's collection this season is aimed at a girls trousseau or a destination wedding in the tropics. The collection is a perfect pick for the millennial bride. The subtle Sakalava tribe face paintings alongside the bountiful orchard gardens serve as a canvas for the prints. Linear grass prints and abstract foliage and floral buds in fluid strokes are brought to life through colour on colour pigments and digital prints.

The line centres around progressive Indian wear featuring outfits with a contemporary and fresh take on tradition such as flowy anarkalis with caped backs and corsets, clouded silk dresses with knots flowing through seams.

"Doordarshan Agartala unit refutes Tripura CMO’s claim, says did not black out Independence Day","Manik Sarkar at the I-Day parade in Agartala. PTI photo Manik Sarkar at the I-Day parade in Agartala. PTI photo

The Agartala unit of the Doordarshan refuted Tripura Chief Minister’s Office claim that CM Manik Sarkar’s speech was blacked out on Independence Day. In a letter addressed to the media, U K Sahoo, head of the Doordarshan Kendra in Agartala, said his news unit gave wide coverage to the chief minister’s speech.

“On August 15, 2017, Doordarshan also gave wide coverage to the Chief Minister’s Independence day programme and telecast report running to 29 minutes and 45 seconds. Out of which the Hon’ble Chief Minister’s speech coverage was for 12 minutes. This was telecast at 1900 hours (SIC),” the letter read.

Sahoo said that a repeat telecast of the programme will air at 4.45 pm on Wednesday. The Chief Minsiter’s speech and the Independence Day programme were publicised in its regional news bulletins in various districts of Tripura, Sahoo claimed.

“Therefore, the allegation that Doordarshan Kenra, Agartala blacked out the Chief Minister on Independence day is totally incorrect and is vehemently refuted,” Sahoo wrote in the letter.

READ | Doordarshan, AIR blacked out my Independence Day speech, told me reshape it: Tripura CM Manik Sarkar

On Tuesday, the Tripura government alleged that the chief minister’s office was informed via letter that his speech would not be telecast unless he “reshaped it”.

The letter purportedly said, “The message of the Chief Minister was closely examined by competent authority. In view of the sanctity of the occasion, the broadcast code and responsibility of the public broadcaster it is not possible to telecast it in the present format.”

“However, Doordarshan/Prasar Bharati will be happy if the Chief Minister agrees to reshape the content making it suitable to the solemnity of the occasion and sentiment of the people,” it said.

A PTI report from Agartala quoted a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office: “The Chief Minister clearly stated that he would not change a single word and described it as unprecedented, undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant step.”

CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted “Doordarshan is not the private property of the BJP or the RSS. Its refusal to broadcast Tripura CM’s speech is undemocratic and illegal.”

"Retail inflation rises to 2.36 per cent in July, exports rise by 3.94 per cent","Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) was 0.90 per cent in June 2017 and 0.63 per cent in July 2016. (Illustration :C R Sasikumar) Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) was 0.90 per cent in June 2017 and 0.63 per cent in July 2016. (Illustration :C R Sasikumar)

The annual consumer price inflation rose to 2.36 percent in July after easing for three straight months, as a decline in food prices slowed sharply, government data showed on Monday. However, on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the country’s July retail inflation was lower than the 6.07 per cent CPI rate reported for the corresponding month of last year.

As per the ministry’s data, retail inflation in July was pushed higher by a rise in prices of cereals, milk-based products, meat and fish. On a sequential basis, the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) rose by 3.21 per cent during the month under review when compared to June 2017.

The data on a YoY basis, showed that cereals prices in July edged higher by 3.97 per cent, and meat and fish recorded a sharp rise of 3.19 per cent. Food and beverages during the month under consideration recorded a marginal rise of 0.43 per cent over the same month last year.

Among non-food categories, ‘fuel and light’ segment’s inflation rate accelerated to 4.86 per cent in July. The rural CPI YoY ruled higher at 2.41 per cent, whereas in urban areas it was at 2.17 per cent.

Wholesale inflation also rose sharply to 1.88 per cent in July — first rise in five months — as some food articles turned dearer even as the industry pitched for cut in interest rates citing weak industrial activity. Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) was 0.90 per cent in June 2017 and 0.63 per cent in July 2016.

The doubling in the rate of inflation in July, the first month of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, was mainly on account of turnaround in prices of food articles, especially vegetables. WPI inflation has been in decline since March.

Food articles, which were witnessing deflation for the previous two months, saw inflation go up to 2.15 per cent in July on a yearly basis, the official data released today showed.

Meanwhile, India’s export grew by 3.94 per cent on a yearly basis to USD 22.54 billion in July on account of rise in shipments of petroleum, chemicals and marine products, official data released showed.

Katrina Kaif is unarguably one of the fittest actors in the Indian film industry these days. The Bollywood beauty has on and off laid a lot of importance on the concept of staying fit and healthy, and clearly the result shows. The 34-year-old is always particular with her workout sessions and has often shared videos with celebrity trainer and Pilates master Yasmin Karachiwala.

The most recent was Kaif and Karachiwala trying out some combination Pilates moves under strict instructions from well-known master trainer Ann Toran from New York. The short video shows the Jagga Jasoos actor focusing on breathing and stretches while doing exercises that would not only strengthen the core but also tone the arms, calves and thighs.

As many know, Pilates is inspired by calisthenics, yoga and ballet, and is really helpful in increasing flexibility, and improving muscle tone-ups, especially in the abdomen region, lower back, hips and buttocks.

In this video, Kaif is working out on a Pilates reformer, which creates a unique environment for doing varied exercises in a small space. She starts off with simple pull ups for her abdomen, arms and back muscles, moving on to arm exercises and then a combination move for the upper body yet again. If you pay attention, you will find Toran concentrating on breath regulation.

Watch Kaif’s video here.

This is not the first time Kaif has posted on Instagram from her fitness sessions. See her other posts here.

It is not just Kaif, but actors like Alia Bhatt, Kriti Sanon and Sunny Leone are also popularly known for their intense fitness regimes of which Pilates forms a significant constituent.

Voices of Partition: One UP Muslim and two Pakistan born Hindus recollect the horrors of 1947,"From left Kulsum Naqvi, Balram Rana and Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo) From left Kulsum Naqvi, Balram Rana and Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo)

“Hindustan had become free. Pakistan had become independent soon after its inception but man was still slave in both these countries — slave of prejudice … slave of religious fanaticism … slave of barbarity and inhumanity.”- Saadat Hasan Manto

At the stroke of the midnight hour when the world slept, India awoke to life and freedom…..she also awoke to deaths and massacre, abductions, deceit, fear and displacement. The partition of Punjab remains by far the bloodiest part of Indian history, the dirtiest and scariest of all, tagging along as it did with the euphoria of freedom. A UP Muslim and two Hindu immigrants from Punjab narrated to Indianexpress.com their memories of August 15, 1947.

Kulsum Naqvi: We thought out brothers were dead

Kulsum Naqvi (Express Photo) Kulsum Naqvi (Express Photo)

Kulsum Naqvi (82) was born in a conservative Muslim household in a small village of Moradabad district in Uttar Pradesh. Daughter of a wealthy zamindar, Naqvi had grown up with every kind of luxury at her disposal. The departure of the British, however, had stripped her family of all its wealth. She recounts her childhood days when the Hindu-Muslim riots had torn apart her family.

“I had a beautiful childhood. We had a large house, almost like a haveli. My father was a zamindar and he owned a number of villages. We had a large number of servants in our house and they would manage everything. But ours was also a conservative Muslim family. We wore the burkha whenever we went out and were forbidden from being among men.

There were a large number of Hindus in my childhood village. I had lots of Hindu friends. Back then we never thought about who was a Hindu and who a Muslim. I remember during Holi, my friends would come to our house and drag me out and we would play Holi all day long. Similarly, during Id, my Hindu friends would join in the celebrations as well.

When the country got free we had a lot of celebrations in our village. Slogans were raised and crackers were burst. However, independence had come at a huge cost for us.

After the English left, however, we felt a huge change in our lives. All of a sudden we became poor. All the land owned by my father was acquired by the Indian government and we were left with nothing. My father was very unhappy about this. Later, the government had offered him a part of land as compensation but my father refused that as well out of anger. However, despite all the loss we went through my father was determined that he won’t leave India.

Partition had not led to any riots in our village. Both Hindus and Muslims had treated each other very well. There were a few mob attacks and slogans of ‘Jai Ram’, and ‘Jai Shankar’ would be raised. But the Hindu families around our house had given us a lot of support. They had ensured that nothing happen to us and that we need not leave.

However, my two brothers were working in Bareilly back then. The riots there resulted in them fleeing to Pakistan. We did not even know that they had fled to Pakistan. My father just assumed they had died in the riots. The grief of their presumed death had resulted in my father losing his memory. It is only after eight to ten years that they contacted us from Pakistan and that is when we got to know they were still alive. By then my father had in fact married off one of my brother’s wife who was with us, under the assumption that his son had died.

They later told us about the ordeal they went through while migrating. They told us that while both of them had left together, they somehow got separated. One went off to Karachi and the other one to Dhaka in East Pakistan. My brother described to me how there was absolutely no police protection in the train and how scared they were for their lives. No food and water was available either.

One of my elder sisters was also in Bareilly at this time. She too fled to Lahore in Pakistan during the riots. But she got in touch with us sooner than my brothers. She had later told me that she was asked to remove her burkha while travelling due to fear of being attacked. This was the first time she had stepped out without a burkha.

I visited my brothers in Pakistan in 1977. But I was very uncomfortable there. First of all people would laugh at our language. Then they would often accuse us of treachery because we did not leave India during Partition. We did not like the treatment and so we left earlier than decided.”

Solochana Sehgal: We would take shelter in houses of Muslim neighbours

Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo) Solochana Sehgal (Express Photo)

A South Delhi resident, Solochana Sehgal was an 11-year-old girl when the country attained independence. Having grown up with a large number of Muslim friends in her neighbourhood, she was forced to move to India a few days before independence due to the riots there. She recollects about her days of living in fear and the horrific sights she saw on her way to India.

“I was born in Kohat in West Pakistan. My father was a judge there. While growing up I had a number of Muslim friends. I remember Naseem, she was a very close friend of mine. In fact her father had helped us leave Kohat. He was the one who made all the arrangements and got my elder sister and my mother a burkha to wear during our travel. I was very young so I did not have to wear a burkha. But once we left Kohat I never kept in touch with Naseem. I used to miss her a lot though. But we used to get news of so many riots and houses burning and that used to scare us a lot. There was no question of writing to her after that.

When the riots first started taking place in Kohat there was so much of violence and destruction all around. Our house was amidst the houses of Muslims. So whenever the attacks took place we would go to the houses of the Muslims. There was no fear of getting burnt down there. So during the nights then come back to our home in the morning. The Muslims used to give us a lot of support. They were our friends. They kept telling us that we should not worry.

In our village we would hear so many cases of women being abducted and raped. Parents would be so scared. Some of them would be killed with poison so as to save them from getting raped.

We came out of Kohat about a month before Independence. A bus was arranged for us and some people were also arranged for our protection. We just came in our clothes and did not get anything else with us. Later, when we travelled in train, we saw such horrific scenes of people suffering and dying. So many pregnant women would give birth to their babies on the platform itself without any facilities.

We first reached Hoshiarpur in Punjab. My father had stayed back in Kohat since he was a judge and could not leave. For a long time we knew nothing about the whereabouts of my father. My mother used to remain very anxious. She would observe fasts for days, praying for news of him. Many days later a girl in our neighbourhood came to us saying that my father had been given a job in Delhi and that is how we got to know.

Once my father joined us we all left for Delhi and have been living here since then.”

Balram Rana: I regret not being able to save my family

Balram Rana (Express Photo) Balram Rana (Express Photo)

An Ayurveda specialist, 105-year-old Balram Rana was born in Nupursethi village in present day Pakistan. During Partition Rana was a 35-year-old, practising medicine in Rawalpindi. Completely bed-ridden now, he recounts the anguish of losing his family members in the riots and the guilt of not being able to convince them to leave the village on time. His daughter on the other hand explains how he still spends sleepless nights crying about the family he lost in the riots.

“I had a large family while growing up and Hindus and Muslims had good relations among themselves in my village. But during the riots the same Muslims turned sour. My mother had a friend who was Muslim. She used to be so close to my mother. But during the attack she just turned her back on us.

I was in Rawalpindi when Partition was announced. My grandparents, parents and their brothers were all in our village when the riots broke out. I had been asking them to join me in Rawalpindi, but they refused to do so. There was a man called Man Singh in my village. He fooled everyone. He kept telling everyone that nothing will happen and people believed him.

When the attacks took place everyone who remained were killed. Man Singh was also killed and so was his uncle and sons. His sons were axed. My grandmother was thrown into a fire alive. So many of my uncles were killed. At that moment, whoever came in front of the Muslims were killed. Only the ones who could run away were saved.

I had one Muslim friend, Nazeer. He and his family would always tell us that they would help our family in times of need. When the attacks took place he asked my parents to hide in their house. That is how my mother, father and sister were saved. The others were all killed.

In Rawalpindi also riots had taken place in Kursibazaar, but I managed to get out of there well before time. I somehow managed to get help from a friend and got up on a train with my wife and her younger sister and reached Hardwar. I still keep thinking that had I been in my village that day even I would be killed.”

"US designates Hizbul Mujahideen a foreign terrorist organisation, freezes assets","Syed Salahuddin commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, addresses his supporters in Muzaffarabad. (File Photo) Syed Salahuddin commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, addresses his supporters in Muzaffarabad. (File Photo)

The US State department on Wednesday designated Hizbul Mujahideen—also known as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The move comes nearly a month after it designated HM chief Syed Salahuddin as a specially designated global terrorist.

According to a statement from US department of States released this evening, “The designations seek to deny HM the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences, all of HM’s property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.”

Formed in 1989, HM is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir. Hizbul Mujahideen is led by Specially Designated Global Terrorist Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as Syed Salahuddin. Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014, explosives attack in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people, according to the statement.

New Delhi has been pushing for ban on HM and its chief with United Nation Security Council but has been vetoed by China. The designation by US department of States may help New Delhi to argue its case before the UNSC and will also put pressure on other countries to take action against HM and its leader. “Today’s action notifies the U.S. public and the international community that HM is a terrorist organization. Terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and deny them access to the U.S. financial system,” a statement from US department reads.

"Opposition, activists slam probe panel report on Rohith Vemula death","Rohith Vemula’s death had kicked up a controversy over the action against him that was alleged to have been prompted by complaints by BJP leaders. (File photo) Rohith Vemula’s death had kicked up a controversy over the action against him that was alleged to have been prompted by complaints by BJP leaders. (File photo)

Opposition parties and activists on Wednesday slammed a probe panel report that said Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula, who allegedly committed suicide last year, did not kill himself due to university action against him. The report of the one-man judicial commission under former Allahabad high court judge Justice A K Roopanwal, set up by the human resource development ministry, said “Vemula was a troubled individual and was unhappy for several reasons”.

The enquiry commission report submitted to the HRD ministry last year, also said that Vemula was not a Dalit by caste, besides giving a clean chit to then HRD minister Smriti Irani and BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya.

Academic scholar and Dalit rights activist Kancha Ilaiah alleged that the report has been written to present the government’s version of the story.

“What surprises me is that what the then HRD minister Smriti Irani had said about Vemula’s death is what forms the content of the report.

“We would have taken it more seriously if Irani would have then said that ‘look we do not know what happened and we are constituting an enquiry to know about it’,” Ilaiah told reporters, adding “What the minister wanted to say is all what has been written in the report”.

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he has been demanding a probe in the matter by a sitting Supreme Court judge for the truth to come out, asking “what can a retired judge say when the government has already made up its mind?”

Congress’ Rajeev Gowda also slammed the report saying it was a “sham”.

“It insults the memory of Vemula and the tragedy of his suicide. He was driven to death by mistreatment, harassment by varsity and intervention of central ministers into the issue,” he claimed.

Vemula hanged himself in a hostel room on January 17 last year as he was allegedly upset over disciplinary action taken against him by the University of Hyderabad.

His death had kicked up a controversy over the action against him that was alleged to have been prompted by complaints by BJP leaders.

Taramani review: This Andrea Jeramiah film deserves to be watched,"Despite its shortcomings, Taramani has a lot working in its favour. Despite its shortcomings, Taramani has a lot working in its favour.

Taramani movie cast: Andrea Jeremiah, Vasanth Ravi, Anjali

Taramani movie director: Ram

Taramani movie rating: 3.5

There is a Tamil phrase that Director Ram uses in the movie — “Mozhangalukum mottai mandaikum mudichu podrathu”. It indicates an unlikely relationship between two things at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The love story in Taramani’s is a bit like that. On one hand we have the stylish, sophisticated, modern Althiya Joseph (Andrea Jeramiah) and on the other there is the conventional Prabhunath (Vasanth Ravi) who is new to city and its urbane culture. Taramani follows Altheya and Prabhu capturing the multi-edged intricacies in contemporary romance through their stories.

Taramani is complex, heavy and a tad along. But at the same time it is also empowering. The movie demolishes every kind of stereotype out there – at times with subtlety and at times through a loudspeaker. The beauty of Taramani’s script does not lie in the pronounced moments but in the small things; like when Althea finds her husband with someone; little do we expect him to be homosexual. Similarly, when her five-year-old son is seen with a white stick like thing in his mouth, we are almost certain that it is a cigarette (Althea drinks and smokes, what else would it be?) — only to find out that it is a lollipop. Many such ‘expectations’ are pleasantly broken and that makes Taramani enormously effective.

We also have the loud reminders that this is a man’s world. After a break up, a colleague invites Altheya to a party. When she refuses, the colleague asks “are men the only people allowed to drink after a break up?” Altheya smiles for an instant, realising that she was momentarily lost in a stereotype herself. Though overdone at places, these clichéd lines work due to its relatability.

For a film that has been in the making for three years, Taramani feels fresh – thanks to Director Ram’s voiceovers and dialogues. Witty and powerful, it is his narrative that keeps you engrossed through the movie’s length. There is a sequence where Prabhu returns some cash to a lady in thousand rupee notes. As Prabhu leaves, a voice over says demonetisation was announced that night and we do not know if the woman managed to get the notes exchanged, ending it cheekily with a ‘Jai Hind’. His satirical political/social comments provide much needed relief to the intensity on screen and also save the movie from feeling dated.

Vasanth Ravi gives an impressive debut as Prabhu but Andrea steals the show with a remarkably understated performance. As an independent single mother, her portrayal is rooted in reality. It is also a small delight to hear the English dialogues sound natural and not contrived, as it is generally in Kollywood.

The movie, however, does lose its focus a bit in the middle and takes its own time to get back on track. The staging and the cinematography is unimpressive while the music works in patches. A few story arcs are fantastical. It would have more emphatic had it been streamlined a bit, it tries to say too much. Also, for a story that doesn’t really ‘judge’ anyone, the male lead gets a character certificate too many times.

But despite its flaws, Taramani’s voice is genuine; and for that, the movie deserves to be watched.

How world newspapers reported India’s independence in 1947,"The major newspapers of the world had culled out a significant part of their front pages to underline the nationalist aspirations, the birth of the two nations and the celebrations as well as massacre that accompanied the same.

Mid 20th century was clearly a dramatic time for the global order. The trauma of the Second World War had its grip firmly over the psyche of the Western powers and the colonial powers were facing the wrath of the added expenses brought forth by their colonies. As the Western world reeled under its internal and external pressures, one piece of news from the oriental part of the globe had shaken it up further, enough to make its way to the front page of all the major newspapers of the world. The jewel in the crown of the British empire was lost and had found itself a space in the world map, independent of the authority of its colonial masters. Further, this long drawn battle for independence had been won at a cost, as not one but two independent nations had emerged on August 15, 1947, leaving the South Asian region soaked in blood of the Partition riots that had accompanied it.

Indian independence was a historic moment for the world. The largest and most important colony of the British empire was freed. Further, the route to freedom for India was unique in its capacity that it drew on the Gandhian theory of non-violence, something that went on to inspire several leaders across the globe. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the major newspapers of the world had culled out a significant part of their front pages to underline the nationalist aspirations, the birth of the two nations and the celebrations as well as massacre that accompanied the same. Incidentally though, while the partition of Punjab and the bloodshed resulting from it, made its way to the front pages of almost every newspaper, the partition of Bengal was barely ever mentioned at all.

Here is how some of the major newspapers of the world reported on Indian independence in 1947.

The New York Times

Flaunting a large map of the Indian subcontinent, as it stood on August 15, 1947, the front page of the American daily, New York Times reported on the celebration of freedom on one hand and the grief of partition on the other. Further, it also reported on the fact that a number of princely states were yet to decide on the nationality they wished to adhere to. The ambiguity of the status of the princely states was made evident from the map which left out states like Hyderabad and Kashmir that had not yet made up their mind.

The Washington Post

The front page of the Washington Post carried a long reportage on the celebrations following Indian independence. The paper made a keen observation of the oriental pomp accompanying the celebrations. “They began a new chapter of two independent dominions with celebrations in oriental pomp and splendor- marred by bloodshed, death and terror in wide sections of the country,” wrote the paper. The speech of Nehru, the celebratory mood in the Red Fort and the burning of Punjab were all reported under the headline “India achieves sovereignty, amid scenes of wild rejoicing.”

The Chicago Tribune

The focus of the American news daily Chicago Tribune, on the other hand, was on Lord Mountbatten taking oath as the first governor-general of India. While reporting on the increasing death toll in Punjab and the celebration of the role of Gandhi, the Chicago Tribune’s reportage referred to the newly born nations as “Hindu India” and “Muslim Pakistan”. The second page of the newspaper carried a special section dedicated to Pakistan under the headline, “Jinnah frosty as he wins his dream of Moslem state.”

The Irish Times

One of the very first British colonies to gain independence, Ireland shared a special solidarity with India in her long sought after freedom. Accordingly, the Irish daily laid its focus on the Indian accomplishment of independence. “The last stroke of midnight, booming from the dome of New Delhi’s Parliament buildings, set off the highest, noisiest and most joyful celebrations ever experienced in the East,” wrote the newspaper under the headline, “India celebrates as Britain hands over control.”

The Daily Telegraph

The celebrated British daily chalked a large portion of their front page to reportage of Indian independence. Large portions of their report were devoted to the communication between the British and Indian political elite, while a significant section was headed as “Indians praise Britain” and another as “British sagacity”. A photograph of the Union Jack at the Residency of Lucknow adorned the front page as well which said that “the Union Jack flying from the tower of the ruined Residency at Lucknow, from which it had never been lowered since recapture of the town after the siege of 1857. It was hauled down for the first and last time at midnight last night, marking the transference of power to the Dominion of India (Hindustan).”

The Times of India, the Indian Express and the Hindustan Times

Back home, the news dailies like Times of India, Hindustan Times and the Indian Express were paginated with the pride of independence. The front page of each of the papers were basking in glory of the jubilation being observed across the cities of Delhi and Bombay as Nehru delivered his ‘tryst with destiny’ speech. The birth of Pakistan too was given due importance as the paper reported on Jinnah’s communication with Britain regarding the future relationship between Pakistan and its former coloniser. Also reported were the tasks ahead for the newfound nations.

Puneri Paltan captain shares his ‘roller-coaster ride’,"Puneri Paltan’s kabaddi team captain Deepak Hooda Puneri Paltan’s kabaddi team captain Deepak Hooda

FROM BEING a part-time teacher in his village in Haryana to donning the cap of the captain of Puneri Paltan’s kabaddi team, Deepak Hooda said his life has been a “roller coaster ride”.

His tryst with kabaddi began when he was 16 years old and had started participating in local tournaments. Initially, he played to earn money and support his sister after they lost their parents at a very young age.

It was while playing for local tournaments that he developed an interest in kabaddi and aspired to be a part of the national team. “I joined the Haryana team and bagged gold at the senior national-level tournament in Patna in 2014. Later, I played for the national team at the 2016 South Asian Games and won the gold, again. The beginning of the Pro-Kabaddi League brought a huge change in the field. Kabaddi players started getting exposure, financial stability and, more importantly, respect. The reason I am being recognised today by fans, is the Pro-Kabaddi League,” he said.

Hooda added that it was his dream to be a part of the national squad and win laurels. “I was thrilled to be a part of the gold-winning team at the 2016 South Asian Games. My biggest achievement, till date, is being a part of the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup Squad. I hope that, as the captain of the Puneri Paltan, I would be able to lead my team to victory and add another feather to my cap,” he said.

“The feeling of donning the Indian Jersey was a dream come true for me…,” he added.

Pointing out that while cricket is the most popular sport in the country, he said kabaddi was not far behind. According to studies, Kabaddi was the second most viewed sports in India in 2016, he added.

The Pro-Kabaddi League has repackaged the sport in an appealing way, said Hooda, adding that, today, the audience for kabaddi is double as compared to the previous seasons.

“The Pro-Kabaddi League has given a financial stability to players like me, who hail from humble backgrounds. It has given us a platform to showcase our talent. Our team owner’s motive is to promote kabaddi right from the grassroots levels. The government, too, is actively encouraging the sport and its players, and soon enough we may also be a part of the Olympics,” he added.

Pointing out at the void he feels as his parents are not around, he said, “I had lost my mother when I was 4, and my father passed away in 2013, leaving me as the sole breadwinner in the family. Hence, I had to leave my studies. I became a part-time teacher for two years, to support my sister. That was the time I started playing kabaddi and was drawn towards it. Kabaddi helped me a lot, in channelising my energy and emotions for good.”

The Railways has brought some good cheer for Bihar, amid the gloom of floods and destruction, with Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announcing a slew of amenities for passengers in the state. Among the most passenger-friendly moves, Prabhu announced the availability of Wi-Fi facility for passengers waiting at railway platforms for browsing the Internet at high speed. The service is being provided by RailTel in partnership with Google.

“Floods in Bihar have caused distress, I have directed concerned officers to extend all possible assistance to the people. We wanted to do this programme to ensure that people get the benefit of these amenities as soon as possible,” said Prabhu.

“In Chapra, we are also providing Wi-Fi. First we had a target of providing Wi-Fi at 140 stations, now we are targeting 200 stations to provide Wi-Fi this year and in two years time, we will provide it in 400 stations,” said Prabhu, going on to list the amenities provided at other railway stations across the state.

Prabhu also announced the foundation stone laying for Gaya Byepass, electrification of Bakhtiarpur-Rajgir section, and new amenities for Bihta station, which is 28 kms west of Patna and Chapra station. The Bihta Station is an important station connected with the state capital where dozens of long distance trains halt.

The amenities here include extension of platforms for accommodation of 24 coaches, extension of four platform sheds, provision of 12 benches for the passengers and a water booth. Chapra, not only gets the Wi-Fi connection, but also two escalators at a cost of Rs 145.54 lakh, 36 CCTV cameras, four water vending machine, each costing Rs 4.5 lakhs and a second entry gate is also being constructed at a cost of Rs 24.62 crore to meet the demand of passengers.

The minister also announced a green corridor in the Bhagalpur-Banka section of Malda Division wherein all the coaches will have bio-toilets by 2019-2020. Prabhu highlighted the importance of the electrification of Bakhtiyarpur-Rajgir section which was the missing link between two electrified corridors of Mughalsarai-Patna-Bakhtiyarpur-Sitarampur-Howrah (Delhi-Howrah main line) and Mughalsarai-Gaya-Dhanbad-Sitarampur-Howrah.

The proposed route via Tilaiya is a shorter route for transportation of coal to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). Apart from coal, this line also carries fertilisers, food grains, cement and salt. “In the next few years, amenities for passengers will only get better. After becoming Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had said that we will make the Railways such that people get the best amenities and they feel that everything has improved for the better,” said Prabhu.

The minister also announced the electrification of Meralgram-Renukut section which is a part of the Garwa road-Chopan-Singrauli line covering 257 kms passing through the states of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.

"Australian Open comeback an ‘outrageous plan’, admits Serena Williams","Serena Williams plans to defend her Australian Open title in 2018. (Source: AP File) Serena Williams plans to defend her Australian Open title in 2018. (Source: AP File)

Serena Williams won the Australian Open this past year while she was pregnant. So expecting her to make a comeback within months of giving birth shouldn’t be a massive ask for a superhuman that she is. And yet the entire idea of such a comeback is an outrageous plan – the now dethroned World No 1 admits.

“It’s the most outrageous plan,” she said in an interview to Vogue. “I just want to put that out there. That’s, like, three months after I give birth. I’m not walking anything back, but I’m just saying it’s pretty intense.” Serena is expected to give birth at the end of the year and add to her already impressive tally of 23 Grand Slam titles.

But with a year away from the sport, Serena knows it will be a difficult ask with voices expected to grow louder if she doesn’t win outright. “In this game you can go dark fast,” she said. “If I lose, and I lose again, it’s like, she’s done. Especially since I’m not 20 years old. I’ll tell you this much: I won’t win less. Either I win, or I don’t play.” Serena isn’t the first tennis player looking to make a successful return to the court. Belgium’s Kim Clijsters retired at 23 having won a US Open but after a 28-month layoff, she returned having given birth to once again win at Flushing Meadows.

Another level of criticism that has been aimed at Serena has been her unorthodox style of play. Known to obliterate her opponents with sheer power on serve and in her groundstrokes while grunting her way around, her style isn’t known to attract fans. But the American thinks a lot of that expectation may have to do with her race. “Not only me, but women in general sometimes feel that power is a bad word,” said the 35-year-old. “As I’ve gotten older I’ve started to feel differently about it. Power is beauty. Strength is beauty. So now on the court I want people to think that I’m powerful. But I also want them to be shocked at how I play. I want people to expect something, then get something different.”

“I feel like people think I’m mean,” she said. “Really tough and really mean and really street. I believe that the other girls in the locker room will say, ‘Serena’s really nice.’ But Maria Sharapova, who might not talk to anybody, might be perceived by the public as nicer. Why is that? Because I’m black and so I look mean? That’s the society we live in. That’s life. They say African Americans have to be twice as good, especially women. I’m perfectly OK with having to be twice as good.”

Appearing on the cover of Vogue for a third time, Serena said her inclusion was a positive step for African American women. “Being black and being on the cover was really important to me,” she said. “The success of one woman should be the inspiration to another, and I’m always trying to inspire and motivate the black girls out there. I’m not a model. I’m not the girl next door. But I’m not hiding. Actually, I look like a lot of women out there. The American woman is many women, and I think it’s important to speak to American women at a time when they need encouragement. I’m not political, but I think everyone is worried, to a degree.”

The too late nation,"A nation without common decency, common practicality and basic compassion. (Source: PTI Photo) A nation without common decency, common practicality and basic compassion. (Source: PTI Photo)

Maithili Sharan Gupt’s immortal lines hum kaun thae, kya ho gaye hain, aur kya honge abhi, aao vichare aaj mil kar yeh samasyaen sabhi (Who were we? Who have we become? And what more shall we be? Come, let us together meditate on all these conundrums), seem the right exhortation on India’s 70th Independence Day. It seems necessary since the virtues Gupt extolled in the imaginary universe of his poem — knowledge, self-knowledge, independence, detachment, piety, free-spiritedness and, above all, compassion (“by the suffering of others, we were with tenderness moved”) — seem all but eclipsed from our scale of values.

But more crushingly, the unimaginably horrible deaths of more than 60 children in BRD hospital Gorakhpur have probably become a more accurate mirror of what we have indeed become: A nation without common decency, common practicality and basic compassion.

There are proximate political and administrative failures leading to children being denied oxygen. Individual responsibility will have to be assigned. But this horrific episode is also a rebuke to our independence, what we have done with it, the kind of community we have become, and the scale of values we measure ourselves by. The numbness the episode produces is in part because it reminds us that in our republic poor children are fated to die in part because of what we choose to be.

The children are fated to die because in this republic our priorities have gone awry. The crisis in India’s health system is not the biggest secret in the world. Yet this crisis does not precipitate the slightest public anger, does not engage our collective intelligence, or move our conscience.

The children are fated to die because even in tragedy we will find an excuse to once again replay mock battles. In India, there is no space for mourning, only for recrimination. There is no space for truly valuing what was lost, even a moment of pause where we confront the gaping void these deaths leave behind. Instead, that void will be filled very quickly by the same politics of recrimination, divisiveness and distraction that produced this outcome in the first place.

The children in India are fated to die because settling medieval scores, living out accumulated resentments, depletes our social, political and emotional resources. The real individuality of our citizens, children with a future, parents with hope, is rendered invisible by more abstract and murderous battles of clan and community. The dead weight of a politics trapped in the past renders invisible the sufferings of the present.

The children are fated to die because our structures of representing reality are now irrevocably broken. Rather than allowing us to access the totality of our circumstances, they consistently throw a veil over reality. They satiate our appetite for mock battles of great sound and fury, whose only consequence is greater estrangement of citizens from one another.

The children are fated to die because in India evil remains structural. It does not come announcing its intent. But it is so deeply inscribed in the structure of privilege, so marginalises the poor and renders them so invisible, that we can comfortably go on living with our sense of innocence. The devastating hand of economic violence still makes a mockery of all our constitutional bromides about liberty and equality.

The children are fated to die because India is superb at the grammar of protest and episodic intervention. In mission mode, under a special dispensation, we can achieve anything. But India is terrible at institutionalising quotidian routine functions in the state. It is terrible at small forms of cooperation. There is a banality to evil in India, in a different sense. What makes evil sticky in India is that it is the outcome of accumulated small dysfunctions.

The children are fated to die because the politics of symbolism and prestige will outweigh any sense of facticity and science. The answer to the question of what will it take to make Gorakhpur encephalitis-free will probably be yet another dysfunctional research institute, not a deployment of knowledge available.

The children are fated to die because there is no community, just an endless series of contractors, bureaucrats, and technicians trying to intervene in contexts where there is no local community; no sense of Gorakhpur as a shared space, a community with some modicum of collective self-control over destiny. In a way, independence has condemned us not to freedom but an even more overpowering fatality, all the more insidious because it has a veneer of democratic legitimacy to it.

Maithili Sharan Gupt’s ancient India may be a figment of his imagination. But at least the mythology he constructed peddled some of the right virtues. But in our scale of values, knowledge gives way to denial, self-knowledge to a self-forgetting piety and arrogance, detachment to veniality, free-spiritedness to conformity, and above all, compassion to contempt. If we look in the mirror of Gorakhpur and ask who we have become, the picture is not pretty.

But even if we let the past be the past and ask what we shall become in the future, the answer is not comforting. It is very likely in the next few months, the political and judicial groundwork for building a Ram temple will intensify. It is unlikely it will be a monument to karuna (compassion). It will instead be a monument to our collective narcissism, an itch to fight and divide. It is a forlorn hope, but it would be so extraordinary if in the aftermath of Gorakhpur, what we build in Ayodhya is a hospital not a temple. It is a forlorn hope that it can become a symbol for overcoming all that keeps us back: A politics of distraction, divisiveness and dissimulation that comes in the way of a politics of dignity.

India is 70; young among nations. But time is of the essence before it ages rapidly. There is a real danger that India will be “too late.” Martin Luther King once wrote, “We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilisations are written the pathetic words ‘too late.’” The question after Gorakhpur is: Is India at 70 too late, too late not for false glory, but to recover its own humanity?

"Bareilly Ki Barfi: Things you should know about the Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao starrer","Bareilly Ki Barfi has created quite a buzz among fans not only for its stellar cast of Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon, but also because it is being directed by Nil Battey Sannata fame Ashwini Iyer. Aligning to Bollywood's latest obsession with small-town tales, this love triangle from Uttar Pradesh is everything crazy with a desi zing added to it. Here are some facts you should know before watching the film on August 18.

From a peppy background score to kickass dialogues, the trailer of Bareilly Ki Barfi is proof that the film has successfully captured the true essence of UP culture. Set in the backdrop of Lucknow and Bareilly, the characters played by the stars appear true-to-life and genuine.

What makes this film stand out is the fact that the makers have made sure to add a uniqueness and depth to the characters, be it Bitti's free-spirited nature and break-dancing or Rajkummar Rao trying on sarees. These little quirks make the film a progressive take on North Indian culture and have left us wondering about the plot.

Taking promotions up a notch, Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann even gate-crashed an actual engagement party in Mumbai leaving the hosts and guests equally surprised. Talking to a leading daily, Ayushmann had said, ""We had warned the event managers but the moment we walked in, I could hear people saying, 'Inko bhi bulaya hai kya?'. And the expression on the new couple's faces was priceless!""

While Ayushmann is playing the owner of a printing press, Rajkummar Rao will reportedly be seen as an author and Kriti as a straightforward, outgoing small-town girl. The plot revolves around her equations with her family and the two men vying for her attention. Who will win her heart in the end? We will have to wait till August 18 to find that out."
"Pune: 33 per cent pendency, 100-odd govt officials flock to Bombay HC thrice a week","A delegation of Pune Bar Association met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Chief Justice of Bombay High Court Manjula Chellur on Saturday. Express A delegation of Pune Bar Association met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Chief Justice of Bombay High Court Manjula Chellur on Saturday. Express

ON an average, thrice a week, at least 100 government and civic officials from Pune from various departments rush to Mumbai to meet government lawyers in Bombay High Court in connection with writ petitions or PILs filed. These officials, including district collector and municipal commissioner, make it to Mumbai primarily by government vehicles. They are supposed to meet government lawyers, provide information sought by them and even file affidavits. The time, money and efforts involved in this regular but necessary exercise, says Pune Bar Association (PBA), is simply colossal.

This huge loss, says PBA, can be easily avoided if a bench of the Bombay High Court is set up in Pune, a demand that persists for years now. A delegation of PBA on Saturday met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Chief Justice of Bombay High Court Manjula Chellur and once again argued strongly to set up the Pune bench of the Bombay High Court for the convenience of one and all, including litigants, lawyers and government officials. The delegation included the likes of senior advocates Harshad Nimbalkar, S K Jain, Bhaskarrao Awhad, M P Bendre and PBA president Rajendra Daundkar.

When the PBA delegation met the CM, he passed on the onus to the Chief Justice. Senior advocate S K Jain, who was part of the delegation, said, “The CM said that the Chief Justice has to take a call. The CJ said that the demand will be decided on the merit. We will form a committee of judges who will look into the demand to set up the bench from cities like Pune and Kolhapur,” said Jain. On his part, the CM that said once the decision is finalised, the government will provide all the necessary funds. “We will provide Rs 22 crore to set up the bench,” he said.

Another senior advocate Harshad Nimbalkar said that the delegation highlighted the key point of pendency of cases from Pune. “About 33 per cent of the cases pending in Bombay High Court are from Pune. If a Pune bench is set up, it will take off a lot of load from the HC,” he said. Besides, Nimbalkar said the delegation argued that Pune was a divisional headquarters with five districts under it. Several key tribunals, like the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and Income Tax Tribunal, function in Pune.

Nimbalkar said that the delegation pointed out to the CM and the CJ that Pune has better connectivity than Kolhapur to Mumbai. “Whether it is by air, rail or road, Pune is close to Mumbai and hence should get preference over Kolhapur,” he said. PBA is apparently making efforts through District Guardian Minister Girish Bapat to set up the bench in Pune. State Minister Chandrakant Patil seems to be holding the brief for advocates in Kolhapur.

The PBA delegation also told the CM and the CJ that in Mumbai, there is a dearth of space for keeping the court records. “But in Pune we have no such problem…there is a need to decentralise the high court work,” said advocate Jain.

PBA highlighted the fact that the demand for a Pune bench was raised in 1978 at the same time when the demand for Aurangbad bench came up. “Even the State Assembly had given a green signal for the setting up of the benches. While the Aurangabad bench came up in 1980 or so, the Pune bench demand remained just that,” Jain said.

Significantly, the PBA said if it is not possible to decide between the two cities, Pune or Kolhapur, then the best solution could be dividing the tenure of the bench between Pune and Kolhapur. “In a month for 15 days, the bench can function in Pune and for another 15 days, it can function in Kolhapur,” said advocate Nimbalkar. It was also suggested that large amount of vacant land is available in Tathwade area where the bench can come up.

Biggest Bollywood hits of 2017 so far,"With Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, Akshay Kumar has proved that he has got what it takes to pull audiences to the theaters. The unconventional love story of Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar) and Keshav (Akshay Kumar) with Toilet being the villain of their fairy tale is running to packed houses after the disheartening fate of Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma starrer Jab Harry Met Sejal. Within five days of its release, the film, which highlights the issue of open defecation in India, has managed to mint Rs 83.45 crore. With such good numbers, this is Akshay's second film after Jolly LLB 2 to be in the top 10 openers of 2017.

Earlier in the year Baahubali: The Conclusion created a storm with its record-breaking collection of Rs 510.98 crore in India. But before Baahubali 2, it was Shah Rukh Khan's Republic Day release Raees which minted Rs 137.51 crore despite a clash with Hrithik Roshan's Kaabil. Raees is the second highest earner of the year until now.

Well, Salman Khan also failed to spell his charm on the moviegoers as his much-awaited Eid release Tubelight tanked at the box office. The actor, who failed to impress the audience with his good-boy image, admitted that he never expected a positive review from film critics. In fact, the film also failed to touch the 120-crore mark and raked in only Rs 119.26 crore.

The court room drama Jolly LLB 2 starring Akshay Kumar and Huma Qureshi entered the 100-crore club with its total collection of Rs 117 crore.

Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt once again won hearts with their quirky yet simple love story, Badrinath Ki Dulhania. The film was applauded by the critics and audiences alike. The film, which released in March, earned Rs 116.68 crore.

Hrithik Roshan's blind act in Kaabil did bring him appreciation but the film was overpowered by SRK's Raees. It minted Rs. 103.84 crore.

Irrfan Khan starrer Hindi Medium proved to be an underdog as despite a slow start the film managed to earn Rs 69.59 crore. The film was made on a modest budget of Rs 22 crores.

Despite his stature in the domestic as well as international market, Shah Rukh Khan failed to impress his massive fan following with Imtiaz Ali's directorial Jab Harry Met Sejal. The film was panned by critics and audiences alike. Despite many unique and interesting promotional gimmicks, the film earned only Rs. 62.60 crore, which is something unexpected from a Shah Rukh Khan starrer.

Despite a decent opening on its release date and a good collection through the weekend, Jagga Jasoos failed to do an impressive job at the box office. The Ranbir Kapoor-Katrina Kaif starrer collected Rs 54.16 crore in India.

Anil Kapoor and his nephew Arjun Kapoor succeeded in tickling the funny bone of the audience with their perfect comic timing in Mubarakan. The movie earned Rs 51.55 crore. Though the film, made on a budget of Rs 55 crore, got a slow opening, it picked up at the box office due to positive word-of-mouth.

The 'lady-oriented' Lipstick Under My Burkha amid competition from other big banner movies managed to perform well at the box office. It earned Rs 18.87 crore. The film starring Konkona Sensharma and Ratna Pathak Shah was made on a budget of Rs 6 crores."
"Defying Kerala govt order, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat hoists flag at school","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (File Photo) RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (File Photo)

DEFYING A directive issued by the CPI(M)-led government in Kerala, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday hoisted the national flag at a government-aided school in Palakkad district.

In a written order issued late on Monday night, Palakkad District Collector P Marykutty informed V Sreekumar, headmaster of the Karnaki Amman Higher Secondary School, that “there is a direction from the government that only office heads or elected people’s representatives should hoist the flag” on the occasion of Independence Day.

Stating that they had “received information that representatives of a certain organisation” would hoist the flag at the school, the district administration told the headmaster that the “above direction should be strictly adhered to.’’

But Bhagwat defied the order on Tuesday morning, as he unfurled the flag at the school and delivered a speech.

When contacted, Marykutty claimed that as per the flag code, either government officials or elected people’s representatives should hoist the national flag.

“We had given general instructions to all departments in this regard. The school not only violated that instruction, but also did not ensure that the national anthem was sung after hoisting the flag. After singing Vande Mataram, everyone left the school. The national anthem was

sung later, when very few were around. Hence, the police have been asked to register a case against the school headmaster,’’ she said.

Superintendent of Police, Palakkad, Pratheesh Kumar said: “We are examining the issue… We haven’t decided on registering any case so far.’’

Director of Public Instruction K V Mohan Kumar said his office had issued directions to all schools in the state, saying that their headmasters should hoist the flag at 9:30 am. “In Palakkad, the headmaster did not hoist the flag. It was Bhagwat who hoisted the flag at 9.30 am. The headmaster hoisted the flag later, at 10:30 am. I have sought explanations from the school headmaster and the deputy director of education in Palakkad. The headmaster has given a one-line explanation, that he did hoist the flag, which is not satisfactory,’’ said Kumar.

Countering the district administration, BJP Palakkad district president E Krishnadas said the order that only officials and elected representatives should hoist the national flag has no legal backing. “Every citizen of the country has the right to unfurl the national flag. To cover up the awkwardness after issuing the order, the district collector has now instructed the police to register a case against the headmaster,’’ said Krishnadas.

Kailas Mani, a member of the school management trust, alleged that the controversy was politically motivated. “To mark the school’s golden jubilee celebrations in 2015-16, we had invited Bhagwat and several other dignitaries. Bhagwat had then promised to visit the school on his next visit to Palakkad. Recently, we got to know that Bhagwat was attending an RSS function in Palakkad, and so we invited him,’’ said Mani, denying any violation of the flag code.

Meanwhile, RSS Prachar Pramukh Manmohan Vaidya criticised the state government, claiming that “no other school had been given similar information”.

“We condemn such brazen attempts by the CPI(M)-led government of Kerala to deny the basic citizen rights of celebrating Independence Day, and their continuous attempts to poison the state of Kerala with divisive politics,” said Vaidya. “The school authorities decided that they would proceed as planned and that Sarsanghchalakji must exercise his constitutional rights,” he added.

Accusing the RSS of politicising the issue, CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said this was an example of “RSS-isation” in educational institutions controlled by the RSS.

In its invitation to Bhagwat, dated February 28, 2015, the Karnaki Amman Education Society wrote that its “trust members” are “all swayamsevaks of Moothanthara Shakha, which is one of the oldest in Kerala”. Inviting Bhagwat for the school’s golden jubilee celebrations, the society said that “we are blessed with the presence of all former sarsanghchalaks to our school… attending such programmes”.

Chess legend Garry Kasparov suffers first loss in his comeback event,"At the day’s close Garry Kasparov drew once more after going up against Viswanathan Anand of India. (Source: File) At the day’s close Garry Kasparov drew once more after going up against Viswanathan Anand of India. (Source: File)

Chess legend Garry Kasparov suffered the first loss of his brief but highly anticipated comeback to the game, succumbing to fellow Russian Ian

Nepomniachtchi and bringing his draw total to five.

After three draws on Monday, the 54-year-old former world champion — who dominated the game from 1985 to 2000 — had hoped to play “more aggressive” chess on day two of the Rapid and Blitz tournament in St Louis.

But after drawing his first game yesterday with Armenian world number four Levon Aronian, a contest that featured some gutsy moves from Kasparov and a few trademark death stares, he could not hold on against Nepomniachtchi.

At the day’s close Kasparov drew once more after going up against Viswanathan Anand of India, another “former” competitor and the only one present to have played against Kasparov when he ran the global chessboard.

“I haven’t played serious chess in 12 years, & haven’t missed as many opportunities as I did today in 15! Hoping to steady the ship tomorrow!” tweeted Kasparov at the end of the day.

“I was too democratic today. I made quite a few good moves, but spread them evenly among all three games instead of concentrating them!” After his loss Kasparov’s fans, all hoping to see the brilliance that characterized his long career, said they were disappointed but still hopeful.

“It had to happen. But he is doing pretty well for a comeback against these new players,” said one fan, 42-year-old American Tracy Stewart. “He hasn’t been offensive enough.”

Kasparov, who left the game in order to pursue a career in politics, will need some wins if he wants to move up in the tournament rankings — he started Tuesday in 7th position out of 10.

Victories would give his comeback some symbolic power — Kasparov would be seen as passing the torch to a new generation, albeit a generation still spellbound by his talent.

But those more youthful players seem determined to knock Kasparov from his pedestal. On Tuesday neither his risks nor his intimidating

glowering looks paid off.

American grandmaster Robert Hess had predicted a “tough day,” saying that “every opponent is extremely strong, so Garry will certainly need to bring his A game if he is going to try to score some victories.”

Though the winner’s purse in St Louis is a not-too-shabby $150,000, Kasparov said he would donate any winnings to promote chess in Africa.

"Encephalitis to education, communalism and nationalism: Here’s what CMs said","UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at an Independence Day function in Lucknow. (Express Photo) UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at an Independence Day function in Lucknow. (Express Photo)

Uttar Pradesh

Lucknow: In his first Independence Day speech, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that the remedy for treatment of diseases such as encephalitis lies in the Swachh Bharat Mission, and that he has seen for the last two decades that 500 to 1,000 children between the ages one and 10 years die in eastern UP every year due to “gandagi” (filth). Adityanath also said that manchan (staging) of Ram-Leela in Ayodhya had been stopped in the past but it has been restarted so that people can take inspiration from Lord Ram’s ideology.

Facing criticism from the Opposition on deaths at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, his Lok Sabha constituency for two decades, Adityanath appealed to people to take the pledge to become part of the Swachh Bharat Mission. He said a a large number of children in UP die of vector-borne diseases such as encephalitis, chikungunya, dengue, kala azar. “Mera maanna hai ki encephalitis jaisi bimariyon ke upchaar ka raaz Swachh Bharat Mission ke andar chhupa hua hai (I believe the remedy for diseases such as encephalitis lies in Swachh Bharat),” he said. Highlighting his government’s decisions in the last five months, he said the state is working to preserve the heritage of the nation. He said a society that gets cut off its roots becomes a “trishanku” (in a limbo), with no goal in life.

Kerala

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said attempts to water down the concept of nationalism should be defeated, and that nationalism based on democracy and secularism should be upheld. Stating that nationalism, which has evolved on the grounds of secular values and democracy in India, should not fall into new conventions of religious hatred and religious nationalism, he said, “Indian nationalism is a confluence of diversity. Nationalism will collapse if we try to annihilate this diversity. If nationalism is constructed on narrow-minded sentiments, a great threat is waiting to emerge.”

Beginning the address after paying tribute to children who died in the Gorakhpur hospital, he said, “Every Independence Day begins with pride and joy. (But) we cannot help but say that there is a sense of sadness during this year’s Independence Day.”

Maharashtra

Mumbai: Taking a pledge to make Maharashtra farmers debt-free, CM Devendra Fadnavis said the government reckons loan waiver is not the long lasting solution. “My government has given Rs 34,000 crore loan waiver to 89 lakh farmers. But we are not going to seek solace and rest. It cannot provide a permanent satisfaction,” he said. To provide shelter for all, he said the government will build 12 lakh houses in rural and 10 lakh houses in urban areas under affordable housing project by 2019.

Karnataka

Bengaluru: Opposing “imposition” of Hindi by the Centre as a language alongside Kannada and English in Bengaluru Metro and supporting efforts to encourage use of Kannada as a primary language, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said on the occasion of Independence Day that the “concept of cooperative federalism mandates that local language’s primacy cannot be compromised’’. He said, “Ours is a pluralistic society with many languages, cultures and communities. The strength of our nation lies in that all these not only coexist but are flourishing by retaining their respective identities within the democratic set-up, as ordained by our constitution. This is unity not only in diversity, but also unity through diversity.”

Siddaramaiah also criticised efforts to create differences among Indians by inciting hatred on religious and communal lines and called these attempts “anti-national’’.

Patna: CM Nitish Kumar said, “We are committed to provide electricity to all habitations by this year-end, and to every household by 2018-end.” With 12 districts grappling with floods, he said flood-hit people have the “first right on the state exchequer” and thanked Prime Minister Modi for prompt Central assistance by sending 15 NDRF teams. He said, “The government is trying to open an engineering college, an ITI college and an ANM college in every district so that students do not have to migrate to other states for professional courses.”

Gujarat

Vadodara: CM Vijay Rupani said although India got independence 70 years ago, “our dream of surajya (good governance) is not completely fulfilled yet. For more than 60 years the dream of surajya has not been achieved, but now the nation is on its way to surajya, and it is a matter of pride that our great son of Gujarat, Narendrabhai Modi, is leading the way. The youth or the women, the poor or the rich, Narendrabhai is providing equal opportunities to all, and India is emerging as a vishvaguru (world teacher). Narendrabhai has written a new chapter in the development of this country with the mantra of sauno [sabka] saath, sauno vikas.”

Rupani said cow is considered mother in Indian culture, is the “symbol of our religious faith, and by tightening the cow slaughter law in Gujarat we have made sure its protection, and with stricter prohibition law, we are working in the direction to make Gujarat in the true sense Gandhji’s Gujarat.”

Rajasthan

Jaipur: Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said it will be possible to achieve “true Independence” only when every person progresses, education is made compulsory, health services are free, there are job opportunities for everyone, and justice is delivered. Exhorting the need to end economic and social differences, she said the state is moving towards a “new Rajasthan” that will be prosperous, proud, with employment opportunities, and is free of corruption, casteism, foeticide, illiteracy, and poverty.

With opposition Congress raking up the issue of Barmer refinery throughout her current tenure, Raje said that the government had saved Rs 40,000 crore in the recent renegotiation for refinery, and for which a joint venture agreement will be signed soon.

A special tableau on upcoming FIFA Under-17 World Cup was also taken out. “Outstanding police officers were decorated with Police Medals for distinguished service. A presentation on the theme “Ekotai Sampriti” by distinguished artistes and celebrities was an added attraction,” she later wrote on Facebook.

Punjab

Gurdaspur: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh appealed to farmers against taking the extreme step of suicide while announcing his government’s decision to provide jobs to 50,000 youth in the first phase of the ‘Ghar Ghar Mein Naukri’ scheme. He announced launch of a recruitment campaign soon to fill all critical vacancies in government. He also vowed to make Punjab a peaceful, healthy and prosperous state — free from drugs and debt.

Singh announced a Rs 2,500-crore annual repair programme for all link roads — to build and repair 22,870 km roads across the state. He promised that each household in the state will have toilet before December 31 this year, adding that Rs 2,100 crore had been set aside to ensure complete facelift of schools besides providing requisite infrastructure.

Madhya Pradesh

Bhopal: Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said a campaign for quick disposal of undisputed revenue cases such as demarcation and partition has been launched in MP, and people will get Rs 1 lakh cash if their cases remain pending after three months. He said the cash will be recovered from officer/employee found responsible for the delay. He said MP has clocked double-digit growth in the last eight years, and that the state is expected to record 12.21 per cent growth in the ongoing fiscal, with annual per capita income of over Rs 72,000.

Goa

Panaji: CM Manohar Parrikar picked three crisis issues that confront Goa today: unemployment, garbage treatment and rising menace of drugs. He said, “Goans want white-collar jobs, everyone wants desk and clerical jobs. (But) if we have to rein in the monster of unemployment in the coming years, we will have to install dignity of labour.” On reports of drug abuse, he said, “I have instructed the police, but I believe the reason for increase in drugs is frustration. If the youth are without direction, they move in unwanted directions. And therefore employment and proper direction is important.” He also spoke on the Modi government’s Swachh Bharat Mission and urged people to help in better garbage disposal and cut down on use of plastic bags.

Remembering Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on his 20th death anniversary: 5 Bollywood songs which took inspiration from the legend,"Remembering Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on 20th death anniversary. Remembering Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on 20th death anniversary.

There are voices which acquire a deep place in our heart and soul. Then there are voices which make us connect with God. Such was the personality of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, that many still consider him the master. He is an inspiration for all those who love music and want to make a career out of it. There is no note he hasn’t touched, giving us goosebumps. And his songs are so magical that they are still alive within us irrespective of the era they belong to. Everyone is sure to have their individual favourite Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan track. And maybe that is the reason why Bollywood has over and over again used his songs in films in its original or revamped versions. On the death anniversary of the legend, we remember five times when Bollywood paid tribute to him by picking his melodies.

Mere Rashke Qamar: Originally sung by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, “Mere Rashke Qamar” is a love ballad in the form of a qawwali. The track has been recreated for Ajay Devgn’s upcoming film, Baadshaho. In the song, Ajay and Ileana D Cruz are romancing each other.

Mere Rashke Qamar:

Dulhe Ka Sehra: From the film Dhadkan, this song is still relevant and played when a bride is being sent to her in-laws after wedding. It is an emotional track and depicts moods of the bride towards her family. It is one of those rare songs which the legend sang for Bollywood himself. And we are thankful to him for doing so.

Dulhe Ka Sehra:

Tere Bin Nahin Lagda: Not only “Mere Rashke Qamar” but Ajay Devgn’s another film, Kacche Dhaage had recreated “Tere Bin Nahin Lagda”. The Bollywood version is equally loved and remembered. We are sure you still know the tune of the song. We don’t blame you, the song just sinks in.

Tere Bina Nahi Lagda:

Saanson Ki Maala: Sung by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and recreated by Kavita Krishnamurthy, “Saanson Ki Maala” was a song about separation but celebration of love. It starred Madhuri Dixit and was a part of Shah Rukh Khan’s film, Koyla, which also starred legendary actor Amrish Puri.

Saason Ki Maala:

Kiven Mukhre Ton Nazara Hatanwan: This is one of the songs which has been recreated multiple times by several singing groups. One of the version which went onto become extremely popular was by Bally Sagoo and Javed Bashir but even before this, the song made it to a Bollywood film. Remember Shah Rukh Khan and Sonali Bendre’s one and only film English Babu Desi Mem? Well, the song was recreated for that and sung by a lady.

Kiven Mukhre Ton Nazran Hatawan

While a few songs by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan made it to Bollywood in one way or the other, a lot of his other numbers have been adapted as singles by many budding and established singers. “Halka Halka Suroor”, “Piya Re” and “Allah Hoo” are among the few which have been recreated several times.

Crime Branch to probe NRI’s death in New Friends Colony,"Representational Image Representational Image

More than a month after a non-resident Indian was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his friend’s home in southeast Delhi’s New Friends Colony, the case has been transferred to the Delhi Police Crime Branch, which has questioned the man’s friends. Police said the deceased, Hemant Chawla, was a citizen of United States, and had come to Delhi on a sabbatical from his job as a financial analyst after his father passed away last year. “On July 4, Hemant’s driver dropped him off at his friend’s house, where he was later found dead,” a senior police officer said.

A case under IPC Section 302 (attempt to murder) and Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) was registered at New Friends Colony police station on July 19 after police found internal injury marks on Chawla’s neck in his post-mortem report, conducted at AIIMS.

DCP (Crime Branch) G Ramgopal Naik told The Indian Express, “We are questioning the victim’s friends and trying to gather clues. Doctors have preserved his viscera and we are waiting for reports to ascertain the cause of death.” Chawla’s family has alleged foul play in his death. “There were only three people in the house other than my brother. His friend who owns the home, his mother, and another friend. My brother was healthy when he went to meet them… His postmortem report, which I was shown but not given a copy of, says there are contusions on his neck,” alleged Shivani Ahluwalia, Chawla’s sister.

The case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by Hemant’s mother Neena Chawla. “She told police in her complaint that she was in UK at her daughter’s home when she received a call around 6 am from the driver, who informed her that Chawla was unconscious and not moving. Soon, Chawla’s friend took the phone from him and told them the same thing,” an officer said.

Pink Whale Challenge emerges as option to counter Blue Whale suicide challenge,"The Pink Whale Challenge sets out daily tasks for participants that aim to spread happiness and positivity. Photo reads “Spread the Pink Whale wherever you go. #BaleiaRosa ()” (Source: Facebook) The Pink Whale Challenge sets out daily tasks for participants that aim to spread happiness and positivity. Photo reads “Spread the Pink Whale wherever you go. #BaleiaRosa ()” (Source: Facebook)

The Pink Whale Challenge is an easily accessible challenge available online that sets out daily tasks for those who participate. But this challenge is diametrically opposite to the Blue Whale suicide challenge which has been linked to many deaths. The Pink Whale Challenge ‘encourages positive and generous acts and attempts to bring happiness in the participant’s daily life.’ The idea of the Pink Whale challenge was conceived in Brazil and the Facebook and Instagram pages where the tasks are set out already have over 3,40,000 followers. The challenge was started in April and Baleia Rosa, as it is called, has already set out 107 daily tasks for its participants.

Describing the projects aim, the administrators of the verified Facebook page Baleia Rosa (Pink Whale in Portuguese) said, “In order to prove that the internet can be used to viralize the good, the Pink Whale was born. We are not a self help group! We just believe that we are all capable of promoting love and good!”

The project is supported by the government of Sao Paulo state in Brazil Photo shows the homepage of the Baleia Rosa (Pink Whale) website that hosts the challenge.

The initiative has received favourable response from the authorities as well. The project is now aided by the Government of Sao Paulo State in Brazil. Apart from the social media platforms, the challenge can be accessed via baleiarosa.com.br and also via their free smartphone app which is available for Android and iOs devices. Though the social media pages operate in Portuguese, the website and mobile apps offer content in English, Portuguese and Spanish.

Find the Pink Whale page on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/eusoubaleiarosa/. You can also find their Instagram account at http://www.instagram.com/eusoubaleiarosa. You can follow the Pink Whale Challenge tasks on Twitter at @eusoubaleiarosa.

Daily challenges for participants on the platform encourage goodwill and boosting self confidence and happiness. Daily challenges for participants on the platform encourage goodwill and boosting self confidence and happiness.

Unlike the Blue Whale challenge, the Pink Whale’s challenges don’t encourage self harm. It includes tasks like writing how you would help someone who’s being bullied, smiling at each person that passes you for an entire day, posting on your social media pages with the lines ‘I am beautiful’, learning something new from an internet tutorial, forgiving someone, apologising to someone, talking to someone who doesn’t talk much et al.

The Pink Whale Challenge sets out daily tasks and has not limited it to the 50 day period of the notorious Blue Whale Challenge. The Pink Whale Challenge sets out daily tasks and has not limited it to the 50 day period of the notorious Blue Whale Challenge.

The Pink Whale was started by a publicist and a graphic designer in the wake of the spread of the Blue Whale challenge. Although there is no academic endorsement that it can wipe out the Blue Whale challenge or defeat the suicidal tendencies, it seems to be an attempt at handling the issue on a core psychological level.

Furthermore, the app doesn’t have the role of any curator or handler and it is completely voluntary. Users are not obliged to complete tasks and share evidence like in the Blue Whale challenge. However, if you do share photographs of your task completion, they put the photos on their website on a section called Whale Puppies that is a beautiful repository of the positive messages and pictures posted by participants.

All about the Blue Whale Challenge

The Blue Whale Challenge is a suicide challenge game that emerged on Russian social networks around 2015. The game’s creator 21-year-old Philipp Budeikin from Russian is under arrest and has confessed to creating the game and inciting people to commit suicide through the challenge.

Read: Blue Whale challenge: These are the 5 suspected cases in India

The curator would assign the players an administrator who would set out 50 tasks spread over 50 days to the participants. The tasks were self-harming in nature including carving and cutting oneself making different shapes and writing certain letters, standing on the edge of a bridge, punishing oneself and vowing to become a whale, talking to other ‘whales’, several secret tasks and eventually committing suicide.

How do players access the game?

The game was popular on VKontakte, a social media platforms in Russia, but slowly spread to different countries and on different platforms. Reports have claimed that administrators chatted with players via these social media platforms or special apps not available on the app stores. It is also available with the names A Silent House’, ‘A Sea of Whales’ and ‘Wake Me Up at 4:20 AM’. The game conditions the players over the 50-day period to believe that they are whales exploiting the popular belief that whales beach to end their lives voluntarily.

What has the government done to help the situation?

Amid reports of many deaths in India being linked to this challenge, the government has written to internet and social media majors like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Instagram and Whatsapp to intervene immediately and remove all links to the suicide game from their platforms. The letter written by Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad read: “Instances of children committing suicide while Blue Whale Challenge have been reported in India…You are hereby requested to ensure that any such link of this deadly game in its own name or similar game is immediately removed from your platform.”

It has also been taken up by Maneka Gandhi, Minister for Women and Child Development, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

What more can be done?

Counselling and sensitisation of parents, teachers and children could be the immediate step to avoid further spreading of such challenges.

Government’s support to volunteer groups could also be crucial in this time. The Pink Whale Challenge could be seen as a case study where government support to a volunteer initiative brought the programme to lakhs of people and now it is followed more in Brazil than the Blue Whale Challenge.

Official sources said yesterday’s incident at Pangong and ways to maintain peace and tranquility along the Sino-India border in Ladakh were discussed at length at the border personnel meeting (BPM). Soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) tried to enter the Indian side in two areas – Finger Four and Finger Five – twice between 6 am and 9 am yesterday. But on both the occasions their attempts were thwarted by alert Indian troops.

After Chinese troopers found their path blocked by ITBP personnel who formed a human chain, they began hurling stones, prompting a swift retaliation by Indian border guards. Personnel from both sides received minor injuries and the situation was brought under control after the customary banner drill under which both sides hold banners before stepping back to their respective positions.

Video: Lucknow Central song Teen Kabootar is a party number with a dark twist,"Lucknow Central song Teen Kabootar is an interesting party number. Lucknow Central song Teen Kabootar is an interesting party number.

Lucknow Central song Teen Kabootar was launched on August 15, Independence Day at Yerwada Central Jail. The song’s mood is simple, fun, and in Farhan Akhtar’s own words it is full of ‘matargashti’. So why do we think that it has a dark twist? It is because of the setting of the song. It is surely not on the streets of pretty locales of Europe, and is infact, set in jail. The jail’s caretaker played by Ronit Roy, comes across as the perfect, and strict warden who is against locked up criminals having fun.

That’s fine! We have Farhan Akhtar and team coming to the rescue as they croon “Ek Kabootar, Do Kabootar” and trying to ‘uncage’ the party spirit of people. This includes their strict onlooker – the jail warden. “Kyun kisi ka wait kare, aao celebrate karen” to “Ek Kabootar, Do Kabootar, Teen Kabootar, Party karne lage hai sare chath ke upar” – this song should not be taken at face value.

The film is a prison movie that documents the journey of Kishen Mohan Girhotra (Farhan Akhtar) and how he lives his time in jail as he waits for his trial. As he waits, he befriends Gayatri Kashyap (Diana Penty), an NGO worker who wants to form bands in the prison so that they can all compete. Kishen then happens to befriend four other inmates Dikkat Ansari, Victor Chattopahdyay, Purushottam Pandit and Parminder Trehan and the five of them form a band. This song is when the band discovers their love for music together and performs for their main warden.

As we watch Kishen and his inmate friends talking about pigeons partying on the terrace, we wonder if in anyway the film questions the notion of if a criminal is allowed to indulge in a hobby. Come to think of it, criminals are behind bars hoping for their rehabilitation. Right? The plot may not delve deeper than the surface, but we can sure hope that there is more to this movie than prison bands and competitions.

"Charlottesville violence: Donald Trump, again, casts blame on both sides in Virginia","“You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. (Source: Reuters) “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that left- and right-wing extremists became violent during a weekend rally by white nationalists in Virginia, reigniting a political firestorm over US race relations and his own leadership of a national crisis.

Trump, who drew sharp criticism from Republicans and Democrats for his initial response, reverted on Tuesday to his position that both sides were at fault for the violence, a day after bowing to pressure to explicitly condemn the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. Appearing angry and irritated, the president maintained that his original reaction was based on the facts he had at the time.

“You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. From there, the back and forth with reporters turned tense.

“Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch,” Trump said of the deadly protest. “There was a group on this side. You can call them the left … that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that’s the way it is.”

The violence erupted on Saturday after white nationalists converged in Charlottesville for a “Unite the Right” rally in protest of plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the US Civil War. Many of the rally participants were seen carrying firearms, sticks and shields. Some also wore helmets. Counter-protesters likewise came equipped with sticks, helmets and shields.

The two sides clashed in scattered street brawls before a car plowed into the rally opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. A 20-year-old Ohio man, James Fields, said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, was charged with murder. Two state police officers also were killed that day in the fiery crash of the helicopter they were flying in as part of crowd-control operations.

“MANY SIDES”

Addressing the melee for the first time on Saturday, Trump denounced hatred and violence “on many sides.” The comment drew sharp criticism across the political spectrum for not explicitly condemning the white nationalists whose presence in the Southern college town was widely seen as having provoked the unrest. Critics said Trump’s remarks then belied his reluctance to alienate extreme right-wing organizations, whose followers constitute a devoted segment of his political base despite his disavowal of them.

Yielding two days later to a mounting political furor over his initial response, Trump delivered a follow-up message expressly referring to the “KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups” as “repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.” Trump’s detractors dismissed his revised statements as too little too late, but his remarks newly inflamed the controversy.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke immediately applauded Trump on Twitter. “Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,” Duke wrote, referring to Black Lives Matter (BLM) and anti-facists.

Democrats seized on Trump’s latest words as evidence that Trump sees white nationalists and those protesting against them as morally equivalent. “By saying he is not taking sides, Donald Trump clearly is,” Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York, said. “When David Duke and white supremacists cheer your remarks, you’re doing it very, very wrong.”

In a similar vein, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said Trump’s characterization of the violence missed the mark. “Neo-Nazis, Klansmen and white supremacists came to Charlottesville heavily armed, spewing hatred and looking for a fight. One of them murdered a young woman in an act of domestic terrorism, and two of our finest officers were killed in a tragic accident while serving to protect this community. This was not ‘both sides,'” he said.

Administration officials, hoping to put the controversy behind them after the remarks on Monday, worried that the controversy would now last for days and potentially affect the president’s ability to made legislative and policy achievements. Asked about the White House’s next steps, one official said: “I think next steps are just to stop talking.”

FALLOUT

Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation representing 12.5 million workers, became the latest member of Trump’s advisory American Manufacturing Council to resign in protest, saying, “We cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” Trumka said. “President Trump’s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis.”

Three other members of the council – the chief executives of pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co Inc, sportswear company Under Armour Inc and computer chipmaker Intel Corp – resigned on Monday. In his remarks on Tuesday, Trump also sympathized with protesters seeking to keep Lee’s statue in place but offered no equivalent remarks for those who favored its removal.

“You had people in that group … that were there to protest the taking down of a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,” Trump said. Trump also grouped former presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, two of the nation’s founding fathers, together with Confederate leaders such as Lee, Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson, who fought to separate Southern states from the Union, noting that all were slave owners.

“Was George Washington a slave owner? Will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? … Because he was a major slave owner,” Trump said. On Tuesday, Trump explained his initial restrained response by saying: “The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts.”

In what became at times a heated exchange with reporters shouting questions, Trump said, “You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.” He said that while neo-Nazis and white nationalists “should be condemned totally,” Trump said protesters in the other group “also had trouble-makers. And you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You got a lot of bad people in the other group too.”

"BCCC orders Sony TV to shift Pehredaar Piya Ki time slot, run it with a scroll that it doesn’t promote child marriage","Pehredaar Piya Ki moved to 10 pm slot by BCCC. Pehredaar Piya Ki moved to 10 pm slot by BCCC.

Pehredaar Piya Ki has become one of the most controversial TV shows in recent times ever since it came under the eye of BCCC. In the latest announcement, BCCC has asked the broadcasting channel, Sony to move the show to the 10 pm slot from its current 8.30 pm, and even run it with a disclaimer scroll that it doesn’t promote child marriage.

PTI tweeted, “Broadcasting Content Complaints Council asks Sony to move #PehredaarPiyaKi to 10 pmslot, run with scroll it doesn’t promote child marriage.” Well, what seemed to start as personal social media posts took a completely different turn when petitions began to be filed against the show to I&B Minister Smriti Irani, and the case reached the desk of BCCC (Broadcasting Content Complaints Council). BCCI’s latest decision on the issue will probably pacify the petitioners.

A source close to Sony said, “The channel has just got the information and once they receive a notice will they decide on what to do next.”

Following the recent events, the show’s producers Shashi and Sumeet Mittal had addressed the media on Monday and had quipped, “Most of the people who are signing the petition have no clue about the show. They proudly claim they don’t watch TV. When you haven’t seen the show, how can you judge it? We have not shown anything objectionable. As traditional people ourselves, we know our boundaries. There is a sweet platonic relationship between the boy and girl, and that nowhere is against the society.”

Man held for ‘raping’ estranged wife in Bhavnagar,"A case has been registered in the matter, said the police. A case has been registered in the matter, said the police.

Police have arrested a man for allegedly abducting and raping his estranged wife in Bhavnagar after they found her at Hadambtala village in Botad on August 2. The woman’s father-in-law has also been arrested. “We have booked a case under section 376 (B) and other provisions of the IPC,” said T S Rizvi, Investigation Officer at Vallabhipur police station in Bhavnagar.

Section 376 (B) of the IPC is related to sexual intercourse with wife by husband during separation and it entails punishment of 2 to 7 years in jail. Officials at the state crime records bureau said that the provision has been rarely used. (See box)

The accused, who is in the Indian Army, married the woman three years ago. It was an arranged marriage.

“Within three months of our marriage, he started hitting me. At first, he used hands to hit me, but then he started using sticks and then whatever he could find. I would often run to my parents’ home with a black eye or a broken hand. I tried to make the marriage work for a year, but then I could not,” said the woman who had filed a case of harassment against her husband in 2016. Since then she has been living with her parents.

“On July 28, when I got down from the bus and was walking towards my office, a Wagon R came near me. My husband jumped out of the car and pulled me inside. Before I could realise what had happened, he hit me with a helmet and gagged me with a cloth. My father-in-law was driving the car. I tried to reach for my phone but could not manage,” she told The Indian Express.

“First my husband and father-in-law took me to a hut in a field. My father-in-law tied me up and went out. My husband then removed my clothes and forced himself on me twice. After that he used sticks to beat me up,” she said. According to her, she was blindfolded and taken to a flat where her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law were present. “They tied me up. My husband would keep me naked and force himself on me whenever he felt like. He took nude pictures of me and said that he would put it on the Internet if I complained to the police… I would scream in pain as he used sticks to beat me every time after raping me. My in-laws would listen to my screams and do nothing. They had told my husband to ensure that he impregnates me so that I can’t seek divorce,” she said.

According to the woman’s brother, one of her colleagues who had seen her being dragged into a car informed them about the abduction. “We told the police immediately, they told us to wait till evening. When my sister did not return home that night, we filed a complaint and an FIR was filed,” he added. Police found the woman from Hadambtala village in Botad on August 2.

“We suspected the in-laws. We got information that her father-in-law was spotted at Hadambtala village and we decided to chase him. He led us to the house where she was kept,” said Rizvi. “She was rushed to a hospital as she was bleeding in her private parts and was unable to walk,” he added. The husband and father-in-law were sent to judicial custody on Friday after they were questioned by the police for a week.

Tales from princely states: A Kashmiri Pandit and a Jodhpur resident recollect being stuck between India and Pakistan,"A N Pandita (left) and S K Rathi (right) (Express Photo) A N Pandita (left) and S K Rathi (right) (Express Photo)

The pampered Indian princes of the British Raj were perhaps the biggest liability of the politicians across the subcontinent. As the date of Independence drew near, the question over the 500-odd chiefdoms and states was the toughest one to deal with. By the late 1930s, the Congress had made clear their intention of integrating the states into the Indian union. But the process was far from being that simple. Mollycoddled by the British for decades now, and exploited by them simultaneously, for many of the princes the departure of the British was seen as the ideal moment when they could make a choice of autonomy, announcing independent statehood on the world map. Then there were others who were caught in the tussle between the newly born dominions of India and Pakistan.

However, the discretion of choice over India, Pakistan or independent statehood lay in the hands of the political elite, the affluent princes. What did that choice mean to the ordinary folks residing in these states, far removed from the high drama of nationalist discourse and very often unaware of what course their homeland’s politics was about to take?

A Kashmiri Pandit and a Jodhpur resident narrat their days of chaos as the two crucial states struggled to free itself from the tug of war between India and Pakistan.

A.N. Pandita of Kashmir: ‘We became Muslims for a few days’

Often referred to as ‘paradise on earth’ Kashmir lay in a location strategic for both Hindustan and Pakistan. With a Hindu king ruling over a predominant Muslim population, the fate of Kashmir was one of the toughest to come to terms with. A direct result of the chaos that the fight over Kashmir led to was the first Indo-Pakistan war that took place barely weeks after independence. A.N. Pandita, who was 19 at the time of the war, recollects the days when caught between the nationalist thirst of India and Pakistan, his largely peaceful childhood home had overnight turned into a space distraught with the fear of being attacked by the either of the two sides. The 89-year-old recollects:

I was born in a village called Rahama in Kashmir. It was a huge village with only seven Kashmiri Pandits residing in it. People in the village were either involved in farming or worked with the forest department. I was a free child. I loved playing with my friends, most of whom were Muslims. I loved eating arcots and would climb trees in pursuit of the same.

We were a well-fed family. But in 1941 we met with a huge tragedy. One of my brothers passed away and it was a huge setback to the family. The grief over his death resulted in my father’s illness and we moved to Baramulla city where a number of our relatives lived. We lived in district headquarters there and I finished my education there.

The early 1940s were the years of the Quit India movement. I remember when we saw Englishmen coming in from Delhi to our city, we would follow them around and doodle ‘Quit India’ in chalk behind their vehicles. We were told that the English would get scared when we would sing Vande Mataram in our school and college.

When Partition was announced, the country split into two. While we were hearing about the deaths and violence in Punjab, Kashmir was suddenly attacked by Pakistani bandits. The attacks first took place in Muzaffarabad. People from there started pouring into Baramulla. As the refugees kept coming in we moved from the city to our village in Rahama.

The next two-three days we were given refuge by a land tiller who was Muslim. I vividly remember the hours spent hiding in his house. We could hear cries of ‘Pakistan zindabad, Hindustan Murdabad’ outside.

One day, at around 4 am, we saw from the attic the Pakistani soldiers approaching the house. We were extremely scared that we would be killed. My uncle had a two-month-old daughter who was with us then. She lay in her mother’s lap and started crying at this moment. My aunt attempted to shut her up by covering her mouth with her hand, so that we do not get discovered by the men. In the process the little girl died. The following day a politician from the National Conference visited us. My father suggested to him that the best solution at this moment was to turn into Muslims. We came out and told everyone that we were Muslims. We visited a Maulvi and sang the phrase ‘la illah ila allah muhammad rasulullah’ which was considered to be the formula for converting to Islam. We learned the kalima and became Muslims for a good 10-12 days. I was also given a Muslim name- Muhammad Maqbool.

Two days later when we went back to Baramulla, the city was in a horrific state. All shops and houses were looted. Kashmiri Pandits there too had turned into Muslims. We were kept in a rehabilitation camp and were forced to sing slogans of ‘Pakistan zindabad’.

Few days later we got news of the Indian army coming in. We were all very happy on seeing the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani army soon started fleeing. However, now the Muslims were scared. They started running away and some came to our home for shelter.

Finally after all this chaos, Kashmir did accede into India. Par aaj ka Kashmir, woh Kashmir nahi raha, woh bhaichara nahi raha (But today’s Kashmir is no longer the Kashmir of the past, that brotherhood is no longer there).

Pandita moved to Delhi during the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in 1990 and currently resides Ashok Vihar with his wife, son and daughter-in-law.

Dr. S.K.Rathi of Jodhpur: ‘There were no celebrations in Nagaur’

The case of Jodhpur was far more curious. A Hindu king ruling over a majority Hindu population decided to join Pakistan at one point. An affinity towards Pakistan was based on the fact that Jodhpur shared a border with the country and that also Jinnah had tried to lure him with some special facilities. Dr S K Rathi, currently a resident of Kota, was a school boy living in Nagaur, part of the Jodhpur state, when India became independent. He recounts, often with a lot of effort, the atmosphere in his village when the British decided to leave and Jodhpur became part of India.

I spent my childhood in Nagaur. My father was a businessman and was also involved in money lending. We had two houses in Nagaur and one in Vasni which was situated a few kilometres away. During those days we had no electricity in our village, nor did we have pukka roads and proper water supply.

Vasni had a Muslim majority, while in Nagaur Hindus were in majority. I had many Muslim friends in Vasni. Muhammad Akbar was a very special friend of mine. We grew up together. We used to play gilli danda and kancha and he also taught me to ride the bicycle.

Growing up we never saw any Englishmen, but somehow knew that they ruled over India. When we were in class 8 or 9 we learnt that they were about to leave. Our teachers used to ask us to line up and raise slogans in praise of Nehru and Gandhi so we would do that. Later, we were told that the English had left and now only Indians ruled.

Only political people knew whether we would go to India or Pakistan. We were ordinary people and we did not know anything and neither did it matter to us back then. We knew that many of the Muslims from Vasni had left for Pakistan. One of our neighbours also left for Pakistan and after he went we never spoke. They were not sure if they were safe so they left. Later their houses were sold off at very cheap rates.

On August 15 when the country became independent there were no celebrations in Nagaur, neither did we get to know anything.

We saw a lot of celebration only once Jodhpur joined India. There was a huge function in school and that is how we got to know. Some political leaders had come and they distributed sweets among the students.

Independence did not really have any impact on our daily lives. Na pehle koi problem tha, na baad mein koi sudhaar aayi (neither did we have any problems before, nor did we see any improvement later).

"Maharashtra’s new Rs 1,300 crore plan to make roads pothole-free","Each such contract would involve a road length of 10 kilometres and would be valid for a two-year period. Each such contract would involve a road length of 10 kilometres and would be valid for a two-year period.

UNVEILING a new plan to fix the persistent problem of potholes across state roads, the Maharashtra government is now aiming to improve road surfaces permanently, moving away from the reactive system of pothole repairs.

While the state Public Works Department (PWD) spends crores of rupees every year to repair potholes, most resurface soon after. To resolve this problem, the government has now decided to award annual maintenance contracts for 50,000 kilometres of roads in the state.

“This is a complete shift from the sporadic repair contracts that were being awarded previously. It will enhance accountability and ensure road quality throughout the year,” said Ashish Kumar Singh, Principal Secretary, Public Works Department.

Singh said that his department had already floated tenders to award the maintenance contracts.

Each such contract would involve a road length of 10 kilometres and would be valid for a two-year period.

According to the government’s estimates, the contract would cost Rs 1,300 crore in all. But it is banking on handsome savings on the recurrent expenditure on pothole repairs, besides the economic benefits from a more dependable road infrastructure network.

For more accountability in the repair work, the government has imposed a condition that those who are awarded the maintenance contracts would have to compulsorily use mechanised methods to fix bad patches. Contractors will also be required to upload real time photos of potholes and bad patches being repaired.

Senior sources said that the earlier practice had been to award repair contracts for individual bad patches, which made monitoring the repair work challenging.

Under the new plan, the number of contracts will be fewer, making the monitoring process more manageable, one of them added.

The whole idea is to make roads pothole-free and more durable, said another.

Meanwhile, the department is in the process of awarding construction of another 10,000 kilometre of roads, totalling Rs 30,000 crore, under the hybrid annuity model.

The department has proposed to pay 40 per cent of the cost of such contracts in biannual instalments within two years of completion of the work, while the remaining payments would be made in phases over 15 years.

WPI inflation rises sharply to 1.88 per cent in July,"Fruits saw inflation at 2.71 per cent, cereals (0.63 per cent) and paddy (3.47 per cent). Fruits saw inflation at 2.71 per cent, cereals (0.63 per cent) and paddy (3.47 per cent).

Wholesale inflation rose to 1.88 per cent in July as prices of some commodities increased in the first month of Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout. Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) was 0.90 per cent in June 2017 and 0.63 per cent in July 2016.

The government data released today showed that prices of food articles went up by 2.15 per cent in July on a yearly basis. In June, the prices had contracted by 3.47 per cent. Vegetable prices which had witnessed a 21.16 per cent contraction in June, shot up by 21.95 per cent in July.

However, manufactured products saw slight fall in inflation at 2.18 per cent in July, compared to 2.27 per cent in June. In fuel and power segment, inflation witnessed a decline at 4.37 per cent in July, over 5.28 per cent in the previous month.

Apart from vegetables, the food articles which saw rise in prices include egg, meat and fish where inflation stood at 3.30 per cent. Fruits saw inflation at 2.71 per cent, cereals (0.63 per cent) and paddy (3.47 per cent).

However, potato continued to see deflation at 42.45 per cent, pulses (-)32.56 per cent and onion (-)9.50 per cent. The final print of May WPI inflation witnessed a little surge at 2.26 per cent, as compared to provisional estimates of 2.17 per cent.

A nationwide GST was implemented on July 1 which combined a plethora of central and state levies into a four tier tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent for all goods and services.

Data released last week showed that industrial output hit a four-year low and contracted 0.1 per cent in June, mainly on account of decline in manufacturing and capital goods sectors.

Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank cut policy repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low.

The RBI said it will endeavour to keep retail inflation close to 4 per cent but in the near term, there might be some uptick on account of pay commission payouts and price adjustments post GST rollout. The data for July retail inflation is due later in the day.
