Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning.

Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides.

Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability.

During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop.

These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery.

Time to take a call

Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer.

Scientists potentially narrow MH370 search area to 3 spots,"Canberra, August 16

Scientists have potentially narrowed the search area for the missing Malaysian airliner to three specific locations in the southern Indian Ocean, through new satellite and drift analysis of the 2014 crash released on Wednesday. But the Australian Transport Safety Bureau cautioned that the drift analysis by Australian science agency CSIRO is based on French satellite images of “probably man-made” floating objects without evidence that they were from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. But the locations could provide potential starting points to search within a 25,000-square-kilometre (9,700-square-mile) expanse identified by a panel of experts in November as the most likely resting place of the Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew on board. That expanse adjoins the original search zone far southwest of Australia that was identified through satellite analysis of the final hours of the flight that apparently ended when the plane ran out of fuel. Malaysia, China and Australia agreed to suspend the deep-sea sonar search in January after 120,000 square kilometres (46,000 square miles) of seabed were combed without finding any trace of Flight 370. The new analysis is based on French military satellite images gathered on March 23, 2014, two weeks after Flight 370 mysteriously veered far off course during a flight by Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing and were taken near the original underwater search zone. The Australian bureau took over the search for Flight 370 from Malaysia a week later. Satellite experts at Geoscience Australia were not asked to analyse the images until March this year. The experts concluded that a dozen objects appeared to be man-made. The CSIRO then investigated where the objects might have originated before drifting for two weeks. The CSIRO identified three potential crash sites, 35.6 degrees S, 92.8 degrees E; 34.7 degrees S, 92.6 degrees E and 35.3 degrees S, 91.8 degrees E. “So that is a way of potentially narrowing down the search area with the very important caveat that, of course, we can’t be totally sure that those objects seen in the images are actual pieces of plane,” CSIRO oceanographer David Griffin said. “This might be a really good clue. It might be a red herring. But if you are going to search, then you’d be silly to ignore this potential clue,” he added. The Australian bureau’s Chief Commissioner Greg Hood said in a statement: “Clearly we must be cautious” of the lack a definite link to Flight 370. Malaysia, China and Australia have decided that the search will remain suspended unless new evidence pinpoints the wreckage’s whereabouts. But seabed exploration company Ocean Infinity, based in Houston, Texas, said last week it had offered to launch a private search for the Malaysian-registered airliner. Voice370, a support group for victim’s families, said under the terms of the offer made to Malaysia in April, Ocean Infinity “would like to be paid a reward if and only if it finds the main debris field”. They urge Malaysia to accept the offer. AP"

Gurdaspur, August 15

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh laced his Independence Day speech with heavy poll sops ahead of the by-election to the Gurdaspur parliamentary seat.

The CM, after unfurling the national flag at the government college stadium, delivered a 20-minute speech in which he doled out numerous bounties for people of Batala, Gurdaspur, Dinanagar, Pathankot, Fatehgarh Churian, Dera Baba Nanak and Dhariwal — the main towns that comprise the Lok Sabha seat.

After speaking about his government’s intentions of ridding the state of the scourge of drugs and to provide employment to each household, Amarinder launched himself full throttle ahead into giving a massive infrastructure fillip to voters of the area.

“Since I am in Gurdaspur it will only be appropriate on my part to give you some important things,” said Amarinder, who became the first CM to unfurl the tricolour in the district headquarters of Gurdaspur in 70 years.

Much to the delight of the sardine packed stadium, Amarinder announced the setting up of a Sainik School in this district. He, however, refused to divulge the exact location for building the venture. He also spoke of giving a Rs 2000 crore tourism boost but he neither named the exact venture nor disclosed the place where it would be established.

“Cola manufacturer — PEPSI — has agreed to set up a plant in Pathankot. It will prove to be a big boost to the economy and will also provide hundreds of employment opportunities. The plant will solve the unemployment problem of the area to some extent,” he said.

He said his government had sanctioned a grant of Rs 118 crore to improve the school infrastructure in the district. “Rs 40 crore has also be sanctioned to upgrade the health facilities in Gurdaspur town while Rs 84 crore has been given to the rural development ministry to build toilets in the constituency,” he said.

“I have learnt that for the last few years a technical problem had meant that large parts of Gurdaspur town used to go without power for long periods of time. From today, there will be no electricity problem in the city. I have instructed power board officials to ensure that not even a single colony of Gurdaspur remains without power,” he said much to the applause of the crowd.

The CM also announced a degree college for the constituency to be constructed at Kalanaur where a massive chunk of Panchayat land is lying vacant. This was a long pending demand of the residents and had even been made an election promise by Dera Baba Nanak sitting Congress MLA S S Randhawa. Kalanaur falls in the Dera Baba Nanak assembly seat.

He also announced a grant of Rs 7.5 crore for improving water supply and sanitation facilities in Fatehgarh Churian.

“Dinanagar will soon be upgraded to the status of a sub-divisional town,” said Amarinder.

In a major embarrassment to district administration, the national flag was hoisted upside down during a sub-division level Independence Day function at Shaheed Bhagat Singh college in Kotkapura.

Tehsildar Ashok Kumar unfurled this flag at sub division level function in a government college. An ASI of Punjab police, Sukhdev Singh has been placed under suspension for negligence.

The ASI was assigned the job of installing the national flag in the college ground to be unfurled by the chief guest.

An Independence Day parade vehicle developed a snag as smoke started billowing out from engine when local tehsildar along with SP was about to inspect the Guard of Honour in Malout town today.

The vehicle was immediately replaced. Meanwhile, a young girl, part of a band, fell unconscious."
Govt brings knee implants under price ambit; cuts MRP sharply,"New Delhi, August 16

After cardiac stents, the government on Wednesday fixed a price range for knee implants from Rs 54,000 to Rs 1.14 lakh, nearly 70 per cent lower than most surgeries currently cost.

With private hospitals reportedly charging exorbitant rates, the government capped the maximum retail price of the keen implants, a move that will save patients an estimated Rs 1,500 crore annually.

""Government will not remain a mute spectator and will not allow this illegal and unethical profiteering,"" Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Ananth Kumar told a news briefing.

The price in case of specialised implants for cancer and tumour has been sharply cut to Rs 1,13,950 from the current prices of Rs 4-9 lakh.

There are 1.5 crore to 2 crore patients who require knee implants surgery. Every year 1.2 lakh to 1.5 lakh knee surgeries takes place in India, according to the government.

It is estimated by World Health Organisation (WHO) that by 2020, osteoarthritis is going to be the fourth largest cause of immobility in globally, Kumar informed.

The government had in February slashed the maximum price of life-saving heart stents implants by up to 85 per cent by capping them at Rs 7,260 for bare metal ones and Rs 29,600 for drug eluting variety.

Earlier, the average maximum retail price (MRP) for BMS was Rs 45,000 and for DES, it was Rs 1.21 lakh.

Kumar said today's decision comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced from the Red Fort on the Independence Day that prices of knee surgery would be brought down.

Earlier this month, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority had stated that the average trade margin on orthopaedic knee implants were found to be as high as 313 per cent.

""After cardiac stents, we have now decided to bring all kinds of knee implants under price control. In our country 1.5 to 2 crore people suffer from knee problems, who need health assistance,"" Kumar said.

""The government will not be a mute spectator to illegal and unethical profiteering,"" he added.

""Today across the country, private hospitals have increased prices of knee implant surgeries. They are indulging in unethical profiteering. To stop this and give relief to patients, we have taken this decision,"" he said.

The decision has been taken keeping people's interest and health security of the nation into consideration, Kumar said.

The minister warned of stringent action against hospitals, importers, retailers if they charged in excess of the MRP saying that the government would recover excess profit from such knee implants with 18 per cent interest and may also cancel licences of hospitals.

Asked whether industry would be able to recover their costs under the new prices, the minister said: ""The MRP has been fixed after taking into account the landed cost and there will be comfortable margins for the industry.""

Reacting to the development, medical device industry body MTaI said MTaI is reviewing the order from NPPA.

Under the new price regime, the MRP of most widely used complete knee implant (Cobalt-Chromium) has been fixed at Rs 54,720 plus GST, a reduction of 65 per cent from earlier average MRP of Rs 1,58,324. This particular type of knee implant has around 80 per cent market share.

The new MRP of special metal titanium and oxidised zirconium has been fixed at Rs 76,600 plus GST, down 69 per cent from an average rate of Rs 2,49,251 earlier.

High flexibility implant will now cost Rs 56,490 plus GST, down 69 per cent from average MRP of Rs 1,81,728 earlier.

Special metal and high flexibility knee implants account for another 17 per cent of the market.

Revision implants for second surgery, which patients normally need after 10 years, will now cost Rs 1,13,950 plus, lower by 59 per cent from average MRP of Rs 2,76,869.

Lastly, the MRP of specialised implants for cancer and tumour has been fixed at Rs 1,13,950 which used to be priced around Rs 4-9 lakh. — PTI"
"US designates Hizbul Mujahideen as 'terrorist group', slaps sanctions","Washington, August 16

The designation, which slaps a series of US sanctions on the outfit, came against the backdrop of upsurge in the terror activities of the militant group in Kashmir in recent months.

""These designations seek to deny Hizbul Mujahideen the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks,"" the State Department said in a statement.

Among other consequences, all of Hizbul Mujahideen's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.

The US decision marks a severe blow to Pakistan which has been projecting the militant group as a voice of Kashmiri people.

Pakistan's powerful Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif have repeatedly praised the militant group's slain commander Burhan Wani who was killed in July last year in an encounter in Kashmir.

Formed in 1989, Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Kashmir.

Hizbul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

The State Department said terrorism designations expose and isolate organisations and individuals, and deny them access to the US financial system. Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of US agencies and other governments, it said. — PTI"
Kapil Mishra mocks Kejriwal on birthday by singing 'AK teri kursi gol’,"New Delhi, August 16

Sacked Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra on Wednesday posted a video on Youtube and shared it on twitter, in which he mocks Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by singing ‘AK teri kursi gol’.

Kejriwal who turned 49 today, was mocked by the disgruntled AAP leader who posted “Birthday surprise for you @arvindkejriwal ... Soon all Delhi will sing this for you ..Enjoy!!! (sic),” on twitter.

Birthday surprise for you @arvindkejriwal ... Soon all Delhi will sing this for you ..Enjoy!!! #AKतेरीकुर्सीगोलhttps://t.co/XEZZE2KKzB — Kapil Mishra (@KapilMishraAAP) August 16, 2017

The song is another parody version of the popular Marathi folk song ‘Sonu tula mazyawar bharosa naay ka’ (Sonu, don’t you trust me) which went viral after RJ Malishka of Mumbai sang one mocking the BMC.

Kapil Mishra also put up banners on different flyovers across the national capital, calling Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal “corrupt” and urging people to join his campaign against the AAP leader.

“Hundred days of surgical strike against Kejriwal’s corruption. Now it’s clear that Kejriwal is corrupt,” read the banners, hanging down the flyovers for passersby to read.

The banners had ‘India Against Corruption’ written on the left corner and a contact number at the bottom. “To join give miss call on 78630 37300.”

“We have completed 100 days of surgical strike against corrupt Kejriwal. Today, ‘India Against Corruption’ is doing a banner campaign across the city,” Mishra said on Wednesday.

The sacked minister said the banners were put up at major flyovers, including Azadpur, ITO, Wazirabad, Peeragarhi and Dwaraka.

Mishra took to Twitter to post photos of the banners in different parts of the city.

Mishra was on May 6 sacked by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a minister in the Delhi government, citing poor performance.

A day later, the sacked AAP leader made allegations of corruption against Kejriwal and Delhi Minister Satyendar Jain. Mishra was suspended from the party on May 8.

Mishra has since been protesting and levelling allegations of corruption against Kejriwal and Jain. Agencies"
The Tribune: Movie Reviews,"Nonika Singh

How one feared that this would be no more than an audiovisual requiem for Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan! Surely, Toilet Ek Prem Katha does more to the cause than the television commercial featuring Vidya Balan.

But the film that brings out the problem of open defecation out in the open is much more than a promotional advert.

Yes, as the subtitle says, it’s very much a love story inspired by true events. Set in a small town-like-village in UP where men ride motorbikes, wear fake Rayban glasses, are kicking and alive on Facebook, but have orthodox, almost archaic, views when it comes to making a toilet in their homes/villages.

But before the film’s real mission can unfurl, there is bitter-sweet love story of Shekhar (Akshay Kumar) and Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar). He falls for her and even though Jaya is cut from a different cloth, what makes her reciprocate his feelings is his earnestness.

Trust Akshay to infuse sincerity and dignity to a character that could well be a caricature. Far removed from our urban sensibilities and far different from the superstar that he is, Akshay makes you care for this reel person Shekhar.

Indeed, it’s not easy to pass off an actor pushing 50 as a lover boy. So he is shown as a rather mature 36-year-old man whose ‘manglik’ status demands a marriage to a buffalo and a wife with two thumbs, a la Hrithik Roshan.

But the real villain in this love story “har love story mein villain toh hona chaaheye” is a genuine problem that plagues a vast majority of India. Expectedly, love follows a different route and tails a husband’s resolve to first find and then make a toilet for his wife.

But before you dismiss the film as a government mouthpiece on its most publicized programme, well it actually exposes a scam and informs how thousands of crores have been siphoned off in the name of bringing toilets to rural India. Of course, the Prime Minister (no names please) gets a clean chit, rather an emphatic pat on the back and there is even a reference to ‘notebandi’ in glowing terms.

Amidst all this, as the couple’s story threatens to turn into a half-baked revolution, their love shines and sparkles. Bhumi, who has walked the simple rustic path in her first film as well, comes out a ‘toper’ once more. With a desi accent in place, a woman with a heart and a resolve of steel, she is both believable and relatable. Even though modern urban India may not be able to fully comprehend the seriousness of the issue, both Akshay and Bhumi make you feel for them.

Besides, despite the gravity of the problem at hand, the first half packs mirth. With amusing dialogues in tow and a refreshing cameo by Divyendu Sharma as Akshay’s younger brother, the plot gets rolling.

Sure enough a film, that too cause-driven, can’t be without few sermon-laced melodramatic moments and second half does come riding with many in abundance. At more than one point the message becomes louder than the film’s entertainment value.

Still the director does attempt the balancing act and navigates the film through its bumps to finally arrive at the expected finale. But as they say, “all is well that ends well” moreso when the intention too is right from the beginning. If you can ignore the motive to be on the right side of powers that be, the film does power a real cause and brings some genuine emotions on the table."

New Delhi, August 14

Ground-to-air security has been tightened in and around the national Capital, including the historic Red Fort from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on the 71st Independence Day tomorrow.

All the vehicles entering from neighbouring states are being checked thoroughly in the presence of heavy security on borders.

Close to 70,000 personnel will be guarding the national Capital owing to the celebrations, a senior police officer said.

About 9,100 personnel have been deployed in and around the historic Mughal fort which will see the presence of senior ministers, top bureaucrats, foreign dignitaries and common people during the PM's address.

Two dozen Parakram Vans manned by quick reaction teams of NSG-trained commandos have been stationed in areas with high footfall to thwart any attempt by terror groups to disrupt peace. As many as 11 such vans have been deployed in the area around the Red Fort.

""There will be multi-tier security in place. The security audit of the residents, including tenants has been completed. The area is being monitored by CCTV cameras and there will be multi-tier security checks in place for people coming to the area,"" the officer said.

At the Red Fort, a special team of NSG snipers and commandos will form the inner layers of the security cordon while anti-aircraft guns have been deployed to thwart any aerial intrusion by objects like drones and projectiles, he said.

The police have already prohibited aerial activities, including para-gliding, flying UAVs and hot air balloons, across the city.

Besides, the police are surveying the areas in the vicinity of the Red Fort and have collected details of over 9,000 people residing there. The buildings facing the Red Fort will be secured by police and paramilitary personnel.

Security along the route to be taken by the Prime Minister's cavalcade from his official residence to the Red Fort will be monitored with the help of hundreds of CCTV cameras.

Special ""spotters"" of the police and paramilitary will keep an eye on parking areas. Over 60 sniffer dogs of paramilitary forces and the police will also be part of the extensive security deployment.

Security around prominent temples like the Iskcon temple, Lakshmi Narayan temple and the Gouri Shankar temple has been ramped up since large congregations of devotees are expected on Janmashtami festival, the birthday of Lord Krishna.

According to a statement by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), train services will run as usual. However, stations like Lal Quila, Jama Masjid, Delhi Gate and ITO will have restricted entry and exit during the ceremony owing to security considerations. Parking will not be available at the stations till 2 pm tomorrow in view of the security measures, a spokesperson for the DMRC said."

A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra asked the panel to supervisory panel to give its report in three months and fixed November 28 for further hearing.

Justice Misra, who did not disclose the names of two former Supreme Court judges to be on the panel, said he would add their names to the former order.

The Bench also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on another petition filed by victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots from Kanpur demanding an SIT probe into the murders of more than 125 people.

It asked petitioner's counsel Prasoon Kumar to hand over a copy of the petition to Uttar Pradesh Additional Advocate General Aishwarya Bhati and posted the matter for hearing on September 21.

Two years after the Narendra Modi government set up an SIT to re-investigate serious anti-Sikh riots cases of 1984 that had been closed, the SIT has managed to file chargesheets only in very small number of cases taken up for further probe.

Almost 3,000 people were killed, most of them in Delhi, in the anti-Sikh riots that broke out following the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984.

Senior counsel Arvind Datar and HS Phoolka, who represented petitioner Gurnad Singh, told the Bench that only nine cases were going on. They demanded that the trial in these cases should be conducted on a day-to-day basis.

The Bench asked them to show its earlier order in this regard to the trial court.

The order came after Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an update on the cases being re-investigated by SIT.

Earlier, the top court had summoned the files of the cases closed by the SIT. The Centre had submitted photo copies of the files of these cases in a sealed cover.

On Wednesday, the Bench asked its Registry to hand over the files to the supervisory panel to start its work. It also asked the government to provide secretarial support to the panel."

A family of Lalton Kalan village murdered one of its members and tried to pass it off as suicide. According to the police, the accused misled the police by stating that the deceased committed suicide because of a quarrel he had with his neighbours last month.

The police said Racchpal Singh of Lalton Kalan village had lodged a complaint with them that he had been beaten by his neighbours in July. On August 5, Racchpal’s brother Baldev Singh told the police that his brother had committed suicide because of mental agony he had been suffering after a quarrel with his neighbours and had even left a suicide note. A case of abetment of suicide against his neighbours Vicky, Tarni and others was registered.

The ADCP Zone-3, Surendra Lamba, said the postmortem report suggested it was a murder. Further investigation was carried out and it came to light that Racchpal used to torment the members of his family, including mother Manjit Kaur, brother Baldev Singh and wife Kiranpal Kaur after getting drunk. The three strangled him with rope and told the police that he had committed suicide.

The police have registered a case against the accused under Section 202 and 34 (committing crime with common intention) of the IPC against the accused."
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

As the memory of those horrible days and years fades away, we are itching to reopen some of the settled questions about our collective existence. Perhaps after seventy years it is time, once again, to revisit those blood-stained days and recall Partition’s sobering lessons…

Harish Khare

With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

Admittedly, the British decision to grant India independence was principally driven by the simple fact that the four-year-long World War II had totally exhausted the imperial will to rule; in fact, the British desire to hold on to India had already been tested morally and ethically by the Indian National Congress, which under the Mahatma’s leadership had waged a unique peaceful freedom struggle. The British middle classes, with their pretensions to liberal values, had no answer to the Mahatma’s saintly leadership. The Union Jack had to be lowered from Red Fort, sooner than later.

But by the time the British came to the conclusion that they could no longer stay in India, they had already instigated mischief among the Indian leadership. The colonial rulers had cynically worked on the Indian society’s religious fault lines, encouraged and cultivated sectarian agendas which ultimately coalesced into the demand for a separate nation.

The Muslim League, under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had already legitimised use of violence in pursuit of its demands. The League’s call for ‘Direct Action’ was an invitation to chaos and the mobs. Once a society develops a taste for violence, its leaders are rarely able to calibrate and control the streets. By the time August 15, 1947, came the Muslim League’s leadership skills were already over-extended even in what came to be known as East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In India, the Congress leadership was barely able to push the mobs back.

Still, a monumental tragedy was destined to take place. The sheer scale of the number of Hindus and Sikhs, who found themselves forced to migrate out to India and of the Muslims in India who had to leave for Pakistan, was maddeningly benumbing. Grand statistics simply cannot convey the trauma and the tragedy that engulfed this part of the world soon after August 1947.

A sympathetic American reporter and an eye-witness described the post-Partition days as “one of the great convulsions of modern history.” On December 12, 1947, he tried to convey the nature of disaster that overtook the two nascent nations: “Consider what has happened. In an orgy of religious-communal madness, some 10 million citizens of the north-western provinces had been routed from their homes. An unknown total, probably between 2,00,000 and 5,00,000 (compared to 2,95,000 American war-dead in World War II), had been put to sword, machine-gunned, or roasted alive. The splintered Punjab administrations were quickly swamped and there even appeared danger that the infant central governments of India and Pakistan Dominions might succumb.” Phillips Talbot (An American Witness to India’s Partition).

The frenzy in the East was no less violent, no less gory, no less bloody than it was in the West. The Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs joyfully discovered their capacity for inflicting violence and death on their erstwhile neighbours as well as total strangers. The massacres, the mayhem and the madness outpaced humanity and all known civic-minded virtues; the trauma and tragedy touched nearly every home, every life. No one was unaffected; no one could remain emotionally unmolested by this continental turbulence.

After a few months the mobs could be rolled back and blood could be washed off the streets, but the memory of Partition-centric violence was now etched on the soul of an entire generation on both sides. The two successive states had entrenched habits and protocols of acrimony and suspicion and political leaders and sectarian interests saw to it that India and Pakistan would not settle down to a peaceful co-existence.

The raw memories of Partition also impacted on how the two states went about the business of creating an internal political order. Once Jinnah was gone, Pakistan hastily abandoned his ideas of an inclusive society and nation. In India, the Mahatma was assassinated. The murder was planned by those who wanted to make India a Hindu State and they thought the Old Man was an obstacle. Ironically, the assassination settled, once for all, how India would grant equal protection and equal citizenship to all its minorities.

Perhaps some in India would argue that Partition’s unfinished agenda still remains unattended. May be, after 70 years, we should simply revisit those horrible, horrible days of chaos and disorder before we embark on another self-defeating journey…"
Tainted Sreesanth takes part in exhibition match,"Kochi, August 15

Cricketer S Sreesanth, who faced allegations of spot-fixing before being exonerated by the Kerala High Court, on Tuesday played an unsanctioned exhibition match involving members of Malayalam film industry.

The Kerala High Court had recently ordered BCCI to lift the life ban imposed on him but the Board has decided to appeal to a larger Bench of the Court.

He unfurled the national flag and was presented with a bouquet before the match.

Sreesanth, who looked distinctly unfit, batted well against the amateur attack.

“I am really happy that I am back and I am beginning my return from the same ground where it all began. Now from here, I want to reach Thiruvananthapuram and from there upwards and back to the Indian team,” said Sreesanth, though it looks very difficult at this point of time.

Sreesanth has played in 27 Tests taking 87 wickets. He also has 75 victims from 53 One-Day Internationals and seven wickets from 10 T20 Internationals. — PTI"
2 get jail in impersonation case,"EXAM FOR RECRUITMENT OF CONDUCTORS

Chandigarh, August 14

Two youths were today sentenced to three years in jail by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in a case of impersonation during a written examination conducted for the recruitment of conductors. CJM Akshdeep Mahajan also imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 each on the duo. However, the sentence of the accused was suspended for a month for further appeal after they filed an application in this regard. According to the CBI case registered on December 3, 2010, under Sections 420, 419 and 120-B, the CTU had conducted a written examination for the recruitment of 127 conductors on December 3, 2010, at various centres in Chandigarh through Panjab University by way of outsourcing. It was stated in the FIR that Newton Kumar appeared for the examination in place of Pawan Kumar. The two were arrested following a complaint in which several other such dummy candidates had appeared. The CBI had arrested them along with the other accused. However, in the case of Newton and Pawan, both were convicted and sentenced. — TNS"

Busting ATM gang was police head’s biggest feat

Having recently hit headlines twice, Kapurthala SSP Sandeep Sharma has made it to the final list of the President Medal awardees for this year.

Sharma recently came in limelight in regard to the arrest of a three-member gang that had committed 34 ATM loots across the region in Punjab, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The gang had looted a huge amount of Rs 3.24 crore and had been indulging in this crime since 2003. It was on his recommendation that CIA inspector Inderjit Singh, who was held by the STF, had been dismissed.

The SSP, however, counts his success on his work done in the past three-four years. “When I was DCP in Ludhiana, I had managed to arrest members of five gangs, including supari killers. Gold bricks too were recovered from this gang,” he said, adding that it was a matter of great satisfaction for him for having been selected for this coveted award."
Two cops of Punjab Police win medals at WPFG games in USA,"Chandigarh, August 16

Two cops of Punjab Police have won six medals in the ongoing World Police and Fire Games (WPFG) at Los Angeles, USA.

Olympian and ace shooter Avneet Sidhu clinched one gold, one silver and two bronze medals in different rifle shooting competitions, said a release issued by Punjab Government.

Sidhu is posted as Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab.

Assistant Inspector General in Punjab Police Ashish Kapoor won gold medals by trouncing his opponents in both singles and doubles titles, release said.

Ashish has been All India Police champion in tennis singles events for the last 15 years.

The WPEG games started from August 7 and would continue till August 17.

These games are held after every two years in which officers or officials from police and fire departments from all over the world compete in the different events.

Over 12,000 participants from across the world participated in the sports and fire fighting events during this year.

Sidhu had won one gold and one silver medal in 18th Commonwealth Games 2006 held at Melbourne (Australia) and bronze medal in 15th Asian Games-2006 at Doha (Qatar).

Jammu airport’s modernised terminal building to open on Thursday,"Jammu, August 16

The Jammu Airport’s upgraded and newly expanded state-of-the-art terminal building will open on Thursday, senior officials said. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and Union Minister for Civil Aviation P Ashok Gajapathi Raju will inaugurate the new building in the presence of Union ministers of state Jitendra Singh and Jayant Sinha. “The Jammu Airport is set to offer a world-class experience to passengers with an expanded and modernised terminal,” Jammu Divisional Commissioner Mandeep Bhandari said. Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh and state Assembly Speaker Kavinder Gupta will also be present at the opening. Bhandari said all arrangements relating to security, traffic management, including alternative traffic routes, and other logistics, had been taken care of. Police and other administration officers had been directed to maintain the highest levels of coordination, he added. Director Airports Authority of India (AAI) DK Gautam said the departure hall on the ground floor of the Rs 80-crore project was ready. “It will be open to passengers from Thursday,” Gautam said. The modification of an operationally busy airport such as the one in Jammu was a “challenging task”, he said. He said it was a “major achievement” for AAI that the expansion work in an airport considered “hypersensitive” because of security restrictions and faced with space constraints was carried out with any flight disruptions and with the minimum inconvenience to passengers. “Three aerobridges are also expected to be delivered by the end of September and will be commissioned by mid-November,” he added. A tensile fabric canopy from airport ticketing counters to the exit gate was almost ready and would protect passengers from extreme weather conditions, he said. PTI"

"The Tribune, Business news","KOLKATA: The estimated Rs 5,500 crore capital good leasing sector growing at 15-20 per cent may get tapered due to high Goods and Services Tax (GST) along with few other issues.

Kolkata, August 16

The estimated Rs 5,500 crore capital good leasing sector growing at 15-20 per cent may get tapered due to high Goods and Services Tax (GST) along with few other issues.

“The GST rate of 28 per cent is high for the leasing industry when compared to the earlier five to 15 per cent tax burden. Higher GST rates lead to requirement of higher working capital at any point of time. This results in increasing the cost of leasing an equipment,” Finance Industry Development Council director general Mahesh Thakkar told PTI.

“The government should actively consider not bracketing the capital goods in the same GST bracket as luxury goods goods. A lower GST rate will help increasing share of leasing in gross capital formation,” he said.

The share of leasing in gross domestic capital formation in India is less than 2 per cent whereas the global average is 10 per cent, he said.

The same could also create hurdles for the foreign companies in India since they believe that leasing is the most preferred method of owing assets for operation, an NBFC official said.

Apart from GST rates, there are other issues like input tax credit, penal interest/charges for delayed remittance of EMI and sale of repossessed assets which needs to be corrected.

“Till now there is no response from the government on our representation,” he said.

Both pointed out that the issue would have a severe impact on capital-starved SME players who would face major hardship due to this.

Construction equipment, wagons, heavy machinery, car leasing among others are expected to face hurdles in new regime.

Leasing in India is just 3 per cent of global volumes and if taxation issues were not addressed, this would effectively be a death blow to leasing even before it made a comeback in India, an equipment company official said. PTI"

Exports to Nepal: Refund of IGST permissible,"TAX ADVICE

SC Vasudeva

The goods and services can be exported either on payment of IGST which can be claimed as refund after the goods have been exported, or under bond or Letter of Understanding (LUT) without payment of IGST.

In case of goods and services exported under bond or LUT, the exporter can claim refund of accumulated ITC on account of exports.

In case of goods, the shipping bill is the only document required to be filed with the Customs for making exports. Requirement of filing ARE 1/ARE 2 has been done away with.

The supplies made for export are to be made under self-sealing and self-certification without any intervention of the departmental officer.

The shipping bill filed with the Customs is treated as an application for refund of IGST and shall be deemed to have been filed after submission of export general manifest and furnishing of a valid return in Form GSTR-3 by the applicant.

n Export of goods to Nepal or Bhutan fulfils the condition of GST Law regarding taking goods out of India. Hence, export of goods to Nepal or Bhutan will be treated as zero rated and consequently will also qualify for all the benefits available to zero rated supplies under the GST regime. However, the definition of ‘export of services’ in the GST Law requires that the payment for such services should have been received by the supplier of services in convertible foreign exchange.

Earlier when GST was not implemented, there was no VAT/other tax applicable when we used to sell our goods to Nepal. But after July 1 with the GST implementation, what is the applicability of taxes? Is IGST applicable on goods sold to Nepal? Is benefit of Para No. 2.52 (a) of FTP (2015-2020) available? If we charge IGST on goods sold in Nepal, is the refund for that IGST available?

Sikh-American truck drivers urge Trump to delay ELD rule,"Washington, August 16

A group representing the Sikh-American truck drivers has urged US President Donald Trump to delay the enforcement of a regulation which mandates them to install expensive logging devices on their vehicles. The new regulation, to be effective from December 18, will require almost all commercial trucks, unless a truck is in an exempted class, to buy and operate an Electronic Logging Device (ELD) to record the hours they are on and off duty. An ELD synchronises with a vehicle engine to automatically record driving time, for more accurate hours of service recording. Industry reports say a wide range of prices exist for different versions of the technology, running from USD 165 to USD 832 annually, the most widely used being USD 495 a truck. The Sikhs Political Action Committee said the new rules carried a price tag of USD 2 billion and are “not adequately developed for reliability” under mandatory conditions. “Please save the livelihood of small businesses and truck drivers from the mandate of the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) rule,” Gurinder Singh Khalsa, chairman of the PAC, said. Khalsa said the federal bureaucracy seemed bogged down to think that more regulations would solve problems on highways. “In fact, the ELDs are counterproductive and do nothing to improve highway safety,” he said in a letter to Trump on August 14, urging him to delay its implementation “until reasonable solutions can be worked out”, according to a press release by the group. A large number of truck drivers in the US are of Sikh origin and many of them work in small business enterprises in the trucking industry. PTI"
Modi govt’s J&K policy has created space for Pak to misbehave: Rahul,"Bengaluru, August 16

In a scathing attack on the Narendra Modi government’s Jammu and Kashmir policy, Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday alleged that it has created a space in the troubled state for Pakistan to ‘misbehave’.

His tirade at a Congress rally here comes a day after Modi, in his Independence Day address, reached out to Kashmiris, saying abuses and bullets would not resolve their problems but embracing them would.

“He (Modi) has created an environment in Jammu and Kashmir of hatred and anger, and the only people who benefit from violence and hatred are the Pakistanis,” Gandhi said.

Claiming that he had worked on the J-K issue with Manmohan Singh, who was the prime minister, and leaders like P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh ‘silently’ without any “drama or tamasha”, he said their effort of 10 years had been “destroyed by Modi in one month”.

“I’m telling you this because Narendra Modi’s policy has created a space in Jammu and Kashmir for Pakistanis to misbehave,” the Congress vice-president added.

Gandhi was here to inaugurate Indira Canteen, the Karnataka Government’s subsidised food outlets that will provide breakfast at Rs 5 and lunch and dinner at Rs 10 per plate.

He said during the UPA rule at the Centre, the government had done enough to build peace in J&K.

When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee came to power, the state was burning, but “we worked for ten years to bring peace to Kashmir. We held panchayat elections..., we created jobs...,” he said.

Criticising the Modi government on the foreign policy front, Gandhi accused it of alienating friendly countries, including Nepal and Russia.

“When we were in government, all the neighbouring countries other than Pakistan and China, were favourable to us. One by one Narendra Modiji has alienated them. For the first time in history, Russia is selling weapons to Pakistan,” he said.

“He has alienated every single neighbouring country including Nepal. He has allowed China to enter India and alienated Russia. That is the reality of what is going on today,” Gandhi said.

On the Doklam standoff with China, Gandhi said Bhutan has been a good friend of India which has given a commitment to the Himalayan nation to protect its people.

“Bhutan is a very good friend of India. Bhutan has stood for India from the days we got our Independence. India has signed a treaty with Bhutan. We have promised that we will protect Bhutan. This is the commitment of the people of India to people of Bhutan,” he said.

Flaying the Independence Day address of Modi, he said the prime minister was silent on his promise of creating two crore jobs for young people every year.

Gandhi also hit out at Modi over the Gorakhpur incident where over 70 children have died at the BRD Medical College since August 7.

“The prime minister did not tell you that more than 90 newborn babies died in Gorakhpur (in Uttar Pradesh) because of negligence by the health department. He did not tell you that a delay in approving the health budget prevented purchase of oxygen cylinders,” he said.

Gandhi alleged Modi wanted an India where the poor were left to die in government hospitals.

He claimed the prime minister was running out of ideas and hence, his Independence Day speeches were becoming shorter every year.

“Last year, he gave the longest speech. This year (he gave a speech for) 45 minutes. Next year, (it will be) 15 minutes. In the coming years, it will reduce to five minutes because he is running out of what things to say,” he added. — PTI"
Sleep tied to Type 2 diabetes risk in children,"Washington, August 16

Children who get more sleep are at a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, a study published in a US journal has said. For adults, getting too much or not enough sleep both have been linked with adiposity and Type 2 diabetes, Xinhua news agency cited the study published on Tuesday as saying. In children, more sleep has been tied to lower levels of obesity, but research about Type 2 diabetes risk factors has been scarce, according to The Journal of Paediatrics. To explore possible connections, researchers analysed the body measurements, blood sample results and questionnaire data from 4,525 children of multi-ethnic descent, aged 9-10 years in England. They found that children who slept longer had lower body weight and lower levels of fat mass. Sleep duration was “also inversely related to insulin, insulin resistance and blood glucose”, they said. “These findings suggest increasing sleep duration could offer a simple approach to reducing levels of body fat and Type 2 diabetes risk from early life,” Professor Christopher Owen, who led the research at St George’s, University of London, said in a statement. “Potential benefits associated with increased sleep in childhood may have implications for health in adulthood,” Owen said. The researchers did not find an association between sleep duration and cardiovascular risk factors, including blood lipids and blood pressure. This lack suggests “sleep duration does not alter other cardiovascular risk in early life, other than by increased obesity and metabolic risks which, if sustained or accentuated, take time to accelerate cardiovascular risks”, the researchers wrote.

Bharat Ka Rahne Wala Hoon...,"This Independence Day, thespian Manoj Kumar talks about the nation, its progress and the way ahead

Mona

As India gears up to celebrate its 70th Independence Day, popular actor-director Manoj Kumar, who has had the sobriquet of ‘Bharat Kumar’, is a proud man. The man behind films like Shaheed, Upkaar, Purab Aur Paschim and Kranti still has the patriotic streak. In fact, even after 47 years, his famous song Bharat Ka Rahne Wala Hoon is much in demand. Here is more from the thespian...

Great feeling

I feel great as August 15 approaches. I am happy at the strides India has taken in different walks of life. Yes there are areas we need to work on, but I insist we must do it together as individuals, society and government.

Surging ahead

Soon after Independence, we have had inspiring leaders – Nehru gave slogan of Aaram Haram Hai, Shastri ji that of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan; then came Indira Gandhi with Garibi Hatao. These leaders had a vision. Then Vajpayee tried solving the most irksome issue by visiting Pakistan, only to be back-stabbed with Kargil. Now we have Modi ji, who has shown promise and wants to revolutionise the country; we must give him time.

Masala mix

Sometime back I received a letter from the External Affairs Ministry and they wanted to use the song Bharat Ka Rahne Wala Hoon for Prime Minister’s Israel visit. I happily gave the permission. Nationalism in films is as significant as it is in society. We in India don’t have a sandwich culture, but thali one. We have to serve everything — right from entertainment, music to story to message.

Dangal fan

The last movie that I enjoyed was Dangal. Not only is that a beautiful story, but also filmed well. It also gives a powerful message of women empowerment. Not only can girls pick up sports, but something like kushti too.

Work hard

My message to readers is to work hard towards the development of the nation and to enjoy August 15!

"Wounds remain unhealed, lessons unlearnt","70 YEARS LATER…

Harish Khare

As the memory of those horrible days and years fades away, we are itching to reopen some of the settled questions about our collective existence. Perhaps after seventy years it is time, once again, to revisit those blood-stained days and recall Partition’s sobering lessons…

Harish Khare

With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

Admittedly, the British decision to grant India independence was principally driven by the simple fact that the four-year-long World War II had totally exhausted the imperial will to rule; in fact, the British desire to hold on to India had already been tested morally and ethically by the Indian National Congress, which under the Mahatma’s leadership had waged a unique peaceful freedom struggle. The British middle classes, with their pretensions to liberal values, had no answer to the Mahatma’s saintly leadership. The Union Jack had to be lowered from Red Fort, sooner than later.

But by the time the British came to the conclusion that they could no longer stay in India, they had already instigated mischief among the Indian leadership. The colonial rulers had cynically worked on the Indian society’s religious fault lines, encouraged and cultivated sectarian agendas which ultimately coalesced into the demand for a separate nation.

The Muslim League, under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had already legitimised use of violence in pursuit of its demands. The League’s call for ‘Direct Action’ was an invitation to chaos and the mobs. Once a society develops a taste for violence, its leaders are rarely able to calibrate and control the streets. By the time August 15, 1947, came the Muslim League’s leadership skills were already over-extended even in what came to be known as East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In India, the Congress leadership was barely able to push the mobs back.

Still, a monumental tragedy was destined to take place. The sheer scale of the number of Hindus and Sikhs, who found themselves forced to migrate out to India and of the Muslims in India who had to leave for Pakistan, was maddeningly benumbing. Grand statistics simply cannot convey the trauma and the tragedy that engulfed this part of the world soon after August 1947.

A sympathetic American reporter and an eye-witness described the post-Partition days as “one of the great convulsions of modern history.” On December 12, 1947, he tried to convey the nature of disaster that overtook the two nascent nations: “Consider what has happened. In an orgy of religious-communal madness, some 10 million citizens of the north-western provinces had been routed from their homes. An unknown total, probably between 2,00,000 and 5,00,000 (compared to 2,95,000 American war-dead in World War II), had been put to sword, machine-gunned, or roasted alive. The splintered Punjab administrations were quickly swamped and there even appeared danger that the infant central governments of India and Pakistan Dominions might succumb.” Phillips Talbot (An American Witness to India’s Partition).

The frenzy in the East was no less violent, no less gory, no less bloody than it was in the West. The Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs joyfully discovered their capacity for inflicting violence and death on their erstwhile neighbours as well as total strangers. The massacres, the mayhem and the madness outpaced humanity and all known civic-minded virtues; the trauma and tragedy touched nearly every home, every life. No one was unaffected; no one could remain emotionally unmolested by this continental turbulence.

After a few months the mobs could be rolled back and blood could be washed off the streets, but the memory of Partition-centric violence was now etched on the soul of an entire generation on both sides. The two successive states had entrenched habits and protocols of acrimony and suspicion and political leaders and sectarian interests saw to it that India and Pakistan would not settle down to a peaceful co-existence.

The raw memories of Partition also impacted on how the two states went about the business of creating an internal political order. Once Jinnah was gone, Pakistan hastily abandoned his ideas of an inclusive society and nation. In India, the Mahatma was assassinated. The murder was planned by those who wanted to make India a Hindu State and they thought the Old Man was an obstacle. Ironically, the assassination settled, once for all, how India would grant equal protection and equal citizenship to all its minorities.

Perhaps some in India would argue that Partition’s unfinished agenda still remains unattended. May be, after 70 years, we should simply revisit those horrible, horrible days of chaos and disorder before we embark on another self-defeating journey…"
"Indian-origin man cleared of causing death of wife, son in UK","London, August 16

An Indian-origin businessman was on Wednesday cleared of causing the death of his wife and son during an accident involving a car he was driving in Leicester city last year.

Rashminder Singh Gill was found not guilty of causing the deaths of his wife, 36-year-old Amrit Gill, and 14-year-old son Taran, by driving carelessly by a jury at Leicester Crown Court.

Gill's daughter, then aged 10, was also in the car at the time of the accident and was injured but survived the crash.

""Finally, I'm glad it's over. I finally feel I can grieve properly about my losses. Last year, and half of this, has been a nightmare. I can't even begin to explain,"" Gill told 'Leicester Mercury' after the verdict.

""I've had no sleep and couldn't think straight at times.

I've been trying to bring up my 11-year-old daughter and make sure she's been okay – it's not been easy. I run my own business and have staff to consider. My work and my daughter are the only things that have kept me sane and busy. I feel so relieved by the verdicts,"" he said.

The collision had occurred on the night of January 29 last year and the jury was told that the road surface was hazardous.

A blocked drain was unable to cope with the deluge and caused a trail of water to traverse both lanes on the unlit dual carriageway leading back to the Gills' home in Leicester.

Gill was driving back with his family in the torrential rain from a meal out and the prosecution claimed his speed was too much given the weather conditions.

His Mercedes went out of control before colliding with an oncoming Audi.

A pregnant passenger in the Audi suffered multiple fractures and lost the near full-term baby she was expecting.

Her husband and their two-year-old daughter were not seriously hurt.

The court heard that it was not possible to calculate the speed Gill was travelling, although he was not said to have been exceeding the 50mph speed limit, which has since been reduced to 40mph.

Gill, who breath-tested negative for alcohol, had no recollection of the collision afterwards.

He said to a police officer at the scene that his wife, in the front passenger seat, had grabbed his shoulder or the steering wheel as the car started to skid.

The defence argued that the jury could not be sure that had not, in fact, caused the loss of control and collision. — PTI"
Punjab: Truck operators call off agitation,"Chandigarh, August 16

Truckers in Punjab on Wednesday called off their month-long protest against the disbanding of truck unions after an assurance from the state government that their interests would not be hurt by its move.

“We have decided to call off our ongoing protest against the state government’s decision to disband 134 truck unions,” All Punjab Truck Operators Union chief Happy Sandhu said here.

The union claimed that small truck operators would suffer the most because of the abolition of truck unions as big companies would take over the business, posing a serious threat to the former’s survival in the business.

Sandhu said Punjab Markfed Chairman Amarjit Singh Samra today arranged a meeting of truck operators with Suresh Kumar, the chief principal secretary to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.

“Suresh Kumar ji assured us that our interests will be taken care of. No truck operator will face any financial loss and minimum and maximum freight will also be decided by the state government,” he said.

“We will now restart transportation of food grains,” he added.

The Punjab Government had approved the Punjab Goods Carriages (regulation and prevention of cartelisation rules), which barred goods carriage operators from forming cartels or unions in the state.

During their agitation, the truckers had blocked traffic on some roads, held rallies and even burnt a few vehicles in the past one month.

The union had even filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the state government’s move of disbanding truck unions in the state. — PTI"

Rupee weakens by 17 paise on strong dollar demand,"Mumbai, August 16

The rupee fell 17 paise to 64.29 against the US dollar in early trade on Wednesday due to increased demand for the American currency from importers amid foreign fund outflows. Forex dealers said dollar strengthening against other currencies overseas on strong US sales data weighed on the rupee sentiment. However, a higher opening in the domestic stock market limited the rupee losses, they added. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth Rs 1,638.83 crore on Monday, as per the provisional data. On Monday, the rupee had closed almost flat at 64.12 a dollar on emergence of fag-end demand for the American currency. Market remained closed on Tuesday on account of Independence Day.

Living in no-nonsense times,"Rajmohan Gandhi

Our Prime Minister tweets, launches projects, meets world figures, addresses election rallies, gives a monthly radio talk. He reaches us. Sometimes he makes constructive points. But we cannot reach him or ask him questions. A one-way torrent of words, even of eloquent words, is not democracy.

Rajmohan Gandhi

THIS valued newspaper asks me to write for free India's 70th anniversary, but I must begin with recent matters. After that call was made for a tank on the JNU campus, artillery in fact moved. It moved to Karnataka, where Congress MLAs from Gujarat had secluded themselves to make poaching difficult. Big investigative guns confronted the MLAs' rich host, a Congress minister in Karnataka. In the opening days of this month, August 2017, about the only person in all of India to be publicly targeted for alleged black money was the afore-mentioned Minister, DK Shivakumar. The timing too may have been well-considered. Since Ahmed Patel, Gujarat's Congress leader, had shown the temerity to stand up to Amit Shah, the BJP president, shouldn't Patel be prevented from re-entering the Rajya Sabha? Why not immobilise Shivakumar and liberate Gujarat's MLAs for the market economy? We live in no-nonsense times. A day or two before the raids on Shivakumar, this is what Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju told Parliament, during a debate on lynchings: “When India's name is shining in the eye of the globe, when people the world over respect our Prime Minister, at this moment to ruin the image of our Prime Minister, our government is as bad as ruining the image of our country… I am ending my comments with a warning... As many times as you raise issues like this, those many times we will expose you.” Wishes are not facts. India's name does not necessarily glow in the world today. Yes, India's global footprint has steadily expanded over the last 25 years. Persons of Indian origin play more visible roles on several continents. But farmers' suicides, violence against women, and lynching of humans in the name of the cow invite critical international coverage on TV, in print and on social media. The world also rightly wonders about the media's independence in India. Our always-visible Prime Minister is also, unfortunately, wholly inaccessible. He is possibly the first Indian Prime Minister who does not hold press conferences or give interviews to probing journalists. When was the last time anyone read a candid interview with Mr Modi? Or watched such an interview on television? Our Prime Minister tweets, launches projects, meets world figures, addresses election rallies, gives a monthly radio talk. He reaches us. Sometimes he makes constructive points. But we cannot reach him or ask him questions. A one-way torrent of words, even of eloquent words, is not democracy. Mr Rijiju was right to refer to world opinion. We do not know whether the lynchings would have secured a debate in Parliament but for the international dismay aroused. Leaving out exceptions like North Korea's rulers, few regimes can wholly disregard international opinion. During our 1975-77 Emergency, Indira Gandhi kept, in a drawer near her South Block desk, a few small journals that had criticised her. If a foreign caller asked her about the freedom of the press in India, she would show the articles. The journals preserved in Mrs Gandhi's drawer did not represent the state of India's conformist Press in 1975-77. Likewise, newspapers questioning the central government today do not speak for India's big media. Possessing a much wider reach, our TV channels seem unwilling to hold Modi and his team to account. When Opposition parties become weak and primary media is fearful, only Caesar may save us from Caesar and his supporters. However, Mr Modi, who has the platform and megaphone to reach millions, who expounds a great deal on chosen goals, refuses to address the nation on life-and-death matters. A brief statement that the Prime Minister condemns lynching was not half enough. From a TV screen, Mr Modi must directly condemn culprits and their supporters. He must tell India's policemen, with the whole nation watching, that they must protect every person on India's soil. He must assure India's women, Dalits and Muslims, specifying them, that their safety is his commitment. Publicly and privately, he must insist that state governments bring the guilty to justice. His record, unfortunately, does not suggest that Mr Modi will do any of this. Following Independence, a far-from-perfect yet precious house of democracy was created in our land. Behind it lay the sacrifice of countless people, including the forebears of many who may read this. In this piece, I cite only from two or three of them, but what a team of heroes we had. I marvel at all of them, thank God for all them, and do not compare them with one another. At that mid-August midnight 70 years ago, this is what Jawaharlal Nehru said: “We shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out, however high the wind or stormy the tempest... All of us, to whatever religion we may belong, are equally the children of India with equal rights, privileges and obligations”. And here are BR Ambedkar's challenging words: “Political tyranny is nothing compared to social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies government.” Narendra Modi himself often speaks of Babasaheb Ambedkar. He also often speaks of Mahatma Gandhi. The Swachh Bharat campaign has Gandhi, or at least Gandhi's spectacles, as its icon. But the dirt that Gandhi sought to remove was more than physical. It was more than financial. Gandhi was above all an enemy of the arrow of hate between Hindus and Muslims that many of Mr Modi's supporters openly and repeatedly launch. Some of them also openly proclaim the goal of a Hindu Rashtra, the mirror image of an Islamic Pakistan. Such a change in the Constitution and ideology of India would amount to a brutal reversal of Gandhi, Ambedkar, Nehru and all those who fought to replace foreign rule with an Indian polity that assured liberty of thought, religion and speech, equality and respect for diversity. Whether their effort has Mr Modi's support or not, the forces that want such a reversal have made solid progress, at least in preparing the political and social ground for it. Will their partial success grow into bigger triumphs? Will dissent and opposition be suppressed with the aid of state agencies and a pliant media? Will thought be controlled through universities and schools? Will it become increasingly hard, dangerous and finally impossible to mount a strong opposition? Hard enough to write, history is impossible to predict. It may be a mistake, however, to count on the long-term gullibility or inertia of the Indian people, or to dismiss as old-fashioned the instincts passed on to the Indian people by the remarkable movement that saw success 70 years ago. Rousing India against the British Empire but refusing to hate the Englishman, hating Indian society's cruel injustices but refusing to condone ill-will towards any Indian, Gandhi knew he had invited enmity. He fully expected to join the ranks, large in number, of the subcontinent's victims of hate. Equally, he expected his ideas to continue the fight. Alluding 10 days before independence to the possibility of being eliminated, Gandhi wrote in his weekly Harijan: “I shall be alive in the grave and, what is more, speaking from it (Harijan, 7 Aug. 1947; Collected Works 96: 202). Similar was the confidence of a great many others who offered their lives for a free India where citizens would be free to think, believe and speak as they liked, and where they loved fellow-Indians, no matter of what kind. The hand holding it may be old or young, weak or strong, but the torch of national and individual freedom will be held, passed on, and held again, and again, no matter how fierce or long the storm. The writer, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, is a historian dividing his time between India and the United States."
"India's real GDP growth to average at 7.4% over 2017, ’18: Deutsche Bank","New Delhi, August 15

India's growth momentum will get stronger with revival in private investment cycle and real GDP growth is expected to average at about 7.4 per cent over 2017 and 2018, says a Deutsche Bank report.

It also termed as 'faulty' the argument that a 7.5-8 per cent real GDP growth in the next few years will still be lower than what was achieved in the boom period of 2006-2008.

It said the global economy post the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) has adjusted to a new-normal of low-growth low-inflation environment, and India's growth achievement should therefore be judged taking this structural shift into consideration.

""In the current new normal, an economy which delivers a steady 7.5-8.0 per cent growth in real terms should be comparable to 9-10 per cent growth in the pre-GFC period, in our view,"" it added.

According to the global financial services major, the country's growth momentum will only get stronger as private investment cycle starts reviving gradually, along with continuation of strong private consumption.

The medium-term outlook for the country looks ""exceedingly positive"" driven by supportive population dynamics, steadily rising aspirational middle class and a reforms oriented government, it said.

“We are forecasting India's real GDP growth to average about 7.4 per cent over 2017 and 2018, which will mark about 200 bps improvement from the average outturn over 2012 and 2013, a period when India's macro came under severe pressure,"" Deutsche Bank said in its research note.

It termed India as one of fastest growing economies in the world.

India lost the tag of the fastest growing major economy to China in the March quarter with a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, which pulled down the 2016-17 expansion to 7.1 per cent. — PTI"

"Vemula wasn't Dalit, didn't commit suicide due to external factors: Probe panel","Opposition, activists slam report

New Delhi, August 16

Hyderabad University Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula did not commit suicide because of any pressure exerted by union ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya or university's Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile and that it was a decision ""of his own"", an inquiry commission has found.

Opposition parties and activists have slammed the report that said Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula, who allegedly committed suicide last year, did not kill himself due to university action against him.

“(T)he suicide did not relate to any activities of the university administration or the political leaders (then HRD Minister Smriti Irani and Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya), including Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile. It was wholly a decision of his own.

""His suicide note is on the record, which shows that Rohith Vemula had his own problems and was not happy with the worldly affairs,"" said the report of the commission set up by the Union Human Resource Development Ministry.

The one-man commission, headed by Allahabad High Court judge (retd) A.K. Roopanwal, was constituted in 2016 following Vemula's suicide that triggered protests by students in Hyderabad and elsewhere.

The commission had submitted its findings to the HRD Ministry in December 2016, which was made public on Tuesday.

""He (Vemula) did not blame anybody for his suicide. If he would have been angry with the decision of the university, certainly either he would have written in specific words or would have indicated in this regard....

""This shows that the circumstances prevailing in the university at that time were not the reason for committing suicide,"" it said.

The report also sought to clarify that Vemula did not belong to the Scheduled Castes category. He came from ""Vaddera"" community, and thus belonged to the OBC category, it said.

""The evidence on record shows that she (Vemula's mother) belongs to Vaddera community and, therefore, the Scheduled Castes certificate issued to Rohith Vemula cannot be said to be a genuine one and he was not a Scheduled Caste person,"" it said.

Vemula's mother V. Radhika claimed to hail from ""Mala"" community, which is considered a Scheduled Caste. After getting divorce from her husband V. Manikumar -- who belonged to Vaddera community -- in 1990, she alone raised Vemula.

Moreover, the commission did not find any proof of discrimination against Vemula on account of his caste, which could have eventually led to his suicide.

""Nothing has been brought before me by which it could be shown that he was ever given a different treatment from that to the General category students by the university authorities during his stay in the university,"" it stated.

Vemula was among the four students, who had been barred from accessing the hostel premises and other public spaces within the university as a proctorial inquiry punishment in August 2015, for abusing and beating up ABVP activist N. Susheel Kumar over a Facebook post.

Vemula committed suicide on January 17, 2016, by hanging.

Slamming the report, academic scholar and Dalit rights activist Kancha Ilaiah alleged that the report has been written to present the government's version of the story.

""What surprises me is that what the then HRD minister Smriti Irani had said about Vemula's death is what forms the content of the report.

""We would have taken it more seriously if Irani would have then said 'look we do not know what happened and we are constituting an enquiry to know about it',"" Ilaiah told reporters, adding ""What the minister wanted to say is all what has been written in the report"".

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he has been demanding a probe in the matter by a sitting Supreme Court judge for the truth to come out, asking ""what can a retired judge say when the government has already made up its mind?""

Congress' Rajeev Gowda also slammed the report saying it was a ""sham"".

""It insults the memory of Vemula and the tragedy of his suicide. He was driven to death by mistreatment, harassment by varsity and intervention of central ministers into the issue,"" he claimed. — Agencies"
Air India announces Chandigarh-Bangkok flight from Oct 6,"Chandigarh, August 16

Air India on Wednesday announced its Chandigarh-Bangkok flight from October 6.

The flight from Bangkok, known for ornate shrines and vibrant street life, will arrive in Chandigarh at 9.30 am. The flight to the Thailand capital will take off from the local airport at 1.30 pm.

Mohali Industries Association had filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the non-operation of the Chandigarh international airport.

In its statement filed before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Air India state manager GS Tomar had said: “Air India proposes to commence operations on the Chandigarh-Bangkok route from October 29, 2017, with the new A-320 Neo aircraft on four-flights-a-week basis”.

Taking note of the assertion, the Bench of Justice SS Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan asked the airline to plan its flight schedule in a manner that would prevent limited watch hours at the airport from posing a problem.

The Bench was also informed that the airline was awaiting clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs for launching of hub and spoke flights for other international destinations from Chandigarh.

At the same time, Air India said the airline had no immediate plan to launch an Amritsar-Toronto flight.

The assertion came almost 10 months after the Chandigarh-Bangkok flight by Air India was first announced. The flight was to start in April, but was deferred. The Division Bench headed by Justice SS Saron had also asked Air India to submit its status report on restarting the Amritsar-Birmingham flight by July 18."
Tips for becoming a co-applicant in home loan,"Ravindra Rao

A home is the most popular, and will be the most enduring of all earthly establishments, said the late great American magician, Channing Pollock, about his abode. A home is perhaps the most prized possession for most of us and aspirational in every sense; the best address, important neighbours and all facilities that we would ever need in life. That costs a small fortune in many Indian cities but if you have a robust source of income and an impressive credit score, such dreams can be realised without much strain. However, for those who do not fulfil the income criteria for a substantial loan, a simple way to hone your overall financial prowess is to borrow jointly with your spouse or someone who can be designated as a co-borrower. Let’s understand the basics of this advantageous concept.A co-borrower can be an immediate family member, salaried or self-employed, who is an Indian or even an NRI. Depending on their discretion, lending institutions can allow up to six co-applicants which may include spouse, siblings and blood relatives like parents. Nevertheless, married couples get the highest preference as banks even assign a longer loan repayment tenure subject to the retirement age of the older applicant.Prospects of a bigger loan at a better rate brighten when an applicant adds co-applicants with a good credit score and an independent income source. It helps lenders consider the joint income of the applicants to assess their repayment capacity. But banks may insist that all co-owners of the property must be the co-applicants as well.A joint home loan bestows tax deduction benefits for both co-applicants separately, provided they are co-owners of the property and each of them is contributing to the home loan repayment. As per existing provisions, principal repayments are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act for up to a maximum limit of Rs 1.50 lakh. In the case of interest payments, there is a tax deduction available under Section 24 up to Rs 2 lakh if the property is self-occupied (If the property is let out, then the entire interest becomes eligible for tax deduction). For a joint home loan, this takes the combined limit to Rs 3 lakh under Section 80C and Rs 4 lakh under Section 24(b) – which helps reduce a significant burden on the family.

Advantage for married applicants

Few important tips can enhance the overall benefit to married applicants. A couple must mutually work out the ownership share between themselves as co-borrowers to optimise tax benefits; either this can be in the ratio of 50:50 for claiming deductions in equal proportion or 60:40 or 70:30 depending on which co-borrower falls into what tax bracket – if he or she has a higher income, a bigger share of the property can help avail greater benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit given to each co-applicant would be in proportion to their contribution in repayment of principal and interest. Thus, it is even possible for co-applicants to decide how much tax benefit they would want, and at what proportion, each applicant would pay. In case of a woman applicant, many lenders would provide a differentiated interest rate - usually a few basis points below the normal home loan rates. For this, the applicant must be the sole or joint owner of the property and an applicant or co-applicant for the home loan. Joint home loan applicants can make payments from a single or joint account by way of cheques or ECS. Some institutions even allow co-borrowers to share the number of EMIs between them, depending on which they could decide the number of EMI cheques to be issued by each applicant. One borrower can pay all instalments while the other can refund his or her share by way of cheque or fund transfer to that account.A key factor that decides one’s loan eligibility is the credit worthiness of borrowers. When one applies for a loan or credit, a lender seeks the individual’s credit risk, evaluated by a credit score maintained by agencies. A credit report is the holistic sum of the applicant’s financial dealings in every sphere of life, interpreted as a number that is critical for getting not just loans or other means of credit, but even to qualify for them (banks can judge not just the applicant’s primary eligibility but even his/her ability and propensity to repay). It is prudent to keep a check on the credit report/credit score of an applicant as well as a co-applicant; as lower scores could impact one’s chances of obtaining finance for a home.Besides home loan documents, individual details such as KYC (proof of identity and address), income and property documents are required to avail the housing loan. Detailed documentation helps a lender to decide faster and beneficially in your favour. Income documents can be supported by other assets created by the applicants to show their prudent financial behaviour. Though there would be multiple borrowers, the documentation process for joint home loans remains much like that of individual home loans. Despite its enormous benefits, one may avoid applying for a joint home loan if the credit score of the co-owner is low due to a poor credit history or if he/she is already repaying an ongoing loan that has consumed maximum loan eligibility or if he/she is intending to buy a bigger property in the future for self-occupancy or if he/she is about to retire.

Managing loan and finances

A joint home loan is not only about saving in terms of principal and interest payment to a great extent, but also about sharing an honorable and real responsibility towards a home. Many couples would agree that such a joint move has instilled a sense of discipline – especially financial prudence – in them where both partners feel proud for contributing towards mutual benefit. Yet, one must not take hasty decisions in terms of finalising a house or taking a huge loan (it may turn out expensive over the tenure with fewer benefits). Couples must undertake basic financial planning before committing to a huge monthly payout which may hamstring regular needs or individual desire to acquire something personal. As TS Elliot said, “Home is where one starts from.” Home loan is where one could learn much from – as co-borrowers.

"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a smartphone app to help middle-aged and older adults self-manage their mental illness and other chronic conditions.

Washington, August 16

Scientists have developed a smartphone app to help middle-aged and older adults self-manage their mental illness and other chronic conditions.

The app takes patients through 10 sessions over a period of about three months, covering topics such as stress vulnerability and illness, medication adherence and strategies, and substance and medication abuse.

Physicians can remotely monitor app use, and intervene when problems are detected, facilitating telemedicine for less accessible populations.

Researchers at Dartmouth College in the US tested the app’s usability. They found that 10 participants (mean age of 55.3 years) with serious mental illness and other chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application.

They found that even patients with limited technical abilities could use the app successfully.

“The use of mobile health interventions by adults with serious mental illness is a promising approach that has been shown to be highly feasible and acceptable,” said Karen Fortuna from Dartmouth College.

These technologies are associated with many advantages compared with traditional psychosocial interventions, including the potential for individually tailored, just-in-time delivery along with wide dissemination and high population impact, researchers said.

The process of adapting an existing psychosocial intervention to a smartphone intervention requires adaptation for a high-risk group with limited health and technology literacy, they said.

“Smartphone applications also potentially facilitate patient engagement in participatory, personalised and preventative care,” Fortuna said.

“As the health care industry increasingly embraces prevention and illness self-management, it is important for physicians and patients to be actively involved in designing and developing new technologies supporting these approaches,” Fortuna added.

The study was published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. PTI"
The Scheme of Passive Resistance,"LAHORE, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 15, 1917

THE scheme of passive resistance is being debated from all standpoints. There are people who recommend it because there is no alternative for the perseveration of one's liberty. Others declare that the Congress, being committed to adopt none but constitutional methods, cannot entertain a proposal for passive resistance, however expedient it may be. The Indian Social Reformer appeals to the educated classes to abandon the suggested scheme and to the Government to give up repressive methods. Our contemporary reminds us of Prof. Seeley's observation that if it should, at any time, become possible of execution in India, passive resistance would make British rule impossible."
In mission mode,"MOVIE REVIEW: TOILET EK PREM KATHA

Nonika Singh

How one feared that this would be no more than an audiovisual requiem for Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan! Surely, Toilet Ek Prem Katha does more to the cause than the television commercial featuring Vidya Balan. But the film that brings out the problem of open defecation out in the open is much more than a promotional advert.

Yes, as the subtitle says, it’s very much a love story inspired by true events. Set in a small town-like-village in UP where men ride motorbikes, wear fake Rayban glasses, are kicking and alive on Facebook, but have orthodox, almost archaic, views when it comes to making a toilet in their homes/villages.

But before the film’s real mission can unfurl, there is bitter-sweet love story of Shekhar (Akshay Kumar) and Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar). He falls for her and even though Jaya is cut from a different cloth, what makes her reciprocate his feelings is his earnestness. Trust Akshay to infuse sincerity and dignity to a character that could well be a caricature. Far removed from our urban sensibilities and far different from the superstar that he is, Akshay makes you care for this reel person Shekhar.

Indeed, it’s not easy to pass off an actor pushing 50 as a lover boy. So he is shown as a rather mature 36-year-old man whose ‘manglik’ status demands a marriage to a buffalo and a wife with two thumbs, a la Hrithik Roshan. But the real villain in this love story “har love story mein villain toh hona chaaheye” is a genuine problem that plagues a vast majority of India. Expectedly, love follows a different route and tails a husband’s resolve to first find and then make a toilet for his wife. But before you dismiss the film as a government mouthpiece on its most publicized programme, well it actually exposes a scam and informs how thousands of crores have been siphoned off in the name of bringing toilets to rural India. Of course, the Prime Minister (no names please) gets a clean chit, rather an emphatic pat on the back and there is even a reference to ‘notebandi’ in glowing terms.

Amidst all this, as the couple’s story threatens to turn into a half-baked revolution, their love shines and sparkles. Bhumi, who has walked the simple rustic path in her first film as well, comes out a ‘toper’ once more. With a desi accent in place, a woman with a heart and a resolve of steel, she is both believable and relatable. Even though modern urban India may not be able to fully comprehend the seriousness of the issue, both Akshay and Bhumi make you feel for them.

Besides, despite the gravity of the problem at hand, the first half packs mirth. With amusing dialogues in tow and a refreshing cameo by Divyendu Sharma as Akshay’s younger brother, the plot gets rolling.

Sure enough a film, that too cause-driven, can’t be without few sermon-laced melodramatic moments and second half does come riding with many in abundance. At more than one point the message becomes louder than the film’s entertainment value. Still the director does attempt the balancing act and navigates the film through its bumps to finally arrive at the expected finale. But as they say, “all is well that ends well” moreso when the intention too is right from the beginning. If you can ignore the motive to be on the right side of powers that be, the film does power a real cause and brings some genuine emotions on the table."

Mumbai, August 16

Shah Rukh Khan paid a visit to veteran actor Dilip Kumar, who calls the superstar his “mooh bola beta”.

The visit came after the 94-year-old returned home following a week-long stay at the Lilavati Hospital here for kidney-related problems.

The veteran actor’s wife Saira Bano on Tuesday took to Twitter to share a string of photographs of Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar.

In one of the photographs the ‘Dear Zindagi’ star is seen kissing Dilip Kumar’s forehead.

“Message from Saira Banu: Sahab’s mooh bola beta (son) Shah Rukh Khan visited Sahab today. Sharing some photos of the evening,” the caption said.

His wife also said Dilip Kumar was “doing much better”.

“Shah Rukh Khan visited Sahab this evening. Sahab’s doing much better since (he) returned from the hospital. Shukar Allah.”

Dilip Kumar was admitted to the hospital on August 2 following dehydration and urinary tract infection.

Last seen on the big screen in ‘Qila’ in 1998, the actor was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015.

He is known for films like ‘Devdas’, ‘Mughal-e-Azam’ and ‘Karma’. IANS"
DISABLED,"As Devendra Jhajharia gets set to be the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award, he becomes a ray of hope for many

Sabi Hussain

Devendra Jhajharia’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing ever since his name was recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. While there is a deluge of congratulatory messages on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, his native home in Rajasthan is being frequented by politicians and bureaucrats. The award has suddenly brought the focus on this two-time Paralympics gold medalist. “It’s been a surreal few days,” said an elated Jhajharia over the phone from his village Jhajharian ki Dhani in Churu district. “It’s like a dream come true. I waited 12 years for this honour, since winning the gold at 2004 Athens Paralympics. The award has given a ray of hope to other para athletes in the country,” said the javelin thrower and Rio Paralympics gold medalist. August 29 would, indeed be, a watershed moment in para-athletics, as Jhajharia will become the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Each day a new fight For para-athletes, such moments of joy during their professional career are far and few between. Instead, they have an everyday fight on their hand for recognition, equality and, more importantly, against bureaucratic red-tapism. Last month, para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande was forced to beg in Berlin, Germany, after she apparently ran out of money to meet her expenses while competing in a week-long tournament. Recently, a 62-member Indian contingent of hearing-impaired athletes, returning after its best-ever performance at the Deaf Olympic Games in Turkey, protested when no official from the Sports Ministry or the Sports Authority of India came to receive them at the Delhi International Airport. “Time and again, we have been failed by the system,” said Haryana’s Paralympian and Arjuna awardee discus thrower Amit Saroha.

Spurred by taunts

Recalling his struggle, Saroha said the fight was not about coming out of the hospital following a horrific car accident in 2007 but being able to find acceptance in the society. “I wanted encouragement, not sympathy. I wanted the Tri-colour wrapped around my body, not a consoling hand on my shoulder,” said Saroha, a gold medallist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Para Games and a silver medalist at 2015 and 2017 editions of the World Championships. “My lower body had become paralysed after the accident. I didn’t want to sit idle at home. Since I had been a National-level hockey player until 2003, I decided to participate in throw ball and discus throw events. But, the Paralympic Committee of Haryana (PCH) refused to accept my candidature,” said Saroha. “The accident had left me quadriplegic (with paralysis of all four limbs). The PCH officials were convinced that my upper body wouldn’t be able to generate the strength required to throw the discus. I had to run from pillar-to-post for my selection in the Indian team. It was only when I won my first international medal (a silver in discus throw) at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Para Games that the attitude of people changed,” added the 32-year-old from Sonepat. Jhajharia had his own poignant tale to share. “Since childhood, I was considered physically weak. My classmates would make fun of my thin frame. To become physically stronger, I started participating in sports. But things took a turn for the worse. At eight, while climbing a tree, I was electrocuted after accidently touching a live wire. This led to the amputation of my left arm. I would be taunted with comments like “tundla ho gaya hai” (his hand has become disabled). It was a nightmare.” “In 1995, I participated in a district-level championship for students. All other participants were able-bodied. I became district champion after winning the tournament. That was the turning point of my life. Later, when I won gold medal at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2002 and at the Athens Paralympic Games in 2004, I shut the mouth of all those who had told my parents that I wouldn’t be able to do anything in my life,” added the 36-year-old.

What keeps them going

“Simple, to see the Tricolour rise and hear the National Anthem during the medal ceremony. People who have never experienced it won’t understand. You can’t describe the feeling of pride in words,” said high-jumper Sharad Kumar, who won a silver medal at the recent World Para-athletics in London. “It’s also our way of living with dignity. We para-athletes feel ignored and discriminated. But, we have found solace in sports. I only have problem with my leg but the able-bodied have problem with their mind and heart. They are more disabled than us,” added the 2014 Incheon Para Asian Games gold medalist, who suffered paralysis of his left leg after being administered wrong medicine for polio at the age of two. Tragedy struck Sundar Singh Gurjar when he lost his left hand in a car accident in 2015. He created history by becoming the first Indian to win gold in men’s javelin throw event at the Worlds recently. “I had been competing as a javelin thrower till that fateful evening. But, before anybody could point a finger at me, I made sure to continue pursuing my sports career. I didn’t want people to make fun of my disability.” The gold at the Worlds was a redemption for Gurjar, who missed an announcement call for his name at the Rio Paralympics as he failed to understand the accent of the announcer. He reached the arena a minute late to find that he’d been disqualified. “This shows the indifferent attitude of the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI). What exactly was the official attached to our contingent doing when my name was called? The PCI official should have ensured my participation. I was left to fend for myself,” Gurjar said. Giving back to the game In spite of the hardships faced by them, these shining lights of para-athletics are a role model for other differently abled athletes. Saroha spends his entire salary of Rs 40,000 per month — which he earns as a coach at the SAI’s Sonepat centre — on providing training and arranging for exposure trips abroad of some of his protégés like Dharambir Nain, Amit Balwan, Sunil, Rampal Chahar, Rinku Hooda and Ekta, among others. At present, Saroha is funding 17 para-athletes. “If I’ll help others, only then God will help me,” said Saroha. “Whatever cash award I receive from the Haryana government, I spend the amount on funding my trainees. I don’t want other para-athletes to go through the same struggle I was subjected to.” Both Jhajharia and Deepa Malik, Rio Paralympics silver medallists from Haryana, have written to their respective state governments to provide them land to open a sports academy for para-athletes in Jaipur and Gurugram, respectively."

Amritsar, August 14

City residents are upbeat after the Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, today announced a slew of welfare and development schemes for the holy city to put it into a higher-growth trajectory.

Amritsar Vikas Manch (AVM) president Kulwant Singh Ankhi welcomed the announcement of construction of Railway Overbridges (ROBs) at level crossings on the Amritsar-Mehta road at Vallah, level crossing No. S-23 on the Amritsar-Attari railway crossing from Putligar Chowk towards Islamabad and another at Jodda Phatak.

The ROBs at Vallah and Putlighar will be undertaken at a cost of Rs 62 crore.

Ankhi said there had been a long-pending demand to raise the ROBs. He appreciated the announcement of the Amritsar City Development Plan at Rs 171.90 crore that would involve construction of an ROB at Jaura Phatak, construction of a flyover from HP Petrol Pump (Batala Road) to Majitha Road at Sant Singh Sukhs Singh Chowk, extension of the existing ROB (Bhandari Bridge), improvement of the façade from the Hall gate to Town Hall and back to Pink Plaza as well as five multi-level parkings at Kairon Market, Machhi Mandi near the Hall gate, near Old Telephone Exchange and outside the Hall gate.

Harpinder Singh Walia, a resident of New Golden Avenue, said level crossings at Jodda phatak (twin gates) over the Amritsar-Jammu and the Amritsar-Delhi lines resulted in their closure most of the time.

He said densely populated localities were situated on both sides and people had to suffer traffic jams for longer hours.

A hotelier, Randhir Singh, said setting up of a Unified Tourism Information and Facilitation Centre would promote tourism in the city.

He said with several tourist projects becoming functional, it was necessary to promote them among tourists and maintain them.

He said the plan to set up public toilets at 17 places in the city, beautification work around Sri Durgiana Mandir and de-congestion of traffic around Ghee Mandi through construction of slip roads and redesigning of congested roundabouts would help devotees to reach Golden Temple conveniently.

Punjab Sudhar Sabha president Balram Kumar Sharma said construction of a Multipurpose Sports and Recreation Facility on 26 acres of the Improvement Trust land at Ranjit Avenue on the Bypass Road would help the youth to wean away from drugs."
High GST may taper leasing industry growth,"Kolkata, August 16

The estimated Rs 5,500 crore capital good leasing sector growing at 15-20 per cent may get tapered due to high Goods and Services Tax (GST) along with few other issues. “The GST rate of 28 per cent is high for the leasing industry when compared to the earlier five to 15 per cent tax burden. Higher GST rates lead to requirement of higher working capital at any point of time. This results in increasing the cost of leasing an equipment,” Finance Industry Development Council director general Mahesh Thakkar told PTI. “The government should actively consider not bracketing the capital goods in the same GST bracket as luxury goods goods. A lower GST rate will help increasing share of leasing in gross capital formation,” he said. The share of leasing in gross domestic capital formation in India is less than 2 per cent whereas the global average is 10 per cent, he said. The same could also create hurdles for the foreign companies in India since they believe that leasing is the most preferred method of owing assets for operation, an NBFC official said. Apart from GST rates, there are other issues like input tax credit, penal interest/charges for delayed remittance of EMI and sale of repossessed assets which needs to be corrected. “Till now there is no response from the government on our representation,” he said. Both pointed out that the issue would have a severe impact on capital-starved SME players who would face major hardship due to this. Construction equipment, wagons, heavy machinery, car leasing among others are expected to face hurdles in new regime. Leasing in India is just 3 per cent of global volumes and if taxation issues were not addressed, this would effectively be a death blow to leasing even before it made a comeback in India, an equipment company official said.

"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a smartphone app to help middle-aged and older adults self-manage their mental illness and other chronic conditions.

Washington, August 16

Scientists have developed a smartphone app to help middle-aged and older adults self-manage their mental illness and other chronic conditions.

The app takes patients through 10 sessions over a period of about three months, covering topics such as stress vulnerability and illness, medication adherence and strategies, and substance and medication abuse.

Physicians can remotely monitor app use, and intervene when problems are detected, facilitating telemedicine for less accessible populations.

Researchers at Dartmouth College in the US tested the app’s usability. They found that 10 participants (mean age of 55.3 years) with serious mental illness and other chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application.

They found that even patients with limited technical abilities could use the app successfully.

“The use of mobile health interventions by adults with serious mental illness is a promising approach that has been shown to be highly feasible and acceptable,” said Karen Fortuna from Dartmouth College.

These technologies are associated with many advantages compared with traditional psychosocial interventions, including the potential for individually tailored, just-in-time delivery along with wide dissemination and high population impact, researchers said.

The process of adapting an existing psychosocial intervention to a smartphone intervention requires adaptation for a high-risk group with limited health and technology literacy, they said.

“Smartphone applications also potentially facilitate patient engagement in participatory, personalised and preventative care,” Fortuna said.

“As the health care industry increasingly embraces prevention and illness self-management, it is important for physicians and patients to be actively involved in designing and developing new technologies supporting these approaches,” Fortuna added.

The study was published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. PTI"
"Melbourne most liveable city; Karachi, Dhaka among the least","No Indian city among top 10 or bottom 10

New York, August 16

Melbourne is the most liveable city in the world, followed by Austrian capital, Vienna and Canada's Vancouver in the second and third place, respectively, reveals a survey.

According to the Global Liveability Report compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), no Indian city was ranked in the top 10 or bottom 10 in the most liveable city ranking.

Others in the 10 most liveable cities in the world include Toronto at the fourth place, followed by Calgary (5th), Adelaide (6th), Perth (7th), Auckland (8th), Helsinki (9th) and Hamburg (10th).

According to the survey that covered 140 cities globally, though the rankings of top five cities remain unchanged, the past few years have seen increasing instability across the world, causing volatility in the scores of many cities.

""While not a new phenomenon, the frequency and spread of terrorism have increased noticeably and become even more prominent,"" the report said adding ""repeated attacks in France and the UK have had a contagion effect, raising terror alerts and lowering stability scores in cities across the region"".

Besides, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Turkey remain the subject of high-profile civil unrest and armed conflicts, while a number of other countries, such as Nigeria, continue to battle insurgent groups.

""Even a relatively stable country such as the US has seen mounting civil unrest linked to the Black Lives Matter movement and the policies proposed by President Donald Trump,"" it said.

EIU noted that overall, the global average liveability score has fallen 0.8 per cent to 74.8 per cent over the past five years.

As per the survey, the least liveable city was Damascus at 140th place, followed by Lagos (139), Tripoli (138), Dhaka (137), Port Moresby (136), Algiers (135), Karachi (134), Harare (133), Douala (132) and Kiev (131).

The rating quantifies the challenges that might be presented to an individual's lifestyle in any given location, and allows for direct comparison between locations.

Trump holds his stand: Blames 'both sides' for Virginia,"New York, August 16

President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that left- and right-wing extremists became violent during a weekend rally by white nationalists in Virginia, reigniting a political firestorm over US race relations and his own leadership of a national crisis. Trump, who drew sharp criticism from Republicans and Democrats for his initial response, reverted on Tuesday to his position that both sides were at fault for the violence, a day after bowing to pressure to explicitly condemn the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups. Appearing angry and irritated, the president maintained that his original reaction was based on the facts he had at the time. Blame, he said, belonged on both sides. ""You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now,"" Trump said, referring to right- and left-wing protesters. From there, the back and forth with reporters turned tense. ""Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch,"" Trump said of the participants in the deadly protest. ""There was a group on this side. You can call them the left ... that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that’s the way it is."" The violence erupted on Saturday after white nationalists converged in Charlottesville for a ""Unite the Right"" rally in protest of plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the US Civil War. Many of the rally participants were seen carrying firearms, sticks and shields. Some also wore helmets. Counter-protesters likewise came equipped with sticks, helmets and shields. The two sides clashed in scattered street brawls before a car plowed into the rally opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. A 20-year-old Ohio man, James Fields, said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, was charged with murder. Two state police officers also were killed that day in the fiery crash of the helicopter they were flying in as part of crowd-control operations.

‘Many sides’

Addressing the melee for the first time on Saturday, Trump denounced hatred and violence ""on many sides"". The comment drew sharp criticism across the political spectrum for not explicitly condemning the white nationalists whose presence in the southern college town was widely seen as having provoked the unrest. Critics said Trump's remarks then belied his reluctance to alienate extreme right-wing groups, whose followers constitute a devoted segment of his political base despite his disavowal of them. Yielding two days later to a mounting political furor over his initial response, Trump delivered a follow-up message expressly referring to the ""KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups"" as ""repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans"". Trump's detractors dismissed his revised statements as too little too late. His remarks on Tuesday inflamed the controversy further. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke immediately applauded Trump on Twitter. ""Thank you President Trump for your honesty and courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville and condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,"" Duke wrote, referring to Black Lives Matter (BLM) and anti-facists. Democrats seized on Trump's latest words as evidence that Trump saw white nationalists and those protesting against them as morally equivalent. ""By saying he is not taking sides, Donald Trump clearly is,"" said Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York. ""When David Duke and white supremacists cheer your remarks, you're doing it very, very wrong."" In a similar vein, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said Trump's characterization of the violence missed the mark. ""Neo-Nazis, Klansmen and white supremacists came to Charlottesville heavily armed, spewing hatred and looking for a fight. One of them murdered a young woman in an act of domestic terrorism, and two of our finest officers were killed in a tragic accident while serving to protect this community. This was not 'both sides,'"" he said. A tweet by former President Barack Obama soon after the violence had garnered 2.8 million ""likes"" to become the most liked Twitter message ever by Tuesday, the social media network said. ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...,"" Obama said in the tweet on Saturday, accompanying a picture of himself looking through an open window at a group of children. Administration officials, hoping to put the controversy behind them after the remarks on Monday, worried that the controversy would now last for days and, potentially, affect the president's ability to achieve legislative and policy goals. Asked about the White House's next steps, one official said: ""I think next steps are just to stop talking"".

Fallout

Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation representing 12.5 million workers, became the latest member of Trump's advisory American Manufacturing Council to resign in protest. ""We cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,"" Trumka said. ""President Trump's remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis"". Three other members of the council — the chief executives of pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co Inc, sportswear company Under Armour Inc and computer chipmaker Intel Corp — resigned on Monday. In Tuesday's remarks, Trump also sympathised with protesters seeking to keep Lee's statue in place but offered no equivalent remarks for those who favored its removal. ""You had people in that group ... that were there to protest the taking down of a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,"" he said. Trump also grouped former presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, two of the nation's founding fathers, together with Confederate leaders such as Lee, Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson, who fought to separate Southern states from the Union, noting that all were slave owners. ""Was George Washington a slave owner? Will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? ... Because he was a major slave owner,"" Trump said. On Tuesday, Trump explained his initial restrained response by saying: ""The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don't make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts."" In what became at times a heated exchange with reporters shouting questions, Trump said, ""You also had people that were very fine people on both sides."" He said that while neo-Nazis and white nationalists ""should be condemned totally"", protesters in the other group ""also had trouble-makers. And you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You got a lot of bad people in the other group too."""
The Tribune: Sport news,"NEW DELHI: The failure to clear the ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the National Cricket Academy was the primary reason why Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were not considered for the Sri Lanka limited overs series.

New Delhi, August 16

The failure to clear the ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the National Cricket Academy was the primary reason why Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were not considered for the Sri Lanka limited overs series.

The Indian team regularly undergoes a series of fitness tests with ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test being the most important of them.

It is an advanced version of the ‘beep’ test that was used by teams of earlier generations. The current Indian team is considered to be the fittest by a fair distance.

It has been learnt that for the current Indian team, the acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. Captain Virat Kohli, easily the fittest Indian cricketer, scores around 21 in the test.

However both Yuvraj and Raina have scored well below the permissible level of 19.5 with Yuvraj barely managing to touch 16, which was the biggest reason for his ouster.

“The current team think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, skipper Virat Kohli and chairman of selectors MSK Prasad have made it clear that fitness standards are non-negotiable.

“On an average, the Australian cricketers score 21 in Yo-Yo test. Here Virat, Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey regularly hit that score while others are either touching 19.5 or is hitting above that score,” a BCCI official, who cannot come on record, told PTI today.

“In an earlier era, when the traditional beep test was in vogue, the Indian players of the 1990’s would have scored around 16 to 16.5 barring a few like Mohammed Azharuddin, Robin Singh or Ajay Jadeja.

“But now it’s different as the skipper himself is hitting the benchmark, which the Australian cricket team sets it,” the official added.

Just for understanding, how the Yo-Yo Test works. Cones are placed to mark out two lines 20 meters apart. A player starts with his foot behind one of the lines, and begins running when instructed. Player continues running between the two lines, turning when signalled by the recorded beeps.

After each minute or so, the pace gets quicker. If the line is not reached in time, the player must run to the line turn and try to catch up with the pace within two more ‘beeps’. The test is stopped if the player fails to catch up with the pace within the two ends.

The entire process is software-based where the results are recorded.

It must be noted that the same test for football and hockey team will produce entirely different results as they have higher benchmarks, considering the speed and endurance level involved with the sport. — PTI"
India-origin kid is overnight hero on British TV,"London, August 16

A 12-year-old Indian-origin contestant on a British television show has become an overnight sensation after he answered all questions correctly.

Rahul, whose surname is not being revealed, got all 14 of his questions correct in the first round of the latest series of 'Child Genius', a show broadcast by Channel 4.

He has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club -- the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world.

However, as neither scientist is recorded as having taken an IQ test, the scores are only estimates.

On the TV show, 20 contestants aged eight to 12 will be whittled down to one winner over the course of a week.

Rahul achieved full marks in a spelling test, correctly reciting the letters in words like garrulous, accouchement, and hyponatraemia (low level of sodium in the blood).

In a timed memory round, he answered 14 questions out of 15 correctly, but did not have time to answer the final question.

""I always want to do the best, and I'll do that no matter what the cost. I think I'm a genius. I'm good at mental maths, general knowledge and I find it quite easy to memorise stuff,"" said Rahul, who cites his favourite language as Latin.

""Most kids want immediate gratification but I also want long-term gratification. If I could play maybe my Xbox now, I'll be really happy now, but I might be sad later on because I haven't revised for my test,"" he said.

His success in the first round of the show made him an instant social media hit.

One Twitter user joked: ""Rahul could negotiate peace between North Korea and the USA.""

While he narrowly lost out in a maths round, he is exempt from elimination due to his high score.

Rahul's IT manager father, Minesh, and pharmacist mother Komal said their son was in the game to win and their role was to encourage him.

""We are here to win. There's no two ways about that.

We're all achievers. I used to play table tennis for Barnet council. We're always trying to better ourselves,"" said Minesh.

The show's finale will take place over the weekend to crown the UK's brightest child. — PTI"

City residents are upbeat after the Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, today announced a slew of welfare and development schemes for the holy city to put it into a higher-growth trajectory.

Amritsar Vikas Manch (AVM) president Kulwant Singh Ankhi welcomed the announcement of construction of Railway Overbridges (ROBs) at level crossings on the Amritsar-Mehta road at Vallah, level crossing No. S-23 on the Amritsar-Attari railway crossing from Putligar Chowk towards Islamabad and another at Jodda Phatak.

The ROBs at Vallah and Putlighar will be undertaken at a cost of Rs 62 crore.

Ankhi said there had been a long-pending demand to raise the ROBs. He appreciated the announcement of the Amritsar City Development Plan at Rs 171.90 crore that would involve construction of an ROB at Jaura Phatak, construction of a flyover from HP Petrol Pump (Batala Road) to Majitha Road at Sant Singh Sukhs Singh Chowk, extension of the existing ROB (Bhandari Bridge), improvement of the façade from the Hall gate to Town Hall and back to Pink Plaza as well as five multi-level parkings at Kairon Market, Machhi Mandi near the Hall gate, near Old Telephone Exchange and outside the Hall gate.

Harpinder Singh Walia, a resident of New Golden Avenue, said level crossings at Jodda phatak (twin gates) over the Amritsar-Jammu and the Amritsar-Delhi lines resulted in their closure most of the time.

He said densely populated localities were situated on both sides and people had to suffer traffic jams for longer hours.

A hotelier, Randhir Singh, said setting up of a Unified Tourism Information and Facilitation Centre would promote tourism in the city.

He said with several tourist projects becoming functional, it was necessary to promote them among tourists and maintain them.

He said the plan to set up public toilets at 17 places in the city, beautification work around Sri Durgiana Mandir and de-congestion of traffic around Ghee Mandi through construction of slip roads and redesigning of congested roundabouts would help devotees to reach Golden Temple conveniently.

Punjab Sudhar Sabha president Balram Kumar Sharma said construction of a Multipurpose Sports and Recreation Facility on 26 acres of the Improvement Trust land at Ranjit Avenue on the Bypass Road would help the youth to wean away from drugs."
New smartphone app to help manage mental illness,"Washington, August 16

Scientists have developed a smartphone app to help middle-aged and older adults self-manage their mental illness and other chronic conditions. The app takes patients through 10 sessions over a period of about three months, covering topics such as stress vulnerability and illness, medication adherence and strategies, and substance and medication abuse. Physicians can remotely monitor app use, and intervene when problems are detected, facilitating telemedicine for less accessible populations. Researchers at Dartmouth College in the US tested the app’s usability. They found that 10 participants (mean age of 55.3 years) with serious mental illness and other chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application. They found that even patients with limited technical abilities could use the app successfully. “The use of mobile health interventions by adults with serious mental illness is a promising approach that has been shown to be highly feasible and acceptable,” said Karen Fortuna from Dartmouth College. These technologies are associated with many advantages compared with traditional psychosocial interventions, including the potential for individually tailored, just-in-time delivery along with wide dissemination and high population impact, researchers said. The process of adapting an existing psychosocial intervention to a smartphone intervention requires adaptation for a high-risk group with limited health and technology literacy, they said. “Smartphone applications also potentially facilitate patient engagement in participatory, personalised and preventative care,” Fortuna said. “As the health care industry increasingly embraces prevention and illness self-management, it is important for physicians and patients to be actively involved in designing and developing new technologies supporting these approaches,” Fortuna added. The study was published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. PTI"

Busting ATM gang was police head’s biggest feat

Having recently hit headlines twice, Kapurthala SSP Sandeep Sharma has made it to the final list of the President Medal awardees for this year.

Sharma recently came in limelight in regard to the arrest of a three-member gang that had committed 34 ATM loots across the region in Punjab, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The gang had looted a huge amount of Rs 3.24 crore and had been indulging in this crime since 2003. It was on his recommendation that CIA inspector Inderjit Singh, who was held by the STF, had been dismissed.

The SSP, however, counts his success on his work done in the past three-four years. “When I was DCP in Ludhiana, I had managed to arrest members of five gangs, including supari killers. Gold bricks too were recovered from this gang,” he said, adding that it was a matter of great satisfaction for him for having been selected for this coveted award."
The Tribune,"LONDON: A 12-year-old Indian-origin contestant on a British television show has become an overnight sensation after he answered all questions correctly.

London, August 16

A 12-year-old Indian-origin contestant on a British television show has become an overnight sensation after he answered all questions correctly.

Rahul, whose surname is not being revealed, got all 14 of his questions correct in the first round of the latest series of 'Child Genius', a show broadcast by Channel 4.

He has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club -- the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world.

However, as neither scientist is recorded as having taken an IQ test, the scores are only estimates.

On the TV show, 20 contestants aged eight to 12 will be whittled down to one winner over the course of a week.

Rahul achieved full marks in a spelling test, correctly reciting the letters in words like garrulous, accouchement, and hyponatraemia (low level of sodium in the blood).

In a timed memory round, he answered 14 questions out of 15 correctly, but did not have time to answer the final question.

""I always want to do the best, and I'll do that no matter what the cost. I think I'm a genius. I'm good at mental maths, general knowledge and I find it quite easy to memorise stuff,"" said Rahul, who cites his favourite language as Latin.

""Most kids want immediate gratification but I also want long-term gratification. If I could play maybe my Xbox now, I'll be really happy now, but I might be sad later on because I haven't revised for my test,"" he said.

His success in the first round of the show made him an instant social media hit.

One Twitter user joked: ""Rahul could negotiate peace between North Korea and the USA.""

While he narrowly lost out in a maths round, he is exempt from elimination due to his high score.

Rahul's IT manager father, Minesh, and pharmacist mother Komal said their son was in the game to win and their role was to encourage him.

""We are here to win. There's no two ways about that.

We're all achievers. I used to play table tennis for Barnet council. We're always trying to better ourselves,"" said Minesh.

The show's finale will take place over the weekend to crown the UK's brightest child. — PTI"
Reporting turbulent times,"ARCHIVES

The Tribune, which continued to print except for a brief break, stood tall in the tough times, mirroring the events that were reshaping the lives of millions

Roopinder Singh

The Tribune, ever the chronicler of the people and events of Punjab, found itself in an unusual situation of becoming the subject of news reports. In the days leading to Partition, two employees were killed in Lahore, one was stabbed. The Tribune ceased publication in Lahore on August 16, 1947. A truck and a car evacuated 94 staff and some of their family members. The printing press it left behind, newsprint, typewriters and a van were given to Pakistan Times by the West Punjab Government. Just 40 days later, on September 25, 1947, the newspaper resumed publication — from Simla. Yes, the printing press was small, staff inadequate, and finances badly crunched, but the paper gave a voice to the people and made them aware of events that were shaping their lives.

A perusal of the files shows that it was on Wednesday, April 9, 1947, that The Tribune had a banner headline “Proposed Partition of Punjab and Bengal”; another one, “Maharaja of Patiala Urges the Princes to Join Constituent Assembly.” Even then, there was hope. On April 21, the banner headline read: “No Partition of Indian Now”.

However, reality soon sunk in, and on June 21 and 23, the headline declared: “Bengal votes for Partition”, and “Punjab to be Partitioned,” with another item highlighting the worsening situation in Amritsar where “100 bombs [were] exchanged by rival mobs.” Details about how various institutions and assets were to be divided are fascinating — instant records have a compelling intensity, even as the fluid situation makes for patchy, chaotic historical narrative.

The August 15 issue declared: “India Wakes to Life and Freedom.” It reported on the historic session of the Constituent Assembly for New Delhi. From Karachi came another report: “Birth of Pakistan an event in History” and another one titled “Goodwill and Friendship with Britain and Hindustan Qwaid-i-Azam Jinnah’s Aim.” Thereafter, the staff was forced to flee from Lahore.

By October, when The Tribune resumed publication in Simla, the horrific deaths and displacement of millions dominated the reporting. There is the story of how Hindus and Sikhs were wiped out in Miani, a village in Pakhtunkhwa. Another day, another story. This about the “Ill-fated train from Pindi to Dadan Khan; Witnesses’ Account of Loot, Murder and Abduction,” even as an adjoining item says “Retaliation Denounced: UP Communists Appeal for Peace”. On October 5, the banner headline is: “4 Columns of 1,15,000 Marching to India: 30,000 Hindu and Sikh Refugees Cross Border. Muslims attack Convoy Near Janarwala.”

A separate story on this page details the efforts of The Tribune’s Refugees Forum, wherein displaced people made efforts to contact their loved ones. By the end of the year, On December 5, 1947, The Tribune was able to announce: “Hindus and Sikhs Evacuated from W. Punjab. Colossal Task Completed Within Allotted Time. Small Pockets Yet to be Cleared. Over 8 Million people cross border.”

One aspect of the task may have been completed, but there was so much more. A new country was being run. This region and its people had borne the brunt of Partition. Millions of lives had been lost, many more millions displaced, rendered homeless, and many families torn apart in the days that led to the Independence of India. The Tribune was, once again, the chronicler of Punjab, serving the people of the state."
Philippine police now say 32 drug suspects killed in one day,"Manila, August 16

Philippine police said on Wednesday that an updated report shows anti-drug operations in a northern province this week left 32 alleged drug offenders dead, 11 more than earlier reported as the highest death toll in a single day since President Rodrigo Duterte launched his war on drugs a year ago. Senior Superintendent Romeo M Caramat Jr said 67 police operations in various parts of Bulacan province on Tuesday left 32 suspects killed in encounters with police, while 109 others were arrested. Confiscated during the operations were more than 200 grams of methamphetamine, 786 grams of marijuana, assorted firearms, grenades and ammunition. Police records show since the nationwide crackdown started, more than 3,200 alleged drug offenders have been killed in gun battles with law enforcers. More than 2,000 others died in drug-related homicides, including attacks by motorcycle-riding masked gunmen and other assaults. Human rights groups report a higher toll and demand an independent investigation into Duterte’s possible role in the violence. AP"
The Tribune: Punjab,"WASHINGTON: A group representing the Sikh-American truck drivers has urged US President Donald Trump to delay the enforcement of a regulation which mandates them to install expensive logging devices on their vehicles.

Washington, August 16

A group representing the Sikh-American truck drivers has urged US President Donald Trump to delay the enforcement of a regulation which mandates them to install expensive logging devices on their vehicles.

The new regulation, to be effective from December 18, will require almost all commercial trucks, unless a truck is in an exempted class, to buy and operate an Electronic Logging Device (ELD) to record the hours they are on and off duty.

An ELD synchronises with a vehicle engine to automatically record driving time, for more accurate hours of service recording.

Industry reports say a wide range of prices exist for different versions of the technology, running from USD 165 to USD 832 annually, the most widely used being USD 495 a truck.

The Sikhs Political Action Committee said the new rules carried a price tag of USD 2 billion and are “not adequately developed for reliability” under mandatory conditions.

“Please save the livelihood of small businesses and truck drivers from the mandate of the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) rule,” Gurinder Singh Khalsa, chairman of the PAC, said.

Khalsa said the federal bureaucracy seemed bogged down to think that more regulations would solve problems on highways.

“In fact, the ELDs are counterproductive and do nothing to improve highway safety,” he said in a letter to Trump on August 14, urging him to delay its implementation “until reasonable solutions can be worked out”, according to a press release by the group.

A large number of truck drivers in the US are of Sikh origin and many of them work in small business enterprises in the trucking industry. PTI"

Insure your assets against natural calamities,"KG Krishnamoorthy Rao

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning. Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides. Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability. During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop. These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery. Time to take a call Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer. The writer is Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited.

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"
India openers Dhawan and Rahul achieve career-best rankings,"Dubai, August 15

KL Rahul broke into the top-10 for the first time at 9th, while Shikhar Dhawan also attained a career-high position of 28th in the latest ICC Test rankings after India’s clean-sweep of Sri Lanka in a three-match series. Left-hander Dhawan, who top-scored with 119 in the final Test in Pallekele, has moved up 10 places to 28th position after India won inside three days on Monday. This was the Delhi batsman’s second century in three Tests as he finished with 358 runs and was named player of the series. Rahul has moved up two positions to equal his career-best ninth position after a contribution of 85 in the opening stand of 188 that came in under 40 overs. Rahul thus equalled his career-best ninth rank attained in July this year but the present tally of 761 ratings points is his highest till date. All-rounder Hardik Pandya’s 96-ball knock of 108 has seen him gain 45 positions to reach a career-best 68th rank among batsmen, while pace bowlers Mohammad Shami (up one place to 19th position) and Umesh Yadav (up one place up to a career-best 21st position) have gained among bowlers. There was good news for Chinaman bowlers too as India’s Kuldeep Yadav and Sri Lanka's Lakshan Sandakan have made rapid strides. Kuldeep, coming in for Ravindra Jadeja, has moved up 29 slots to 58th place after returning with figures of four for 40 and one for 56, while Sandakan’s haul of five for 132 has helped him gain 16 places to reach 57th position. Other Sri Lanka players to move up in the rankings include batsmen Dinesh Chandimal and Niroshan Dickwella. Chandimal has gained two slots to reach 33rd position while Dickwella has gained seven slots to reach a career-best 61st position. In the list for all-rounders, Jadeja has lost the top slot to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hassan after missing the Pallekele Test owing to a one-match suspension after accumulating six demerit points inside a 24-month period. Jadeja has slipped one point behind Shakib’s tally of 431 points but remains at the top of the bowling rankings. Top-ranked India and seventh-placed Sri Lanka have retained their positions in the team rankings with India gaining two points to reach 125 points, increasing its lead over South Africa to 15 points. Meanwhile, England hosts the West Indies for a three-Test series starting Thursday, which it may have to win in order to remain in third position, depending on the results of a two-Test series between Bangladesh and Australia that starts later this month but ends earlier on September 8. Australia will go up to 101 points if it wins the series 2-0. PTI"
Bhatinda,"BATHINDA: The saying ‘Time is a great healer’ seems to be have lost much of its appeal for the two brothers — Harminder Singh Mokha (83) and Gurcharan Singh Mokha (78) — who still live with a heavy heart and bitter memories of Partition. While recalling their partition experiences, Harminder Singh and Gurcharan Singh Mokha said they were leading a royal life in Lal Kurti Bazaar at Rawalpindi.

Bathinda, August 14

The saying ‘Time is a great healer’ seems to be have lost much of its appeal for the two brothers — Harminder Singh Mokha (83) and Gurcharan Singh Mokha (78) — who still live with a heavy heart and bitter memories of Partition.

While recalling their partition experiences, Harminder Singh and Gurcharan Singh Mokha said they were leading a royal life in Lal Kurti Bazaar at Rawalpindi.

Their grandfather, Atar Singh Mokha, was a landlord. They Life turned owned many horses and had employed many servants over there.

They said in March 1947, tension started building up in the Rawalpindi area. Their grandfather was the president of the peace committee.

Along with their paternal uncle Locha Singh, he had called a meeting at Tanch village, which was dominated by Sikhs at that time.

“The meeting was organised at a Muslim resident’s house at the village. It lasted for six hours after which, all of a sudden, the Muslims told the Sikhs present there to vacate the house immediately. When they started moving, Muslims surrounded the house and they started firing on the Sikhs. In this incident, the grandfather and paternal uncle were brutally murdered,” they added.

The military didn’t even hand over the body of Atar Singh Mokha to his father Budh Singh Mokha. An acquaintance gave us kara (symbol of faith in Sikhism) of our grandfather, which he found at the site of the killing, and we have kept it till date,” they said.

“Seeing the tension increasing with each passing day, our family decided to shift from Rawalpindi. We stayed at our Muslim friend’s house near the railway station,” the brothers said.

“A few days later, we went to the railway station to board a train to India. We were horrified to learn at the station that the train which had arrived earlier was full of dead bodies of Sikhs who were killed by Muslims,” the two brothers said.

Mokha brothers said with the grace of God, we were able to cross over to Ferozpur.

“Finally, we reached Bathinda but we didn’t know anyone here,” they said.

“We thought there was many Sikhs living at Ambala Cantonment. We decided to go there but the ticket checker at the railway station told us that our relative, whom we were looking for, was transferred to Bathinda. We were told that we didn’t need to leave as he would arrange for an accommodation here,” they added.

It took 23 days for their relative to reach Bathinda from Pakistan due to the tension.

As many as 25 members of their family stayed in two rooms for many days.

Because of running out of money, the two brothers had to sell their grandmothers jewellery to start a business.

They started a tea shop and later swerved into cloth business. It was not before tremendous struggle and putting in a lot of hard work that they started living a prosperous life.

They said they were allotted land at Fazilka but when their father went to see it, the Army was deployed there.

“The thought of living near the border again gave rise to anxiety. We asked for land somewhere else and after some appeals, we got land in Bathinda,” they said."

Rajbhar, in a letter, has claimed that his child died due to disruption of oxygen supply and has blamed Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh, Medical Education Minister Ashutoh Tandon and Principal Secretary Health Prashant Trivedi for that. He alleged that no post-mortem was done after the child’s death. The complaint was filed on August 14, but no FIR has been registered yet. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, meanwhile, has outright blamed the college principal, Rajiv Mishra, for laxity in performing his duty. He said a team of top ministers was asked to determine if the death of the children was actually due to a disruption in oxygen supply at the hospital and assured “not to spare anyone found guilty”."
Traffic on Jammu-Srinagar highway resumes,"Jammu, August 16

Traffic on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway resumed on Wednesday morning after remaining suspended for nearly 12 hours due to blocking of the road by huge boulders near Banihal, officials said. Huge boulders came rolling down and blocked the highway at Rattanbas in Banihal area on Tuesday night, forcing suspension of the traffic, a spokesman of the traffic department said. The clearance operation started early on Wednesday and the highway was made traffic-worthy by 9.30 am. Light motor vehicles from both sides are plying on the road, the spokesman said. However, heavy vehicles would be allowed from Srinagar to Jammu only due to road-widening work at various places along the highway. PTI"
Suspense over weightlifter Chanu's Arjuna Award continues,"Sabi Hussain

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 15

Glasgow Commonwealth Games gold medallist, weightlifter Sanjita Chanu’s wait for the Arjuna Award has just got extended.

Sports Minister Vijay Goel has apparently refused to accept her recommendation for the award at the moment.

The minister it’s been learnt has demanded more time to revisit the entire list of recommended names for the Arjuna Awards and has delayed the signing of the file.

A meeting between Goel and sports secretary Injeti Srinivas this week is expected to bring finality to the issue on whether or not Chanu would be nominated for the country’s second highest sporting honour.

An earlier meeting between Goel and top ministry officials on Monday had remained inconclusive.

At the meeting, Goel was to put his final stamp of approval on the names of athletes recommended for this year’s Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna Awards.

Goel, however, chose to deliberate further on the names.

Chanu’s name wasn’t there in the original list of 17 sportspersons recommended for the Arjuna Awards.

But, Srinivas included her name in the list, using his executive powers since a secretary can recommend the name of a meritorious athlete.

It’s been learnt that Srinivas had held a discussion with the awards selection committee chairman, Justice (retd) C K Thakkar, in this direction and found Chanu’s case deserving.

Meanwhile, the ministry has rejected the Pullela Gopichand-led Dronacharya Award committee’s recommendation to bestow the honour on para-athlete coach Satyanarayana, who trained Rio Paralympics gold medallist T Mariyappan and bronze winner Varun Bhati.

Satyanarayana’s name was among the three coaches recommended for the country’s highest coaching honour.

But, his name was stuck down after the ministry received an anonymous complaint against the coach, where it’s been revealed that he is involved in legal proceedings at the Saket Court in Delhi.

Satyanarayana had also been found guilty of violating the Sports Code after he simultaneously contested elections for a position in the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI) and Athletics Federation of India (AFI)."

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

As the memory of those horrible days and years fades away, we are itching to reopen some of the settled questions about our collective existence. Perhaps after seventy years it is time, once again, to revisit those blood-stained days and recall Partition’s sobering lessons…

Harish Khare

With rare exceptions, the world has simply not known how to divide a nation amicably and peacefully. The division of India in 1947 to carve out a new state of Pakistan inevitably produced its own ghastly share of violence, dislocation and disruption.

Admittedly, the British decision to grant India independence was principally driven by the simple fact that the four-year-long World War II had totally exhausted the imperial will to rule; in fact, the British desire to hold on to India had already been tested morally and ethically by the Indian National Congress, which under the Mahatma’s leadership had waged a unique peaceful freedom struggle. The British middle classes, with their pretensions to liberal values, had no answer to the Mahatma’s saintly leadership. The Union Jack had to be lowered from Red Fort, sooner than later.

But by the time the British came to the conclusion that they could no longer stay in India, they had already instigated mischief among the Indian leadership. The colonial rulers had cynically worked on the Indian society’s religious fault lines, encouraged and cultivated sectarian agendas which ultimately coalesced into the demand for a separate nation.

The Muslim League, under Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had already legitimised use of violence in pursuit of its demands. The League’s call for ‘Direct Action’ was an invitation to chaos and the mobs. Once a society develops a taste for violence, its leaders are rarely able to calibrate and control the streets. By the time August 15, 1947, came the Muslim League’s leadership skills were already over-extended even in what came to be known as East Pakistan and West Pakistan. In India, the Congress leadership was barely able to push the mobs back.

Still, a monumental tragedy was destined to take place. The sheer scale of the number of Hindus and Sikhs, who found themselves forced to migrate out to India and of the Muslims in India who had to leave for Pakistan, was maddeningly benumbing. Grand statistics simply cannot convey the trauma and the tragedy that engulfed this part of the world soon after August 1947.

A sympathetic American reporter and an eye-witness described the post-Partition days as “one of the great convulsions of modern history.” On December 12, 1947, he tried to convey the nature of disaster that overtook the two nascent nations: “Consider what has happened. In an orgy of religious-communal madness, some 10 million citizens of the north-western provinces had been routed from their homes. An unknown total, probably between 2,00,000 and 5,00,000 (compared to 2,95,000 American war-dead in World War II), had been put to sword, machine-gunned, or roasted alive. The splintered Punjab administrations were quickly swamped and there even appeared danger that the infant central governments of India and Pakistan Dominions might succumb.” Phillips Talbot (An American Witness to India’s Partition).

The frenzy in the East was no less violent, no less gory, no less bloody than it was in the West. The Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs joyfully discovered their capacity for inflicting violence and death on their erstwhile neighbours as well as total strangers. The massacres, the mayhem and the madness outpaced humanity and all known civic-minded virtues; the trauma and tragedy touched nearly every home, every life. No one was unaffected; no one could remain emotionally unmolested by this continental turbulence.

After a few months the mobs could be rolled back and blood could be washed off the streets, but the memory of Partition-centric violence was now etched on the soul of an entire generation on both sides. The two successive states had entrenched habits and protocols of acrimony and suspicion and political leaders and sectarian interests saw to it that India and Pakistan would not settle down to a peaceful co-existence.

The raw memories of Partition also impacted on how the two states went about the business of creating an internal political order. Once Jinnah was gone, Pakistan hastily abandoned his ideas of an inclusive society and nation. In India, the Mahatma was assassinated. The murder was planned by those who wanted to make India a Hindu State and they thought the Old Man was an obstacle. Ironically, the assassination settled, once for all, how India would grant equal protection and equal citizenship to all its minorities.

Perhaps some in India would argue that Partition’s unfinished agenda still remains unattended. May be, after 70 years, we should simply revisit those horrible, horrible days of chaos and disorder before we embark on another self-defeating journey…"

Partition and train-based saviour,"Partition and train-based saviour

Lt-Gen K J Singh (retd)

Lt-Gen K J Singh (retd) While leaving India, the British left behind two Armies with Command HQs at Rawalpindi, Pune and Lucknow. The first challenge came in the form of large-scale riots and arson as a prelude to the impending Partition. As an emergency response, a Punjab Boundary Force and a Military Evacuation Organisation were created. The Boundary Force became operational on August 1, 1947, under Maj Gen TW Reeves based at Lahore. It had 15 Indian and 10 Pak units with legendary officers like Brig KS Thimayya (later rose to be the Chief) from India and Brig Ayub Khan of Pakistan, who later made himself President. The failure of this Border Force is attributed to many factors, including idiosyncrasies of Reeves, and resulted in its disbandment on September 1 and the raising of the Delhi and East Punjab Command under Lt Gen Dudley Russel on 15th September. While the Force proved inadequate, yet it did save many lives, including that of my father (14 year old then) at Adhwal village in Chakwal district, where Sikh Light Infantry evacuated them in the face of marauding rioters in the nick of time. Both nations took over of their respective areas across the new boundary, which was unmarked on ground. The new HQ could not find suitable accommodation and was given a barrack-type hutment at the site where Sena Bhavan stands today in Delhi. Governor-General Mountbatten was more considerate and gave the old Viceregal train for mobile HQ. An initial thought was that like the Boundary Force, the Command would be a temporary requirement. The idea of train-based mobile HQ indeed was unique and a novelty. Mobile HQ took charge of the situation to organise an orderly movement of refugees, saving lives and property. It was greatly aided due to the alignment of the railway line along Grand Trunk Road. Refugee trains were provided with special railway wagons called 'flats' mounted with machine-gun emplacements and armoured car and infantry escorts. Similar escorts were provided to road convoys, my mother, an infant, travelled in one such convoy and lost her father due to mob violence as convoys despite protection got attacked on the way. Kabayali raids resulted in Kashmir being added to the Command's charter and re-designation as the Western Command on 20th Jan 1948 with Lt Gen KM Cariappa (later Field Marshal) as Army Commander. The legacy of mobile HQ has been enshrined in the Western Command museum in the vintage train, restored under expert supervision of the late Lt-Gen SK Sinha, who was a staff officer in this unique HQ."
Out of Touch With the People,"LAHORE, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 15, 1917

NEITHER the people of India nor the powerful section of the Anglo-Indian press seem to be convinced of the plea by the Bengal Government that for six months in the year when its chief officers remove to the hills and conduct the administration from there, they may be considered to be in full touch with the wide country and the people, because the posts and telegraphs and the newspapers keep them duly informed. Commenting on Sir Henry Wheeler's defence of the hill exodus in the Bengal Legislative Council, the Englishman writes:-""If this is the kind of contact with public opinion that the Government relies upon, the sooner it realises its inadequacy the better. It is a second-hand contact. It is not always a reliable contact. The sound and conscientious administrator does not rely on second-hand reports of what the public say and feel and how the public live."" It is seldom that the Indian and the Anglo-Indian press join to condemn the defects of the Government, and when they do, no further proof is required to conform to the unanimous opinion."

Cyber mining virtual money,"A peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, bitcoin is said to be the future of money. Is it really or just a speculator’s dream?

Vaibhav Sharma

There is nothing wrong with online money transfers, and they are convenient for the most part. You can pay with your credit or debit cards, banks accounts and even digital wallets like PayTM that simply let you scan a barcode and transfer money. With things like Samsung and Apple Pay, it seems that the world is headed towards an even more seamless future where all you will ever have to do is wave your phone. But apart from cash transactions, in all these modes of payment there is a middleman who is taking a part of the spend as fee for his efforts in delivering the money, ensuring there is no misuse, and for bookkeeping. With credit cards, you have companies like Visa and MasterCard taking up to almost 3 per cent of the transaction value as fee, and the situation is similar with players like PayTM and Mobikwik. More often than not, this cost has to be borne by the seller. So, is there something that could remove the middleman altogether, but at the same time ensure security and accuracy?

What is it?

It is described as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that is completely decentralised and operates without an intermediary. But what does that really mean? Let’s look at it this way. If you give someone cash, you cease to have that banknote in your possession any more. But that isn’t the case with digital currency. What if you made two copies of the same and sent it to different people. What if you made 100? That would make any digital currency a non-starter. So perhaps there could be a ledger maintained that would keep a track of what you had, and what was sent. The question would then be twofold: Who would maintain such as a ledger, and could that person be trusted? Bitcoin answers all these questions with a remarkably simple, yet secure setup. There is such a ledger, but instead of trusting one person with the bookkeeping, a copy of this ledger is shared with everyone. Whenever bitcoin is spent, a corresponding entry is made in everyone’s ledger and this ensures that no one can cheat the system. The code on which this ledger runs is open source — which means that it is maintained, secured, improved and checked in the public domain under everyone’s watchful eyes.There are a number of ways you can come into possession of bitcoin; the first method is to devote a considerable amount of your computer’s resources to keeping a copy of the ledger described above, and as reward for the same you would be awarded bitcoin. In fact, this is the only way bitcoins can be created. The second and easiest method is to simply buy it from an online bitcoin exchange. If you wish you can also sell something and accept bitcoins as payment, or simply trade your local currency with someone offering bitcoins as barter. To store them, you’ll need something known as a bitcoin wallet.

The risks

The manner in which its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned bitcoin puts a cap on their total number at 21 million. The greater the number of bitcoins in circulation, the lesser will be the speed at which they can be mined/created. While this means inflation will not be an issue with Bitcoin, it does have its own set of challenges. Since it is divorced from the governments or central banks, it is not backed by anything. If you lose a bitcoin because of a hack or for other reasons, there is no getting them back. Further, as they have no inherent value of their own, their worth exists only because there are people willing to accept them. In April 2013, bitcoin went from trading at $266 to about $50, and then rose to $100. In October of the same year, when the dark web portal The Silk Road was seized by the FBI, the price crashed from the $140 region to about $110. When people attempted to capitalise on the fall, the price rose to about $200 in a few weeks. By November 2013, it was trading at over US$1000 at a famous bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox. By April 2014 the prices fell again to about $400, and even fell as low as $200 in early 2015. However, in the last few months, bitcoin has really rallied to climb to over $3000 in August 2017.

The reward

In addition to being quicker, cheaper and more reliable, bitcoin also eliminates the middleman and thus provides a layer of secrecy to the transaction. In fact, it lets you remain largely anonymous, and this is one of the reasons why it was so popular on the dark web. People used it to buy drugs, arms and even services of hitmen on The Silk Route before it was shut down. Even when demonitisation hit the country, a number of people turned to bitcoin in hopes of staying outside the tax net. Things like these make it clear that bitcoins will never been favoured by the government, but if you have the appetite for risk, bitcoins are something that may grow in value even more, after all, there can only be 21 million of them in total, ever. From $50 in 2013 to over $3000 currently is an exponential rise that has made many millionaires. Bitcoin’s acceptability is also growing rapidly with mainstream companies like Expedia getting onboard. Digital currencies are so hot right now, that an offshoot of bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash that was only created on the 1st of August 2017 crossed a valuation of $7 Billion in a day."

Panchkula, August 15

Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki on Tuesday cautioned people against the threats of terrorism and called for united efforts by every citizen to defeat anti-national forces.

The people in the country celebrate various festivals in their own way, but Independence Day is celebrated without any discrimination of religion, caste, creed and language, he said after unfurling the national flag at a state-level function at Panchkula.

Recalling the supreme sacrifices made by freedom fighters, martyrs and soldiers, he said it is our duty to give due respect to their families.

The state government is giving many special benefits to the families of martyrs and their dependents so that they could lead a respectable life, he said.

The governor said it had been decided that like the freedom fighters, the last rites of their wives would also be performed with full state honours.

The government has also raised the financial assistance being given to the family members of the armed forces personnel who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to Rs 50 lakh, Solanki said.

“Today, we can face the challenges of the era of globalisation only if we are united and engaged in protecting the nation,” he said.

It is a matter of pride that campaigns like ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’, ‘Swachh Bharat’, ‘Ek Bharat-Shresth Bharat’, ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Digital India’ and ‘Stand Up India’ were going on to enable the country face new challenges, he said, and called upon the people to contribute to make India a superpower of the 21st century.

Solanki said Haryana had become the leading state in per capita income, industrial production, foreign investment, education, sports, agriculture and transport.

“Growth rate of GDP in the state is higher than the national average. It is growing at a rate of more than seven per cent every year. Here, 33 per cent of the country’s two-wheelers, 50 per cent cars and 52 per cent cranes are manufactured. The government’s enterprise promotion policy is an attempt to make the Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ campaign successful,” he said.

The Governor also highlighted various achievements of the state government in the field of sports, education, skill development and other schemes being implemented for the welfare of all sections of society.

Earlier, he released the ‘Sankalp Se Siddhi’ vision 2022 document of the Panchkula district administration and also honoured freedom fighters, widows of freedom fighters, war widows and some officials of district administration. PTI"

The saying ‘Time is a great healer’ seems to be have lost much of its appeal for the two brothers — Harminder Singh Mokha (83) and Gurcharan Singh Mokha (78) — who still live with a heavy heart and bitter memories of Partition.

While recalling their partition experiences, Harminder Singh and Gurcharan Singh Mokha said they were leading a royal life in Lal Kurti Bazaar at Rawalpindi.

Their grandfather, Atar Singh Mokha, was a landlord. They Life turned owned many horses and had employed many servants over there.

They said in March 1947, tension started building up in the Rawalpindi area. Their grandfather was the president of the peace committee.

Along with their paternal uncle Locha Singh, he had called a meeting at Tanch village, which was dominated by Sikhs at that time.

“The meeting was organised at a Muslim resident’s house at the village. It lasted for six hours after which, all of a sudden, the Muslims told the Sikhs present there to vacate the house immediately. When they started moving, Muslims surrounded the house and they started firing on the Sikhs. In this incident, the grandfather and paternal uncle were brutally murdered,” they added.

The military didn’t even hand over the body of Atar Singh Mokha to his father Budh Singh Mokha. An acquaintance gave us kara (symbol of faith in Sikhism) of our grandfather, which he found at the site of the killing, and we have kept it till date,” they said.

“Seeing the tension increasing with each passing day, our family decided to shift from Rawalpindi. We stayed at our Muslim friend’s house near the railway station,” the brothers said.

“A few days later, we went to the railway station to board a train to India. We were horrified to learn at the station that the train which had arrived earlier was full of dead bodies of Sikhs who were killed by Muslims,” the two brothers said.

Mokha brothers said with the grace of God, we were able to cross over to Ferozpur.

“Finally, we reached Bathinda but we didn’t know anyone here,” they said.

“We thought there was many Sikhs living at Ambala Cantonment. We decided to go there but the ticket checker at the railway station told us that our relative, whom we were looking for, was transferred to Bathinda. We were told that we didn’t need to leave as he would arrange for an accommodation here,” they added.

It took 23 days for their relative to reach Bathinda from Pakistan due to the tension.

As many as 25 members of their family stayed in two rooms for many days.

Because of running out of money, the two brothers had to sell their grandmothers jewellery to start a business.

They started a tea shop and later swerved into cloth business. It was not before tremendous struggle and putting in a lot of hard work that they started living a prosperous life.

They said they were allotted land at Fazilka but when their father went to see it, the Army was deployed there.

“The thought of living near the border again gave rise to anxiety. We asked for land somewhere else and after some appeals, we got land in Bathinda,” they said."

The government has asked all smartphone companies, majority of them Chinese manufacturers, to outline the procedures and processes adopted by them to ensure security and privacy of users’ data. The directive comes amid the standoff between India and China over Doklam, as also rising concerns over imports of Chinese IT and telecom products. “The ministry has given time till August 28 to all companies to furnish their responses,” a senior IT Ministry official said. The official pointed to international and domestic reports about data leaks from mobile phones and said that in the first phase, devices and preloaded software and apps would be under scrutiny. Based on the response of the companies, the ministry will initiate verification and audit of devices where required. It has also warned of penalties under provisions of IT Act 43 (A) in case stipulated processes are not being followed. The official said the objective of the exercise is to ensure that required data security measures are being taken with regard to hardware and software in mobile phones. In all, the IT ministry has written to 21 smartphones makers and majority of these companies are Chinese device manufacturers, the official said. “Any device sold in the country should be compliant with global security standards. If companies fail to comply, further action will be taken,” said the official who did not wish to be identified. IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had called a meeting of senior officials in the department, and representatives of Cert-In and others on August 14 to take stock of the situation, the official added.

Police and paramilitary CRPF personnel are being trained in standard operating procedures (SOPs) to help them deal with stone-throwing incidents in Kashmir, CRPF Director General RR Bhatnagar said on Wednesday. The DG said strategy, training and new SOPs had been formulated. “Using non-lethal ammunition mostly, we along with J&K Police, have devised a strategy to put to work during strikes and stone-pelting and you will see its effect soon,” he said. The DG was talking to reporters on the sidelines of a function held for widows of paramilitary personnel killed on duty. Among the personnel killed was Commandant Pramod Kumar, who died in a militant attack on August 15 last year. On counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir, Bhatnagar said security forces were meeting success. “There is good coordination between J&K Police, Army and CRPF, who are all working as one unit, and the operations will continue in the future as well,” he said. Referring to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen operational commander Yasin Itoo last week, the DG CRPF said seven commanders had been killed this year and 132 terrorists “neutralized”. “In the coming time, we will have more successes,” he said. Bhatnagar refused to speak on the number of militants active in the Valley but maintained that “anti-militancy operations are going on and whoever treads this path, will face action”. On NIA probes into separatist and terror funding, he said these would have an effect. “Illegal things, illicit funds are either for terror or law and order (disturbance) or stone-pelting. The NIA raids will have an effect on them,” he said, adding that there was already a “positive effect”. He said the situation in Kashmir was “definitely under control”. PTI"

It now has 175 million daily users, significantly more than Snapchat’s 161 million, despite widespread bemusement when it was introduced earlier this year. Here’s how to use WhatsApp Status.

Where to find Status

WhatsApp tweaked its user interface with the launch of Status, which has been treated to its own dedicated tab above the conversation list. To access Status, you can either tap the tab or swipe left from the WhatsApp home screen. How to view someone’s status You’ll find a list of statuses on the Status screen in the app – simply tap to watch them. To provide a little feedback on one of your friend’s updates, tap Reply at the bottom of the screen while viewing their status.

Adding yours

To post your own status, hit the My Status button at the top of the Status screen or the circular green icon in the bottom right corner. You can then take a picture, record a video or choose an existing file from your camera roll. Once you’ve made your choice, you can personalise it by adding a caption, emoji, text or drawings to it. You can resize and rotate the emoji with a pinch, and resize and rotate the text, as well as change its colour and font. When you’re happy, tap Send.

Who can view yours?

Nobody that isn’t saved to your phone’s address book can access your statuses. However, you can control which of your contacts can and can’t view them by tinkering with your privacy settings. One the Status screen, tap the menu button in the top right corner, select Status Privacy and choose between the My Contacts Except… and Only Share With... options. You can also see a list of exactly who has viewed your status, unless you’ve disabled Read Receipts for messages in WhatsApp. To re-enable Read Receipts, navigate to Settings > Account > Privacy and check the Read Receipts box. Been there, done that? Delete it Though status updates automatically disappear after 24 hours, you can delete yours early if you want to. On the Status screen, tap the three dots next to the My Status button, tap and hold the update you want to get rid of and hit the delete icon.

Or else, mute

You can easily mute a status too, in order to stop it from appearing at the top of the list on your Status screen. Just tap and hold the update you want to mute and select Mute when the option appears. In order to unmute any statuses you’ve muted, head to the Status screen, scroll down the page to the Muted Statuses section and tap and hold the update you’d like to unmute.— The Independent"
Emojis in work e-mails may portray low competence,"Jerusalem

Using a smiley face emoji or similar emoticons in work-related e-mails may not create a positive impression and could actually portray low competence, a study suggests.

""Our findings provide first-time evidence that, contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence. In formal business e-mails, a smiley is not a smile,"" said Ella Glikson, a post doctorate fellow at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) in Israel.

Researchers conducted a series of experiments with a total of 549 participants from 29 different countries.

In one experiment, participants were asked to read a work-related e-mail from an unknown person and then evaluate both the competence and warmth of that person.

All the participants received similar messages. Some included smileys while others did not.

Researchers found that in contrast to face-to-face smiles, which increase both competence and warmth, the smileys in an e-mail had no effect on the perception of warmth, and in fact had a negative effect on the perception of competence.

""The study also found that when the participants were asked to respond to e-mails on formal matters, their answers were more detailed and they included more content-related information when the e-mail did not include a smiley,"" Glikson said.

""We found that the perceptions of low competence if a smiley is included in turn undermined information sharing,"" she said.

In another experiment, the use of a smiley was compared to a smiling or neutral photograph. The findings show that in case of a photograph, a smiling sender was perceived as more competent and friendly than a neutral one.

However, when an e-mail on formal work-related matters included a smiley, the sender was perceived as less competent. The smiley did not influence the evaluation of the sender's friendliness, researchers said.

The team also found that when the gender of the e-mail writer was unknown, recipients were more likely to assume that the e-mail was sent by a woman if it included a smiley.

However, this attribution did not influence the evaluation of competence or friendliness.

""People tend to assume that a smiley is a virtual smile, but the findings show that in the case of the workplace, at least as far as initial 'encounters' are concerned, this is incorrect,"" Glikson said.

""For now, at least, a smiley can only replace a smile when you already know the other person. In initial interactions, it is better to avoid using smileys, regardless of age or gender,"" she added.

The study was published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. PTI"

Decrypting your home loan eligibility,"Harshil Mehta

Home is where the heart is. Though owning a home may mean different things to different individuals, one thing is common —we all want to own a home. Given the expense involved, most people prefer to avail a home loan to finance this dream, which is one of the most important decisions and undertakings in his life. Applying for a home loan can often seem like a complex process but one must be aware about some of its key aspects. Some important factors to be considered while applying for a home loan are as follows:

Income

This is the most important factor with a strong bearing on home loan eligibility. If the applicant is a salaried employee, then banks and financial institutions will consider his salary and age. This basically means that the loan eligibility will be evaluated on the basis of his income and the number of years the individual has worked. Lenders also reconfirm the individual’s repayment capability and the tenure of his job. One can also club his spouse’s income to enhance his home loan eligibility and can apply for a joint home loan.

Age factor

While applying for a home loan, banks and financial institution check the age of the borrower as this assesses the number of years the applicant would work. It is often believed that a joint home loan is easily available, but this is not the case always. Age of the co-applicant is also vital while applying for a home loan. For example, Brinda Roy, 29 years old takes a home loan with the co-applicant being her mother who is 60+, then the loan tenure will be calculated mainly on the basis of the age of the older person. The tenure of the loan will be restricted from 10-15 years depending on the bank or financial institution. If Brinda was individually applying for a home loan then her eligibility would depend more on her individual credit score than her age.

Debt

If an individual is applying for a home loan with other outstanding loans such as a car loan or personal loan it may affect his home loan eligibility. If one already has an existing home loan with over 12 unpaid instalments, banks and financial institutions generally take this into account while calculating the borrower’s eligibility. In such a situation, it is important to prepay full or half of their existing outstanding loans to improve their eligibility and ensure that their new application for the home loan remains unaffected.

Credit score

To qualify for a home loan, a good credit score is very important which usually ranges from 400 to 900. Banks and financial institutions prefer to lend to borrowers with credit score higher than 750 since it reflects stronger credit worthiness. This gives a clear picture about the applicant’s credit history, past payment behaviour and makes way for attractive interest rates for the borrower. Before applying for a home loan, it is most critical to check eligibility criterion. It is also very important for the applicant to know the amount they are eligible for and at what interest rate, which will help you to optimise chances of loan approval. Additionally, improving one’s loan eligibility will also have positive impacts on one’s personal financial planning and help move towards better financial security in life. The writer is CEO, DHFL.

The Tribune: World news,"WASHINGTON: An anti-racism tweet by former United States President Barack Obama after the Charlottesville violence has become the most liked tweet ever.

Washington, August 16

An anti-racism tweet by former US President Barack Obama after the Charlottesville violence in which he quoted iconic South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela has become the most liked tweet ever, garnering more than 2.8 million likes.

“No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion,” the tweet read.

“This Tweet from @BarackObama just became the most Liked Tweet ever. It set the record at approximately 10:07 EST,” a Silicon Valley-based social media company said in a statement.

The tweet has been endorsed by more than 2.8 million social media users and has also been retweeted by over 1.2 million times.

“It is also currently the 5th most Retweeted Tweet ever,” the company statement said.

The record of most retweeted tweet is by Carter Wilkerson who tweeted earlier this year, “Help me please, a man needs his nuggs.”

On Monday, Obama’s tweet surpassed talk show host Ellen DeGeneres’ 2014 Oscars selfie tweet, which stands at number 3 with 2.4 million likes.

The Obama tweet became the most liked ever, taking the top spot from pop star Ariana Grande’s tweet which has 2.7 million likes.

Her heartfelt tweet had come in response to a terrorist bombing that killed 22 people after she performed a concert in Manchester, England, in May.

Obama’s tweet, which quotes a line from Mandela’s autobiography ‘Long Walk to Freedom’ came after a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 others were injured when a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Two police officers also died on Saturday when their helicopter monitoring the rally crashed. PTI"

Can’t worry about future of Tests while playing: Kohli,"Pallekele, August 14

Scoreboard

India’s first ever overseas whitewash has come against a below-par Sri Lanka but skipper Virat Kohli feels it doesn’t take away anything from the victory and their effort. Also, he doesn’t want to reflect on the future of Test cricket in the backdrop of the lop-sided series. “We are winning and the momentum is with the team. When playing, we don’t think where Test cricket is headed and what the future will be,” said Kohli. “We consider it a privilege that we are able to play Test cricket for the country. Our mindset hasn’t changed one bit till now.” Kohli, however, did agree that the situation is much better if both the teams are on an even keel. “When both teams play good cricket, it is a cracker of a series... If any team plays very well in a series, you will get such results. When both teams play with equal intensity, the matches will be close, and so will be the series,” he said. — PTI

"Yuvraj, Raina failed ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the NCA","The failure to clear the ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test at the National Cricket Academy was the primary reason why Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were not considered for the Sri Lanka limited overs series.

The Indian team regularly undergoes a series of fitness tests with ‘Yo-Yo’ endurance test being the most important of them.

It is an advanced version of the ‘beep’ test that was used by teams of earlier generations. The current Indian team is considered to be the fittest by a fair distance.

It has been learnt that for the current Indian team, the acceptable ‘Yo-Yo’ score is 19.5 and upwards. Captain Virat Kohli, easily the fittest Indian cricketer, scores around 21 in the test.

However both Yuvraj and Raina have scored well below the permissible level of 19.5 with Yuvraj barely managing to touch 16, which was the biggest reason for his ouster.

“The current team think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, skipper Virat Kohli and chairman of selectors MSK Prasad have made it clear that fitness standards are non-negotiable.

“On an average, the Australian cricketers score 21 in Yo-Yo test. Here Virat, Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey regularly hit that score while others are either touching 19.5 or is hitting above that score,” a BCCI official, who cannot come on record, told PTI today.

“In an earlier era, when the traditional beep test was in vogue, the Indian players of the 1990’s would have scored around 16 to 16.5 barring a few like Mohammed Azharuddin, Robin Singh or Ajay Jadeja.

“But now it’s different as the skipper himself is hitting the benchmark, which the Australian cricket team sets it,” the official added.

Just for understanding, how the Yo-Yo Test works. Cones are placed to mark out two lines 20 meters apart. A player starts with his foot behind one of the lines, and begins running when instructed. Player continues running between the two lines, turning when signalled by the recorded beeps.

After each minute or so, the pace gets quicker. If the line is not reached in time, the player must run to the line turn and try to catch up with the pace within two more ‘beeps’. The test is stopped if the player fails to catch up with the pace within the two ends.

The entire process is software-based where the results are recorded.

It must be noted that the same test for football and hockey team will produce entirely different results as they have higher benchmarks, considering the speed and endurance level involved with the sport. — PTI"
Skipper Upul Tharanga pleads for patience ahead of India ODIs,"Colombo, August 16

A day after Sri Lanka’s Test captain Dinesh Chandimal apologised for a 3-0 series whitewash against India, limited-overs captain Upul Tharanga has asked fans for patience ahead of their upcoming ODIs and Twenty20 matches. Sri Lanka failed to challenge the world’s top-ranked Test side during the three-match series and the gulf in quality between the two sides was clearly visible. They also suffered their maiden one-day international series loss to Zimbabwe last month, prompting long-serving captain Angelo Mathews to step down. Sri Lanka next play five ODIs and a Twenty20 against the Virat Kohli-led India, starting on Sunday, which will be Tharanga’s first as full-time captain. “Every team goes through a rough patch,” Tharanga said in a statement from Sri Lanka Cricket. “This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are. “Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for good 18 years–don’t forget this now when we are going through a rough patch.” The 32-year-old said the 1996 World Cup winners had already identified areas for improvement. “These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes–however, it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith,” Tharanga said. Sri Lanka have recalled all-rounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana to their limited-overs squad and Tharanga was confident of defeating India. “Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India,” he said. “We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.” Squad: Upul Tharanga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella (wicketkeeper), Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando.

Sabi Hussain

Devendra Jhajharia’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing ever since his name was recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. While there is a deluge of congratulatory messages on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, his native home in Rajasthan is being frequented by politicians and bureaucrats.

The award has suddenly brought the focus on this two-time Paralympics gold medalist. “It’s been a surreal few days,” said an elated Jhajharia over the phone from his village Jhajharian ki Dhani in Churu district.

“It’s like a dream come true. I waited 12 years for this honour, since winning the gold at 2004 Athens Paralympics. The award has given a ray of hope to other para athletes in the country,” said the javelin thrower and Rio Paralympics gold medalist.

August 29 would, indeed be, a watershed moment in para-athletics, as Jhajharia will become the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Each day a new fight

For para-athletes, such moments of joy during their professional career are far and few between. Instead, they have an everyday fight on their hand for recognition, equality and, more importantly, against bureaucratic red-tapism.

Last month, para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande was forced to beg in Berlin, Germany, after she apparently ran out of money to meet her expenses while competing in a week-long tournament.

Recently, a 62-member Indian contingent of hearing-impaired athletes, returning after its best-ever performance at the Deaf Olympic Games in Turkey, protested when no official from the Sports Ministry or the Sports Authority of India came to receive them at the Delhi International Airport. “Time and again, we have been failed by the system,” said Haryana’s Paralympian and Arjuna awardee discus thrower Amit Saroha.

Spurred by taunts

Recalling his struggle, Saroha said the fight was not about coming out of the hospital following a horrific car accident in 2007 but being able to find acceptance in the society.

“I wanted encouragement, not sympathy. I wanted the Tri-colour wrapped around my body, not a consoling hand on my shoulder,” said Saroha, a gold medallist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Para Games and a silver medalist at 2015 and 2017 editions of the World Championships.

“My lower body had become paralysed after the accident. I didn’t want to sit idle at home. Since I had been a National-level hockey player until 2003, I decided to participate in throw ball and discus throw events. But, the Paralympic Committee of Haryana (PCH) refused to accept my candidature,” said Saroha.

“The accident had left me quadriplegic (with paralysis of all four limbs). The PCH officials were convinced that my upper body wouldn’t be able to generate the strength required to throw the discus. I had to run from pillar-to-post for my selection in the Indian team. It was only when I won my first international medal (a silver in discus throw) at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Para Games that the attitude of people changed,” added the 32-year-old from Sonepat.

Jhajharia had his own poignant tale to share.

“Since childhood, I was considered physically weak. My classmates would make fun of my thin frame. To become physically stronger, I started participating in sports. But things took a turn for the worse. At eight, while climbing a tree, I was electrocuted after accidently touching a live wire. This led to the amputation of my left arm. I would be taunted with comments like “tundla ho gaya hai” (his hand has become disabled). It was a nightmare.”

“In 1995, I participated in a district-level championship for students. All other participants were able-bodied. I became district champion after winning the tournament. That was the turning point of my life. Later, when I won gold medal at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2002 and at the Athens Paralympic Games in 2004, I shut the mouth of all those who had told my parents that I wouldn’t be able to do anything in my life,” added the 36-year-old.

What keeps them going

“Simple, to see the Tricolour rise and hear the National Anthem during the medal ceremony. People who have never experienced it won’t understand. You can’t describe the feeling of pride in words,” said high-jumper Sharad Kumar, who won a silver medal at the recent World Para-athletics in London.

“It’s also our way of living with dignity. We para-athletes feel ignored and discriminated. But, we have found solace in sports. I only have problem with my leg but the able-bodied have problem with their mind and heart. They are more disabled than us,” added the 2014 Incheon Para Asian Games gold medalist, who suffered paralysis of his left leg after being administered wrong medicine for polio at the age of two.

Tragedy struck Sundar Singh Gurjar when he lost his left hand in a car accident in 2015. He created history by becoming the first Indian to win gold in men’s javelin throw event at the Worlds recently.

“I had been competing as a javelin thrower till that fateful evening. But, before anybody could point a finger at me, I made sure to continue pursuing my sports career. I didn’t want people to make fun of my disability.”

The gold at the Worlds was a redemption for Gurjar, who missed an announcement call for his name at the Rio Paralympics as he failed to understand the accent of the announcer. He reached the arena a minute late to find that he’d been disqualified.

“This shows the indifferent attitude of the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI). What exactly was the official attached to our contingent doing when my name was called? The PCI official should have ensured my participation. I was left to fend for myself,” Gurjar said.

Giving back to the game

In spite of the hardships faced by them, these shining lights of para-athletics are a role model for other differently abled athletes. Saroha spends his entire salary of Rs 40,000 per month — which he earns as a coach at the SAI’s Sonepat centre — on providing training and arranging for exposure trips abroad of some of his protégés like Dharambir Nain, Amit Balwan, Sunil, Rampal Chahar, Rinku Hooda and Ekta, among others. At present, Saroha is funding 17 para-athletes.

“If I’ll help others, only then God will help me,” said Saroha.

“Whatever cash award I receive from the Haryana government, I spend the amount on funding my trainees. I don’t want other para-athletes to go through the same struggle I was subjected to.”

Both Jhajharia and Deepa Malik, Rio Paralympics silver medallists from Haryana, have written to their respective state governments to provide them land to open a sports academy for para-athletes in Jaipur and Gurugram, respectively."

Another mismatch as India win 3-0

Also in this section

Gorakhdhanda

India completed another dominant win over Sri Lanka on Monday, by an innings and 171 runs and within three days, to record a 3-0 triumph in the series. Following on, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 181 in the second session of play, surrendering to the guile of Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, who took nine wickets among them. In series involving at least three Tests, this is the first time India whitewashed another team in its own backyard. Virat Kohli and his men deserve credit for that. Shikhar Dhawan, making a comeback, led the way with 358 runs in three Tests, while spinners Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja grabbed 30 wickets between them, and Shami took another 10. Kohli would be the first to acknowledge that India - though they played great cricket - were favoured by fortune. Kohli won the toss in each Test, and promptly chose to bat. His batsmen took advantage of the first-day pitch each time, against an indifferent bowling attack - at the end of the first day’s play in the three Tests, India were 399/3, 344/3 and 329/6. India three first-innings totals were 600, 622/9 and 487. Sri Lanka couldn't cope with the pressure. They did not touch 400 even once, and were bowled for less than 200 in three of the six innings. The Indian team had the good fortune to catch a Sri Lankan team low on experience, ability and confidence. Sri Lanka lost a home Test to Bangladesh in March, and were put under great pressure by Zimbabwe last month. Not too long ago, when Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan were still playing, Sri Lanka was a very difficult place to tour. Even the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble managed to win only one series in Sri Lanka. Kohli, however, has a perfect record there —two out of two series won in Sri Lanka. It’s a creditable record, though it also indicates how low Sri Lanka have fallen."

The arrest of separatists and the charges against them go far beyond managing security. The hints are clear: the Centre won't concede any political ground to hardliners, and, any talk of talks would come later

[ + read story ]

ON July 24, seven Kashmiri separatist leaders were arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for allegedly funding militancy and unrest in Kashmir. It marked a shift in government’s policy to deal with secessionism in Kashmir. It is defined by iron fist with no valet glove.

The arrests followed a series of raids by the NIA that continued for over a month. Apart from active separatist workers, a battery of businessmen is also under scanner within and outside Kashmir, making the crackdown more target-oriented. Only this week the Enforcement Directorate raided a prominent business man of Kashmir.

Such crackdowns — conducted in the past too — related to alleged unlawful activities, in which cases were formally registered for follow-up investigations. But these yielded no results. The general belief among security agencies is that the hawala money has been pumped through cash, trade and funding through Middle East, but nothing has been established conclusively. The NIA probe, however, appears aimed at fixing the separatists and their alleged links to hawala channels.

The police, state intelligence and Central agencies maintain that hawala money has been used to fund street protests, subversive activities, violence and militancy in the state. According to the J&K government, 173 cases of funding have been registered in the state since 2001 till last year.

“Charge-sheets were issued in 90 cases, 45 were under investigation and 23 are awaiting sanction. Nine cases were untraced and six not admitted,” says a senior official. The police require the state home department’s sanction to proceed in the cases under various laws. Some of the cases were:

2011: Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, a key aide of hardline Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani was arrested along with three others with alleged hawala money of Rs 21 lakh. The case was later handed to the NIA.

2002: J&K Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik was arrested after his aide was held on way to Srinagar from Nepal along with $100,000. A charge-sheet followed.

2006: Delhi Police slapped charges of funding separatist organizations on a Dubai-based Kashmiri businessman close to Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.

These cases have only dragged on. The separatists have called the seizures and arrests as “a campaign of vilification”. Their denial lent some weight when last year Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, in a written response to a question in the state Assembly, denied having received any report about separatist leaders receiving hawala money.

What’s different now?

While the security situation on the ground remains fluid, the NIA has extended its role in targeting the entire separatist spectrum. “The operation is to basically explore a co-relation between funding from Pakistan and Hurriyat as well as militants,” an official privy to NIA investigations said. “The state police have been treating individuals of terrorist organizations invoking section 18 & 20 of UA(P) (Unlawful Activities Prevention) Act and the NIA is targeting organizations as a whole, including their hierarchy (section 38 UA(P) Act,” the officer said.

This is perhaps the first time section 38 UA(P) has been invoked in the state.

Hot on the money trail in Srinagar, Jammu, Haryana and Delhi, the NIA has tightened its noose and arrested seven Kashmiri separatist leaders for allegedly funding militancy.

The arrested separatists included Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Altaf Funtoosh (Geelani’s son-in-law and in-charge of legal cell in Hurriyat), Ayaz Akbar (Hurriyat spokesman), Raja Mehrajuddin Kalwal (district president of Srinagar for Geelani-led Tehreek-e-Hurriyat), Peer Saifullah (Geelani’s aide), Aftab Hilali Shah alias Shahid-ul-Islam (spokesman for Mirwaiz-led Hurriyat), Nayeem Khan (National Front chairman) and Farooq Ahmad Dar alias Bitta Karate (head of a JKLF faction). The sleuths have summoned at least over two dozen people for questioning, including Geelani’s sons.

The separatists were arrested in connection with the terror funding case under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war against Republic of India), 121A (conspiring to commit certain offences against the state) of IPC and sections 13 ( punishment for unlawful activities), 16 (punishment for terrorist act), 17 (punishment for raising funds for terrorist act), 18 (punishment for conspirac), 20 (punishment for being a member of terrorist gang or organization), 38 (offence relating to membership of terrorist organization), 39 (offence relating to support given to terrorist organization), 40 (offence of raising funds of Unlawful for a terrorist organization) of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

‘War against India’

The investigations began in the follow-up of a television expose that found Nayeem Khan, Karate and Javed Baba conceding that they received funding from Pakistan to perpetuate secessionist activities in Kashmir. The NIA later registered a case on May 30, against the separatist and secessionist leaders, including the members and cadres of the Hurriyat Conference, who have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed organizations Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Dukhtarane Millat, Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and other militant organizations. These outfits allegedly raised, received and collected funds through various illegal means, including hawala. Some of the charges relate to funding separatist and terrorist activities, including throwing stones on security forces, burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India.

J&K former Director General of Police K Rajendra Kumar says NIA is a professional organization and the investigation will definitely have impact on the ground. “They (NIA officials) have all the data and are immune to interference from any quarter. You need to cut the oxygen of funding. Once that is done, you will see an impact on the situation,” he says. “The investigation of funding is a specialist job. The NIA has the logistics to investigate such cases.”

Separatists, who have termed the crackdown aimed at “defaming them and their movement”, have roped in Kashmiri lawyers to defend their case. While the lawyers may question the jurisdiction of NIA in J&K, the separatist have a tough road ahead. Their shutdown call against the NIA crackdown did not evoke an effective response from the people.

“The NIA crackdown may trouble us, but in the end New Delhi will be a loser. Any further delay in resolving the Kashmir issue will only harm the government,” says a separatist leader.

"Day after skirmishes, Army officers of India, China meet in Leh","New Delhi, August 16

Army officers of India and China met on Wednesday in Leh's Chusul sector, a day after border guards foiled an attempt by Chinese soldiers to enter Indian territory along the banks of Pangong lake in Ladakh.

(Follow

)

Official sources said yesterday's incident at Pangong and ways to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Sino-India border in Ladakh were discussed at length at the border personnel meeting (BPM).

Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tried to enter the Indian side in two areas -- Finger Four and Finger Five -- twice between 6 am and 9 am yesterday. But on both the occasions their attempts were thwarted by alert Indian troops.

After Chinese troopers found their path blocked by ITBP personnel who formed a human chain, they began hurling stones, prompting a swift retaliation by Indian border guards.

The Chinese troops had managed to enter up to Finger Four area in the region from where they were sent back. This area has been a bone of contention between India and China as both claim it to be a part of their territory.

When asked about yesterday's incident in Ladakh, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters, ""This is not a subject on which the government makes a comment on.""

The sources said today's BPM was pre-scheduled and the issues discussed included strengthening of existing mechanism for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border.

Brigadier ranked officers of both sides attended the meeting.

Two-thirds of the Pangong Lake are controlled by China while one-third of it is controlled by India.

The incidents in Ladakh took place amid a face-off between Indian and Chinese armies in Dokalam in India-Bhutan-China trijunction which has entered the third month.

Official sources said notwithstanding the standoff, sweets were exchanged between the Indian Army and PLA troops in multiple border locations including in Dokalam.

Exchange of sweets on Independence Day and Republic Day has been a tradition for last several years. — PTI"

Sabi Hussain

Devendra Jhajharia’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing ever since his name was recommended for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. While there is a deluge of congratulatory messages on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, his native home in Rajasthan is being frequented by politicians and bureaucrats.

The award has suddenly brought the focus on this two-time Paralympics gold medalist. “It’s been a surreal few days,” said an elated Jhajharia over the phone from his village Jhajharian ki Dhani in Churu district.

“It’s like a dream come true. I waited 12 years for this honour, since winning the gold at 2004 Athens Paralympics. The award has given a ray of hope to other para athletes in the country,” said the javelin thrower and Rio Paralympics gold medalist.

August 29 would, indeed be, a watershed moment in para-athletics, as Jhajharia will become the first Paralympian to receive the Khel Ratna Award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

Each day a new fight

For para-athletes, such moments of joy during their professional career are far and few between. Instead, they have an everyday fight on their hand for recognition, equality and, more importantly, against bureaucratic red-tapism.

Last month, para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande was forced to beg in Berlin, Germany, after she apparently ran out of money to meet her expenses while competing in a week-long tournament.

Recently, a 62-member Indian contingent of hearing-impaired athletes, returning after its best-ever performance at the Deaf Olympic Games in Turkey, protested when no official from the Sports Ministry or the Sports Authority of India came to receive them at the Delhi International Airport. “Time and again, we have been failed by the system,” said Haryana’s Paralympian and Arjuna awardee discus thrower Amit Saroha.

Spurred by taunts

Recalling his struggle, Saroha said the fight was not about coming out of the hospital following a horrific car accident in 2007 but being able to find acceptance in the society.

“I wanted encouragement, not sympathy. I wanted the Tri-colour wrapped around my body, not a consoling hand on my shoulder,” said Saroha, a gold medallist at the 2014 Incheon Asian Para Games and a silver medalist at 2015 and 2017 editions of the World Championships.

“My lower body had become paralysed after the accident. I didn’t want to sit idle at home. Since I had been a National-level hockey player until 2003, I decided to participate in throw ball and discus throw events. But, the Paralympic Committee of Haryana (PCH) refused to accept my candidature,” said Saroha.

“The accident had left me quadriplegic (with paralysis of all four limbs). The PCH officials were convinced that my upper body wouldn’t be able to generate the strength required to throw the discus. I had to run from pillar-to-post for my selection in the Indian team. It was only when I won my first international medal (a silver in discus throw) at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Para Games that the attitude of people changed,” added the 32-year-old from Sonepat.

Jhajharia had his own poignant tale to share.

“Since childhood, I was considered physically weak. My classmates would make fun of my thin frame. To become physically stronger, I started participating in sports. But things took a turn for the worse. At eight, while climbing a tree, I was electrocuted after accidently touching a live wire. This led to the amputation of my left arm. I would be taunted with comments like “tundla ho gaya hai” (his hand has become disabled). It was a nightmare.”

“In 1995, I participated in a district-level championship for students. All other participants were able-bodied. I became district champion after winning the tournament. That was the turning point of my life. Later, when I won gold medal at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in 2002 and at the Athens Paralympic Games in 2004, I shut the mouth of all those who had told my parents that I wouldn’t be able to do anything in my life,” added the 36-year-old.

What keeps them going

“Simple, to see the Tricolour rise and hear the National Anthem during the medal ceremony. People who have never experienced it won’t understand. You can’t describe the feeling of pride in words,” said high-jumper Sharad Kumar, who won a silver medal at the recent World Para-athletics in London.

“It’s also our way of living with dignity. We para-athletes feel ignored and discriminated. But, we have found solace in sports. I only have problem with my leg but the able-bodied have problem with their mind and heart. They are more disabled than us,” added the 2014 Incheon Para Asian Games gold medalist, who suffered paralysis of his left leg after being administered wrong medicine for polio at the age of two.

Tragedy struck Sundar Singh Gurjar when he lost his left hand in a car accident in 2015. He created history by becoming the first Indian to win gold in men’s javelin throw event at the Worlds recently.

“I had been competing as a javelin thrower till that fateful evening. But, before anybody could point a finger at me, I made sure to continue pursuing my sports career. I didn’t want people to make fun of my disability.”

The gold at the Worlds was a redemption for Gurjar, who missed an announcement call for his name at the Rio Paralympics as he failed to understand the accent of the announcer. He reached the arena a minute late to find that he’d been disqualified.

“This shows the indifferent attitude of the Paralympics Committee of India (PCI). What exactly was the official attached to our contingent doing when my name was called? The PCI official should have ensured my participation. I was left to fend for myself,” Gurjar said.

Giving back to the game

In spite of the hardships faced by them, these shining lights of para-athletics are a role model for other differently abled athletes. Saroha spends his entire salary of Rs 40,000 per month — which he earns as a coach at the SAI’s Sonepat centre — on providing training and arranging for exposure trips abroad of some of his protégés like Dharambir Nain, Amit Balwan, Sunil, Rampal Chahar, Rinku Hooda and Ekta, among others. At present, Saroha is funding 17 para-athletes.

“If I’ll help others, only then God will help me,” said Saroha.

“Whatever cash award I receive from the Haryana government, I spend the amount on funding my trainees. I don’t want other para-athletes to go through the same struggle I was subjected to.”

Both Jhajharia and Deepa Malik, Rio Paralympics silver medallists from Haryana, have written to their respective state governments to provide them land to open a sports academy for para-athletes in Jaipur and Gurugram, respectively."

Two food inspectors suspended for alleged wheat pilferage,"Ludhiana, August 16

Two food inspectors have been suspended here for alleged pilferage of wheat meant for the public distribution scheme.

"The Tribune, India news","NEW DELHI: Hyderabad University Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula did not commit suicide because of any pressure exerted by union ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya or university's Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile and that it was a decision ""of his own"", an inquiry commission has found.

New Delhi, August 16

Hyderabad University Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula did not commit suicide because of any pressure exerted by union ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya or university's Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile and that it was a decision ""of his own"", an inquiry commission has found.

Opposition parties and activists have slammed the report that said Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula, who allegedly committed suicide last year, did not kill himself due to university action against him.

“(T)he suicide did not relate to any activities of the university administration or the political leaders (then HRD Minister Smriti Irani and Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya), including Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile. It was wholly a decision of his own.

""His suicide note is on the record, which shows that Rohith Vemula had his own problems and was not happy with the worldly affairs,"" said the report of the commission set up by the Union Human Resource Development Ministry.

The one-man commission, headed by Allahabad High Court judge (retd) A.K. Roopanwal, was constituted in 2016 following Vemula's suicide that triggered protests by students in Hyderabad and elsewhere.

The commission had submitted its findings to the HRD Ministry in December 2016, which was made public on Tuesday.

""He (Vemula) did not blame anybody for his suicide. If he would have been angry with the decision of the university, certainly either he would have written in specific words or would have indicated in this regard....

""This shows that the circumstances prevailing in the university at that time were not the reason for committing suicide,"" it said.

The report also sought to clarify that Vemula did not belong to the Scheduled Castes category. He came from ""Vaddera"" community, and thus belonged to the OBC category, it said.

""The evidence on record shows that she (Vemula's mother) belongs to Vaddera community and, therefore, the Scheduled Castes certificate issued to Rohith Vemula cannot be said to be a genuine one and he was not a Scheduled Caste person,"" it said.

Vemula's mother V. Radhika claimed to hail from ""Mala"" community, which is considered a Scheduled Caste. After getting divorce from her husband V. Manikumar -- who belonged to Vaddera community -- in 1990, she alone raised Vemula.

Moreover, the commission did not find any proof of discrimination against Vemula on account of his caste, which could have eventually led to his suicide.

""Nothing has been brought before me by which it could be shown that he was ever given a different treatment from that to the General category students by the university authorities during his stay in the university,"" it stated.

Vemula was among the four students, who had been barred from accessing the hostel premises and other public spaces within the university as a proctorial inquiry punishment in August 2015, for abusing and beating up ABVP activist N. Susheel Kumar over a Facebook post.

Vemula committed suicide on January 17, 2016, by hanging.

Report presents govt's version: Dalit rights activist

Slamming the report, academic scholar and Dalit rights activist Kancha Ilaiah alleged that the report has been written to present the government's version of the story.

""What surprises me is that what the then HRD minister Smriti Irani had said about Vemula's death is what forms the content of the report.

""We would have taken it more seriously if Irani would have then said 'look we do not know what happened and we are constituting an enquiry to know about it',"" Ilaiah told reporters, adding ""What the minister wanted to say is all what has been written in the report"".

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he has been demanding a probe in the matter by a sitting Supreme Court judge for the truth to come out, asking ""what can a retired judge say when the government has already made up its mind?""

Congress' Rajeev Gowda also slammed the report saying it was a ""sham"".

""It insults the memory of Vemula and the tragedy of his suicide. He was driven to death by mistreatment, harassment by varsity and intervention of central ministers into the issue,"" he claimed. — Agencies"
A meeting best forgotten,"MOVIE REVIEW - JAB HARRY MET SEJAL

Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering. So much so even the delectable song Hawayein written by Irshad Kaamil and composed by Pritam gets lost and can’t hold love in the air."
Cloudbursts kill 6 in Dharchula,"Tribune News Service

Pithoragarh, August 14

Six persons were killed and nine another reported missing after two separate cloudbursts in Dharchula sub division of the district early today. Army sources maintained the toll could rise to 16. Sources said the first incident occurred at Mangti Nullah near Tawaghat in Dharchula sub division when the local rivulet Mangti Nullah overflowed due to heavy rains at its basin and hit some shops and an Army camp below the nullah. The Army, NDRF and SDRF teams have recovered two bodies form the spot while an Army jawan is missing, said Ashish Chauhan, District Magistrate, Pithoragarh. The second cloudburst occurred at Malpa, where an overflowing local rivulet swept away four persons. Disaster mitigation teams later recovered four bodies while one person has been saved. “We have pressed into service rescue and rehabilitation personnel from NDRF and SDRF beside ITBP and Army jawans and a massive search operation has been launched to trace the missing,” said RS Rana, district disaster management officer in Pithoragarh district. Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat today flew to the rain-hit areas of Dharchula in Pithoragarh district. The CM said the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra had been halted due to cloudburst that occurred in Malpa in Pithoragarh district last night. The district administration will allow the pilgrims to move only when the route is safe,” the CM said. He said that villages in the border areas of Malpa, Taluka, Mangati and Bangapani had been cut off after the roads were washed away. Significantly, only two groups of pilgrims have reached China, while the remaining six groups have been halted for now. Since mobile connectivity has also been disrupted, we will request the Government of Nepal to increase the frequency level so that the border villages in Pithoragarh district are covered,” he said. Rawat said that adequate food supplies and ration stocks are being maintained. Accompanied by state Finance Minister Prakash Pant, Rawat said the disaster management department had been asked to prepare an action plan to deal with recurring landslides and other rain-related incidents. He said people in areas along the banks of rivers and rivulets prone to landslides were being evacuated to safety. The road from Malpa to Gal and the Lamadi-Chudi road was badly affected by the landslides, Pant said.

Yogi cannot escape responsibility for kids’ deaths

Also in this section

India thrash Sri Lanka

The death of 60-odd children in a hospital at Gorakhpur, the constituency of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, has jolted the nation on the eve of Independence Day. There is a nauseating dispute over the cause of the deaths with the government insisting that lack of oxygen cited in media reports is not the reason for the deaths. It was revolting the way BJP and UP government spokespersons reeled out figures of similar deaths happening in the hospital during the monsoon in the recent years to hammer the point that such things were normal in eastern UP. They blamed the deaths on encephalitis, a viral infection caused by a mosquito bite, which affects the brain, leading to coma and death. According to a media report, 114 patients have died of encephalitis this year so far. The deaths should be a matter of embarrassment to a regime that promises to bring about parivartan. Instead, the familiar trick of an inquiry has been played upon an anguished nation. And the Yogi government contradicts itself. If oxygen shortage did not cause the deaths, as it claims, then why has the government suspended Dr Kafeel Ahmad Khan, in-charge of the paediatrics ward responsible for oxygen supply? The government seems to admit that there was oxygen shortage but manitains that it did not cause the deaths. Similarly, the government has suspended Medical College chief Rajeev Misra, giving indications which way the inquiry should move. Whatever the cause of the deaths, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath cannot escape his part of the responsibility. He has represented Gorakhpur in Parliament for about 20 years and thousands of deaths have taken place in his constituency since the first case of encephalitis was discovered in 1978. In May this year a CAG report had pointed out that BRD Medical College, Gorkhpur, and other UP hospitals have failed to provide proper treatment to patients because of inadequate infrastructure. The Chief Minister cannot plead innocence of facts now. He is guilty of wasting his energies in pursuing a politically-motivated agenda. About time he and his mentors began attending to the nitty-gritty of basic administration."
Waqf Board plans grand I-Day event,"Chairman lashes out at Cong, accusing it of using Muslims as vote bank

Haryana Waqf Board chairman and Punhana MLA Raheesha Khan said today that Independence Day would be celebrated on a grand scale. Students of schools under the management of the board would perform on patriotic songs and present cultural programmes on the occasion, he said, while reviewing the arrangements being made for Independence Day celebrations at the board’s headquarters here. Talking to mediapersons, Khan said: “As a citizen of the country, it is our duty to celebrate Independence Day and this time, it will be celebrated on a grand scale at the board’s headquarters. Members of the board, Imams, students and other people of Ambala and Rohtak divisions will celebrate Independence Day at the headquarters in Ambala.” He said, “Independence Day used to be celebrated in the past too, but on a small scale. It is being done to send out a clear message across the country that Muslims have no issues in celebrating the day and singing the National Anthem.” Lashing out at the Congress, Khan said: “Some anti-social elements and the Congress have disturbed the atmosphere. It has always used the Muslim community as its vote bank and did nothing for its welfare. The Congress has instilled a sense of fear in the Muslims that the BJP is anti-Muslim and you will be thrown out if the BJP comes to power.” “The Congress and some other political parties have been politicising every issue by giving them religious colours,” he added. — TNS"

Ludhiana, August 14

A family of Lalton Kalan village murdered one of its members and tried to pass it off as suicide. According to the police, the accused misled the police by stating that the deceased committed suicide because of a quarrel he had with his neighbours last month.

The police said Racchpal Singh of Lalton Kalan village had lodged a complaint with them that he had been beaten by his neighbours in July. On August 5, Racchpal’s brother Baldev Singh told the police that his brother had committed suicide because of mental agony he had been suffering after a quarrel with his neighbours and had even left a suicide note. A case of abetment of suicide against his neighbours Vicky, Tarni and others was registered.

The ADCP Zone-3, Surendra Lamba, said the postmortem report suggested it was a murder. Further investigation was carried out and it came to light that Racchpal used to torment the members of his family, including mother Manjit Kaur, brother Baldev Singh and wife Kiranpal Kaur after getting drunk. The three strangled him with rope and told the police that he had committed suicide.

The police have registered a case against the accused under Section 202 and 34 (committing crime with common intention) of the IPC against the accused."

‘Come with torn clothes for FIR’

Almost 10 days after Varnika Kundu was stalked, a case of harassment of a girl student at Post Graduate Government College (PGGC), Sector 11, in broad daylight has come to light. On Sunday, a student of Master’s in Physical Education, was passing from near the college ground when two of her classmates, Avish Kamboj and Shailendra Gill, allegedly passed lewd comments at her. Avish is the college president of INSO. The police today arrested the duo under preventive measures. The victim was with one of her friends at that time and both got into an argument with a group of boys standing with the accused. The victim claimed that during the argument, the accused abused her and told her that they would “thrash her”. In the meantime, a group of boys playing volleyball nearby started commenting and hooting. The victim was embarrassed and left the spot. After consulting her hostel warden, the victim approached the police and got a complaint registered. However, no action was taken by the college authorities or the police till this morning, following which members of PUSU, whom the girl supported, staged a protest outside the Principal’s office. Sensing trouble, the local police took both accused under preventive arrest. Members of INSO also held a protest saying the matter had been blown out of proportion by PUSU and that their president was being falsely implicated. Virendra Kairon, who answered Kamboj’s phone, said, “Both of them have been taken for a medical examination by the police; what started as an argument has been converted into something else.” Kairon said last year the girl had an argument with the accused after he clicked her photograph without permission. They were not on talking terms since then. However, on Sunday evening, the victim and the accused got into an argument. SHO of the Sector 11 police station Lakhvir Singh said, “The complaint mentioned ‘hooting and commenting’ by two boys and we have arrested them under preventive measures. They will be produced before the SDM tomorrow”. Principal of the college JK Sehgal was not available for comments.The brother of the victim has claimed that the police did not register an FIR despite repeated attempts. He said, “My sister asked a policeman to register an FIR, but he said he would do so if she approached them with torn clothes”."

The tussle between Haridwar MLA and Urban Development Minister Madan Kaushik and Tourism Minister Satpal Maharaj, which resulted in their supporters coming to blows with each other at Haridwar, has been referred to the Disciplinary Committee of the state unit of the BJP. The open war between the two senior BJP leaders alerted the national leadership, which then asked state BJP chief Ajay Bhatt and Chief Minister TS Rawat to hold talks with Madan Kaushik and Satpal Maharaj. However, Satpal Maharaj is said to have demanded immediate action and expressed his unwillingness to be co-opted after which the state BJP chief Ajay Bhatt referred the matter to the Disciplinary committee. “The matter is before the Disciplinary Committee, which is headed by Gyan Singh Negi. It will present its report to the party within 15 days,” said Ajay Bhatt, Uttarakhand BJP chief. Satpal Maharaj reportedly objected to dumping of garbage outside Prem Ashram Gate, which is run by him, by the MC employees. Earlier, the Haridwar Municipal Corporation removed encroachment outside Prem Ashram, which exasperated Satpal Maharaj and his supporters. The latter launched an indefinite sit-in as a mark of protest. The anti-encroachment drive was spearheaded by the Mayor of Haridwar, who is reportedly a close associate of Madan Kaushik."
"Swine flu kills 208 in Gujarat this year, over 900 hospitalised","Ahmedabad, August 16

Swine flu has killed 208 people in Gujarat since January this year and 994 patients infected with H1N1 virus are currently undergoing treatment in hospitals, the state government said on Wednesday.

In a statement issued here, Gujarat Health Minister Shankar Chaudhary said the administration is taking necessary steps to curb the spread of swine flu, with the help of over 5,000 doctors.

As per the release, 1,883 people across the state were found to be infected with H1N1 between January 1 and August 15 this year.

“While only 256 cases were reported in the first six months, the virus raised its head only after July, when 322 cases were reported. This month alone, 1,305 people were found to be infected with the virus,” the release said.

“Of these, 994 people are still under treatment, while 208 have succumbed to the disease,” the release said adding that 681 patients were discharged after treatment.

In order to control the spread of H1N1 virus, a dedicated team of 17,000 health workers, including 5,000 MBBS doctors, have been deployed across the state to identify patients and to provide necessary guidance and treatment, it said.

These health workers have already completed the task of identifying swine flu positive cases through door-to-door survey, covering over four crore citizens, the release said.

The minister also expressed confidence that in the coming days, the number of swine flu cases would gradually come down due to the government’s “quick response”. — PTI"

Actor Mark Ruffalo protests at Trump Tower over Virginia violence,"Actor Mark Ruffalo held a candle light vigil at Trump Tower in the memory of Charlottesville victim, Heather Heyer, who was killed in a weekend rally in Virginia.

The 49-year-old actor decided to protest following US President Donald Trump’s response to the violence against the counter-protesters of a rally organised by white nationalists.

Trump had said that “there is blame on both sides” for the demonstration that turned violent on August 12.

Ruffalo posted a video on Instagram to inform his fans and followers about the protest.

“We want him to hear us. We want him to know that an American killed on American soil by a Nazi is not acceptable. That there is no equivalence, there is no many sides.

“There’s two sides to this. People who fight Nazis and Nazis and that’s it. We cannot allow Nazis to be a normal part of our society. We have to fight,” he said in the video.

“The Avengers” star was supported by filmmaker Micheal Moore, who interrupted his own Broadway show, ‘The Terms of My Surrender’ to sit beside Ruffalo on top of a double-decker bus he arranged for the public.

The vigil was also joined by actor Olivia Wilde, who led chants of “Trump is not a legitimate president! Trump is not America! We love America!” outside the tower.

According to Entertainment Weekly, “The Big Sick” actor Zoe Kazan also came forward to raise slogans such as, “We reject fascism! We reject white supremacy! We reject Neo-Nazis! We will not accept white supremacy in the White House!”

Some celebrities took to social media to register their protest.

TV host Jimmy Kimmel wrote on Twitter, “I haven’t seen anything that crazy since Tyson bit Holyfield @realDonaldTrump.”

Author JK Rowling tweeted, “One good thing about that abomination of a speech: it’s now impossible for any Trump supporter to pretend they don’t know what he is.”

Veteran actress Barbra Streisand said Trump said what he really believes without a prepared statement.

“Equating neo-Nazis to those protecting civil rights is disgraceful and crazy,” she continued.

“Captain America” star Chris Evans tweeted, “Is anyone else watching this?!? Wow... It’s like watching a train wreck!! ‘Before I make a statement I need the facts’? Since when??”

Get to the root of aerial appeal,"GREEN HOUSE

Immature aerial roots.

Roots that do not get anchored to the ground are brittle and can break off with careless handling.

Maj Gen C S Bewli Aerial roots are adventitious roots that have the unique ability to develop and grow above the ground-level; while growing some of these reach the ground to eventually anchor and get transformed into active roots; others keep drawing moisture and nutrients from air to survive. Aerial roots have a striking and conspicuous appearance; they emerge only under high humidity conditions and shade. Therefore, species with aerial roots are mainly found in rain forests and areas within tropics and sub tropics. It is not that all plant species in such areas have the ability to develop aerial roots; only a handful of species reserve the right to show off the grandeur of their aerial roots. Aerial roots absorb moisture and nutrients from air just like underground roots. n Some of the house plant species of Philodendron, Monstera, Epipremnum, Ivy (Hedera), Euonymus, etc. have aerial roots that function as anchors. The roots cling to the supporting structures such as trellises, rocks and walls and draw nutrients from air. n Aerial roots in Epiphytic orchids and Anthurium function to cling tightly on another plant or rock outcrop to survive. These are mainly found in rain forests because the habitat provides most of their growing requirements. They derive moisture and nutrients from air to keep them hydrated. They can be acclimatised to grow under local conditions by providing a sort of similar environment. n Aerial roots on some of the tree species of Ficus and Schefflera continue to grow until they touch the ground and get entrenched. Initially, they draw moisture and nutrients from the air, but once they get embedded in the ground they derive their nutrition from the soil. Amid the numerous aerial roots that spring, only a few succeed in reaching the ground and getting through the soil. While the aerial roots embed to the ground and grow, they thicken considerably and form secondary trunks. A classic bonsai can be created with species whose aerial roots eventually get deep-rooted into the ground. Ficus benghalensis, F. virens, F. religiosa, F. panda, F. salicifolia, F. microcarpa, F. longisland, Schefflera actinophylla, S. arboricola are some of the awesome species with aerial roots. Bonsais of these species, when created in non-tropical regions, normally do not develop aerial roots. However, by facilitating favourable environment aerial roots can be formed. Irrespective of the style of bonsai, aerial roots need to be trained, harmonised and fused to enlarge the trunk and enrich its appeal. The trunk of bonsai gives an impressive and a dramatic appearance when multiple secondary trunks grow from the canopy and get seated in the soil-mix. Extraordinary and singular characteristic of these plants having secondary trunks has generated interest in bonsai artists' world-over. There is a burgeoning interest to create such bonsais as they make breathtaking and unusual additions to bonsai collections.

New Delhi, August 14

Ground-to-air security has been tightened in and around the national Capital, including the historic Red Fort from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on the 71st Independence Day tomorrow.

All the vehicles entering from neighbouring states are being checked thoroughly in the presence of heavy security on borders.

Close to 70,000 personnel will be guarding the national Capital owing to the celebrations, a senior police officer said.

About 9,100 personnel have been deployed in and around the historic Mughal fort which will see the presence of senior ministers, top bureaucrats, foreign dignitaries and common people during the PM's address.

Two dozen Parakram Vans manned by quick reaction teams of NSG-trained commandos have been stationed in areas with high footfall to thwart any attempt by terror groups to disrupt peace. As many as 11 such vans have been deployed in the area around the Red Fort.

""There will be multi-tier security in place. The security audit of the residents, including tenants has been completed. The area is being monitored by CCTV cameras and there will be multi-tier security checks in place for people coming to the area,"" the officer said.

At the Red Fort, a special team of NSG snipers and commandos will form the inner layers of the security cordon while anti-aircraft guns have been deployed to thwart any aerial intrusion by objects like drones and projectiles, he said.

The police have already prohibited aerial activities, including para-gliding, flying UAVs and hot air balloons, across the city.

Besides, the police are surveying the areas in the vicinity of the Red Fort and have collected details of over 9,000 people residing there. The buildings facing the Red Fort will be secured by police and paramilitary personnel.

Security along the route to be taken by the Prime Minister's cavalcade from his official residence to the Red Fort will be monitored with the help of hundreds of CCTV cameras.

Special ""spotters"" of the police and paramilitary will keep an eye on parking areas. Over 60 sniffer dogs of paramilitary forces and the police will also be part of the extensive security deployment.

Security around prominent temples like the Iskcon temple, Lakshmi Narayan temple and the Gouri Shankar temple has been ramped up since large congregations of devotees are expected on Janmashtami festival, the birthday of Lord Krishna.

According to a statement by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), train services will run as usual. However, stations like Lal Quila, Jama Masjid, Delhi Gate and ITO will have restricted entry and exit during the ceremony owing to security considerations. Parking will not be available at the stations till 2 pm tomorrow in view of the security measures, a spokesperson for the DMRC said."

This Independence Day a rethink on government role required

Nirmal Sandhu

Even though we have demonstrated adequately that we are incapable of a meaningful, civilised debate on any issue — be it in Parliament, television studios or a public forum — we need to decide whether the size of the government needs to shrink. Despite administrative reforms, automatic clearances and availability of technology, an elephant-size government, whose maintenance cost shoots up with every pay commission report, has become a liability. Politicians need a large government to accommodate every possible loyalist. They have no incentive to shed administrative fat. The US Republic Party believes in having a minimum government and consequently lower taxes, something Narendra Modi once believed in. The Democratic Party, though broadly follows similar economic policies, takes motherly care of the working class and immigrants. In India political parties have no ideological commitments to having a small or large government. They stretch their government to the maximum permissible limits. After the Soviet meltdown and the retreat of socialism, the Western model of small governments is generally preferred. Punjabi ministers from Canada travel in Punjab like ordinary citizens. Wondering at the spread of ministerial paraphernalia, they are appalled by the level of bad governance. In India, we waste resources on inessentials. We expect a government to do everything and take blame for everything that does not work. As a nation we are less watchful of how our tax money is spent. Since the government interferes so much in every sphere, including agriculture and business, it is natural for farmers and businessmen to demand incentives and even loan waivers as a matter of right if things go wrong. Protectionist policies have robbed people of self-respect, entrepreneurial spirit and the will to take risks and responsibility for their actions. We disown failures and expect a government rescue if our decisions go bust. Politicians pander to every whim of every section that matters in elections, thus inviting more unreasonable demands. We fully deserve the politicians we have. A democratic government has a responsibility towards citizens in distress. Providing a social safety net is a laudable goal of a welfare state. In our country while there is no social security worth the name, the concept of welfare has been extended to absurd levels. That politicians' sole purpose of being in politics is to gain and retain power is obvious. So when they seek votes, they make all sorts of promises, say whatever voters want to hear. Sometimes to keep their faith, they deliver also. If limited resources are diverted to appease this or that section, it affects the quality of governance, the delivery of services like health and education, the functioning of institutions and the over-all well-being of people as Punjab has seen. A bankrupt treasury has a demoralising effect and the pile-up of heavy unproductive debt imposes a cost on the generations to come. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had successfully played welfare politics to her advantage. What stopped Tamil Nadu from ending up in bankruptcy like Punjab was the overall expansion of the economy and efficient delivery of services. Though Tamil Nadu has been dubbed ""the number one corrupt state in India"", Jayalalithaa ensured that freebies did reach the needy. If free power can win Badal an election, he would not mind bankrupting a government treasury or taking loan after loan to keep that promise. That would force every political opponent to do the same. Competitive populism has ruined Punjab. Inheriting an empty treasury, Capt Amarinder Singh does not know from where to start work on innumerable promises he has made. Remember what an American journalist, PJ O’Rourke, has said, ""A politician who portrays himself as 'caring' and 'sensitive' because he wants to expand the government's charitable programs is merely saying that he's willing to try to do good with other people's money."" The latest convert to those using public money to buy themselves public goodwill is Narendra Modi. If he can win an election in Uttar Pradesh by offering free gas cylinders apart from playing communal politics, he would do the same in every next State that goes to the polls. Then he has the justification to deny the gas subsidy to the middle class and raise the tax on petrol and diesel. If a culture of freebies has to be sustained, which helps politicians more than the marginalised, sacrifices are required from better-off sections. Then there can't be complaints about a state's taxes or/and debt shooting up. We need to settle this debate whether ""pro-poor"" politics is doing the nation any good. Are we blindly funding schemes that the corrupt benefit from and buy politicians public goodwill. Or do we want our government to get off our backs and do the minimum possible? If we approve of a government running hotels, airlines and banks that keeping making losses because of political interference, corruption and lack of a professional work culture, or extending financial bailouts to this or that failed business, then we should happily pay for all the taxes and levies demanded of us. There is growing discontent among various sections because large amounts of resources are diverted from development - infrastructure, education and healthcare. Children dying for lack of oxygen in a UP hospital reveal the state of government healthcare in the country. The Maratha march in Maharashtra, the Jat reservation agitation in Haryana, the Patidars hitting the streets in Gujarat and peasant unrest in Punjab and elsewhere -all point to economic aspirations remaining unfulfilled. This is partly because money which should have gone into agriculture has been used to fund politics of populism. There are two ways of overcoming deprivation. One is to spend more on education and healthcare so that every Indian is empowered to participate in the effort for higher growth and better living standards. The other is to focus on growth first and let benefits trickle down to the people at the bottom of the pyramid. The second model has not shown very encouraging results. Politics of appeasement makes a mockery of every growth model and is now pursued both at the Centre and in states. We had some world-class economists at the helm but were rendered helpless in the pursuit of power. The UPA had a good team in Dr Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram, Dr Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Raghuram Rajan, but the excessive focus on ""inclusive growth"" and the political priority of winning elections did not give them a free hand to carry out reforms they wanted. If a government ceases to be a savior of all and a provider of everything, and just limits itself to the essentials — just a lean, mean and efficient machinery to do the chosen things —then we can perhaps breathe easier and be spared a whole lot of financial burden that chokes us now."
Another woman complains of being stalked in Chandigarh,"Chandigarh, August 15

Barely over a week after the incident of stalking of an IAS officer’s daughter here, another woman has complained of being chased by three men in a car.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that last night while returning home from market in a two-wheeler she was chased by three men in a car from Sector 36 till Sector 40 here last night, the police said on Tuesday.

“The men started chasing her after she bought some fruits from the market,” Chandigarh Police Deputy Superintendent of Police, Deepak Yadav said.

The woman, who belonged to Hisar and has been staying here as a paying guest, noted down the vehicle’s number and informed the police, the DSP said.

A case has been registered on her complaint under Section 341 (wrongful restraint), 354D (stalking), and Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC, the DSP said.

“We will soon apprehend the accused,” he said.

"Gold drops below Rs 30,000, silver plunges Rs 800","New Delhi, August 16

Gold moved on a slippery track on Wednesday, settling below the Rs 30,000-mark by plunging Rs 300 to Rs 29,750 per 10 grams, in a sign of subdued overseas trend as well as local demand. The plunge was sharper in silver, which cracked below the Rs 40,000 level at Rs 39,300 per kg, a loss of Rs 800, weighed down by a drop in off-take. Data on US manufacturing came in better than expected, which in turn increases the probability of higher returns from the dollar and treasuries. Additionally, receding geo-political worries involving North Korea and the US made the precious metals lose sheen. Globally, gold fell 0.09 per cent to USD 1,270 an ounce in Singapore. Fading demand from local jewellers and retailers at the current level pulled down the gold prices further. In the national capital, gold of 99.9 per cent and 99.5 per cent purity fell Rs 300 each to Rs 29,750 and Rs 29,600 per 10 grams, respectively. Sovereign, however, remained flat at Rs 24,500 per piece of eight grams in limited deals. Silver ready dropped as much as Rs 800 to Rs 39,300 per kg and weekly-based delivery Rs 885 to Rs 38,365. Silver coins saw a price decline of Rs 1,000 to Rs 72,000 for buying and Rs 73,000 for selling of 100 pieces. PTI"

"Simple trick may help you remember carrying umbrella, keys","Toronto, August 14

Do you often forget carrying your keys or umbrella with you while stepping out of your house? A simple memory trick may help!

Imagining an action that connects two objects may help people overcome certain kinds of memory problems, a study suggests.

Thinking about an action between two objects — like an umbrella being lodged in the door lock — and a potential consequence, such as not being able to lock the door, could help people improve their memory for relationships with other objects, researchers said.

The strategy — termed “unitization” — could be used in personalised memory rehabilitation to help older adults and those with amnesia bypass gaps in their abilities, said Jennifer Ryan, senior scientist at Baycrest’s Rotman Research Institute in Canada.

“Previous research has shown that imagining two objects fusing into one will help people work around these memory deficits; but our work demonstrated that understanding the relationship between the two items is also important,” said Ryan, also a professor at the University of Toronto.

“We know that cognitive function is impaired during ageing and this strategy could be one workaround for minor memory problems, depending on what you need to achieve,” she said.

The study evaluated the performance of 80 healthy older adults (between the ages of 61 and 88) on a memory task. The group was first trained and tested on the task to gather initial results.

They were then either taught one of the three individual features of unitization (fusion, motion, action/consequence) or the overall unitization strategy.

After learning these new approaches, participants were tested again to see if this helped their performance.

Older adults trained to improve their memory using only the action/consequence feature of unitization saw the greatest memory improvements.

“We are trying to understand what is important to unitization and what people need to learn in order to benefit,” said Ryan.

“There is no single strategy that will fix your memory, but one method may be more be suitable than another,” she said.

The study was published in the Memory and Cognition journal. — PTI"
Modern apples originated in Kazakhstan: study,"New York, August 16

The modern juicy, crisp apples originated in a mountainous region of Kazakhstan, according to a study which reveals a surprising two-way journey on the Silk Road for one of the world’s most popular fruits. As travellers journeyed east and west along the Silk Road, trading their goods and ideas, they brought with them hitchhiking apple seeds, discarded from the choicest fruit they pulled from wild trees, researchers said. This early selection would eventually lead to the 7,500 varieties of apple that exist today, they said. Researchers, including those at Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI) in the US, sequenced and compared the genomes of 117 diverse apple accessions, including M domestic and 23 wild species from North America, Europe, and East and central Asia. “We narrowed down the origin of domesticated apple from very broad central Asia to Kazakhstan area west of Tian Shan Mountain,” said Zhangjun Fei, professor at BTI. Researchers discovered that the first domesticated apple had travelled to the east, hybridising with local wild apples along the way, yielding the ancestors of soft, dessert apples cultivated in China today. “We pointed out two major evolutionary routes, west and east, along the Silk Road, revealing fruit quality changes in every step along the way,” Fei said. Researchers also found that as the apple travelled west along the Silk Road in the hands of travellers, trees grew from dropped seeds and crossed with other wild apple varieties, including the incredibly sour European crabapple. They found that M sylvestris has contributed so extensively to the apple’s genome that the modern apple is actually more similar to the sour crabapple than to its Kazakhstan ancestor, M sieversii. “For the ancestral species, Malus sieversii, the fruits are generally much larger than other wild apples. They are also soft and have a very plain flavour that people do not like much,” said Yang Bai from BTI. The hybridisation between ancient cultivated apples and M sylvestris, followed by extensive human selection, gave us new apples that are larger and fuller in flavour, and with a crispy firmness that gives them a longer shelf life, researchers said. “The modern domesticated apples have higher and well-balanced sugar and organic acid contents. That is how the apple started to become a popular and favoured fruit,” Bai said. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. PTI"

"Union Cabinet extends tax incentives for industries in Himalayan states, NE","New Delhi, August 16

The central government has extended tax incentives to industries in Himalayan states such as Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir as well as northeastern states till March 2027, the finance minister announced on Wednesday.

""Within the framework of the GST Act each industry will be entitled to its own refund mechanism during this particular period (March 31, 2027),"" he said after the Cabinet meeting headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Industries in the north eastern and Himalayan states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand under the previous excise regime used to get 10-year exemption, he said.

According to the scheme, industries that began its operations during the period got excise tax holiday for 10 years, he said, adding that there is a separate residuary period for every industry because of commencement of production and their consequent entitlement of 10-year exemption.

Under the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, there is no provision for exemption but there is one section under the Act which permits refunds.

""Therefore, refund would be permitted through DBT. The sunset clause of these exemptions has been extended to 2027. 4,284 industrial establishment will entitled to this benefit. Budgetary provision for this Rs 27,413 crore,"" he said. PTI/TNS"

"Blade Runner, autoencoded","The strange film that sums up our fears of AI and the future

Andrew Griffin

Terence Broad’s Blade Runner sometimes looks a lot like the classic 1982 film. Sometimes it looks completely different. His autoencoded version of Blade Runner is the film as a computer sees it — or, more specifically, as a computer sees it, remembers it, and then regurgitates it. The film is being shown as part of the Barbican’s science fiction exhibition-meets-festival, Into The Unknown. And it’s perhaps the most cutting edge of all the work featured there — not only being about science fiction, but being created in a way that sounds like it comes straight out of the work of Philip K Dick. Broad’s project works by analogy with memory, and uses cutting edge artificial intelligence to do so. It uses an autoencoder — that encodes a big data sample, in this case individual frames of films, into a tiny representation of itself which it can then reconstruct later on. When it does so, a great deal has been lost in the shrinking. But strange things can be found in that reconstruction, too — the technology looks to make up for what it can’t remember by filling in the gaps. “The reconstructions are in no way perfect, but the project was more of a creative exploration of both the capacity and limitations of this approach,” wrote Broad in an introduction to his work that would later go viral. In that way, it seems remarkably and uncannily similar to human memory. It shrinks everything down and stores it away, so that it can be opened back up and relived with the gaps filled in at a later date. And the idea was inspired by strange experiments with humans, too. One of the first inspirations was a talk by scientists who had managed to make an MRI machine reconstruct things that people were looking at, simply by looking at the patterns showing in their brains. It could literally see through other people’s eyes, by looking right into their heads. But all of those human inspirations and influences are taken and turned into a work that is undeniably technological. If the MRI experiment showed us what people are watching from inside their heads, the autoencoded Blade Runner almost allows us to watch how a computer sees, peering inside its own brain in the same way. It definitely remembers in a different way to how humans do. It’s terrible at recalling and reconstituting faces, for instance, and can’t recognise that the same face belongs to the same person and so needs to move in a straight line. And it also appears to find it impossible to remember a black frame; because there are so few in the film, there’s no point storing the black and instead remembers it as an average of all the other parts of the film, throwing out a beautiful but decidedly unblank green image. For now the limits of the project are where the interest is found, and the imperfections of the reconstruction make it a work of art. But theoretically computers could eventually become perfect at the work — watching, shrinking and then reconstituting the film as it actually is. It all sounds eerily like a question that would plague the noir world of Blade Runner. But Blade Runner wasn’t always the aim. The film began as a project for a university course, and required learning techniques that are at the very forefront of AI and visual technology. “Originally it was really just an experiment; the whole thing started out as a research project,” says Broad. “For a long time I was training it on these videos of really long train journeys. After a couple of months I got really bored and thought it would be interesting to do it with Blade Runner.” The choice of film happened by a kind of intentional coincidence but fits perfectly into the film because the themes seem to mesh so well. Blade Runner explores the edge of artificial intelligence, the beginnings of humanity and how to know the difference between the two; the autoencoded Blade Runner does the same thing but with the film itself. “I’d always had the idea [of Blade Runner] in the back of my mind. But I didn’t think it would work. But then as soon as we did it we saw that it obviously should be the sole focus for the project.” Because the computer processes things over time — and takes a while to do it — the process of actually finding that it would work well was one that revealed itself gradually. “When you’re training it, you would give it a batch of images of random frames. Then it would start giving you the output. So I was just looking at this output while it was training. “I saw this image and saw you could recognise some of the scenes. But this was a really small resolution. So we saw this and then it was like, right we need to kind of do this in order and remake the video. “Then we did a little 10 minute sample. And it was kind of mind blowing, for me and my supervisor. I’ve got the original 10 minute — it’s really noisy and really grainy. You can see what’s going on and it’s kind of mind-blowing. Then I thought — let’s just remake Blade Runner, the whole thing.” That decision put the film squarely in the realm of science fiction — a decision that would see it sit among the greatest work of the genre in the Barbican exhibition. Not simply because it took such a seminal science fiction film, but also because it was a kind of science fiction itself, using brand new techniques to reprocess a film in a way that would be unimaginable and inexplicable to people even 10 or 20 years ago.— The Independent"

"Rival factions clash, Jat leader Malik hurt","Sushil Manav

Jat reservation stir leader Yashpal Malik was among 12 persons injured in a clash between rival factions at an All-India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) rally in Samain village of Fatehabad today. Malik, who was in the village to address a meeting, had barely been felicitated when he was attacked by a group carrying sticks and stones. He was hit on the head and chest. His supporters hastened to form a ring around him and took him to safety.It was a free-for-all thereafter with rival factions throwing stones at each other, even as Malik was rushed to Hisar for treatment. The police, deployed in large numbers, were taken aback. It blamed some people sitting in the audience for the trouble. But organisers had another version. They alleged “50 outsiders” had attacked Malik and his men. Malik, speaking to The Tribune, accused Sarva Khap spokesperson Sube Singh Samain of engineering the attack at the instance of a BJP leader in connivance with some police officers. He did not name the BJP leader. Samain village is part of the Tohana Assembly segment which is represented by BJP state president Subhash Barala. “We have given a 72-hour notice to the government to arrest Samain and others and to initiate action against policemen who connived with them. If the government fails to act, we will hold a state-level meeting and decide our future course,” Malik warned. He said they had filed a police complaint. Addressing a press meet at Hisar, he claimed the assailants intended to kill him. “There were over 100 policemen led by a DSP and an SHO at the site. Strangely, the assailants came in vehicles with pink badges and simply walked out of the venue after the attack. It is obvious the police had prior information about them. It smacks of a political conspiracy.” The Jat leader’s supporters blocked the Hisar-Chandigarh road near Kanheri village for well over two hours, demanding action. Kuldeep Singh Yadav, SP, said the police had so far received the medico-legal report of only one of the injured. He claimed at least four policemen had been injured too. Samain’s cellphone was switched off, but speaking to mediapersons at Tohana, he denied any role in the attack. JK Abhir, officiating Deputy Commissioner, Fatehabad, said with Samain apprehending violence, the authorities had made elaborate arrangements at the rally. He claimed the police had acted promptly. Sukhbir Singh Hooda, vice-president of the All-India Jat Mahasabha, said there was widespread resentment against Malik for “bungling funds” collected during the quota agitation and that may have been the reason for the attack."
"The Tribune, Personal finance news","KG Krishnamoorthy Rao

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning.

Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides.

Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability.

During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop.

These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery.

Time to take a call

Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer.

Serial winners on the prowl,"India beat Lanka by an innings and 171 runs, complete their first sweep ever in an away series having three or more matches

Pallekele, August 14

Kohli says

A ruthless India crushed Sri Lanka inside three days in the final Test on Monday to complete a 3-0 whitewash in one of the most one-sided Test series in recent times. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and paceman Mohammed Shami shared seven wickets between them as the world’s top-ranked side shot out Sri Lanka for 181 to win by an innings and 171 runs. The beleaguered hosts, whose second innings ended shortly after the tea break, had been asked to follow on after managing 135 in their first innings in reply to India’s 487. Ashwin picked up 4/68 in the second innings while Shami finished with 3/32 in an inspired bowling performance by India. “A good day, a good win for us. Very happy with the overall performance and it always feels nice to have convincing victories,” said India captain Virat Kohli. “We are a young side. We look forward to playing Test cricket, we look forward to playing with the same excitement. That’s the only way you can be ruthless.” All-rounder Hardik Pandya, who scored his maiden Test hundred on Sunday, was adjudged Man of the Match while opener Shikhar Dhawan, a last minute replacement for Murali Vijay, was named Player of the Series. Sri Lanka’s highest partnership of 65 came between captain Dinesh Chandimal, who made 36, and former skipper Angelo Mathews (35). Wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella chipped in with a fluent 41. Their hopes of avoiding an innings loss rested on a solid start but Ashwin struck in his first over of the day to jolt the hosts. The off-spinner sent back opener Dimuth Karunaratne for 16 after Sri Lanka had resumed on 19/1. The left-hander was caught by Ajinkya Rahane at slip after getting a thick edge to a turning delivery. Nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara was caught behind off Shami, who also dismissed Kusal Mendis for 12 to reduce the hosts to 38/4. Left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav broke the stand between Chandimal and Mathews when he dismissed the former through a bat-pad catch at short leg. Once Mathews was out leg before to Ashwin, India’s win was merely a formality. “Our batting and bowling was below-par through the series,” Chandimal said after his team’s failure to make any of the Tests last full five days. “We have to be more patient and concentrate more.” The two sides will now clash in five ODIs and a T20, starting on Sunday. — ReutersIndia have white-washed an away series of three or more Tests for the first time. They have won three Tests in an overseas series for the second time — the first occasion being when they won 3-1 vs New Zealand under Tiger Pataudi’s captaincy in 1967-68.For the fourth time, Sri Lanka have lost a home Test within three days. The first three instances being vs Pakistan in 1994 and in 2006, both at Kandy, and vs England at Colombo (SSC) in 2001.Virat Kohli enjoys an outstanding record as captain — his success percentage of 65.51 is the highest among the Indian captains in Tests. India’s record under his captaincy being 19 victories, three defeats and seven drawn matches in 29 Tests.Number of centuries Shikhar Dhawan scored in the series. He was adjudged Man of the Series. His tally of 358 (avg. 89.50) is his best ever in a Test series. He finished as the top run-scorer on either side in the series.India’s triumphs by an innings at Pallekele is their second biggest in an overseas Test.Pallekele: Chief selector MSK Prasad today said that former skipper MS Dhoni’s future is being discussed at selection meetings but they will look at alternatives only if the Jharkhand dasher doesn’t deliver. After explaining Yuvraj Singh’s omission, Prasad was asked about Dhoni and he replied: “Discussions happen about everybody. It is not just MS. When we pick someone, when we talk about combinations, we talk about everybody.” Asked about Dhoni’s future, the chairman said it’s difficult to predict but till he was delivering for the team, it shouldn’t be a problem. “You never know. We don’t say it is an automatic thing (selection) but we will see. If he is delivering, why not? If he is not, we will have to look at alternatives,” said Prasad. PTI

Pandya is special

I don’t think I need to add any more lines, his (Pandya’s) performance has spoken for itself... You know, a guy who can get a fifty and a hundred in his first three games batting at No. 8 has to have something special in him... He brings in a great balance to the team, he’s a gun fielder and he gives you those crucial breakthroughs. All doubts aside from the outside, inside the team we absolutely have 120% faith in him.

Shami among top three

I certainly rate him (Shami) among top three for sure. Because of his wicket-taking ability and the kind of impact he has on games. When he makes up his mind to come out and give it his 120%, then he can bowl 140, 145 clicks on a regular basis. So he is a quality bowler, he has all the ingredients of becoming a consistent world-class bowler, provided the fitness factor can be maintained.This was the toughest series in my career, no doubt. The reason being that we were not able to take the games to five days. This is the worst series ever. It’s pretty tough for the team and me."
Haryana Governor calls for united efforts to defeat anti-national forces,"Panchkula, August 15

Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki on Tuesday cautioned people against the threats of terrorism and called for united efforts by every citizen to defeat anti-national forces. The people in the country celebrate various festivals in their own way, but Independence Day is celebrated without any discrimination of religion, caste, creed and language, he said after unfurling the national flag at a state-level function at Panchkula. Recalling the supreme sacrifices made by freedom fighters, martyrs and soldiers, he said it is our duty to give due respect to their families. The state government is giving many special benefits to the families of martyrs and their dependents so that they could lead a respectable life, he said. The governor said it had been decided that like the freedom fighters, the last rites of their wives would also be performed with full state honours. The government has also raised the financial assistance being given to the family members of the armed forces personnel who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to Rs 50 lakh, Solanki said. “Today, we can face the challenges of the era of globalisation only if we are united and engaged in protecting the nation,” he said. It is a matter of pride that campaigns like ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’, ‘Swachh Bharat’, ‘Ek Bharat-Shresth Bharat’, ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Digital India’ and ‘Stand Up India’ were going on to enable the country face new challenges, he said, and called upon the people to contribute to make India a superpower of the 21st century. Solanki said Haryana had become the leading state in per capita income, industrial production, foreign investment, education, sports, agriculture and transport. “Growth rate of GDP in the state is higher than the national average. It is growing at a rate of more than seven per cent every year. Here, 33 per cent of the country’s two-wheelers, 50 per cent cars and 52 per cent cranes are manufactured. The government’s enterprise promotion policy is an attempt to make the Prime Minister’s ‘Make in India’ campaign successful,” he said. The Governor also highlighted various achievements of the state government in the field of sports, education, skill development and other schemes being implemented for the welfare of all sections of society. Earlier, he released the ‘Sankalp Se Siddhi’ vision 2022 document of the Panchkula district administration and also honoured freedom fighters, widows of freedom fighters, war widows and some officials of district administration.

Deep sleep may reinforce new motor skills,"Los Angeles

Deep sleep can help the brain reinforce newly learnt motor skills that involve handling objects, Indian-origin scientists have found.

Researchers at University of California San Francisco in the US found that during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, slow brain waves bolster neural touch points that are directly related to a task that was newly learned while awake, while weakening neural links that are not.

""This phenomenon may be related to the notion of 'extracting the gist' of how to perform a novel task. Sleep appears to reduce neural activity that is not related to a task we are in the process of learning,"" said Karunesh Ganguly, associate professor at UC San Francisco.

Researchers used a system known as a brain-machine interface (BMI) to better understand how the brain picks up new skills during sleep.

They implanted electrodes in the motor region of rats' brains to send electrical signals to a computer, which then drove movement of a detached mechanical device.

Since neural circuits are dynamic, the rats' brains rewired themselves to control this device just as swiftly as they would have if the rats were practising new ways to control their own limbs.

""A particular neuron may normally be devoted to controlling a limb, but we can create a new relationship of that neuron with an external disembodied device,"" said Tanuj Gulati, a postdoctoral scholar at UC San Francisco.

""A particular neuron may normally be devoted to controlling a limb, but we can create a new relationship of that neuron with an external disembodied device,"" said Gulati, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

Researchers connected neurons in rat brains to implanted electrodes, which controlled a mechanical waterspout. The source of water was behind a tiny door facing away from the mice.

Since the spout faced away, the rats had to learn to use a computer-driven mechanism to move it toward them. As the rats explored several strategies to control the spout, some of which included overt movements, they sometimes activated neurons adjacent to the electrodes.

When the proper neurons were activated, the computer moved the waterspout, researchers said.

""Eventually the rats learn to delink actual movements from the spout — they know they don't really need to flinch their arm or do anything to make it move,"" Gulati said.

""All they have to do is volitionally control the pipe and it will come to them,"" he added.

Researchers noted that once rats got the hang of the task while awake, certain neural patterns kept 'replaying' during sleep.

""This shows that you can not ignore sleep. Whether you are trying to do it in patients trying to regain movement control after a neural injury, or healthy individuals trying to learn a new skill,"" Gulati said. PTI"
Savage & sensual,"MOVIE REVIEW: THE ATOMIC BLONDE

Johnson Thomas

This brutal spy thriller has the comic book character Atomic Blonde a.k.a British Spy, Agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) sent to Berlin a few days before the Wall is set to come down, to retrieve a priceless dossier. She is supposed to partner with maverick MI6 agent David Percival (James McAvoy) but upon her arrival everything looks pretty much dicey, leading to double and triple crosses that come unstuck only in the final climactic reel.

Theron lends insight and sleek power to her role as the indefatigable spy who outsmarts and outfights all her opponents to get to the coveted prize. Lorraine comes across as truly mysterious, highlighted by silver grey camera filters and blue lighting while guzzling her favourite drink, vodka on the rocks, in truly abandoned abundance. Theron is the heart of the film. Her commanding presence lights up the narrative lending depth and dimension to a film that has little to say but much to show. Theron, in fact, makes it so believable that even the narrative convolutions highlighting smart mechanics don’t seem obvious or ingratiating.

Music sourced from 80’s and 90’s lend teeth to the turbulence within. The highlight action sequence of the movie involves Lorraine tracking a group of killers into a movie theater showing Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 science fiction drama, Stalker, then sneaks into the area behind the screen and is ultimately kicked right through it. That oblique reference to The Zone that spies like Lorraine and Percival inhabit where everything goes and everything can kill you is emblematic of Tarkovsky’s creation. The action is terrifyingly brutal and Theron is supremely with it. Her glare alone could turn you to ice and her action chops are meant to kill.

Based on Anthony Johnston’s graphic novel, this film winds itself around like a le Carré, Len Deighton novel and there’s enough style and stuffing to make it a tasty looking treat. James McAvoy lends able support to Theron and together they make this a spectacle worth getting hung over about!"
Indian-American sentenced to 40 months in prison for fraud,"Washington, August 16

An Indian-American man has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for cheating victims in a telephone fraud scheme, an official has said. Anandkumar Jayantila Nayee was held responsible for at least USD 150,000 in victim losses during the telephone fraud scheme, said Benjamin Greenberg, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. From January 2014 to early 2017, Nayee, who had previously pleaded guilty, conspired with others to defraud victims in an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) impersonator scam, according to court documents. His co-conspirators contacted victims by telephone and made fraudulent representations to them, including that the victims owed income tax payments to the IRS or owed fees for grants or loans that they had purportedly received. Nayee’s co-conspirators instructed the victims to deposit payments related to the taxes or fees that they purportedly owed onto debit cards and into bank accounts controlled by Nayee and his co-conspirators.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Nayee and his co-conspirators then received and retained the victims’ payments, federal prosecutors alleged. According to court papers, from January 2014 through February 28, 2014, a co-conspirator purchased Green Dot prepaid debit cards and provided the full debit card numbers to Nayee, who resided in India at the time. Nayee then caused the prepaid debit cards to be registered in the names of real people and notified his co- conspirator once the cards had been funded by victims of the telephone fraud scheme. The co-conspirator then used the prepaid debit cards to purchase money orders and deposited the money orders into bank accounts specified by Nayee who had moved to Miami from India in 2015.

Lack of early diagnosis is leading India towards a breast cancer epidemic, according to scientists who suggest that educating men may be key to encouraging women to seek help earlier. The research, which is the first of its kind to look at breast cancer awareness in India, found that cultural and religious issues mean that women do not access health services, are reluctant to consult male doctors, neglect their own health due to family obligations and are over-dependent on other family members to seek medical help, all of which cause delay in diagnosis. Researchers at University of Portsmouth in the UK found that traditional marketing campaigns do not work for raising awareness of the disease and that community nurses are the most effective channel. These community nurses, who are trusted in the community and by male members in the family, represent one of the best channels of fostering a greater understanding by men about early symptoms and diagnosis. The research highlights the significance of the country’s rapid economic development, leading to greater urbanisation, which is leading some women towards a western lifestyle resulting in a rise of breast cancer rates. It describes the issue as one of the biggest health threats facing India today. In India’s cities and urban areas, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer among women, researchers said. As many as 70,218 Indian women died of breast cancer in 2012 and deaths from the disease are predicted to increase to 76,000 in 2020 with an average age of incidence shifting to 30 years from 50 years, they said. Yet women seek medical care extremely late due to lack of awareness about self-examination and cultural barriers. Judith Fletcher-Brown, from the University of Portsmouth, interviewed several women by email about their experiences in order to elicit the most open answers to her questions. One participant said that even among friends they are too shy, although there is more openness between mothers and daughters. “India is still a patriarchal society and while women are now in responsible jobs and earning for their families, it’s the men who are still the head of the household,” said Fletcher-Brown. “Even educated professional women do not discuss private matters about their bodies with their husbands, fathers or brothers, so it’s essential to direct health messages towards men to increase their awareness of and willingness to discuss the problem,” she said. Researchers found that community health nurses had the greatest impact in raising awareness of early breast cancer symptoms with both men and women. These Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are embedded in the community and are far more effective than national advertising campaigns in overcoming cultural barriers because they have the trust of husbands and fathers as well as the women at risk. The study showed that schools are the second best channel through which to raise awareness in young women, and in third place was the media, which has seen some success in raising awareness through charity initiatives in the country. Traditional marketing campaigns were one of the least effective channels. PTI"

Building on a safe turf,"Arjun Kamal

The recent collapse of a five-storey building in Mumbai is yet another example of the careless attitude adopted in the construction of buildings in India. The news of building collapse or the collapse of balcony, chhajja, canopy, etc are very common in our country. Such disasters occur often during rains, storms, earthquakes or even due to overloading in marriage or religious celebrations. An eye for the right site Unsafe construction practices and wrong selection of site are the main culprits in such accidents as was seen in the case of collapse of buildings in Chennai a few years ago. Site selection, thus, is one of the foremost factors when it comes to creating a safe built environment. It is also one of the most neglected aspects. Every building needs a flat surface to transfer its overall load, as well as the load that it carries in the form of its occupants, the furniture and the equipment that it houses. If the water table of a site is high then suitable measures should be taken in the structural design to make a building safe for the occupants. Actually it is better to avoid construction, especially of high-rises in such locations. Another factor related to site is its topographic analysis. This analysis comprises studying the type of soil at a particular site and its slopes. With the help of these studies we come to know about the natural drainage and buildable and non-buildable slopes. Areas of natural drainage should be strictly avoided for construction. Ridge lines (lines of intersection of two sloping planes of a site) are best for building roads as the water moves away from them. On the other hand valley lines (lines joining inclined surfaces, down which water flows), are the areas for natural drainage. On any site, water has a tendency to flow through these valley lines. These areas are best suitable for water channels and agriculture since they will get a ready flow of water and rich sediment deposition. Soil survey also comprises a crucial part of topographic analyses. Such surveys give vital information about erodability of soils and the dangers connected with its cutting and filling. During this analysis, information about the type of rock is also recorded. In the case of soft and unstable rocks even a slight disturbance can cause vibration thereby causing landslides which often result in loss of life and property. Analysis for topography should be conducted so that such instances don’t occur. The only thing that can make this possible in our country is the awareness, initiative and enforcement. Often, authorities are active in alerting the residents about unsafe buildings but indifference of the latter results in loss of lives like it happened in the case of Vakola building in Santa Cruz, Mumbai. Many sites are wetlands, that is, they remain saturated with water either temporarily or forever. Wetlands are, in fact, the best defence that Nature has provided us against flooding. Often referred to as natural sponges, these slow down rainwater, absorb it and let it percolate in ground leading to groundwater recharge. They also clean water by removing harmful pollutants like residual metals and organic materials. The Chennai building was built on a wetland, hence there was no solid strata for its effective load transfer. Many countries have made stringent laws for wetland protection.

Bad beams and slabs

Another dangerous practice that is rampant in India is the use of “flat beams”. These have longer surface as their horizontal face and the shorter surface as the vertical one. Surprisingly, for structural stability this should be vice versa. Today, most of the buildings are being constructed from Reinforced Cement Concrete popularly known as RCC. Concrete can handle compressive stresses but can’t handle tensile stresses. That’s why steel reinforcement bars are used to resist these tensile forces. While designing beams, the depth should be more than the width. Beams with more depth than their width distribute loads more effectively as compared to the wrongly designed beams having more width than their depth, which results in their cracking as seen in the figure. Another factor while designing RCC structures is the quality of the cement and steel. Cement has a expiry date beyond which it starts losing its strength. Often unscrupulous builders use cement that has crossed its expiry date of use, which results in poor effective strength of structure resulting in building collapse. Another component of RCC is that the steel used should be free from impurities. Unscrupulous manufacturers use steel scrap, to manufacture reinforcement bars, which has low strength as compared to fresh steel which is free from impurities. The result is, again, an unsafe structure made of weak steel reinforcements which can collapse any time. One dangerous reason for the overconfidence of these builders is that such structures stay intact for many years because they are designed for an “ultimate load”. This means the maximum load which they can bear doesn’t get imposed on them for a long time. However, whenever such load is encountered in the form of a crowd, collapses happen.

Regulating expert feed

Another reason for such rampant unsafe construction is that there is “no minimum qualification” required to become a builder. Anyone having enough contacts and money can buy a piece of land and start building a project on it. The system required for registration of civil engineers is also lacking. Structures are designed by civil engineers only and expert engineers can ensure safe and solid buildings by making accurate calculation of structural members viz. how much concrete and what type of reinforcement would be used for a safe and economical design. This absence of registration has resulted in unqualified people doing the job of “structural design” and municipal bodies have no control over them. Ironically, when India encountered one of the worst earthquakes in its history — the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 — the government announced that it would start mandatory registration for all civil engineers in order to end the practice of unsafe structural designs. But till date no such thing has happened.

Pitfalls of profit

Many times in their greed to make more profit builders deviate from the building plans approved from the development authority. Recently after the Chennai building collapse, a survey for multi-storeyed and special buildings was conducted by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. The results were shocking. The authority found that over 50 per cent of the structures under survey had deviated from the approved plan. People responsible for such unsafe buildings, however, are yet to be brought to book.

Lax fire safety

Another major factor which is responsible for deaths in buildings in India is fire. A key thing to note here is that a majority of casualities in fire accidents are due to choking rather than burn injuries. This is due to incompetent planning of fire-escape routes in building design. In order to achieve more saleable area, a lot of builders ignore the planning of fire escape routes resulting in a design which becomes a death trap for its users, in case of a fire accident. The National Building Code (2005) clearly states that fire safety certificate is compulsory for handing over a multi-storey building for public use. Builders cross the line of law while giving possession to the buyers when they don’t get a fire clearance for such buildings.Better monitoring and law enforcement is the only way to stop this menace of unsafe buildings. Registration should be made mandatory for all civil engineers like it is for all architects in India. Only, architects having valid license should be allowed to submit a building plan. Stringent monitoring of builders should be done for completion certificates of buildings. Moreover landscape architects should be made a core part of team while carrying out constructions in hilly or large areas. Topographic analyses must become an integral part of any architectural design. — The writer is an architect. and interior designer"
