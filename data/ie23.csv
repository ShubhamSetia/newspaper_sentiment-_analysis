Top-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska survived a second-set comeback bid from Eugenie Bouchard to advance to the quarterfinals of the Connecticut Open on Tuesday.

The 10th-ranked Radwanska, who won the title in New Haven last year, defeated Bouchard 6-3, 7-5 in 1 hour, 45 minutes. The Polish veteran is 4-0 in her career against the Canadian, who needed a wild card to enter the tournament.

Bouchard fought off two match points but was broken while serving to force a tiebreak.

“I expected this kind of match,” Radwanska said. “I think she seems better now than a few months ago, playing more consistent.

“I’m feeling much better than in the beginning of the year. I’m not struggling with my health anymore so I feel strong. I feel better and more confident on court as well so that is helping.”

Also advancing were Australia’s Daria Gavrilova, who needed 2 hours, 12 minutes to defeat Timea Babos of Hungary 7-5, 7-6 (6), and Elise Mertens of Belgium, a straight-sets winner over Russia’s Daria Kasatkina. No. 8 seed Peng Shuai of China eliminated Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia with a 6-2, 6-3 victory, and Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro moved into the second round when Slovakia’s Jana Cepelova retired in the second set of their match.

The Connecticut Open is the final women’s tuneup for the U.S. Open, which begins on Monday.

A day after three-hour downpour paralysed Mohali, Tuesday witnessed dawn of the aftermath. In Phase 5, where water entered several houses, the situation was alarming. There was no drinking water and residents had to go to bed hungry as they were unable to cook in their kitchen. But they couldn’t get any sleep as the mattresses were all wet.

Talking about the situation, Tarsem Lal, a resident, said that water was still present inside several houses and people were unable to go to work on Tuesday. With the city under the grip of vector-borne diseases, residents have urged the Municipal Corporation (MC) and the health department to carry out fogging in the area to stop mosquitoes from breeding in the water and prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. The residents also met the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Gurpreet Kaur Sapra and demanded compensation for the damages. They said that the DC listened to their problems, but said that she could only visit the areas after August 25 as she is busy in making arrangements for maintaining law and order in the city.

“Some of my neighbours provided food to those who could not cook in their kitchen. Everybody has put out their clothes and mattresses for drying outside their houses. Our houses are stinking,thus making it impossible to sit inside,” said Balbir Singh, a resident. The residents also met the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Gurpreet Kaur Sapra and demanded compensation for the damages. They said that the DC listened to their problems, but said that she could only visit the areas after August 25 as she is busy in making arrangements for maintaining law and order in the city. Neelam Sharma, another resident of the locality said that there was no supply of drinking water on Tuesday and residents had to remain without water till afternoon. She also said that important documents of many people were damaged in the water.

Monday’s heavy downpour has not only got the residents worried, but the administration as well. Mayor Kulwant Singh stated that an emergency meeting of all the engineers and other concerned officers have been called to discuss the issue. The mayor said that they will get a fresh survey done of the drainage systems at airport road and Phase 5 so that problems could be identified and fixed accordingly. Councillor Arun Sharma said that they have urged the MC to start fogging in the area. He said that as water has accumulated in some of the houses there is a danger that dengue and malaria may spread. He added that the DC had assured them to fast-track the fogging process.

Meanwhile, the teams of MC engineers also inspected various sites which were waterlogged. The sources in the MC said that the teams inspected the storm water drains on the airport road which was badly hit by the rain. On the otherhand, the motor market saw heavy rush as many people arrived there to get their vehicles repaired.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI: Virat Kohli hints at continuing with same team combination","Virat Kohli-led Indian team defeated Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in first ODI. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli-led Indian team defeated Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in first ODI. (Source: AP)

India are all set to take on Sri Lanka in the second match of the five-match series at Pallekele. After thumping the hosts by 9 wickets, The Virat Kohli-led side would now be eyeing to stretch their lead in this second encounter and the Indian skipper Virat Kohli on Wednesday hinted on continuing with the same team combination as first ODI.

“Wicket similar to Dambulla. I don’t see any reason to change team just after 1 game but everything and any combination is possible,” said Virat Kohli.

Kohli also talked about the roles of the players in the team, he said that the upcoming season is an opportunity for every member to define their roles.

This coming season gives us an opportunity to define roles for players and give them time to execute it so that for the World Cup, we know exactly what one player needs to do in certain situations,” Kohli told

“And it helps someone like MS also because he doesn’t play Test cricket anymore. This long streak of matches will help him be in touch with the international games, find some momentum and stick to it,” Kohli added.

“So it’s an opportunity for everyone in the team including MS to create good habits and sustain them over a period of time,” the skipper said.

Axar Patel was picked up in the playing XI in first match of the series in Dambulla and speaking about opting for Patel over Kuldeep Yadav, Kohli told that apart from his bowling, Axar is good with the bat as well as pretty good in the field.

“It was a case of having two left-arm spinners that led us not playing Kuldeep in the first game. Axar was favoured more than Kuldeep from the point of view that he bats quite well and he is a gun (great) in the field also. Kuldeep has got opportunities in the past,” he said.

“(Yuzvendra) Chahal and Axar are guys who haven’t got many opportunities so we want to test them out. It’s all about giving opportunities to people which we feel will not hamper our plans in any way and at the same time, it’s about giving them exposure at international cricket,” he further added.

Mentioning Kuldeep’s abilities, Virat suggested that a player like him is always a “boost” for the team.

“Kuldeep remains in the thick of things all the time. To have a guy like that in the team is always a boost. You might see two wrist spinners playing together if we feel that we don’t need that much depth in the batting in the coming games,” said the skipper.

The Indian skipper also talked about Hardik Pandya and how consistent he is with the ball.

“Hardik has the ability to swing the ball and he can bowl consistently over 135 km/hr. With the new ball, he can get a bit of extra bounce because of his height. He has bowled with the new ball in India against England and against New Zealand in a few games as well. We certainly look at it as a great option for us,” he said.

“Being the fifth bowler in the team, we can get four-five overs out of the way in the first 10, when the ball is swinging. Also Jasprit Bumrah is our strike bowler and he comes in one-change. The teams obviously will be a bit more wary against him so that really gives us good balance in terms of whom to use when,” he added.

District officials told to finalise 10 days for relaxation in noise norms,"On August 10, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) amended the existing noise rules as Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2017. On August 10, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) amended the existing noise rules as Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2017.

The Maharashtra Government on Tuesday asked the district administrations across the state to notify the remaining 10 days this year in which grace time would be given for use of loudspeakers till midnight instead of the mandatory 10 pm. The move comes in the backdrop of the amendments in the Noise Pollution Rules of 2000, which allows the district collectors to allocate 15 days a year to relax noise norms from 6 pm to 12am. The right earlier rested with the state government. The amendment was passed on August 10.

The state government had, however, last year notified 15 days in which noise pollution rules were to be relaxed. However, with five of these 15 days having gone this year and with the impending Ganesh festival, the state government has asked district authorities to quickly finalise the 10 days when sound norms will be relaxed.

“Of the 15 days that were notified for relaxation in 2017, five have already passed this year. All district collectors in lieu of the forthcoming festive season should identify the 10 days when norms will be relaxed and publicise these dates in respective districts,” a Government Resolution stated.

On August 10, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) amended the existing noise rules as Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2017. Before the amendment, the state government used to decide the 15 days a year where grace time would be given for use of loudspeakers till midnight instead of the mandatory 10 pm. Now, instead of the state government the district authorities will decide on the same.

Champions League Play-offs: In-demand Lorenzo Insigne nets as Napoli advance,"Napoli’s Lorenzo Insigne scored in the 89th minute to make it 2-0 for the Italian team. (Source: Reuters) Napoli’s Lorenzo Insigne scored in the 89th minute to make it 2-0 for the Italian team. (Source: Reuters)

Lorenzo Insigne netted his 50th goal for Napoli on Tuesday as the in-demand forward helped his team book a place in the Champions League group stage by beating Nice. Napoli was already leading through Jose Callejon’s goal when Insigne struck from the edge of the penalty area in the 89th minute to complete a 2-0 win on the French Riviera and send his team through 4-0 on aggregate.

Whether Insigne is still at Napoli next month is unclear, with Barcelona among the leading clubs reported to be interested in signing him before the summer transfer window closes on Aug. 31.

“I’m proud to hear that top clubs are watching me, but doing well with the Napoli shirt is something I have always dreamt of,” Insigne said on the UEFA website. “I think we improved a lot, especially in terms of mentality, hopefully we can also win trophies.”

The 26-year-old Insigne is off the mark quickly this season after taking three months to find the net last year.

“Lorenzo is an absolute talent,” Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri said. “At the moment he’s the player who best represents Italian football.”

There was a very different verdict on Nice’s Italian striker, Mario Balotelli, who was described as “highly inadequate” by coach Lucien Favre.

Balotelli had been off the pitch arguing with the fourth official, leaving Nice with 10 men early in the second half, when the unmarked Callejon tapped in at the far post to put Napoli in front. Balotelli, who has a checkered disciplinary record, was booed by his own Nice fans when he was later substituted.

SCORING RECORD

Celtic held a 5-0 lead over Astana but the Scottish champions were given a scare in Kazakhstan, where they lost 4-3 but still advanced 8-4 on aggregate. The 12 goals over the two games set a scoring record for the Champions League playoff round.

Kristoffer Ajer’s own goal in the 26th minute gave Astana a glimmer of hope of mounting a comeback. Although Scott Sinclair leveled eight minutes later, quick-fire Astana goals at the start of second half from Serikzhan Muzhikov and Patrick Twumasi restored the host’s lead on the night.

Twumasi netted again in the 69th to send Astana into a 4-1 lead but his team still required three more goals to go through. Celtic’s nerves were eased by goals in the 80th from Olivier Ntcham and Leigh Griffiths in the 90th.

MARIBOR AT THE TREBLE

Only one side in action on Tuesday was eliminated after winning the first leg. Hapoel Be’er Sheva’s 2-1 advantage over Maribor was wiped out by the Slovenian side winning the second leg 1-0 at home.

Maribor went through 2-2 on away goals to contest the group stage for a third time after previously qualifying in 1999 and 2014.

FAVOURITES ADVANCE

Sevilla is through to the group stage for a third successive season after drawing 2-2 with competition newcomer Istanbul Basaksehir to advance 4-3 on aggregate. Sergio Escudero and Wissam Ben Yedder scored for Sevilla.

Rijeka’s first Champions League campaign in 18 years is over after Olympiakos built on its 2-1 first leg success by winning 1-0 in Croatia. The Greek side will contest the group stage for the 18th time.

The lineup for Thursday’s group-stage draw will be completed on Wednesday. Teams losing in the playoff round drop into the group stage of the Europa League in September.

* Destructive winds, waves batter Hong Kong

* Financial markets, schools, businesses closed

* A total of 420 flights cancelled

* Worst storm in five years

Typhoon Hato, a maximum category 10 storm, slammed into Hong Kong on Wednesday lashing the Asian financial hub with destructive winds and waves which uprooted trees, flooded streets and forced most businesses to close.

More than 400 flights were cancelled, financial markets suspended and schools closed as Hato bore down on the city, the first category 10 storm to hit Hong Kong since typhoon Vicente in 2012.

Many skyscrapers in the heart of the financial centre were empty and in darkness as the city’s workers stayed at home and hunkered through the storm. Hato churned up Hong Kong’s iconic Victoria Harbour and triggered large swells and massive waves on some of the city’s most popular beaches, with serious flooding in low-lying areas.

In residential districts like Heng Fa Chuen on densely populated Hong Kong island, massive waves smashed against the sides of oceanfront buildings and surged over a promenade, swamping vehicles parked nearby.

Construction cranes swayed precipitously from the tops of skyscrapers, trees toppled and residents deployed canoes to get around on some streets.

“I’ve never seen one like this,” said Garrett Quigley, a longtime resident of Lantau island to the west of the city. “Cars are half submerged and roads are impassable with flooding and huge trees down. It’s crazy.”

Maximum winds near Hato’s centre were recorded at a destructive 155 kmh (95 mph).

A senior scientific officer for the Hong Kong observatory said sea levels could rise up to five metres (15 feet) in some places, with the government issuing flood alerts and opening 27 temporary shelters across the city.

Winds intensified in the morning, with the maximum sustained winds recorded at Tate’s Cairn and Waglan Island at 77 kmh (48 mph) and 72 kmh (48 mph), with maximum gusts of 103 kmh (64 mph) and 86 kmh (53 mph) respectively.

Trading in Hong Kong’s financial markets was halted for the day, the stock exchange said. Typhoon Nida in August last year was the last storm to close the exchange for the whole day.

A total of 420 airline flights to and from Hong Kong had been cancelled, said the government.

The city’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, said the storm would “severely” impact flight operations, with the majority of flights to and from Hong Kong between 2200 GMT Tuesday and 0900 GMT Wednesday to be cancelled.

Hong Kong Airlines also suspended most of its flights on Wednesday up until 0900 GMT.

Other transport services, including ferries to the gaming hub of Macau and outlying islands in Hong Kong, were suspended.

"Statins may help combat typhoid, malaria","It would be highly beneficial for patients to develop a better immune system with lesser drugs. (Source: File Photo) It would be highly beneficial for patients to develop a better immune system with lesser drugs. (Source: File Photo)

Besides lowering cholesterol levels, drugs such as statins or Ezetimibe may one day prove to be effective in providing protection against infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, researchers have found.

The findings give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease and point to possible avenues to protect against pathogens — like Salmonella or Ebola — that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells. “This is just the first step,” said Dennis C. Ko, Assistant Professor at the Duke University in the US.

“Our study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,” Ko added.

The study, appearing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that some people may be more susceptible to the highly contagious disease through a gene variant — VAC14 — which affects cholesterol levels. This mutation was found to raise cholesterol levels which binds Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the potentially deadly infection, to a person’s cells, thus increasing the risk of typhoid fever.

According to World Health Organisation estimates, nearly 21 million cases and 222,000 typhoid-related deaths occur annually worldwide.

“Discovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins, for high cholesterol,” Ko said. “We wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,” Ko noted.

Furthermore, other common cholesterol-lowering drug like Ezetimibe were found to protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi. The researchers emphasised the need to try the approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before considering taking this into the clinic.

"Veteran artist Haroon Khimani, 81, to showcase his latest work in Mumbai","Haroon Khimani’s paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation. Haroon Khimani’s paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation.

Haroon Khimani might be an octogenarian but it has not lessened his love for art. The 81-year-old — who always seeks to discover the beauty of nature, mostly in collapsed structures and disasters, be it natural or man-made — will soon showcase his latest contemporary retrospective visual arts exhibition titled ‘Descent’ in Mumbai. His paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation, steeped into potential energy of rebuilding.

“There is an ethical side to nature which borders between ‘being’ and ‘nothingness’. That inspires me the most. For the artist, it is a chance to step inside their own creations, to appear in a visual story and establish an interaction. Creating a super sensual existence on the canvass is an intense personal experience. In my paintings you will see nature acts as a backdrop that determines human fate. Everything is in a flux. Ultimately the desperate elements form a whole and add to the tempo of narrative,” Khimani said in a statement.

The veteran artist, has earlier stated on his website, “Beauty has a new definition for me. My paintings look like landscapes but there is unusual magnitude of structural juxtaposition, depth, recession and space created by colours perceived through black and white tones. We all are habituated to see beauty in limited terms but in disorganised and chaotic nature new beauty forms are created by self-destruction of the existing structures. Nature does this wonderfully but it depends upon our outlook to see the beauty in it. In fact, at such junctures we are emotionally driven to sympathy towards sufferers and dislocated mass, which leads us to see the pathetic and helpless part of it rather than the aesthetic value.”

Spain identifies driver of Barcelona rampage van as hunt continues,"Police put up scores of roadblocks across northeast Spain on Sunday in hopes of capturing a fugitive suspect at large following the vehicle attack. (AP Photo) Police put up scores of roadblocks across northeast Spain on Sunday in hopes of capturing a fugitive suspect at large following the vehicle attack. (AP Photo)

Spanish police said on Monday they had identified the driver of a van that mowed down pedestrians in Barcelona, killing 13, as an international manhunt for the suspect believed to be a Moroccan national deepened. In a tweet, police in Catalonia said they knew who the driver was without naming him, but regional interior minister Joaquim Forn said in a radio interview that “everything suggests the van driver is Younes Abouyaaqoub.”

The 22-year-old Moroccan is believed to be the last remaining member of a 12-person cell still at large in Spain or abroad, with the others killed by police or detained over last week’s twin attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils. Investigators have honed in on an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, aged in his 40s, who is among the suspects and is believed to have radicalised youths in Ripoll, a small town at the foot of the Pyrenees.

Several suspects — including Abouyaaqoub — grew up or lived there. Police raided more homes there on Monday morning, Forn said.

Police said the imam had spent time in prison and had once been in contact with a suspect wanted on terrorism charges, without giving further details. El Mundo newspaper reported that Satty had struck up a friendship in prison with Rachid Aglif, who is serving an 18-

year sentence over the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people.

Prosecutors in Belgium also said he had spent time in the country, without elaborating. The imam has been missing since Tuesday. On Saturday, police raided his apartment. They have raised the possibility that he died in an explosion on Wednesday evening at a house

believed to be the suspects’ bomb-making factory, where police uncovered a cache of 120 gas canisters.

The suspected jihadists had been preparing bombs for “one or more attacks in Barcelona”, regional police chief Josep Lluis Trapero told reporters, revealing that traces of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) — a homemade explosive that is a hallmark of the Islamic State (IS) group — had also been found.

The suspects accidentally caused an explosion at the house on the eve of Thursday’s attack in Barcelona — an error that likely forced them to modify their plans. Instead, they used a vehicle to smash into crowds on Barcelona’s Las Ramblas boulevard as it was thronged with

tourists, killing 13 people and injuring about 100.

Several hours later, a similar attack in the seaside town of Cambrils left one woman dead. Police shot and killed the five attackers in Cambrils, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts and carrying knives. IS claimed responsibility for the attacks, believed to be

its first in Spain.

Australian citizenship crisis erodes support for government,"Turnbull’s centre-right coalition government trails the opposition Labor party by a margin of 54-46, a Newspoll for the Australian newspaper showed, the lowest since February 2017 when support for Turnbull hit its lowest level.

(Photo: Reuters)

Australia’s government hit a six-month low in a widely-watched opinion poll on Monday, with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s one-seat majority in jeopardy over a citizenship crisis which could see three cabinet ministers thrown out of parliament. Australia’s parliament has been rocked by the revelation that seven politicians, including three ministers, are dual citizens, potentially ruling them ineligible to hold elected office. Turnbull’s centre-right coalition government trails the opposition Labor party by a margin of 54-46, a Newspoll for the Australian newspaper showed, the lowest since February 2017 when support for Turnbull hit its lowest level.

At the same time support for the far-right One Nation party jumped two points. One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson drew political rebuke last week when she wore a burqa in parliament as part of a campaign to ban the burqa on security grounds.

The next national election is not due until 2019, but continued poor polling may entice a leadership challenge to Turnbull, says political analysts.

“Voters seem to have made up their mind that this government under Turnbull is not effective. The only way he can turn it around is to get the citizenship issue out of the way quickly,” said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.

The High Court of Australia will this week set out a timetable for ruling on the eligibility of the seven politicians under a citizenship cloud. A 116-year-old law demands an elected lawmaker only have Australian citizenship, but some have discovered they hold dual citizenship by descent of a father being born in another country, such as neighbouring New Zealand.

Australian Attorney-General George Brandis said on Sunday said a final decision was unlikely before mid-October. Labor leader Bill Shorten called on the High Court to disqualify the seven politicians. “The constitution needs to be upheld and honoured,” Shorten told reporters in Sydney.

Britain seeks smooth rules to resolve legal disputes post Brexit,"Britain says it will leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice once it quits the bloc in Mach 2019, meaning new structures will be needed for resolving international disputes. (File photo) Britain says it will leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice once it quits the bloc in Mach 2019, meaning new structures will be needed for resolving international disputes. (File photo)

Britain says rules governing judicial cooperation with the European Union should stay much as they are now after Brexit to prevent international business disputes and divorce battles from becoming longer and more complicated. Britain’s Department for Exiting the European Union says the country wants to “mirror closely the current EU system” governing which country’s courts deal with civil disputes, which laws apply and how judgments are enforced.

In a paper Tuesday, the government did not say in detail how that could happen.

Britain says it will leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice once it quits the bloc in Mach 2019, meaning new structures will be needed for resolving international disputes. Negotiations between Britain and the bloc are to resume in Brussels at the end of August.

"Sebi slaps Rs 42 lakh fine on Exelon Infrastructure, 3 others","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo)

Sebi on Wednesday imposed a total fine of Rs 42 lakh on Exelon Infrastructure Ltd (EIL) and three others for failing to provide relevant information on issues including dealings in the shares of the firm as sought by the regulator. While EIL has been fined Rs 10 lakh for failing to furnish information, a penalty of Rs 20 lakh, Rs 10 lakh and Rs 2 lakh has been slapped on directors Srinivas Rao Marupadi, Shaik Ameer Basha and Ravinder Deshpande, respectively.

Following a stock price jump in EIL in 2011, Sebi conducted a probe into the trading activities in the scrip during December 2010 to January 2012 and observed that major corporate announcements were made by the company during the period.

The probe revealed that various positive corporate announcements made by EIL were not supported by the fundamentals of the company and the announcements were not implemented by the firm subsequently, Sebi Adjudication Officer B J Dilip said in an order.

In order to ascertain the role of entities involved in the manipulation and the role of company and its directors, the investigation authority (IA) issued summons, seeking relevant information for the purpose of investigation.

Dilip said: “I am convinced that EIL, Basha and Marupadi failed to provide information sought by the IA through summons and various reminders regarding implementation status of various announcements made by the company, which I consider was material for the investigations.”

About the information sought by the IA on details of dealings in shares of EIL, shareholding and proof of disclosures made to the firm and stock exchanges, Dilip also said Deshpande and Marupadi “have failed to submit complete information”.

“I consider non-submission of information sought by the IA would not only weaken the case against those who are involved, but also delay gathering of evidences against such entities and thus hamper the investigation,” the officer noted.

Ishant Sharma, who last played for India in March against Australia in the four-match Test series, is enjoying his free time in Maldives, where he is trying a hand at snorkeling. Making full use of his family time, Ishant uploaded pictures of himself under water from his official Twitter account. He posted two pictures on Twitter with the caption, “Trying to find some seam and bounce under water #maldives #snorkeling #familytime.”

Ishant was recently in news that suggested that he is joining County Cricket for Warwickshire along with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. However, Ishant put an end to all the rumours doing the rounds by a tweet saying that he has not joined Warwickshire or any other county. His tweet read, “Contrary to the news rounds through various sites, have not signed Warwickshire or any other county.”

The 28-year old last played an ODI for India in January last year against Australia in Sydney. He has since then been excluded from the limited overs format. Part of India’s squad for the recently concluded Sri Lanka Test series, Ishant was restricted to the bench after being out of favour since the Australia Test series in March where he claimed three wickets in three Tests.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

German police placed concrete barriers in front of Cologne’s world famous gothic cathedral on Wednesday after reports that Islamist militants sought to target Barcelona’s La Sagrada Familia, another icon of ecclesiastical architecture. Many German cities have tightened security since last week’s van attack that killed 13 people in Barcelona, after a period in which most were wary of erecting barriers for fear of triggering a fortress mentality that would put off visitors.

“We took the decision to act as quickly as possible after looking at attacks in Europe,” a police spokeswoman said on Thursday. “Our job is to protect sensitive points, and the cathedral is a symbol of Cologne, known around the world.” Spanish media reported that the Islamist militant cell that sent a van ploughing into strollers on Barcelona’s showpiece Las Ramblas boulevard had been plotting an attack on Antoni Gaudi’s art nouveau landmark, the Sagrada Familia church. Cologne’s immense cathedral, the work of unidentified medieval masons, towers over the Rhine river city. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the cathedral was one of the few buildings in Cologne’s centre to survive World War Two bombings.

Although there have been around a dozen attacks around Europe by militants driving trucks, cities have not rushed to mitigate risks by changing their layout. They have been deterred by high costs, the belief that any measures now will soon be obsolete and a reluctance to disrupt everyday life. “We don’t want to wall up the city,” Andreas Geisel, Berlin’s senator for interior affairs, said in an interview with Bild newspaper. “That would achieve the opposite of what we want: to send out an image of calm and relaxedness.”

In the German capital, barriers remain in place around the site of a Christmas market where a militant drove a stolen truck into crowds and killed 12 people last year, but few other visible measures have been implemented.

"Italy, France and Germany ask European Union to boost powers to block foreign acquisitions: Reports","“It is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,” Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa. (Representative Image) “It is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,” Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa. (Representative Image)

Italy, France and Germany have asked the European Commission to reinforce existing regulations that allow EU states to block foreign acquisitions of European companies, two Italian dailies reported on Tuesday. The request cited the ‘golden powers’ to bar or set conditions for would-be buyers “that operate with rules that do not follow the market and that do not respect rules of reciprocity for acquisitions,” Il Sole 24 Ore and La Stampa reported, citing a leaked letter. European Union leaders agreed in June to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.

The letter was sent to the Commission on July 28 and follows a similar one in February. Although it mentions no countries or firms by name, it appears to have been motivated by recent takeovers by Beijing in Europe. The powers would be reinforced for all target companies viewed as strategic and in cases of takeovers financed by state funds or agencies, says the ten-page document cited by the newspapers.

“It is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,” Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa.

The three countries recommended that under the new regulations, which should not replace national rules, member states should notify the Commission every six months of all corporate investments from outside the bloc, except those in the defence sector.

US Navy to relieve Seventh fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin of duty after collisions,"FILE PHOTO: Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin (Source: REUTERS) FILE PHOTO: Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin (Source: REUTERS)

The commander of the US Navy’s Seventh Fleet will be relieved of his duty following a deadly collision between a destroyer and a merchant vessel, the latest in a spate of similar accidents, a defence official has said.

The decision to remove Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin from the post in Japan comes as the Navy is undertaking a fleet-wide global investigation in the wake of the incident Monday involving the USS John S. McCain which left 10 sailors missing and five injured.

It was the second fatal collision in two months — coming after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship off Japan in June, leaving seven sailors dead –and the fourth accident in the Pacific this year involving an American warship. The incidents have sparked concern that the US Navy could be overstretched in East Asia — both ships belonged to the Seventh Fleet — as it tackles China’s rising assertiveness and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

The latest accident happened before dawn in busy shipping lanes around the Strait of Singapore, and sent water flooding into the vessel. A massive search involving planes and aircraft was launched and US Navy divers joined the hunt yesterday, scouring the ship’s flooded compartments. Divers have found remains of some of the sailors, Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, said on Tuesday.

The McCain had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a “freedom of navigation operation” in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August, sparking a furious response from Beijing. On Monday the Chief of US Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered commanders within a week to set aside time, perhaps “one or two days,” for crews to sit down together for discussions. A “comprehensive review” of practices would also begin.

The admiral did not rule out some kind of outside interference or a cyber-attack being behind the latest collision, but said he did not want to prejudge the inquiry. His broader remarks suggested a focus on “how we do business on the bridge.”

The nights after Summerslam always prove to be exciting and Smackdown Live lived up to its expectations. After AJ Styles retained the United States Title both Owens and Styles were right back in each other’s face. Owens reiterated his thoughts that he was denied a win due to unfair advantage. Demanding a rematch, KO also demanded that he choose the referee.

However, the surprise of the evening came when Smackdown became glorious with the arrival of former NXT Champion Bobby Roode. On his debut, Roode put an impressive performance as he defeated Aiden English. However, the string of surprises did not end there as SmackDown LIVE General Manager Daniel Bryan revealed another new addition to Smackdown- Shelton Benjamin.

After the loss at Summerslam, Japanese rock star Shinsuke Nakamura had his share of revenge when he took on The Singh Brothers in a 1-on-2 Handicap Match.

In the main event of the night, Kevin Owens took on Aj Styles but chose Baron Corbin as the special guest referee. Corbin agreed to the officiating role on the condition that KO gives him an opportunity to challenge him for the United States Title if he wins back the championship, to which Owens agreed.

While Corbin remained fair through the match, towards the end a shove by AJ Styles changed his stand. As he attempted to take down Styles, Shane McMahon interfered and ensured it doesn’t happen. A frustrated Corbin left the ring and Shane-O-Mac donned the role of a referee. This left Kevin Owens a bit distracted and allowed Styles to hit the phenomenal fore-arm.

In the latest update to Neymar transfer saga, his lawyers have announced that the Brazilian will contest legal action against him initiated by former club Barcelona, who are suing the Paris Saint Germain forward for 8.5 million euros ($10.00 million) for breach of contract.

The statement from the 25-year old and his lawyers read, “The player’s formal defence will be filed in due course. Regarding the bonuses owed for the execution of the contract of 2016, it is also necessary to inform that the player has already initiated the formal procedures of collection before the competent courts.”

On Tuesday, the Spanish club asked for an additional 10 percent payment due to a delay in their demands being met after Neymar’s record 222 million euro move. The Catalans statement read, “Barcelona have taken these actions in defence of their interests, after Neymar’s contract was rescinded just a few months after he signed on until 2021.”

Neymar had also come out to criticise his former club on Sunday, saying, “I am disappointed with them (Barcelona directors). I spent four very happy years there and left happy, but not with them. For me they shouldn’t be in charge of Barcelona. Barca deserve much better and everyone knows this.”

Bangladesh sentences 10 to death for 2000 plot to kill PM Sheikh Hasina,"Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (File photo) Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (File photo)

A Bangladesh court has sentenced to death 10 leaders and activists from a banned Islamist group for a plot in 2000 to kill Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by planting bombs at one of her rallies. Judge Mamtaz Begum sentenced the suspects on Sunday in Dhaka, the capital, and ordered them to be shot to death, which is unusual in Bangladesh, where most executions take place by hanging. Prosecutors said two bombs were found a day before Hasina was scheduled to address a rally at a college campus in the southern town of Kotalipara.

Those convicted belong to the Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami group. Defense attorneys said they would appeal the verdict. The group’s former chief, Mufti Abdul Hannan, was involved in the plot along with his associates, prosecutors told the court. Hannan was hanged in April for his involvement in a 2004 grenade attack on a British envoy in Bangladesh. The court acquitted 10 of the suspects for lack of evidence, said prosecutor Khondaker Abdul Mannan. Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami has been blamed for many attacks in Bangladesh in recent years. Though weakened, the group is struggling to fight the government’s nationwide crackdown against hard-liners who want to establish strict Islamic law in the Muslim-majority country.

Hannan studied in India and Pakistan, and fought against Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan in the 1980s before returning to Bangladesh. Bangladesh has experienced a rise of Islamic militancy in recent years. Scores of attacks have taken place against members of minority groups, foreigners and atheist bloggers. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for many of the attacks, but Prime Minister Hasina’s government has rejected the claims. Authorities say the IS doesn’t exist in Bangladesh and blame the attacks on a domestic group, Jumatul Mujahedin Bangladesh. Hasina, who is in her second stint as Bangladesh’s leader, was also prime minister from 1996 to 2001.

"Conor McGregor win would be ‘dreadful’ for boxing, says Jeff Horn","Jeff Horn said Conor McGregor would struggle to even land a punch on the undefeated American. (Source: AP) Jeff Horn said Conor McGregor would struggle to even land a punch on the undefeated American. (Source: AP)

Australia’s Jeff Horn has given Conor McGregor little chance of beating Floyd Mayweather in Saturday’s super-fight and hopes the American will “annihilate” the mixed martial arts fighter for the sake of boxing.

Horn, who became WBO welterweight champion by beating 38-year-old Manny Pacquiao in Brisbane last month, said McGregor would struggle to even land a punch on the undefeated American.

Mayweather (49-0) has not fought in nearly two years but is a heavy favourite to surpass Rocky Marciano’s record in the Las Vegas bout, which purists have dismissed as an exhibition.

“I hope Mayweather annihilates him and I think he will,” Horn said in comments published by News Ltd media on Tuesday. “It will be dreadful for the sport of boxing if Mayweather, one of the greatest fighters of all time, gets rolled by a guy having his first fight but I can’t see McGregor doing too well even with all the hype.

“Their fight is going to be under boxing rules and Mayweather will probably not even get hit. If McGregor’s got any sense he’ll crash tackle Floyd at the opening bell and put a choke hold on him, get disqualified and then they’ll have a rematch and make even more money.”

Saturday’s fight is tipped to test the pay-per-view and revenue records set by the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout in 2015. Mayweather’s defeat of the Filipino generated over $400 million from 4.6 million pay-per-views.

After Horn’s own win over Pacquiao, the Australian immediately laid down a challenge to Mayweather, holding up a walking stick to bait the 40-year-old.

Former schoolteacher Horn is set for a rematch against Pacquiao in Brisbane later in the year but said he would “love a crack” at Mayweather.

“He could challenge me for the world welterweight title. And if McGregor wanted to fight me I’d take it right now. I wouldn’t be worried one bit,” said the 29-year-old.

Horn added that he would fight Mayweather like Marcos Maidana, who pushed the American in two defeats in 2014. “A few years ago we saw Marcos Maidana from Argentina give Floyd the fight of his life but Maidana didn’t have the engine to sustain it for 12 rounds,” the Australian said.

“I’d fight Mayweather like Maidana did but I’d do it for 12 rounds, not six.”

ACHYUT KANVINDE AKAR

Edited by Tanuja & Sanjay Kanvinde

Niyogi books

464 pages

By Riyaz Tayyibji

Achyut Kanvinde, born in the small village of Achara in Maharashtra, belonged to the first generation of modern Indian architects who returned to practice in India after an education abroad, in their quest to find an appropriate contemporary expression for a young country with a long past.

Contrary to popular belief, modern architectural design did not find its way to the subcontinent on the back of Le Corbusier. A group of young Indian architects including Habib Rehman, Piloo Modi and Achyut Kanvinde had already established a base here with their work. Kanvinde, deeply influenced by the great Walter Gropius, had a strong rationalist orientation and an exposure to engineering and construction, which would profoundly influence the course of Indian architecture in the five decades after independence.

This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde’s most important works over these five decades. The work itself is presented chronologically and their decade-wise grouping subtly brings out the fundamental shifts in Kanvinde’s work over his incredibly prolific career. Along with the architectural work, which is represented through generously sized drawings (including a marvellous appendix of construction drawings) and photographs, this book also contains the great architects’ own words and writings.

One glimpses a wide array of subjects, from his own work to architectural education, the role of the building professional, and, most engagingly, anecdotes of his experiences with the many great people he worked with. From statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, the industrious Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Dr. Homi Bhabha to the master architects: Gropius, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. These personal experiences are not only of historical value, but make for enthralling reading for anyone interested in history, architecture or simply the spirit and energy of the time just after 1947. Kanvinde’s own writings are simple, and deal directly with the problems and solutions pertaining to our built environment. The tone of his writing, as much as their content, gives us insight into the man known for his quiet humility, unequalled generosity and professional commitment.

In order to tell us more about the man, the editors have interspersed a series of essays into the book, written by Kanvinde’s colleagues, historians and family members, thus creating a background to the work that ranges from the historical to the intimate. However, though an important aspect of the book, this is also, perhaps, its weakest link. The essays are informative, but lack a certain tautness of narrative.

Much more importantly, the book re-produces the work done by Kanvinde at the JJ School of Architecture during his student days. Comprising both sketches and project work, these drawings talk about the predilection and general direction of the country’s architectural education at the time. The book looks at that historic moment of May 17, 1959, when, at the ‘Seminar on Architecture’ at Lalit Kala Academy, Kanvinde delivered an address titled ‘Architectural Expression and National Policy’. Kanvinde argued for a functional, technology-driven modern architecture embedded in the society of the day. The historical implications of this event are not lost on the editors of this book as they reproduce Nehru’s address along with Kanvinde’s own intimate anecdotes about proceedings.

Modern buildings are rarely ‘pretty’. Made in bare materials and unadorned by softer finishes, they’re robust and driven by functional needs. Yet, in the hands of a great architect, like Kanvinde, these buildings have a fierce and powerful beauty. There is a tactile exploration of material, their organisation into evocative structural configurations that allow for a play of light, of inside and outside, of sun and shadow, of movement and gathering. This is an architecture of doing a lot with very little: for a country that had very little. One simply has to turn to page 148 and look at Kanvinde’s Dudhusagar dairy project for the National Dairy Development Board at Mehsana, to recognise that an industrial building can be given a poetry of form. Balanced horizontals and verticals, the play of raw concrete and white plaster, the power of architectural composition squeezed out from a most pragmatic of requirements.

This book brings out the unparalleled relentlessness with which Kanvinde followed his modernist convictions. An almost spiritual orientation which helped the architect find a deep resonance with the historic architecture of the subcontinent. Though modern in its appearance, his buildings seem to imbibe an age-old understanding of the environment in which he built.

Throughout his career Kanvinde’s work was in partnership, first with Shaukat Rai, and then with the addition of Murad Chaudhary. This book documents his final decade of practice, which was largely a

personal one. Now, he challenges his rationalist approach with projects that have high symbolic content (temples) and require logic other than function. He responds to these self-set challenges by returning to his roots — to his JJ School training and to the poetry of Tukaram. Kanvinde’s life work is a study of systematic architectural development in search of dissolution and belonging. An architect who takes the impulses and influences from a foreign place and brings them home. This book is a fitting tribute to the journey of India’s greatest professional, modern architect.

Court documents show that members of a Spanish extremist cell bought knives and an ax between the first and second fatal attacks in the country’s Catalonia region last week. The detail came light as National Court Judge Fernando Andreu issued orders to jail two of the surviving suspects without bail and provisionally freed another. A fourth was ordered held in police custody for another 72 hours. The documents say the cell had to improvise or carry out alternate plans of violence after the house where they were making bombs exploded on Wednesday night.

The judge says in the order released by the National Court late Tuesday: “The blast truncated the initial plan of the terrorists and precipitated the succession of subsequent events.” Those events including the remaining attackers renting vans, the attacks carried out by one of them in Barcelona, and the attack with knives in Cambrils.

A judge has ordered two of the four surviving suspects in last week’s extremist attacks in Spain held without bail, another detained for 72 more hours and one freed. National Court Judge Fernando Andreu issued his orders after hearing the four answer questions on Tuesday about the vehicle attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils that killed 15 people.

Andreu said there was enough evidence to hold 21-year-old Mohamed Houli Chemlal and 28-year-old Driss Oukabir on preliminary charges of causing homicides and injuries of terrorist nature and of belonging to a terrorism organization.

Asmita Kubal, a final-year BSc student of University of Mumbai, had feared the worst. She had thought that her answersheets were lost when her results were not announced along with her batchmates. On Tuesday, she emerged as one of the toppers in her stream. Her results could be declared due to the efforts of a helpdesk set up by the varsity to assist students, she says.

Kubal, a BSc Statistics student, secured 97 per cent marks and she can now apply for her post-graduation course. “I was worried that I won’t get admissions to the PG course as my results were to be declared later and I would miss the deadline,” said Kubal.

While results of most BSc students were announced on July 31, the results of several students were to be released later for reasons like untraceable papers or missing credentials.

In Kubal’s case, her Operational Research Training papers were untraceable on the system.

Following Kubal’s application on Monday, officials at the helpdesk traced her answersheet, got it assessed and handed over the final printed marksheet to her within a day.

Amid the chaos around the delay in publishing the final year results, a team of 10 officials and teachers are working day and night to help students with their admissions abroad and within the country.

So far, around 1,500 applications seeking results have been received, of which, 1,200-odd have already been processed, said an official from the helpdesk. A mechanical engineering student had left for the United States after securing admission in a university. But he would have had to return if he failed to submit his marksheet by Tuesday, 11am.

When his parents approached the university helpdesk on Monday, officials traced his paper and got it assessed late on Monday night.

“The results were ready by 10 am on Tuesday. The marksheet was mailed to the university directly without any delay,” said an official.

In some cases, tracing papers becomes a challenge, especially because students have entered wrong credentials such as seat numbers, roll numbers and question paper codes. In such cases, the helpdesk has to go to the attendance records and trace answersheets to the students. Tracing supplementary papers, too, takes a lot of effort, said the official.

The university is, however, confident that technical glitches have been ironed out. “We are now hopeful that the problems encountered in the earlier cases will not be repeated,” said Acting Vice-Chancellor Devanand Shinde.

DDCA rejects national selector Sarandeep Singh’s application,"Sarandeep Singh had written a letter to CAC stating that he would like to become chairman of selectors free of cost. Sarandeep Singh had written a letter to CAC stating that he would like to become chairman of selectors free of cost.

The Cricket Affairs Committee (CAC) of the DDCA headed by Madan Lal has shot down national selector Sarandeep Singh’s plea of being considered for the chairmanship of state team’s selection committee. Sarandeep had written a letter to CAC stating that he would like to become chairman of selectors free of cost.

However, on Monday it was found that Sarandeep was not even summoned for an interview as he does not fit the criteria as per Lodha Committee Recommendations.

“Yes, Sarandeep’s plea has been rejected. If he were to become Delhi selector, he would have had to leave his national selector’s job as Lodha Panel Reforms does not allow multiple post for a single person. Therefore, even if he wanted to do the assignment on a Pro Bono (free of cost) basis, it was not possible,” a senior DDCA official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Sarandeep’s contention was that his colleagues in the national selection committee MSK Prasad and Devang Gandhi are both chairman of their respective state selection committees.

“At DDCA, we do not wish to deviate from the Lodha panel reforms. We can’t say why Bengal or Andhra is allowing Devang and Prasad to continue in their respective positions,” the official added.

Sarandeep is currently in Sri Lanka tracking the ODI team’s performance. However his former teammate Vijay Dahiya, who is also in Sri Lanka, appeared for the coaches’ interview via Skype.

Meanwhile, the first round interviews for the selection of coaches and selectors were held at the Feroz Shah Kotla today. The five-member CAC headed by Lal interviewed the candidates asking them questions on their vision, the kind of squad they would like to build and the choice of support staff.

“My interview went off well. I was asked questions on various topics of coaching. I feel confident,” said former Bengal stalwart Ashok Malhotra.

However, the ones who are expected to be frontrunners are Vijay Dahiya, Manoj Prabhakar and last year’s coach KP Bhaskar.

It was learnt that some of the candidates who appeared for selector’s interview then expressed their keenness to become BCCI match-referee.

One such candidate was Delhi fast bowler Feroz Ghayas, who appeared for selector’s interview but expressed his interest in becoming a domestic match referee. Ghayas had earlier been a match-referee before he had migrated to the United States.

In a separate incident, members of Delhi Cricket Coaches Association protested in front of the Kotla for being deemed ineligible for the Delhi coach’s job across age groups. They have submitted a deputation to DDCA administrator Vikramjit Sen and CAC chairman Lal.

UK to treat online hate crimes as seriously as offline abuse,"A hate crime is defined as an offence where the perpetrator is motivated by hostility or shows hostility towards the victim’s disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. (Representational image) A hate crime is defined as an offence where the perpetrator is motivated by hostility or shows hostility towards the victim’s disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. (Representational image)

The UK on Monday issued a new legal guidance saying online hate crimes should be treated as seriously as those committed in person, in the wake of a record country-wide spike in such offences which authorities said had a “corrosive effect” on the society. The new guidance from Crown Prosecution Service (CPS )is marking the publication of the documents with the launch of a social media campaign – #HateCrimeMatters – to encourage people to come forward and report hate crime incidents.

“In recognition of the growth of hate crime perpetrated using social media, a commitment to treat online crime as seriously as offline offences, while taking into account the potential impact on the wider community as well as the victim,” reads the new guidance.

“Hate crime has a corrosive effect on our society and that is why it is a priority area for the CPS. It can affect entire communities, forcing people to change their way of life and live in fear,” said Alison Saunders, UK’s Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).

Saunders said these documents took account of the current breadth and context of offending to provide prosecutors with the best possible chance of achieving justice for victims. “They also let victims and witnesses know what they should expect from us. I hope that, along with this week’s campaign, they will give people the confidence to come forward and report hate crime, in the knowledge that they will be

taken seriously and given the support they need,” she said.

A hate crime is defined as an offence where the perpetrator is motivated by hostility or shows hostility towards the victim’s disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. In 2015-16, the CPS completed 15,442 hate crime prosecutions, the highest number ever as police forces have recorded a UK-wide spike in such crimes.

The conviction rate across all strands of hate crime increased from 82.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 83.2 per cent in 2015-16, the CPS said. “Whether shouted in their face on the street, daubed on their wall or tweeted into their living room, the impact of hateful abuse on a victim can be equally devastating,” Saunders said.

Until now, CPS guidance on hate crime motivated by sexual orientation has had a general focus on all victims. The new guidance specifically refers to bisexual victims, particularly if they report being victimised by gay men or lesbians.

The CPS consulted community groups and criminal justice representatives to produce revised statements covering the different strands of hate crime: racist and religious; disability and homophobic, biphobic and transphobic. The revised legal guidance sets out how prosecutors in the UK should make charging decisions and handle such cases in court.

"Arjuna award devalued, made cheap: Past recipients","The Sports Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the names of the Arjuna awardees for this year but many have question the “dignity” of the award as the government is “throwing” the awards away. Former Arjuna awardees including former captain of Indian hockey team Ashok Kumar and middle-distance runner Sriram Singh Shekhawat raised their voices against it.

“The dignity has to be maintained. Why do you need to give Arjuna every year. Is it necessary? We are now throwing the awards away,” Ashok told PTI. “They (government) have set their own parameters. The value attached with the award should be increased. There should be a cap that only Asiad and Olympic medal winners should be selected for the Arjuna honour,” Ashok, son of the legendary hockey player Dhyanchand, said.

The 1975 World Cup winner and recipient of the Arjuna award in 1974 also questioned the process by which the awards are been given.

“You can’t beg for award or demand it. Why should I blow my own trumpet that I have achieved something. When someone goes out for competition, it happens with the permission of the government. They know the achievements so it should be the government which should pick athletes rather than players sending applications,” he said.

The awards will be conferred to the winners on August 29 — National Sports Day. Indian squash player Saurabh Ghosal also said that the process should be reconsidered.

“I think the concept of recommending or nominating someone for the awards is flawed. It just doesn’t sound right that player needs to be recommended or needs to apply for the award. The committee should pick the winners on their own on the basis of performances. Applying for the awards is like asking for a grant,” the 2006 Arjuna awardee said.

Shekhawat, who holds the national record in men’s 800m since 1976, said that there was a tough fight for the award back in his days.

“When Arjuna awards were decided for year 1972, I was Asiad medallist but still did not get it. There was only one slot and the award was given to V S Chauhan. We both were national record holders but since he was senior to me, he was chosen,” Shekhawat said. “The selected athletes should be a medal winner at least at the Asian Games level,” he suggested.

Echoing the same words, former captain of the Indian volleyball team Suresh Mishra said that there should be so many awards.

“Which name is bigger, Arjuna or Rajiv Gandhi. It’s an insult to Arjuna award. It has been degraded,” he said about the award which was constituted in 1972.

Amid all this, Zafar Iqbal, former captain of Indian hockey team, said that awards help encourage athletes.

“The award is not only for the athletes but also for the masses who follow. It encourages everyone. It has been fair. I don’t think it’s devalued,” the 1979 Arjuna awardee said.

"Cut Pakistan aid, revoke major non-NATO ally status, say US lawmakers","US President Donald Trump. (File/Photo) US President Donald Trump. (File/Photo)

Hailing Donald Trump’s new tough line against Pakistan, top US lawmakers have demanded that Islamabad be designated a “state sponsor of terrorism” and its major non-NATO ally status be revoked to force it stop from supporting terrorist groups. President Trump on Tuesday called out Pakistan for supporting terror groups and providing them safe havens within its territory. The criticism came as a part of his speech outlining the new US strategy to end the 16-year war in Afghanistan and bring peace and stability in the larger South Asian region.

“President Trump’s speech marked a positive shift in US policy, but it must not be limited only to words. If Pakistan does not stop aiding terrorists with American blood on their hands we must cut all aid to Islamabad, revoke their privileged status as a major non-NATO ally, and designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism,” Congressman Ted Poe said.

He said Trump’s speech was a rude awakening for Pakistani military and intelligence services, who “keep betraying” the United States while accepting billions in aid from Washington.

“Despite Pakistan’s ongoing treachery, Islamabad is among the leading recipients of US foreign assistance since 9/11 and is praised in some quarters of the US government as a ‘vital’ ally. This must stop – if we want to stabilise Afghanistan, we must deal first with Pakistan,” he said.

Poe has a legislation pending in the US Congress that calls for designating Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism and revoking its major non-NATO ally status.

Congressman Kevin Cramer, too, applauded Trump for applying pressure on Pakistan.

“While Pakistan is an important partner in helping keep the peace, it’s time they take decisive action to make clear they do not support terrorist regimes in the region,” he said.

“The announcement that the Trump administration plans to increase cooperation with India couldn’t come at a better time,” Cramer said.

Congressman Drew Ferguson tweeted: “We must focus on removing terrorists safe havens and holding our partners in Pakistan to account.”

Senator John Cornyn, co-Chair of the Senate Indian Caucus, rued that the previous administration of Barack Obama never held Pakistan accountable for providing sanctuary to terrorists.

Congressman Tom Graves said Trump’s plan for Afghanistan and South Asia will eliminate terrorist safe havens and give US troops more freedom to pursue the enemy, hold Pakistan accountable and bring focus to the diplomatic strategy.

In his speech, Trump did not give any specifics on increasing troops or timeline for successfully ending the war. He offered few clear changes, but the new policy moved from a strategy based on timeline to the one based on conditions.

Coons said it uses a regional approach to challenge Pakistan’s troubling practice of harbouring extremist groups.

“Essentially, without committing to troop levels or timelines, President Trump has said our strategy is to outlast the Taliban and other terrorist groups, and to only leave Afghanistan once the Afghan government and its armed forces can maintain control of the country.

“This strategy would commit us and our allies to a very long and likely very costly war for many years to come, and deserves to be fully debated and developed now that President Trump has presented its broad outlines,” he said.

Senator Ben Cardin, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said pressure must be increased on Pakistan to end its support for extremist groups.

"I know I will get my opportunity again, says Abhinav Mukund","Abhinav Mukund played a fine knock of 81 in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Abhinav Mukund played a fine knock of 81 in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

After putting up a relatively decent performance in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka, Indian opener Abhinav Mukund has said that he is confident of getting another opportunity soon. Speaking to the TOI, Mukund revealed that it was not a new thing for him to go back to domestic cricket and score runs and again make a comeback and he hopes that it will help him reclaim the opening spot. It may be recalled here that Mukund had to make way for KL Rahul in the third Test despite scoring a fine knock 81 in his previous innings.

“It’s not a new thing for me to go back to domestic cricket, score heavily and come back. I’m all set for the season ahead. Whatever opportunities I get, I want to do well. It’s not like I was dropped because of bad performance. It’s just that I had to make way for a regular. I think people in the team have an idea of what I can do now. That’s a good place to be in. I should take it forward from this and keep scoring runs so that I am always in the reckoning.”, Mukund said.

Expressing disappointment at missing out on the chance to open even after scoring a fifty, Mukund said, “Obviously, it was disappointing to miss out. But the current Indian team is such that you have to make way for the regulars. There were players who sat out even after scoring a 300 (Karun Nair); that’s how the team is and that’s why we are the No. 1 side in the world. I understood it. Kohli and Shastri said they loved my commitment and were pleased with my efforts on the field and with the bat. I know I will get my opportunity again.”

Mukund also spoke about his post on social media where he addressed the issue of racism and revealed that he had been facing such comments for long. “I understand that people from Chennai or down south are generally dark in complexion. I don’t understand how trolling cannot be taken seriously. My teammates supported me. People could relate to what I said. In fact, a couple of ex-cricketers from Chennai did call me and said they too had faced such comments and that they were glad I came out. I wanted to make a statement so that people take it seriously. I think they have.”, he concluded.

Related News US judge orders more environmental analysis of Dakota pipeline

Energy Transfer Partners LP on Tuesday sued Greenpeace and other environmental groups, accusing them of launching an “eco-terrorism” campaign aimed at blocking the Dakota Access Pipeline, the center of months of opposition by Native American and green groups. The pipeline operator said Greenpeace, Earth First and other organizations engaged in “acts of terrorism” to solicit donations and interfere with its pipeline construction activities, damaging its “critical business and financial relationships.”

ETP said the groups’ actions and negative publicity against it, its sister company Energy Transfer Equity LP and other firms caused billions of dollars in damages. Greenpeace USA General Counsel Tom Wetterer said the company’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Bismarck, North Dakota, “abuse(d) the legal system to silence legitimate advocacy work.”

In May the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline began interstate crude oil delivery, but a federal appeals court judge in June ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider its environmental review of the line, opening up the possibility that the line could be shut at a later date.

In its 231-page filing, Energy Transfer accused Greenpeace and groups like Bank Track and the Bold Alliance of “manufacturing a media spectacle” around Dakota Access pipeline opposition. The company said environmentalists approached the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the public face of the months-long fight against the pipeline, and used it to wage a battle against the project.

ETP said environmental groups “cynically planted radical, violent eco-terrorists on the ground amongst the protesters, and directly funded their operations and publicly urged their supporters to do the same.” Energy Transfer is being represented by the Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman law firm, whose founding partner Marc Kasowitz is President Donald Trump’s lawyer.

Greenpeace said this is the second time Kasowitz’s firm has gone after the group. Last year it represented Resolute Forest Products in a defamation lawsuit brought by the global logging company against Greenpeace. Wetterer said that “complaint repackages spurious allegations and legal claims.” The case is Energy Transfer Equity LP v. Greenpeace International, 17-cv-173, U.S. District Court, District of North Dakota (Bismark).

MCA proposes to halve CCI member strength to three,"The MCA’s suggested mode for paring the Commission is not to fill up the vacancies which happen next year when two members retire. The MCA’s suggested mode for paring the Commission is not to fill up the vacancies which happen next year when two members retire.

Asserting its dominant position, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has proposed that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) members’ strength be pruned to half and has declined the fair trade watchdog’s request for delegating it the power to appoint its investigative wing.

Citing ‘de minimis’ or minimalist intervention approach, coupled with March 2017 relaxation to firms from seeking CCI approval in mergers and acquisitions, the MCA has recommended that the Commission be pruned to chairperson and three members from current strength of chairperson and six members.

Last March, MCA notified that March 2016 exemption for seeking CCI approval would apply to mergers and acquisitions. Earlier, it diluted the quasi-judicial body’s hold by exempting from approval combination deals where the target company had assets of Rs 350 crore or turnover of up to Rs 1,000 crore.

The MCA’s suggested mode for paring the Commission is not to fill up the vacancies which happen next year when two members retire. With one post already lying vacant after Madhusudan Sahoo shifted to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the bench would be reduced to four, it added.

While seeking amendment in the Competition Act, the MCA has said that the gains from the CCI vacancies could be used for filling up the National Financial Reporting Authority being set up to enforce discipline among the chartered accounts in the country.

In a separate move, the MCA recently turned down CCI’s November 2016 request seeking delegation of power to appoint and decide the employment terms of the Director General and other officers in its specialised investigative wing.

Backed by law ministry’s opinion, the ministry said that the “DG investigates the cases referred to it by the CCI but undertakes its task of investigation independently of the CCI. In order to maintain independence of the DG from the CCI, power to appoint the DG has been given to Central government”.

The MCA clung on to Section 16 of the Competition Act on appointment of the DG and said that it would not be advisable to confer the appointment powers to the CCI for “maintaining the independence of the investigation by the Director General”.

A small but deadly earthquake on the Italian holiday island of Ischia exposed a deep political fault line on Tuesday over the country’s proliferation of unsafe, illegal housing. The tremor, officially recorded in Italy at a modest strength of 4.0, toppled buildings, killed two people and injured dozens in a district where seven years ago residents rioted to prevent bulldozers from razing illegally built homes.

“It’s ridiculous that people should die in an earthquake of this strength,” said Francesco Peduto, president of Italy’s national association of geologists. “In other advanced countries a quake like this would do no damage at all.” A fifth of new Italian houses were built illegally in 2015, according to the statistics bureau ISTAT, up from 9 percent in 2008. In four southern regions – including Sicily and Campania, where Ischia lies – the proportion stood at well over a third two years ago.

The legal status of the buildings that came down on Monday night was unclear. But the deaths reopened a debate over the problem of builders sidestepping regulations, including those designed to ensure homes can resist earthquakes. “Ischia has always been a symbol of illegal building, random cementification and impunity,” Italy’s environmentalist lobby Legambiente said in a statement after the earthquake. It struck three days before the first anniversary of a much bigger, 6.2 magnitude quake that killed nearly 300 people in central Italy, most of them in the town of Amatrice.

The government and political parties say they want to tackle the problem, but they have been reluctant to match words with deeds, especially in the run-up to local elections in Sicily in November and a national vote early next year. Many houses, especially in the poor south, have been built illegally to save money and time by avoiding taxes and red tape, and their owners resist attempts to enforce the law.

Angelo Cambiano, former mayor of the small Sicilian town of Licata, paid a high price for tackling the problem. He first received anonymous threats and was finally forced from office by his own councillors this month after demolishing 67 illegal dwellings, mostly holiday homes on the coast, since he took office in 2015. Cambiano’s approach was unusual. Governments of all political stripes have preferred to serve up regular amnesties for illegal construction work, allowing culprits to regularise their position with the payment of a modest fine while allowing the structures to stand.

The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, favourite to win Sicily’s regional election, came under fire this month when its candidate argued that inadequate housing policies had obliged many Sicilians to build illegally. His words were widely seen as justification for illegal and shoddy construction. Five-Star, whose battle cries are legality and sustainable development, was attacked for burying its principles in a bid for power. Its most prominent member of parliament, Luigi Di Maio, clarified that “all houses served with a demolition order have to come down”.

TRAGIC PRECEDENT

Ischia, off the southern port city of Naples, is no stranger to earthquakes. A larger tremor in 1883 killed more than 2,000 people on the island. Yet little has been done to make its houses safer now than they were then.

Seven years ago hundreds of its residents built barricades and threw bottles to stop bulldozers reaching the first of 600 illegally built houses due to be demolished. Almost all the houses were spared and the clashes took place in the part of the island worst hit by Monday’s quake. The island has just 64,000 inhabitants but they have presented 27,000 requests to take advantage of amnesties for illegal building over the last 30 years. Despite lobbying by environmentalists and lip service from politicians, illegal house building in Italy has continued apace even as the construction industry as a whole has been hard hit by a triple-dip recession since 2008.

It can cut the cost of a new house by more than half, according to Legambiente, thanks to savings on materials and manpower as well as on the costs of permits and taxes. But in a country often hit by floods and landslides as well as earthquakes, it can also be shortsighted. “We have cried too many times for people buried under the rubble of houses built illegally,” said Infrastructure Minister Graziano Delrio. “It’s time to say enough is enough.”

China Construction Bank raising $15 billion in funding for Belt and Road deals,"Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a 4 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road. (File Photo) Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a 4 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road. (File Photo)

China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) is raising at least 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) for a fund to finance investments related to Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The people said China’s second-biggest bank by assets was raising cash onshore and offshore, and has already been running roadshows with prospective investors. They could not be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

CCB did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a $124 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road, connecting China with new and old trading partners. He also said China would encourage financial institutions to expand their overseas yuan fund businesses. Beijing is trying to contain overseas deals after some extravagant purchases in recent years, but acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries that are part of the Belt and Road initiative are soaring, totalling $33 billion as of mid-August. That compares with a $31 billion tally for all of 2016, showed Thomson Reuters data.

The people said CCB would raise U.S. dollars for the offshore portion of the fund and yuan from onshore investors. Some of the onshore capital could be used for Belt and Road deals overseas, two of the people said.

"Donald Trump commits US to open-ended Afghanistan war, Taliban vow ‘graveyard’: Top developments","U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday committed US troops to an open-ended war in Afghanistan, a decision the Afghanistan government welcomed. Taliban has, however, warned that this decision by the United States of America would make the country a “graveyard for the American empire”. Trump also vowed to step up military campaign against the Taliban. He also blamed Pakistan for harbouring terrorists in safe havens on its soil. US officials said Trump has signed off on Defense Secretary James Mattis’ plans to despatch around 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan.

Here is what has happened in the past 24 hours:

1. In a statement to Reuters, US President Donald Trump said his original instinct was to pull out all US troops. But after a lengthy review with his military advisers about the US’ longest war he was convinced.

2. “The consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable,” he said. “A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill.”

3. Trump reiterated that although US’ troops will fight to win, he asserted that eventually Afghanistan’s police and army must to most of the fighting to defeat the Taliban and allied Islamist militants. “The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. … We want them to succeed.”

4. Approximately 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan work closely with a NATO-led training and advising mission. The rest are a part of a counter-terror operation that mostly targets pockets of Al-Qaeda and Islamic State terrorists.

5. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday welcomed the US strategy saying it would expand the training mission for Afghan forces. “I am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support … for our joint struggle to rid the region from the threat of terrorism,” Ghani said in a statement.

6. The Taliban condemned US President Donald Trump’s decision saying: “If the U.S. does not pull all its forces out of Afghanistan, we will make this country the 21st century graveyard for the American empire.”

7. The United States-backed Afghanistan forces overthrew the Taliban’s hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 over its sheltering of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, primary architect architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in U.S. cities that killed nearly 2,000 people.

8. US’ involvement in the Afghanistan war has however created problems for three presidents. Around 2,400 US troops have been killed in action in Afghanistan ever since.

9. Trump asserted that he would not engage in nation building even as he warned that US’ support “is not a blank check” for Afghanistan’s corruption-plagued government.

10. Trump also slammed Pakistan for providing safe haven to terrorists. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens,” he said, referring to complaints that Taliban and other militants move freely in Pakistan.

Indian-origin CEO racially abused by Donald Trump supporters over comments on Charlottesville protest,"Ravin Gandhi bombarded by hate comments on his option piece on Charlottesville violence.

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to “go back to India” and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump’s economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump’s Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported. “I recently told the New York Times I was ‘rooting’ for certain aspects of Trump’s economic agenda,” Gandhi wrote in the op-ed.

“After Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don’t look like him.” Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters.

Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should “get your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.” The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take “that other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,” referring to the US envoy to the UN.

“She’s (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don’t tell us that you gave him a chance. We don’t give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We’re going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,” the woman said.

In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should “go clean up your own (expletive) country, it’s a filthy mess.” Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said.

“It was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,” he said. “I wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.” “Even though my race is a complete non-issue in my day-to-day life, the sad reality is there’s a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,” he said in the report.

“I wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there’s this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected.” Gandhi added that the fact that Trump “equated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up” as he called Trump’s moral leadership on the issue “reprehensible.”

He said while his sharing a “bigoted” voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so. “My heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let’s be honest — I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I’m suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don’t have resources really are suffering.” “I know I’m on the right side of history here,” he said. “That’s how I sleep at night.”

Lee Chong Wei makes quick exit from World Badminton Championships,"Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia tries to retrieve the shuttle during his first-round match against France’s Brice Leverdez. (Source: Reuters) Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia tries to retrieve the shuttle during his first-round match against France’s Brice Leverdez. (Source: Reuters)

There is one iconic shot of badminton legend Lee Chong Wei that stops the heart a wee bit more than the full-throttle jump smash where he is four feet up in air. It’s the one where he scurries chasing the shuttle with his back to the net. The run abruptly ends with a flat backhand flick mid-stride over the net — almost bat blind to where it might land, as he turns on his heel in a jiffy and stands ready for the next shot. It worked beautifully on Tuesday for a fleeting few seconds — and gave a stadium the sand-in-hand hope that the Malaysian legend could turn back time.

It didn’t end in tears because Chong Wei has perfected the tight-lipped, dignified, smiling acceptance after losing 7 out of 7 finals (3 Olympics and 4 World Championships). But short of a meltdown, it all ended in the most heartbreaking fashion as Frenchman Brice Leverdez won 21-19, 22-24, 21-17 in 75 minutes bringing the stadium to a mooring silence as a lifetime of the legend’s struggles to win the big titles flashed before the eyes. The 35-year-old Chong Wei’s challenge ended in a pool of errors unable to deal with Leverdez’s short attack, as the 31-year-old stayed dogged through a second-game comeback from the legend, flattering to deceive once more in his career.

In the press conference that followed his shock exit in Round 1, Chong Wei mulled aloud with a painful pursed-lipped politeness when asked if this was the end. “Now you ask me, I don’t know. I don’t know my plan. Maybe I’ll retire tomorrow,” he replied. “I’ll have to go back and see if I still have the fire in me. But tomorrow I don’t know,” he said, looking miserably lost.

“How did the pressure affect you?”

“It affected me, right? I lost in the first round!” he said with a tight smile.

The story of the eternal ‘best man’ of badminton is the sport’s most profound tale over the last decade and a half. But should this be his last match, it will tell in a nutshell the story of how it never worked out for someone who is almost-perfect, and put in shade by the brilliance of Lin Dan.

Chong Wei would struggle from the start, the first few points split equally between him and Leverdez. Still, a first-game loss could’ve been dismissed as a rusty start as it’s been in several tournaments in recent years before he’s picked up. However, the torrid errors continued into the second, as the Frenchman stuck to a plan of attacking both flanks and Chong Wei looked awfully out of touch. 14-18 down, he would level at 20, and be saved by a mistimed albeit borderline shuttle as a lucky referral pushed the match into a decider. He would lead by 5 points in the third, but again feel a rash of silly errors, while Leverdez rode his luck on the net and for once, Chong Wei seemed resigned to give up.

The Frenchman’s single-point warning to himself had been to never lift the shuttle — to deny Chong Wei the opening.

“I never give up, I keep trying again, but today I did my best but it didn’t work out,” Chong Wei would say later, murmuring about how he’d won the All England this year and beaten Leverdez there, so it wasn’t a demon in his head. The All England — in what’s been a story of his life — despite its tradition, is a Super Series event only, and the biggies have eluded him in scorching public glare. He had his coach of many years Misbun Sidek by his side, but it didn’t help on this day. “When people keep saying ‘You don’t win, you don’t win’, it’s so difficult to accept this and carry on. That’s why he’s so special in Malaysia, he’s something meaningful for our country,” the coach would say later.

Chong Wei is Malaysia’s biggest star — the heartbeat of a country which unfortunately boasts only one other No 1 — Nicole David, the woman squash player, whose sport isn’t on the Olympics programme. “We give him whatever he wants in support, because he’s the greatest. He’s maintained discipline, so the country will always support him. We’re not communist, so we won’t push him out. He’ll be supported for as long as he wants,” said teammate Yogendra Krishnan.

Considerable support

Malaysian fans had travelled all over from the UK, and left having lost their voices but not their pride in the man. “We’re disappointed because he’s the only one. But we keep supporting him no matter what,” said 28-year-old Wei Chun Lee, who works in London and had travelled overnight. “Not a wink of sleep whole night, and now we’ve lost our will to do anything,” he would say.

The French and Malaysian fans had built up quite a din, and the whole stadium stopped in its stride, when the drama of the second game unfolded – Chong Wei two match points down, eking out an escape one last time at these Worlds where he was seeded 2nd. “We keep telling ourselves the pressure is so much on him, that it’s tough to win,” Lee Gran Hui, 24, said, having cried after the Rio finals where despite beating Lin Dan in the semi-finals, Chong Wei had come up short against the steady Chen Long.

“Our second favourite player is Lin Dan. Though he’s beaten Chong Wei so many times (27 in 39 meetings), they played some of the best matches in the sport and are both legends,” she added, not regretting once having to put herself through the grief of ending as the second-best always. “Not just us. Our parents’ generation too. He means the world to Malaysians old and young.”

Misbun, the lanky, upright coach has been besides Chong Wei for most of his life, and counts the Malaysian Open win against Danish Peter Gade in 2004 as his ward’s best. “It really impressed me because I knew after that win that this person will fly Malaysia’s flag high.”

Misbun would talk about how though he initially came from a modest family where securing himself financially was the first target, his ward did not stop at just that. “It’s difficult to find a talent like Chong Wei, because he had the extraordinary desire to be the best. Obedient, skillful and strong, our success was my brain and his energy,” he would explain, adding that “the 2008 Beijing final would remain his closest brush at the Olympics.”

Misbun though conceded that Chong Wei did bring on pressure onto himself. “Sometimes when you take badminton too seriously, you can’t play well. He’s good when he’s joyful, but not when he’s under pressure. But now sometimes I see him enjoying, sometimes not.”

When asked the pressure-poser, Chong Wei would say, “Yea, pressure is normal.” The legend had internalised expectations to the extent it ran in his bloodstream. It’s what the Malaysians will eternally be grateful to him for. Lee Chong Wei is worth straining the vocal chords for.

"Liverpool must rotate to compete on two fronts, says Jurgen Klopp","Jurgen Klopp said he will keep shuffling his pack during the European competition as long as the replacements continue to impress. (Source: AP) Jurgen Klopp said he will keep shuffling his pack during the European competition as long as the replacements continue to impress. (Source: AP)

Liverpool must rotate their squad this season if they are to sustain their challenge in both the Premier League and the Champions League, manager Juergen Klopp has said.

Klopp made five changes to the starting lineup for Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace, a game sandwiched in between two legs of their Champions League playoff against Hoffenheim.

The German is taking nothing for granted despite Liverpool’s 2-1 lead over the Bundesliga side ahead of their return leg at Anfield.

“We all have pressure and it’s a quick start always,” Klopp told reporters. “You need to be there immediately, deliver and all that stuff.

“The difference this year is that it’s really hard, we all know a draw today, two points instead of four or six, it doesn’t feel good but you can sort it.

“You can’t do this in a Champions League qualifier. This intensity is really hard, for both teams not just us, yes that’s very special and that’s why we made the changes today.”

Substitutes Dejan Lovren, Emre Can and Mohamed Salah are all expected to return to the starting lineup against Hoffenheim on Wednesday.

Klopp said he will keep shuffling his pack during the European competition as long as the replacements continue to impress. “It’s all about the boys. If they play in a game like this today, if they perform like this then yes, we will change, 100 percent,” he added.

“If not, we can’t because we cannot give a game away, we cannot say that’s not that important.” Following their European qualifier, Liverpool host Arsenal in the league on Sunday.

"Yemen officials: Saudi-led coalition strikes hotel, several dead","A victim is carried from the site of an airstrike on a hotel in Arhab, Yemen Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017. (Al-Masira TV via AP) A victim is carried from the site of an airstrike on a hotel in Arhab, Yemen Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017. (Al-Masira TV via AP)

The Saudi-led coalition carried out several airstrikes in Yemen early on Wednesday, hitting a small hotel near the capital of Sanaa and killing dozens of people, Yemeni officials and witnesses said. There were conflicting reports on the victims, with doctors saying they were farmers and officials and witnesses saying they included Houthi rebels.

The fighter jets targeted a two-story hotel in Qaa al-Qaidhi district, located in the town of Arhab, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of Sanaa, officials said.

The building sustained extensive damage and bodies were still being retrieved from under the rubble, witnesses said later on Wednesday. Another airstrike hit a checkpoint manned by the Houthis, a few kilometers (miles) from the hotel, they added. The officials and the witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.

Footage of the area aired on al-Masirah TV, a Houthi-run satellite news network, showed bodies hanging out of a simple cinderblock building. Bystanders wrapped mangled corpses into blankets to try to carry them away.

The TV network said 41 civilians were killed and that the death toll was expected to rise further. Officials and witnesses told The Associated Press that the death toll had reached 60 and that the majority of those killed were Houthis rebels.

Physician Ali al-Rakmi who was helping at the site of the hotel strike, said there were more than 100 people inside at the time of the attack, all farmers who work in growing qat. The plant’s leaves are chewed for a stimulant effect, a widespread tradition among Yemeni men.

Al-Rakmi said they had retrieved 35 bodies so far, with many only as pieces of bodies.

Fahd Marhab, head of the Umrah hospital about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the site of the airstrike, said there were no wounded and that all the people in the hotel were killed in the 3 a.m. airstrike. He also said that they were mostly farmers. It was not possible to reconcile the discrepancies in the accounts and the different number of fatalities reported by the officials and the TV.

There was no immediate comment from the coalition.

The Saudi-led coalition has been waging an extensive air campaign against the Houthis and forces loyal to ousted Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh since March 2015, seeking to push the rebels from lands they captured, including Sanaa, and restore the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to power.

But the airstrikes have also hit civilian targets, such as schools, hospitals, and markets, killing thousands and prompting rights groups to accuse the Saudi-led coalition of committing war crimes. Activists have also called upon Western countries, including the United States and Britain, to cease military support for the coalition.

Yemen’s conflict began after the Houthis swept into Sanaa in 2014 and overthrew Hadi’s government, forcing it to relocate to the southern port city of Aden and prompting Hadi to seek military support from Arab Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia.

The conflict has so far killed over 10,000 civilians, displaced 3 million people and pushed the impoverished nation to the brink of famine.

Wednesday’s hotel bombing comes amid stepped-up airstrikes in and around Sanaa, with army compounds and other Houthi locations targeted. Also hit was the Rimah Hamid military camp south of Sanaa, where officers are loyal to Saleh’s forces.

The Houthi-Saleh alliance, meanwhile, has seen a long-simmering power struggle burst into the open. Over the past days, the two sides have exchanged accusations and threats ahead of a rally on Thursday to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of Saleh’s party, the General People’s Congress.

Saleh and the Houthis were always unlikely allies. As president, Saleh fought the Houthis from 2004 till 2009 in their northern heartland of Saada. After his overthrow in the 2011 uprising under a deal that gave him immunity from prosecution in return for giving up power, Saleh and the Houthis struck an alliance of convenience with a common enemy — Hadi’s government and his Islamist Islah party allies.

Sanaa is packed with armed men and armored vehicles, fueling fears of open clashes between Saleh’s forces and the Houthis. Saleh has complained that the rebels have sidelined him and his loyalists, leaving them out of military and political decisions, as well as U.N.-sponsored negotiations to end Yemen’s civil war.

Afghanistan hails Donald Trump for breaking silence on Pakistan’s support to terror,"Afghanistan’s Ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. Afghanistan’s Ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy.

Afghanistan today lauded President Donald Trump for breaking America’s “silence” on Pakistan providing sanctuaries to terrorists and embracing a strategy that gives the war-torn country what it needs. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America’s longest war.

He also warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Reacting to Trump’s address, Afghanistan’s Ambassador to the US Hamdullah Mohib thanked president Trump for breaking America’s silence on Pakistan, which has been harbouring terrorists for attacks against its neighbours. “We welcome this decision, which is the result of intense deliberations and takes into account both our countries’ needs and considerations. This is the first time a focus has been put on what Afghanistan must have to succeed, and we are grateful for this outcome,” Mohib said after Trump concluded his speech on Afghanistan and South Asia.

Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. He also lauded the decision to integrate America’s military, economic and political power to achieve shared goals.

The strategy also expands “authority to move swiftly against terrorist activities and criminal networks in place of micromanagement from Washington” and “a breaking of the silence over Pakistan’s shelters and sanctuaries for terrorists”, the Afghan Ambassador said. “Like America, Afghanistan also wants an honourable and enduring outcome” to this fight, for all the Afghan, US, and NATO soldiers who have served and sacrificed to advance the cause of peace, Mohib said.

In his address, Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” Trump said.

“Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,” he said, in an apparent warning to Pakistan. In his speech, Trump came down heavily on Pakistan for its support to terror groups, saying Islamabad receives billions in aid from the US but continues to harbour terrorists.

“In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognise those contributions and those sacrifices,” Trump said. “But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill our people,” he added.

Trump noted that the US has been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars but it continues to house the very terrorists that America is fighting.

“But that will have to change. That will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country’s harbouring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace,” Trump said.

England’s batting line-up is one we can look to exploit in our conditions: Mitchell Starc,"Mitchell Starc has revealed his plans to take down the English batsman in the upcoming Ashes series. (Source: Reuters) Mitchell Starc has revealed his plans to take down the English batsman in the upcoming Ashes series. (Source: Reuters)

The upcoming Ashes series between England and Australia is expected to be a feisty contest. With both teams in good form, players from the warring sides will know the importance of getting a strong start to the series. While preparations for one of the anticipated series have already begun, in the latest interview pacer, Mitchell Starc has revealed his plans to take down the English batsman, which is by targeting the inexperienced lot. Noticeably, England’s batting-order does comprise the likes of David Malan, Mark Stoneman and Westley, all of whom are relatively new to the international stage.

Speaking to The Unplayable Podcast, Starc said, “They’re certainly not as settled in the batting stakes as they were a little while ago. Root and Cook are their two guys that are quite experienced and their two key batters.” and added, “They’re trying a few guys there at the top with the last couple of series so you don’t really quite know who they’re going to bring to Australia yet. It will be interesting, it’s a nice one to watch for the bowlers. We’re a more settled side than they are at the moment. Their batting line-up is one we can look at try to exploit in our conditions.”

Commenting on the English bowling attack, Starc said,”(England) will rely a lot on their bowlers who come to Australia and have played a lot in Australia before,” he said. “That’s the most dangerous part about their team with guys who have taken a lot of wickets, home and away as well.

India vs Sri Lanka: Another arrow in Jasprit Bumrah’s quiver,"In the first ODI at Dambulla, Bumrah stuck to his basic weapons, the yorkers and cutters. (Source: Reuters) In the first ODI at Dambulla, Bumrah stuck to his basic weapons, the yorkers and cutters. (Source: Reuters)

The go-to man in the Indian team is Jasprit Bumrah, when it comes to limited-overs cricket. The Gujarat fast-medium bowler is a natural with his yorkers, which makes him so successful in death-overs. An economy rate of 4.86 over 17 ODIs, when modern bats and benign pitches have made the bowlers’ job very difficult, is a testimony to his shorter formats bowling skills.

His height allows him to extract bounce off the deck and Bumrah also has a deceptive bouncer. The 23-year-old is now trying to develop a knuckle ball. Knuckle ball is baseball’s export to cricket. A knuckler, as it is called in baseball, minimises the spin of the ball in flight, causing an unpredictable motion. In cricket, a knuckle ball dips alarmingly mid-flight and starts wobbling. In layman’s term, it is a fast bowler’s doosra, to be bowled through the strength of the finger-tips.

Like Zaheer Khan, pioneer of the knuckle ball in Indian cricket who picked the art from South African Charl Langeveldt, Bumrah, too, was covering the ball in his run-up while trying the new variety at the nets before India’s first ODI. In the Dambulla game, however, he basically stuck to his stock ball that skidded through quickly off a length. He seems to be searching for more perfection and confidence before using it frequently in a match.

A bit of an IPL 2017 recap could be contextual here. In the fifth match, between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, Kedar Jadhav had lined himself up to lift Zaheer over mid-off. But a knuckle ball from the veteran seamer deceived him. Beaten by the mid-air dip, Jadhav was holed out inside the circle.

Zaheer, the master

Zaheer mastered the art with ridiculous ease after he learnt the process from Langeveldt in 2010. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the next Indian bowler to realise its wicket-taking potential as he started practicing the delivery after the Australia series earlier. It passed on to Mohit Sharma and now, Bumrah appears to have developed a serious interest for it.

Gujarat Lions seamer Andrew Tye’s success with the knuckle ball in the last IPL could also be a reason for its increasing popularity among the Indian bowlers.

Bumrah bowled first change after Kumar and Hardik Pandya shared the new ball in the first ODI. He started off with a slower against Danushka Gunathilaka but it didn’t quite come off the finger-tips. On a pitch that offered little movement, there was no swing either, the fast bowler rather stuck to basics and used off-cutters occasionally.

Against a well-set Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella, he didn’t experiment much. His first spell of four overs went for 19 runs without a wicket.

In his second spell, with the Sri Lankan batting on the slide, Bumrah basically searched for the yorker length. There’s a school of thought that he overuses the delivery a little, especially at the death, and might become predictable after a while. Knuckle ball, when he perfects the art, will give him a new option; in the middle overs and towards the back end of the innings.

India’s fast bowling coach Bharat Arun is very approachable and as R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav’s revival would attest, he did a fine job during his first spell that lasted for close to two years. Now he is back to fine-tune the Indian bowlers.

Arun is impressed with Bumrah working on skills. “Blessed to have a bowling attack that’s so versatile and each one is so different from the other. So it’s about what the bowler wants to work on and my job is to give them feedback; the right feedback that helps them to evolve as a bowler.”

South Korea begin computer-simulated drills amid North Korea tensions,"US Army soldiers move during the annual US South Korea Ulchi-Freedom Guardian military exercises in Paju in 2016. (Source: AP) US Army soldiers move during the annual US South Korea Ulchi-Freedom Guardian military exercises in Paju in 2016. (Source: AP)

South Korean and U.S. forces began computer-simulated military exercises on Monday amid tensions over North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, amid reports that Pyongyang has generated at least $270 million since February despite U.N. sanctions. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the joint drills, called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, were purely defensive and did not aim to raise tensions on the peninsula.

“There is no intent at all to heighten military tension on the Korean peninsula as these drills are held annually and are of a defensive nature,” Moon told Cabinet ministers. “North Korea should not exaggerate our efforts to keep peace nor should they engage in provocations that would worsen the situation, using (the exercise) as an excuse,” he said.

The joint U.S.-South Korean drills will continue to Aug. 31 and involve computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea. The United States also describes them as “defensive in nature”, a term North Korean state media has dismissed as a “deceptive mask”.

“It’s to prepare if something big were to occur and we needed to protect ROK,” said Michelle Thomas, a U.S. military spokeswoman, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.

North Korea views such exercises as preparations for invasion and has fired missiles and taken other actions to coincide with the military drills in the past. North and South Korea are technically still at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. North Korea’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland has fuelled a surge in regional tension and U.N.-led sanctions appear to have failed to bite deeply enough to change Pyongyang’s mind.

SANCTIONS UNDERMINED

Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported on Monday that a confidential United Nations report found North Korea had continued to evade U.N. sanctions by “deliberately using indirect channels” and had generated $270 million in banned exports since February. The “lax enforcement” of existing sanctions and Pyongyang’s “evolving evasion techniques” were undermining the United Nation’s goal of getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, Kyodo quoted the report as saying.

The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Aug. 5 that could slash the North’s $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. The latest sanctions were imposed after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that North Korea will face “fire and fury” if it threatens the United States. The North responded by threatening to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, but later said it was holding off on a decision while it waited to see what the United States would do next.

There will be no field training during the current exercise, according to U.S. Forces Korea. The United States has about 28,000 troops in South Korea. About 17,500 U.S. service members are participating in the exercise this month, down from 25,000 last year, according to the Pentagon. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday the reduction in the number of U.S. troops taking part reflected a need for fewer personnel and was not because of tensions with Pyongyang. Other South Korean allies are also joining this year, with troops from Australia, Britain, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand taking part.

China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has urged the United States and South Korea to scrap the drills. Russia has also asked for the drills to stop but the United States has not backed down.

‘Climbdown’ for Britain over European Union court role after Brexit,"The influence of the ECJ in Britain was a major bone of contention in last year’s EU referendum campaign, in which supporters of a “Leave” vote had argued in favour of complete judicial sovereignty for Britain. The influence of the ECJ in Britain was a major bone of contention in last year’s EU referendum campaign, in which supporters of a “Leave” vote had argued in favour of complete judicial sovereignty for Britain.

The European Court of Justice could still wield influence in Britain even after Brexit through joint rulings with British officials, the government said today, in what critics called a “climbdown”. The proposals outlined also left open the possibility of the ECJ having jurisdiction during any transition periods agreed for after Britain leaves the bloc and before a new UK-EU partnership comes into force.

Opposition lawmakers said the negotiating position was a reversal from the complete break previously advocated by Prime Minister Theresa May, who had said she would “bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain.” The influence of the ECJ in Britain was a major bone of contention in last year’s EU referendum campaign, in which supporters of a “Leave” vote had argued in favour of complete judicial sovereignty for Britain.

The government paper published Wednesday said that only the ECJ’s “direct jurisdiction” would end. “It is not necessary or appropriate for the CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union) to have direct jurisdiction over a non-member state… Such an arrangement would be unprecedented,” the Department for Exiting the EU said.

Britain said there were “existing ways of resolving disputes in international agreements, without the CJEU having direct jurisdiction”. It outlined several precedents such as joint political committees and arbitration courts already used by the EU to enforce international agreements with third countries, and said similar mechanisms could be used for Britain after Brexit.

Even the modified proposals are likely to prove a source of dispute with the EU, which has argued for direct ECJ jurisdiction for example in cases involving European citizens living in Britain. But the perception among government critics in Britain was of a softening of its position.

Pro-EU opposition Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the “sudden shifting of the goalposts to ending only the ‘direct’ jurisdiction of the ECJ suggests they are paving the way for some sort of climbdown”. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the most vocal pro-EU opposition party in parliament, said the proposals were a “sensible and long overdue climbdown”.

“The government seems to have belatedly accepted it won’t be possible to end the EU court’s influence in the UK without damaging our free trade and security cooperation,” he said in a statement. Junior justice minister Dominic Raab defended the government’s position, saying it was “absolutely and wholesale wrong” to suggest that Britain would still have to respect the rulings of the ECJ.

But he added: “It makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK,” he told BBC Radio. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, criticised the UK’s latest proposal.

“UK gov wants to keep “half an eye” on ECJ ruling. EP (European Parliament) thinks ECJ must keep both eyes open to protect #citizenrights,” he wrote on Twitter. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC: “The idea that we are somehow going to wholly escape the influence of the European Court of Justice on our lives in this country is, I’m afraid, pie in the sky”.

“It’s going to continue in many areas to have a very profound influence, but of course the difference is going to be that we will no longer have any direct influence into the formation of that EU jurisprudence because we ourselves will no longer be appearing in front of the ECJ as an EU member,” he said.

US navy pauses operations after 10 sailors lost in collision,"The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S.

The US Navy declared a worldwide pause in its operations after the latest in a series of accidents left ten sailors missing and five injured. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered an “operational pause” to allow a “comprehensive review” of practices after the destroyer USS John McCain was hit by a merchant tanker off Singapore.

“As you know this is the second collision in three months and the last of a series of incidents in the Pacific theater,” Richardson said.

“This trend demands more forceful action. As such I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world.”

US Defense Secretary James Mattis, on a visit to Jordan, said Richardson’s “broader enquiry will look at all related accidents, incidents at sea, that sort of thing. He is going to look at all factors, not just the immediate one.”

There was no official word on how long the disruption to the world’s most powerful navy, active in all of the world’s oceans, might last. But some US media suggested the pause would last for a day.

Ten US sailors were still missing after the John McCain collided with a tanker today, tearing a large hole in its hull in the second accident involving an American warship in two months.

The badly damaged destroyer limped into port in the city-state of Singapore in the afternoon under escort after the dramatic pre-dawn accident, which sent water flooding into the vessel.

A major search involving ships and aircraft from three countries was launched for the missing sailors after the McCain hit the Alnic MC in the busy shipping lanes of the Singapore Strait, near the Strait of Malacca.

Analysts said the accident, so soon after June’s collision off Japan involving a US warship, raised questions about whether the US Navy was overstretched in Asia as it seeks to combat Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.

The US Navy said there was “significant damage to the hull” of the warship in the latest collision, which led to flooding of crew sleeping areas, machinery and communications rooms.

“Damage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding,” they said in a statement after the John S. McCain arrived at Changi Naval Base in the city-state.

A helicopter took four of the injured to a Singapore hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening while the fifth did not need further medical attention, the navy said.

The 505-foot (154-meter) vessel could still sail under its own power after the collision at 5:24 am (2124 GMT Sunday) with the Liberian-flagged tanker, which was slightly bigger at 600 feet. Two other vessels escorted it into port, AFP journalists saw.

The warship had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a “freedom of navigation operation” in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August around a reef in the Spratly Islands, sparking a furious response from Beijing.

The vessel is named after US Senator John McCain’s father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.

McCain himself, who as a naval pilot was shot down during the Vietnam War and held prisoner, welcomed the review.

“I agree with Admiral Richardson that more forceful action is urgently needed to identify and correct the causes of the recent ship collisions,” he said.

“I expect full transparency and accountability from the Navy leaders as they conduct the associated investigations and reviews.”

President Donald Trump tweeted: “Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway.”

Ridzwan Rahmat, a naval expert at Janes by IHS Markit, said initial indications suggested the US warship may not have been obeying rules designed to separate maritime traffic passing through the Singapore Strait.

With the accident coming soon after the freedom of navigation operation, he told AFP that it raised questions “whether there is crew fatigue setting in, whether or not the tempo of operations by the US Navy in this region is getting too fast.”

“Are they doing too much within this region with North Korea, and Japan and then now in the South China Sea?”

Singapore, Malaysia and US ships and aircraft were all involved in the hunt for the missing sailors.

The tanker involved in the collision, which was used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighed over 30,000 gross tonnes, sustained some damage but no crew were injured, and Singapore said there was no oil pollution.

In June, seven American sailors died when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship in a busy channel not far from Yokosuka, a gateway to container ports in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama.

The dead sailors, aged 19 to 37, were found by divers in flooded sleeping berths a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald.

A senior admiral announced last week that the commander of the destroyer and several other officers had been relieved of their duties aboard their ship over the incident.

Both the USS John S. McCain and USS Fitzgerald are part of the US Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka.

"In chaotic meeting, Charlottesville votes to shroud statues","Police struggle with a protester during unrest at a demonstration against a statue of a Confederate soldier nicknamed Silent Sam on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, U.S. August 22, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Drake

The Charlottesville City Council voted to drape two Confederate statues in black fabric during a chaotic meeting packed with irate residents who screamed and cursed at councilors over the city’s response to a white nationalist rally.

The anger at Monday night’s meeting, during which three people were arrested, forced the council to abandon its agenda and focus instead on the tragedy. Covering the statues is intended to signal the city’s mourning for Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car slammed into a crowd protesting the rally.

“I think what you saw last night was a traumatized community beginning the process of catharsis,” Mayor Mike Signer told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

The council meeting was the first since the “Unite the Right” event, which was believed to be the largest gathering of white nationalists in a decade. The demonstrators arrived in Charlottesville partly to protest the city council’s vote to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

That removal is in the midst of a legal challenge. A state law passed in 1998 forbids local governments from removing, damaging or defacing war monuments, but there is legal ambiguity about whether that applies to statues such as the Lee monument, which was erected before the law was passed. A judge has issued an injunction preventing the city from removing the Lee statue while the lawsuit plays out.

Signer said Tuesday that city staff had begun working to find a way to cover the large statues with a material that can withstand the elements. The council believes doing so would not violate the state law, he said.

At the meeting, many speakers directed their anger at Signer. They expressed frustration that city leaders had granted a permit for the rally and criticized police for allowing the two sides to clash violently before the rally even started. That fighting went on largely uninterrupted by authorities, until the event was declared an unlawful assembly and the crowd was forced to disperse.

“Why did you think that you could walk in here and do business as usual after what happened on the 12th?” City Council candidate and community activist Nikuyah Walker said.

The mayor tried to restore order, but as tensions escalated, the meeting was temporarily suspended. Video showed protesters chanting “blood on your hands” as Signer stood at the front of the room. Others held signs calling for his resignation.

When the meeting resumed, the agenda was scuttled and the council listened to input from residents.

Three people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct or obstruction, police said.

The council also voted to take the procedural first steps toward removing a statue of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. City leaders had initially planned to leave it in place.

“I believe that the removal of the Confederate statues is a necessary part of showing that this community can be truly a community of mutual respect,” Councilwoman Kristin Szakos, who proposed covering the statues, said in a statement. “We must do that if we hope to move forward to true justice and equity. We should have done it years ago.”

A woman who told the council her daughter was hurt in the car collision also asked why the number of injured had been widely reported as 19 when she believed it was higher.

The University of Virginia Medical Center said it treated 19 patients _ a number the city repeated in a news release. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Sentara Martha Jefferson hospital said it treated 15 patients from the rally over the weekend. Eleven were directly related to the car incident, and one was transferred to UVA, he said.

Later Tuesday, University of Virginia police disclosed they had obtained arrest warrants for a white nationalist in connection with crimes they say were committed on campus a day before a rally that ended in deadly violence.

Police said in a statement Tuesday that Christopher Cantwell of Keene, New Hampshire, was being sought on three felony charges: two counts of the illegal use of tear gas or other gases and one count of malicious bodily injury with a “caustic substance,” explosive or fire.

The statement said the warrants stem from incidents on campus the evening of Aug. 11, when hundreds of white nationalists marched across the grounds, chanting anti-Semitic slogans and carrying torches. At one point, the marchers were confronted by a much smaller group of counter-protesters. But police didn’t elaborate on the allegations against Cantwell.

On Tuesday night, the Norfolk City Council approved a resolution declaring its desire to move an 80-foot Confederate monument from its downtown to a cemetery as soon as state law allows it. The measure asks Virginia’s attorney general to clarify what state law permits.

"Torso found in Copenhagen waters is missing journalist from submarine, Danish police say","A photo of Swedish journalist Kim Wall who was aboard a submarine “UC3 Nautilus” before it sank. TT NEWS AGENCY/ Tom Wall Handout via REUTERS A photo of Swedish journalist Kim Wall who was aboard a submarine “UC3 Nautilus” before it sank. TT NEWS AGENCY/ Tom Wall Handout via REUTERS

Danish police on Wednesday identified a headless female torso found in the Copenhagen waterside as that of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who police believe was killed on a home-made submarine.

“DNA match between torso and Kim Wall,” the police said on Twitter, declining to comment further until a press briefing at 0700 GMT.

Danish inventor Peter Madsen, charged with killing Wall on his home-made submarine, told the court she had died in an accident and that he “buried” her at sea, changing his previous statement that he dropped her off alive in Copenhagen.

The body was found on Monday by a passing cyclist and police said then it was too early to identify the body which was missing its head, legs and arms.

The case has been followed closely by Danish and Swedish media and has drawn interest from around the world.

Madsen has been charged with manslaughter of Wall who has been missing since he took her out to sea in his 17-metre submarine on August 10. He denies the charge.

He was rescued a day after his UC3 Nautilus sank. Police found nobody else on the vessel.

Danish and Swedish maritime authorities used divers, sonar and helicopters in the search for the body in Koge Bay, south of the city, and in the Oresund Strait between the two countries.

Madsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, appeared before a judge on August 12 for preliminary questioning. The case is not open to the public to protect further investigations, police said.

UK looking to stop ‘malicious’ use of rented vehicles after Spain attacks,"Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas on Thursday. Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas on Thursday.

Britain is exploring ways of stopping the “malicious” use of hired vehicles, including looking at what more rental companies can do, the transport ministry said on Sunday, after two attacks in Spain killed 14 people. The attacks – one in Barcelona where a van was driven into crowds, killing 13 people, and another in Cambrils that saw five men drive a vehicle along a walkway, killing a woman – echoed tactics that have been used by Islamist militants in London.

The police say that the use of hired vehicles makes such attacks very hard to prevent. “The threat from terrorism is changing and so must our response. That is why we are reviewing our counter-terrorism strategy and powers and why we have ploughed extra resources into counter-terrorism,” a government spokesperson said.

“The Department for Transport is also working with the police and the vehicle rental industry to explore what more can be done to prevent the malicious use of hire vehicles. This includes looking at what more rental companies could do before an individual can hire a vehicle.” Britain has increased the number of barriers at bridges and in certain locations in city centres to try to prevent such attacks. Since March, Britain has seen four attacks, three involving a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians.

British hire firms make various checks before granting a vehicle rental, including verifying that customers have a full driving licence, additional identification and a valid credit card. Similarly, Italy’s Interior Ministry over the weekend instructed its local officials to begin to track truck rentals. The ministry wants each heavy vehicle hire to be communicated to local police.

India emerging as important regional partner for US: Rex Tillerson,"Tillerson also praised India’s role in Afghanistan. (File) Tillerson also praised India’s role in Afghanistan. (File)

India is emerging as a very important regional strategic partner for the US that can help modernise Afghanistan both politically and economically, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today. Tillerson’s remarks came after President Donald Trump unveiled the US strategy in Afghanistan which included expanded authorities to target terrorists.

“India is emerging as a very important regional strategic partner with the United States, and has played an important role supporting the Afghan government and in particular supporting their economy,” Tillerson told reporters. He also praised India’s role in Afghanistan. “India has provided development assistance. They’ve provided economic assistance. They are hosting an important economic conference in India this next week. All of that is important to stabilising Afghanistan as a nation,” he said.

“Get their economy functioning, stabilise the country so that they can provide more opportunities to their citizens. These are all elements of what will lead to stability and ultimately a peace agreement,” he said. Responding to a question, the Secretary of State sought the help of India in changing Pakistan’s behaviour. “It is important that Pakistan begin to think about its ability to contain these groups as well. It’s why, though, we take a regional approach. The US alone is not going to change this dynamic with Pakistan,” he said.

“India and Pakistan, they have their own issues that they have to continue to work through. But I think there are areas where perhaps even India can take some steps, a rapprochement on issues with Pakistan to improve the stability within Pakistan and remove some of the reasons why they deal with these unstable elements inside their own country,” Tillerson said.

According to the Secretary of State, other regional players have strong interest in Pakistan. “China has strong interest in Pakistan. Having a stable, secure future Pakistan is in a lot of our interests. They are a nuclear power. We have concerns about their weapons, the security of their weapons. There are many areas in which we believe we should be having very productive dialogue that serves both of our interests and regional interests as well,” Tillerson said.

"Army did not let me down, says Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit","Purohit after the special court hearing Tuesday. Ganesh Shirsekar Purohit after the special court hearing Tuesday. Ganesh Shirsekar

A DAY after he was granted bail by Supreme Court in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit Tuesday said the Army had stood behind him. “The Army did not let me down. I have faith in the Army and my colleagues who stood behind me throughout. It has never been in the tradition or ethos of the Army to let anyone down. Never once did I feel that I was out of the Army,” said Purohit, a serving military intelligence officer, who was arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad in 2008.

Purohit said he cannot wait to adorn the military uniform again. “I want to wear my uniform and return to the Army. The uniform is the outermost layer of my skin. I am very happy to get back to it,” he said, while adding that he is yet to be told about where his next posting will be. He said that once released, he would first want to return to his family. “It has been almost nine years and I would call it a rough patch in my life. The trial still continues and I will take each day as it comes,” he said. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court permitted Purohit to be released on cash bail after which the special NIA court issued his release order. Once the formalities are completed, Purohit is likely to be released from prison.

On Monday, the apex court had allowed bail for Purohit observing that there were contradictions in the chargesheets filed by the ATS and the NIA. The court has also relied on the Court of Inquiry documents accessed by Purohit through the Army, which he claims “only substantiates” his claim of having kept his superior officers in the loop about attending meetings which the ATS alleges were part of the terror conspiracy.

When asked if he would be seeking action against ATS based on NIA’s contention that RDX was planted by the ATS at co-accused Sudhakar Chaturvedi’s home, Purohit said he would leave that to the Army. “I am not an individual, I am part of an organisation (Army). The Army will decide on it. If they find that the claims I made were right, senior commanders will decide on whether they should seek action. I have faith in myself, my command and the commanders,” Purohit said.

Asked whether the Army could have intervened in his case to ensure his release, Purohit said it had not let him down. He refused to comment on claims that the politics between the former dispensation and the current one had led to his arrest and release. “I blame none, I blame my destiny.”

Top badminton racquet-makers go opposite ways to impress shuttlers,"A Yonex stringing stall at the World Championships venue. Yonex’s latest racquet is considerably heavier than rival Li Ning’s new offering. (Source: Express photo by Shivani Naik) A Yonex stringing stall at the World Championships venue. Yonex’s latest racquet is considerably heavier than rival Li Ning’s new offering. (Source: Express photo by Shivani Naik)

A wand may choose a wizard in Harry Potter, which was written in this part of the world, but badminton players definitely don’t take any chances. They choose the racquets they wield, with — at times maddening — precision.

So Chen Long might sport a pleasant, smiling visage either end of a badminton match, at times grinning even in the middle of it, but he is known to be exactingly meticulous about every detail of a racquet he can brandish like a sabre or a mace. His stringers clearly know a different World and Olympic champ than his fans.

His AirStream N99 national team racquet — a fourth generation upgrade — is a uniquely accelerating hit-machine with curving air-pockets carved along the frame. Strung at 33 pounds, the Li Ning generates the whiplash for the champion beast. He is known to pivot off the Li Ning Rangers — costing in a range “that’s too expensive to even quote for the European market”, according to the equipment makers’ representatives in Glasgow.

It’s in the racquets that competition in this sport hots up. While Yonex remain market leaders, there’s a fascinating contest between the leading racquet makers in technology. While AirStream’s ridden on the principle of reducing air resistance and lightening the mass, Yonex’s latest sword-scythe — the Astrox 77 is headed in the opposite direction.

“It’s a heavier racquet on the head and the grip,” says company representative Yukisato Takahashi fronting the giant stringing facility in Glasgow’s World Championship dungeons. Both the top of the head and the end of the handle are chunky, so when the racquet is swung and the head goes down, the swing remains smooth and players get power on the shuttle.

While Li Ning’s aerodynamic centerpiece Windstorm 72 — great for quick reactions, not so much for smashing – was incredibly light at 72 gms, the Astrox is upwards of 80gm.

“Power is more important,” says Takahashi, as he reveals the wonder carbon that’s got Yonex buzzing about its September 15 opening.

“It’s an amazing material called Namd,” he says. When swung overhead for a boomer smash, the shaft remains flexible, without jarring. The last racquet from the Yonex stable was the Duora Z-Strike, a two faced frame — where the curved sharper edge on one side helped on the backhand and the box-like weighty other face helped putting the weight on the forehand smash. The markings were subtly colour-coded on the curve – the orange-up for the right hander, the green-up for the left-hander.

Babolat, racquet giants in tennis, entered badminton 10 years ago, and are ambitious about doing well in Japan – home of Yonex, besides cracking France, England and Denmark. It’s a crowded space with Carlton, Head and Victor, but the tennis-pathbreakers patented the metricflex, a different shape of the shaft – rather than the rolled thin cylinder. When swung forward, the racquet doesn’t lose pace on vibrations.

The last big experiment was on the racquet head. It was isometric rather than oval like an egg-head, offering a larger sweet spot. This was after the 80s when racquet makers experimented with shapes like the tear-drop and another that resembled the tennis-spade. “It’s very hard to come up with visible technology in badminton because there’s very few materials to work with. Tennis loves the graphite innovations, but in badminton it’s only the head shape and a thicker shaft (their latest is the thinnest at 6.5 mm, as against the usual 6.8),” says Steven Chapal of Babolat.

The well-built, tall Danes, who thrive on power, prefer the heavy, chunky, stiff connectors. Mathias Boe is known to be particularly fussy about the exact specifications.

Shuttle’s eternal quest — a failed one until now — has been to make a plastic shuttlecock play like the feathers. Defence becomes an almighty headache, as the plastic ones just dip like withering flowers.

A coup

It’s the Yonex strings that most shuttlers prefer owing to their superior quality, though younger players growing up on Li Ning are known to wield them as extensions of their forearms as well. Yonex pulled off a coup when they got the greatest ever Lin Dan on board — the strings literally loosening up the hold on him as he moved a tad bit away from the national team, and Chen Long became the face of Li Ning.

“It hurts to see him in all the Yonex adverts, but we have Chen Long,” a Li Ning representative says.

Both Chong Wei and Lin Dan, the two best players of their generation, are known to string at 30-31 pounds, while someone like Ratchanok Intanon operates on 26, bringing in more skill and relying just about on the equipment (most racquets are naturally strung at 24).

While strings can vary according to player preference and weather, Taufik Hidayat was known to use very fine thin strings on his BG 65. Some towering Danes have pushed the limits of tension string, taking it right upto 36 or 37. Interestingly, both of India’s top singles players — PV Sindhu and K Srikanth — string at 32 on almost the same racquets — the 66 Ulta-Max, the supergirl’s superpower unleashed from the taut mesh.

Carolina Marin is known to string at about 29 pounds.

At the other end of the spectrum is a player like Great Britain’s doubles bronze medallist from Rio, Chris Langridge. He wielded the two-faced wonder racquet for quite some time, but is said to have no clue about how it worked.

“Oh, he didn’t care to even understand how it worked. You’ll see players spin the racquet and bore their eyes into the racquet face. Chris wouldn’t know one from the next,” guffaws a stringer for Yonex. The wizard maketh the magic, never mind the wand’s excruciatingly detailed specifications.

* PM sees above-average growth in 2018

* Election day is Sept. 11

Norway’s economic growth will exceed its historical average in 2018, and the government should “take a step back” on fiscal spending, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Wednesday.

The economy of western Europe’s top producer of oil and gas was hit by a sharp fall in the price of crude from 2014 to 2016, but growth has since picked up along with a partial recovery in oil prices.

“It was right to spend more money when that was needed, but now it’s time to take a step back,” Solberg told a news conference ahead of a two-day government budget conference.

“Next year we expect the mainland economy to grow more rapidly than its historical average,” she added.

The annual spending of cash from the country’s $975 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, should stay at three percent or below, Solberg said.

With less than three weeks to go before parliamentary elections, opinion polls show the minority right-wing government and its centrist backers are locked in a too-close-to-call race with the centre-left opposition.

Pay to stay behind bars! Thailand has a new prison-themed hotel,"The owner of the hotel was inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, ‘The Shawshank Redemption’. The owner of the hotel was inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, ‘The Shawshank Redemption’.

People may love the luxuries of a five-star hotel but for those who like it edgy and different, there’s a lot more fun in staying at some of the world’s weirdest hotels. So, though as a (hopefully) law-abiding person, it’s (thankfully) unlikely that you’ll ever know what the inside of a prison would look like, an entrepreneur in Thailand figured why not create that as an experience for those with a curious mind.

Joining the genre of weird hotels such as the “corpse hotels” in Japan or like the Hotel La Claustra in Switzerland, where people spend their time in a former army bunker, is the Sook Station in Bangkok, which just opened earlier this summer and offers guests the opportunity to spend a night behind bars (quite literally). Designed to mimic jail, enthusiasts can now spend the night in a prison cell for around 1,300 Thai Baht (£30 or Rs2,500) per night, and have a first-hand experience of a Thai prison cell.

The prison-inspired hotel treats its guest well but all perks are styled to suit what a prisoner would otherwise face.

The rooms have metal gates with rods, bunk beds, common toilets and light-out curfew. The guests, rather inmates are given black and white striped clothes and a mug shot is taken on arrival. The compound is also secured with barbed wires, giving off the vibes of a correctional home. Apart from small cells measuring just 8 sqm, there are larger family cells too.

Located at Bang Na district of Bangkok, just 15km away from Suvarnabhumi Airport, it has become quite a hit among tourists. Here, the guests are not given keys to their rooms but receive an inmate number, which can be used as room codes and are given a criminal record as a memento.

Sook Station that translates to “happiness station” in English does come with a few luxuries that inmates wouldn’t find in a jail. From free Wi-Fi and car parking to delicious food served at its restaurant, this unique theme hotel is not that gloomy.

And if one is too tired of the dim lighting and iron gates, there are rooms with a balcony too. The hotel also offers an outdoor Jacuzzi, a relaxation lounge, office space and halls to host events. The terrace is the perfect place to even have a romantic date with fairy lights. It also has a 24-hour coffee shop that too follows the prison theme.

Inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, The Shawshank Redemption, the owner told the Lonely Planet that most of the guests like it because it is unique and comfortable.

But this is not the first prison-themed hotel. Karostas Cietums is a military prison in Latvia that housed enemies and revolutionaries during Stalin’s time that opened in 1905. Now turned into a hotel that is just open for overnight stays, visitors can experience the harsh prison life. And if the severe condition is not preferred, then one can experience luxuries at other prison-turned-resorts. While there is hotel Het Arresthuis (Dutch for house arrest) outside Amsterdam, a 90-year-old prison in Istanbul is now a posh Four Seasons hotel. And luxurious Liberty Hotel in Boston is also a former prison.

"A Year After Brussels Blast, Survivor Says Terror Can’t Finish Everyone","Updated: March 21, 2017 5:40 pm

About 214 Indian passengers were rescued from Brussels and brought back to India via Amsterdam two days after the terror strike that killed 31 people. While 155 passengers were taken to Delhi, 70 others were brought to Mumbai.

When the aanchal became a parcham,"The verdict has sent not only a powerful message of gender equality but women empowerment as well. From our experience, we can say that even when laws are changed, habits take much longer time to adjust. The verdict has sent not only a powerful message of gender equality but women empowerment as well. From our experience, we can say that even when laws are changed, habits take much longer time to adjust.

Tere maathe pe yeh aanchal bahut hi khoob hai lekin/tu is aanchal se ik parcham bana leti to achchha tha

This veil on your head looks very pretty but it will be better if you were to make it a flag. This is how (Asrar ul Haq) Majaz, a student in Aligarh who later became famous for his romantic poetry, counselled women students of his alma mater.

Despite these exhortations, social norms remained rigid and oppressive for Muslim women. And the most oppressive feature of the law that governed their marital lives was that it gave a Muslim man an unrestrained right to divorce his wife with three simple pronouncements of talaq in one sitting.

In fact, even more oppressive was the fact that a Muslim girl grew up with the consciousness that after marriage, her husband would have the right to turn her out of her marital home through instant talaq, without letting her know the reasons thereof. In case the suffering woman chose to protest or seek some relief under existing laws like Section 125 of CrPC (The Code of Criminal Procedure), then there were cleric organisations like the Muslim Personal Law Board which would defend this obnoxious practice in the name of freedom of religion and special identity of the community.

And in case the courts gave the verdict in favour of the oppressed woman, then they would start an aggressive protest movement through which they would use violent and threatening language to compel the government to reverse the judgment through a Parliamentary legislation.

Almost every Muslim country has legally prohibited triple talaq that was being defended by the Personal Law Board and their supporters. But we must acknowledge the fact that by the time the hearing on triple talaq in the Supreme Court had come to conclusion and the Personal Law Board had sensed the general mood, they made a request to the Honourable Court seeking permission to file an additional affidavit and they were allowed to do so.

In this later affidavit, they admitted that the practice of triple talaq is an innovation, it is an unjust practice and that they themselves plan to launch a campaign against it. They requested the court not to intervene but admitted that the government and Parliament have the right to reform through legislation.

The Personal Law Board is a body of clerics, and history shows that they take longer than normal to move ahead with the times. I refer to the famous speech of Mustafa Kamal Pasha, the leader of Turkey who blamed the Muslim clergy for the social and educational backwardness of the community.

He said that in 1450, we stood against world opinion and annexed Constantinople into Turkey as historically, it belonged to us — the capture of the Byzantine capital by the Ottomans in May 1453. But around the same time, we could not stand up to the opinion of one man — the Sheikh-ul Islam of Turkey who had declared that the printing press is prohibited in Islam. This ban on the printing press remained in operation for almost the next two hundred years, resulting in a vast gap in the educational status of Muslim and non-Muslim societies.

In the name of freedom of religion, I have the right to profess, practice and preach what I believe in. But this right to religion does not give me a licence to indulge in oppression and suppression of any other person. I have the right to practice my faith, I do not have the right to indulge in practices which are injurious to the health of others.

Secondly, the right to religion is a personal and individual right available even to non-citizens who happen to be in India. It is not a communitarian right which should accommodate practices that are repugnant to good sense and human dignity. The practice of triple talaq robs Muslim women both their dignity and equality as Indian citizens and, without doubt, is highly oppressive in nature.

In Prophetic tradition, it has been asserted that a dominion or society can coexist with disbelief but it cannot exist if its members practice oppression against each other. Oppression has been described as Fitnah and it is a religious obligation to fight against oppression.

The judgment of the Supreme Court holding that triple talaq is arbitrary and, therefore, unconstitutional is a relief to the suffering women but it is difficult today to make a realistic assessment of the tremendous impact that it would have on our social and national life in years to come. The verdict has sent not only a powerful message of gender equality but women empowerment as well. From our experience, we can say that even when laws are changed, habits take much longer time to adjust.

Soon we will hear about cases where a man makes three pronouncements and the wife refuses to go, saying that this pronouncement carries no legal sanction. And if she chooses to report the matter to police, then it will be a fit case for prosecution under provisions dealing with harassment and mental torture.

This judgment will change the lives of not only Muslim women who despite heavy odds have fought and won this long arduous battle but will inspire other Indian women as well who are facing discrimination at home or at places of work. Their faith in our Constitution and judicial system will be redoubled and now they will fight back any oppression with more vigour and energy.

Woman drags man who harassed her to the GRP,"The Kalyan GRP registered a case against the accused under Section 354 (outraging modesty of woman by word or gesture) of the Indian Penal Code. (Representational) The Kalyan GRP registered a case against the accused under Section 354 (outraging modesty of woman by word or gesture) of the Indian Penal Code. (Representational)

A woman grabbed an eve-teaser by the collar and dragged him to Kalyan Government Railway Police (GRP) station on Monday evening after the man allegedly made lewd gestures at her. The man was arrested later.

A video of the woman dragging the man to the police station went viral on social media by Tuesday. In her complaint to the police, the woman has said she was on her way to her mother’s house when the incident took place at platform number 1 of Kalyan Railway station.

“I was waiting for a train and the man kept staring at me. When our eyes met, he winked at me and made lewd gestures. I ignored him a few times. But when he continued doing it, I could not take it anymore,” the woman has said in her statement to the police.

She then went up to the accused, grabbed him by the collar, raised the alarm and with help of women GRP officers, took the man to the police station. The Kalyan GRP registered a case against the accused under Section 354 (outraging modesty of woman by word or gesture) of the Indian Penal Code.

Police officers said the man has been identified as Surendra Lalbahadur Gautam (30), a resident of Kalyan. Gautam is from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh.

"Man stabbed to death in Ambedkar Colony: ‘There were visible lapses,’ admits DCP","The case will be investigated by the Public Grievance Cell headed by an ACP-rank officer. The case will be investigated by the Public Grievance Cell headed by an ACP-rank officer.

The accused and the victim were stationed in the duty officer’s room instead of the interrogation room; and later when they moved to the investigation officer’s room for interrogation, no officer was present to guard them. These are the lapses, cited by the Delhi Police, that led to the murder of a 34-year-old driver inside Ambedkar Nagar police station, senior officials told The Indian Express.

The victim, Anil, was stabbed six times by his neighbour inside the police station after the latter managed to get his hands on a ‘file poker’. Police owned up to the lapses on their part, with DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya saying, “We have seen visible lapses on the part of our police officers and have set up a vigilance inquiry into the matter. A report will be submitted in the next 48 hours. We will take appropriate action in the case after we receive the report,” he said. The case will be investigated by the Public Grievance Cell headed by an ACP-rank officer. Sources said that the “first lapse” was “the decision to shift both the accused to the duty officer’s room, where they started quarrelling”.

According to the conventional practice, the source said, the two men were “supposed to be taken into the interrogation room, but instead were taken to the duty officer’s room”. “The Investigating Officer on duty, SI Brahm Prakash, then took them to the IO’s room on the first floor. The officer in question has been put under suspension,” a senior officer said.

Sources claimed the “second lapse” was that constable Ashok, who was to stand guard outside the IO’s office, left his post. “Ashok had to go downstairs for two minutes to attend a duty officer’s call, and he left the room unattended, which is when the murder took place. He has also been placed under suspension for not informing another officer to guard the office,” the officer said.

Meanwhile, the SHO of Ambedkar Nagar, Rakesh Kumar Sisodia, has been directed to report before the district police lines on account of overall supervisory lapse, a senior officer said. Sisodia was not present at the station when the murder took place, and was on night patrol duty. Police, however, want to ascertain if the SHO had briefed officers at the station about the official protocol. “We want to find out whether he had been briefing the staff at his station about basics like where to take the complainants and the accused inside the police station,” the officer said.

We love ruffles but Jacqueline Fernandez’s take on it is simply bizarre,"Jacqueline Fernandez in an all-black look. (Source: Instagram/lakshmilehr) Jacqueline Fernandez in an all-black look. (Source: Instagram/lakshmilehr)

From rainbow-inspired pants to glamorous metallic gold tops, with the promotion of her upcoming film, A Gentleman, Jacqueline Fernandez has been giving us plenty of inspiring looks. Maybe this is what you come to expect when two experts from the industry, Anaita Shroff Adjania and Lakshmi Lehr constantly work on curating the perfect look. But even world-class celebrity stylists have their bad days and this look is one such example.

For a promotional event, Fernandez stepped out in an all-black ensemble put together by the duo. The black Deme By Gabriella crop top and the ruffled, high-low skirt from Sandro Paris Officiel allowed her to show off her perfectly toned abs but it did nothing more than that.

We think it’s one of the worst looks of the actor, ever! Even her beauty game lacked finesse and we are really disappointed. To put it bluntly, this look is a complete drab.

Another look which threw us off balance was of the actor in a colourful, knitted maxi dress by Missoni. She paired it with layered dainty necklaces and a pair of earrings from Farah Khan.

We like seeing her in figure-hugging maxis but there’s just too much going on here with this look – it’s like the designer didn’t really put any thought into it and used every colour he could lay his hands on. Also, the gorgeous retro waves didn’t make much of a difference.

Do you like her style quotient? Let us know in the comments below.

Nine killed in Abu Sayyaf militant attack in Philippines: Police,"President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Basilan, to quell the militant threat. Following Monday’s attack, residents evacuated their homes in fear and authorities sent more troops to secure the area. (Representational Image/Reuters) President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Basilan, to quell the militant threat. Following Monday’s attack, residents evacuated their homes in fear and authorities sent more troops to secure the area. (Representational Image/Reuters)

Islamist gunmen killed nine people and injured ten others as they attacked a town in the Philippines at dawn today, burning houses in which women and children were sleeping, police said. About 60 members of the notorious Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group entered a town in their stronghold on Basilan island in the southern Mindanao region and began shooting, local police chief John Cundo told AFP.

“This is an act of terrorism and cowardice. When our forces engaged them in a 45-minute firefight and they felt our numbers and volume of fire they backed away and fled,” Cundo said. “What is unfortunate is that women and children were affected as they were still sleeping when this happened.”

The militants burned four houses and a day care centre in the town of Maluso, Cundo said, adding police and the military were conducting “hot pursuit” operations against the gunmen. The Abu Sayyaf is a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network.

Its members have engaged in banditry and kidnapping, targeting foreigners in exchange for millions of dollars in ransom. One faction based on Basilan has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.

It is not clear whether that faction was involved in today’s attack on Maluso, although its members are among militants who have been occupying since May parts of Marawi, the largely Catholic nation’s most important Islamic city. The militants have withstood a US-backed military offensive in Marawi that has claimed more than 700 lives and displaced nearly 400,000 people.

President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Basilan, to quell the militant threat. Following Monday’s attack, residents evacuated their homes in fear and authorities sent more troops to secure the area, according to Cundo.

"Deoband chorus: Discourage triple talaq, but Shariat above all laws","In Uttar Pradesh’s Deoband, 160 km from Delhi and home to one of the most influential seminaries for Sunni Muslims, Darul Uloom Deoband, the ruling had few takers. In Uttar Pradesh’s Deoband, 160 km from Delhi and home to one of the most influential seminaries for Sunni Muslims, Darul Uloom Deoband, the ruling had few takers.

At her one-room home inside a narrow lane of Deoband, Shazia is conducting a tuition class for four children, including her seven-year-old daughter Alia, on how to read the Quran. Shazia says she was divorced by her husband three months ago through instant triple talaq, “by uttering the words ‘talaq, talaq, talaq’”.

With the eight-year marriage over, the 30-year-old returned to her mother’s house, a few lanes from her former husband’s home. “I have studied only till Class 10, this is all I can do to earn a living for my daughter and myself,” said Shazia, adding that she charges Rs 50 from each student.

And yet, Shazia says, the “shock and sadness” from the “talaq” has not shaken her belief in the Shariat. “When my husband said talaq thrice, it was over. But I would never question the Shariat,” she says.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled against instant triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat, with a majority judgment of the Constitutional Bench calling the law “un-Islamic”. But in Uttar Pradesh’s Deoband, 160 km from Delhi and home to one of the most influential seminaries for Sunni Muslims, Darul Uloom Deoband, the ruling had few takers.

Inside the seminary, where verses from the Quran rang aloud, the mohtamim (rector), Maulana Mufti Abul Qasim Nomani, said, “The courts and the Parliament don’t have the right to form any law that goes against Islamic law.”

Nomani said, “I cannot comment further till I read the entire judgment… As far as our action on the judgment is concerned, we will hold meetings with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and decide what needs to be done. We stand with the AIMPLB.” At his office inside the seminary, Ashraf Usmani, public relations officer of Darul Uloom Deoband, says he does not agree with the description of triple talaq as “traditional law”. “Triple talaq falls under the Shariat. It is not like we have an option to go for or against it,” said Usmani.

Usmani says the seminary may have issued hundreds of fatwas on triple talaq, but none on discouraging the practice. Outside the seminary, Mohammad Aslam (64), a perfume vendor in Deoband town, said, “Though the Shariat mentions triple talaq, it doesn’t encourage it. The correct method would have been for fatwas to be issued against the men who use triple talaq as a tool to get separated from their wives. Teen talaq bahut khatarnak hai, ghar ujad jaate hain isse (Triple talaq is dangerous, it can destroy homes).”

However, Aslam said, “Right, or wrong, we will always go by the Shariat, and not any court order. The Shariat is above all courts. The only correction that needs to be done by the Darul Uloom Deoband is to discourage the practice of triple talaq.” In another part of the town, Femida, the mother of 21-year-old Heena, blames her daughter’s divorce through instant triple talaq eight months ago on the “greed” for dowry.

“Her former husband’s family wanted a lot of dowry, the greed eventually led to the divorce. But the practice of triple talaq is better than making the woman suffer by not divorcing her. Now that my daughter is with me, I will look for a suitable match and get her married again,” said the 45-year-old. “Triple talaq is law, and it has to be followed.

Sweet shops down shutters as part of day-long strike to protest 5 per cent GST,"A shut K C Das at Esplanade in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo by Partha Paul) A shut K C Das at Esplanade in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo by Partha Paul)

Lakhs of sweet shops across the state remained shut on Monday, following a 24-hour strike called by Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, demanding the rollback of the 5 per cent Goods and Service Tax (GST) on sweets. “We have received immense response from sweet sellers across the state. Almost all sweet shops downed their shutters. We do not have the infrastructure to cope up with the new tax regime. Government kept paneer and other perishable items out of GST but imposed 5 per cent GST on sweets,” said Jagannath Ghosh, the Joint Secretary of Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, Kolkata unit.

“It is not possible for sweet sellers to file so many returns. They (Centre) have kept two schemes for us. In one scheme, tax return has to be filed quarterly, and in another we need to file tax return 38 times in one year. We want the government to rollback its decision and keep sweets industry out of GST,” said Ghosh.

According to sweet sellers, the sweets industry registers over Rs 1,000 crore turnover annually, and has about 10 lakh employees. In one day’s strike, the industry would incur a loss of Rs 10 lakh, they said. According to Ghosh, sweet sellers also plan to intensify their protest and sit for a relay hunger strike from August 24 to September 26.

“We have paid VAT on raw materials, but there has been no tax on sweets, and we want the government to understand the core matters of our industry. Those who sell sweets are not computer-friendly, and it is a headache for them to file tax returns. Is it possible to give a printed bill to each customer for one rosogulla or one sandesh?” asked a sweet seller.

GST on sweets will also increase cost of the product, which will be an extra burden for customers. “Here in Bengal, we don’t need occasions to buy sweets. Having sweets is like a daily affair for us. An increase in its cost will definitely affect us,” said Rita Bhattacharya, a housewife. Most of the sweet shops in the state don’t issue bills to their customers. They sell sweets and pay VAT on raw materials. There has been no tax on sweets for many years. “With GST, we have to keep track of number of items sold and issue bills, for which we need a computer and someone to operate it. The infrastructure we require to pay GST is costly,” added Ram Babu, a sweet shop owner at VIP Road who has been running his shop for the last 20 years.

"Donald Trump rules out hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, warns Pakistan for support to terror","US President Donald Trump. (Reuters Photo) US President Donald Trump. (Reuters Photo)

The US on Tuesday ruled out a hasty withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan as President Donald Trump warned Pakistan of consequences if it continues to provide safe havens to terror groups and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Trump, in a prime-time televised address to the nation, laid out his South Asia policy saying a “critical part” of it was to further develop US’ strategic partnership with India.

He said after a “comprehensive review”, it has been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically.

“A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I’ve said many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance, the dates we intend to begin, or end, military operations,” Trump said in his address.

“We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities,” Trump said as he announced his South Asia policy in front of about 2,000 people from all five services and top officials of his administration.Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

“We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” Trump said. “Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,” he said, in a apparent warning to Pakistan.

The US President reached out to India seeking an enhanced role for New Delhi, especially in the economic field, to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan. India, the world’s largest democracy, is a key security and economic partner of the United States, he said.

“We appreciate India’s important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development,” Trump said.

"Donald Trump to announce new Afghan, South Asia strategy: White House","President Donald Trump. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump will announce America’s new strategy in Afghanistan on Monday, amid reports that his administration could be mulling a role for India in ending the brutal and costly conflict, the US’ longest war. Trump will make his first prime-time broadcast to the nation as president at 9 pm (7:30 am IST, Tuesday) to unveil his new plan after a lengthy period of deliberations to end nearly 16 years long war in Afghanistan.

The president will “provide an update on the path forward for America’s engagement in Afghanistan and South Asia,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. The address from the Fort Myer military base in Arlington, Virginia, will follow Defence Secretary Jim Mattis confirmation yesterday that the administration had decided on a new Afghan strategy after “rigorous” debate.

The much-awaited policy announcement comes eight months after Trump became the US president and after criticism from some US lawmakers that he was struggling to make a decision. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, had announced his Afghan policy in the first 100 days of his office. Defence Secretary James Mattis said yesterday that Trump’s policy review on the war and the entire US approach to South Asia — Washington’s tortured ties with Pakistan and complaints that Islamabad is tacitly encouraging extremists — had been finalised.

“He wants to be the one to announce it to the American people,” Mattis said. “He now needs the weekend to collect his thoughts on how he’s going to explain it to the American people.” On Friday, Trump had a meeting with national security officials at Camp David to discuss the Afghan strategy. On Saturday, he tweeted: “Important day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan.”

While Obama’s policy focused primarily on Afghanistan and Pakistan, reports said the Trump administration looked into possibilities for a role for India during its policy review. Months ago, the Pentagon had settled on a plan to send approximately 3,800 additional troops to help strengthen the Afghan Army, which is stuck in what some call a deteriorating stalemate with the Taliban insurgency.

US military commanders have often argued that additional troops would help the US to reverse gains made by the Taliban and other militant groups. Trump delegated authority to adjust troop levels to Mattis early in his administration, but he has been presented by the Pentagon with a range of options for the path forward, including a complete troop withdrawal and the deployment of up to 4,000 more soldiers to add to the more than 8,000 American forces that are already there.

Hopes that the US could finally leave Afghanistan have been checked by the Afghan government’s struggle to preserve order under a resurgent challenge from the Taliban and inroads made by extremist groups like al-Qaeda, ISIS and the Haqqani network.

Following the 2001 September 11 attacks, the US-led an invasion of Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The war eventually became the US’ longest in history. The Afghan war had cost more than USD 1.07 trillion till 2014 end. According to fatalities monitoring website icasualties.org, 3,539 coalition soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, including 2,403 Americans, 455 British and 681 others.

This year, the Taliban offensive against the West-backed government in Kabul increased this summer. Reports said the the insurgent group in an “open letter” to Trump last week reiterated its calls for the withdrawal of all remaining US troops from Afghanistan.

Trump’s address to the nation follows the most polarising chapter of a presidency that has continually exacerbated political divisions.

His handling of the aftermath of violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month has sparked outrage and accusations that Trump has tarnished the moral authority of his presidency.

"In balanced verdict, golden window for progressive reform everywhere","Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court’s verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal) Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court’s verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal)

Like most matters involving Constitution Benches, what will endure is the political context of the debate in which the triple talaq case was spawned, and how the arguments in the Supreme Court impacted that context. It is now 31 years to Shah Bano, which is the last time that matters related to the matrimony of a Muslim woman made it to party political manifestos. The Supreme Court verdict in the case, on the question of the amount of maintenance to be provided to a divorced Muslim woman, was overturned by Parliament through enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.

In the eighties, “Shah Bano” became code for the BJP’s argument against undue state protection for Indian Muslims (read Muslim men). While the Hindu Code Bill and a series of laws passed in the 50s had put restrictions on Hindu men, Muslims were seen to continue to enjoy the right to marry more than once, and divorce in ways that were deemed easier. That Muslim men “had it better” was the political slogan for the ranks, along with “Shah Bano”, “appeasement” and “Babri Masjid”. The three decades since then, before a two-judge Bench pushed the triple talaq matter back into national consciousness (Prakash and Ors versus Phulavati and Ors, 2015), have seen much change and ferment.

Rising literacy has impacted all sections of society, huge changes in communication technology have allowed the Quran to be read on mobile phones, Muslim women have sought to reconcile feminism with Islam, ideas such as parity in wages have gained ground, and progressive legislation such as The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, have left a deep mark on the Muslim community. As dissatisfaction with family courts (Dar-ul-Qaza) grew, a Muslim Women’s Personal Law Board came into being in 2005, even as the women in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board became increasingly visible.

The courts, meanwhile, kept chipping away at the acceptability of instant talaq — in the Shamim Ara case in 2003, the Supreme Court said divorce would not be valid unless the husband could satisfy the court, through “oral, documentary, circumstantial evidence”, that the procedure for divorce laid down in the Quran had been followed. In 2008, Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed of the Delhi High Court ruled in Masood Ahmed that three divorces at one go counted as just a single talaq. The present case cannot be divorced from its context. Muslim organisations have been willing to raise issues of gender parity, but have found it difficult to believe that the interests of the ascendant BJP end at merely ensuring gender parity. Unlike when NDA-I was in power, the BJP today appears far more keen to push through the courts its “core agenda” on Ayodhya, Uniform Civil Code and Kashmir. Thus, Article 35A is facing a fresh challenge in the Supreme Court, while the triple talaq case has been widely seen as proxy for a Uniform (Hindu) Civil Code for all.

The roots of the debate are deep. The attempts at reforming and codifying Hindu law by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr B R Ambedkar faced vociferous opposition from the Hindu Right led by Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, and contributed to Babasaheb’s resignation from the cabinet. While Nehru went about completing the business of codifying Hindu law, the job of persuading the minorities, and of enabling more progressive and vigorous reform from within, did not go far in the face of dominant conservative opinion.

Tuesday’s five-judge verdict gives an important opportunity to the Muslim community to seize the day on what it agrees must indeed happen: meaningful and robust progressive reform. The majority verdict has struck down instant triple talaq as illegal and “arbitrary”, but not as unconstitutional — careful, perhaps, to not open the Pandora’s box of practices such as those pertaining to personal law in Himachal Pradesh (which is at variance with the rest of the country), and among Parsis (where decisions are made by a panchayat) and Christians (where a Church tribunal decides). Among Hindus, customs contrary to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, have been specifically protected by Section 29 (2) of the Act, and the Act’s Section 2 makes it inapplicable to the Scheduled Tribes. By calling out a social evil for what it is, by striking it down and yet not ruffling feathers about how one religion is fundamentally more or less ‘progressive’ than the other, the court has opened a golden window for all communities to push for progressive reform in personal laws that impact all women, men and children.

Udaipur’s Kalpit Veerwal in Limca book of records for 100 per cent in JEE-Mains,"Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

The first-ever student to have scored 100 pc in the prestigious Joint Entrance Examination-Mains, Udaipur boy Kalpit Veerwal has made it to the Limca Book of Records for his feat. Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

His record of the perfect score will feature under the “Education Achievements” category of the 2018 edition, an official from the Limca Book of Records said. “I was confident of cracking the examination but didn’t expect a perfect score. Similarly, making it to the Limca Book of Records was not something I ever dreamt of,” Veerwal told PTI over phone from Mumbai.

Veerwal’s home city of Udaipur is not more than 300 km from Kota, which is referred to as country’s “coaching hub” because of large number of medical and engineering aspirants who go there for their preparations. “I did not study for 15 hours a day, I did not go down the usual ‘Kota route’ for IIT preparations but consistent studies helped me a lot,” he said.

Veerwal’s father Pushpendra Veerwal is a nurse at the Maharana Bhupal Government Hospital in Rajasthan’s Udaipur while his mother Pushpa is a government school teacher. His elder brother is pursuing MBBS from AIIMS, Jodhpur. “All we want for our children was to study at good colleges and land up jobs that could help them in easy survival. We never pressured them to come first in class, score 90 per cent, get the top rank or bag a job that would make them millionaires.

“Everybody suggested that we should send him to Kota or Hyderabad for coaching but we decided not to put him under any extra pressure and enrol him in an institute here. But him making a record is not something we ever expected,” his father told PTI. Veerwal scored 109th rank in the JEE-Advanced. Out of the over 11.8 lakh students, who appeared for the examination for admission to various IITs and engineering colleges, around 2.2 lakh have qualified for the second and final round — the JEE (Advanced).

Veerwal had also topped the Indian Junior Science Olympiad in class 9 and bagged the top spot in the National Talent Search Examination in Class 10. A student of MDS Senior Secondary School in Udaipur, Veerwal took coaching from Resonance institute there.

Time and again we’ve seen that the job of television reporters is not an easy one, especially when you’re ON TV. While this year we’ve had a whole host of them committing bloopers on live television, Mary Beth McDade, a reporter with KTLA News in Los Angeles, had an unexpected visitor just before going live on air. Seconds before she had to start her report, a cockroach flew in and landed on her person. A startled McDade jumped up in alarm as she brushed the flying roach off.

A colleague came in to offer some help, but stayed away when he noticed the rather precarious positioning of the cockroach. Thankfully, McDade had managed to get rid of the roach after a brief moment of panic.

A video of the hilarious encounter was posted on Twitter by her colleague, executive producer Marcus Wilson-SmithVerified account, with the comment: “Ahhhhh: Flying cockroach jumps on @mcdade_mb before her live shot on the @KTLA 5 News at 10p! #RoachBomb”.

From battling natural elements to tackling random walk-ins who could end up either acting weirdly or just bashing the anchor up, we’ve seen many reporters get hit by the unexpected this year. Remember the one who got drenched by the sea as he was reporting about the weather, or the guy who got punched in the face by a guy who was upset at being asked to step out of the camera frame? And as much as we feel sorry for them, there is no denying that such bloopers give us a good laugh.

Supreme Court avenges a misogynist clergy,"On Tuesday, the Supreme Court set aside the practice of divorce through triple talaq among Muslims, ruling that the practice was ‘void and invalid’. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav) On Tuesday, the Supreme Court set aside the practice of divorce through triple talaq among Muslims, ruling that the practice was ‘void and invalid’. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

By a majority of 3 : 2, a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has “set aside” the practice of Triple Talaq prevalent among Indian Muslims. As political parties of various hues and views rush to welcome the judgment, let us first understand what the issue was before the Court and what the Court has actually done. Unlike the Hindu Law or even the so-called progressive Special Marriage law, Islamic Law recognizes the irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce. Both the husband and wife have a right to dissolve their marriage without providing reason.

However, it prescribes an exhaustive procedure for the exercise of such a right. In the case of dissolution at the behest of the husband (called talaq), the procedure prescribed is this :

1. If a Muslim man wants to dissolve his marriage by way of talaq, the dissolution must be preceded by attempts at reconciliation by arbiters from both sides.

2. If reconciliation attempts fail, he may pronounce talaq.

3. Talaq must be pronounced in the presence of the wife and witnesses. In the event the wife refuses to be physically present, the husband must pronounce it in writing and must communicate the writing to his wife.

4. However, there will be a ‘cooling period’ of 3 months during which, if parties reconcile, the talaq so pronounced may be revoked. For these 3 months, this talaq shall remain in abeyance.

5. If during the aforesaid 3-month period, the talaq is not revoked, it will be effective on the expiry of 3 months.

6. If the husband pronounces talaq in accordance with the aforesaid procedure and revokes it within the 3-month cooling period, the marriage stays intact. However, he can do this (pronouncing talaq and revoking it) only twice. If he pronounces talaq for the third time, he cannot revoke it and the marriage shall stand dissolved.

7. The husband must make reasonable provision for maintenance and alimony for the wife.

In India, for decades now, Muslim husbands have been told by ill-informed (and often mischievous) clergy that talaq will not be effective except when pronounced thrice in one sitting. That a Muslim husband must necessarily utter the word talaq three times at one go to dissolve his marriage. They have also been told that such an utterance will lead to an ‘irrevocable’ dissolution of marriage after which parties can neither revoke the divorce nor remarry even if both of them so desire, unless the divorced wife first marries another man, consummates that marriage and gets divorced by that man.

This absolutely un-Islamic practice called halaala was nothing but reprehensible mischief devised by a misogynist clergy to persecute innocent couples (especially the wife) who wanted to rethink their divorce. This practice – pronouncing talaq three times in one go to make it irrevocable and forcing the woman to go through the inhuman practice of halaala — which was challenged before the Supreme Court and which is commonly called Triple Talaq.

The Constitution Bench on August 22 pronounced three different judgments – one each authored by Chief Justice J S Khehar (Justice Abdul Nazeer concurring with him), Justice Kurien Joseph and Justice R F Nariman (Justice UU Lalit concurring with him). While the Chief Justice has upheld the practice of Triple Talaq in a curious and rather oxymoronic fashion, the judges who have authored the other two judgments have set it aside. In this manner, a majority of three judges (Joseph, Nariman and Lalit) have set aside the practice of Triple Talaq and a minority of two judges (the Chief Justice and Justice Nazeer) have upheld it. Needless to explain that the majority judgment is the one that is the law of the land.

What have these judges said ? The Chief Justice has, in his 272-page judgment, held that Triple Talaq is an essential religious practice of Islam and, therefore, protected by Article 25 of the Constitution which guarantees the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion. Rights guaranteed by Article 25 cannot be abrogated except on grounds of public order, morality or health, and since Triple Talaq does not affect any of these, it must be upheld as part of the right of Muslims to profess and practice their religion.

On the basis of this finding, he has refused to touch the practice of Triple Talaq or declare it as unlawful. He has, however, noted that all parties before the Court have been unanimous in maintaining that, whether or not it is un-Islamic, it is a bad practice and has been abolished by statutory reforms in many Islamic countries.

He has, therefore, exercised jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution and directed the Central government to consider appropriate legislation on the subject keeping in mind the progressive developments that have taken place in this regard in the Muslim world. He has further injuncted Muslim husbands from pronouncing Triple Talaq till such time as “legislation in the matter is considered”. His injunction shall, in the first instance, operate for 6 months and its further continuation will depend on what legislative process is brought into action.

Apart from being predicated on a completely absurd foundation, viz., that Triple Talaq is an essential religious practice of Islam, the Chief Justice’s opinion is also ridden with inherent contradictions. On the one hand, he holds that Muslims have a fundamental right to practise Triple Talaq since it is an essential religious practice and therefore constitutionally protected, but on the other hand he not only directs the State to consider legislation to curb Triple Talaq, but also injuncts Muslim husbands from pronouncing Triple Talaq for an uncertain period.

If Triple Talaq is Constitutionally protected, how can its practice be injuncted or how can the State pass a law to curb it? The minority judgment is not only confusing and inconsistent but also falls foul of elementary canons of judicial interpretation. Thankfully, it is a minority judgment and, consequently, does not require to be treated as the law laid down by the apex court. Both the majority opinions demonstrate a great degree of judicial scholarship. Justice Joseph quotes verse after verse from the Holy Quran and finds that Triple Talaq is absolutely impermissible under the Quran. He maintains, and rightly so, that when the Quran – which is the primary source of Islamic law — itself is unambiguous about the impermissibility of Triple Talaq, there is no need to look at secondary sources of Islamic law.

He then holds that since Triple Talaq is un-Quranic, it cannot be deemed to be Islamic, much less an essential practice of Islam even if it has been practised for a long period of time. On the ground of being un-Islamic, he sets it aside holding that : “what is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well”.

Since he sets aside this practice, he finds it imperative to explain the correct procedure to be followed by Muslim men to dissolve their marriage. In doing so, he relies upon and reaffirms the 2002 judgment of the Supreme Court in Shamin Ara Vs Union of India where the Court has affirmed the procedure explained in (1) to (4) above as the correct procedure of talaq prescribed by Islamic law. Justice Joseph believes that when religion is pitted against other Constitutional rights, a reconciliation between the same is necessary and such reconciliation can be done only by the legislature.

Justice Nariman begins his judgment with disagreeing with the Chief Justice. Like Justice Joseph, Justice Nariman also finds that Triple Talaq is not an essential religious practice of Islam ; in fact, it is deprecated. But he adds an ingenious argument in his judgment. The Muslim Personal Law Board, while supporting Triple Talaq, had argued that Muslim Personal Law is de hors (outside) the definition of “law” as found in Article 13 of the Constitution and, therefore, its Constitutionality cannot be tested by the Supreme Court. Justice Nariman maintains that since Triple Talaq is a form of Talaq and Talaq has been recognized as a mode of dissolution of marriage in the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)

Application Act 1937, the practice of Triple Talaq has now been incorporated in a statute and has, consequently, become part of “law” for the purpose of Article 13. It can therefore be tested on the touchstone of Constitutionality. As a result, the apex court can review the practice of Triple Talaq. Having reached this conclusion, he tests the practice on the cornerstone of the Right to Equality guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution and finds that it violates the said right and, consequently, sets it aside as un-Constitutional.

At the end of the day, the practice of Triple Talaq has been set aside by the Supreme Court for different reasons. It is interesting that the majority judgment which has set it aside has not held that the Islamic law of divorce is unconstitutional or unfair. What has been held is that the practice of Triple Talaq is illegal, and to reach this conclusion, the Bench has not repelled the Islamic law of divorce but has, in fact, relied upon it.

It has found that the practice of Triple Talaq is un-Islamic and violates Islamic law itself. In that sense, the Court has actually recognised that true Islamic law is progressive and does not violate women’s rights ; only the un-Islamic practice of Triple Talaq does. Right-wing Muslim bashers who are rejoicing over the apex court having come down on the Shariat with a heavy hand need to hold their horses. Far from doing this, the apex court has actually fallen back on and relied upon the Shariat itself to accord justice to Muslim women by declaring the practice of Triple Talaq as illegal.

Though, in our peculiar social milieu, women’s rights cannot be ensured by judicial pronouncements alone, this judgment will surely go a long way in making a much-needed beginning. One only hopes that this judgment is not politicized by vested interests to defile and deface Islam and similar judgments are pronounced by the apex courts on other issues facing women and disadvantaged groups across religions.

"Keeping close watch on Infosys share price, says Sebi’s chief","Commenting on corporate governance, Tyagi said the 21-member committee on corporate governance, led by Uday Kotak, will submit its report by September-end. Commenting on corporate governance, Tyagi said the 21-member committee on corporate governance, led by Uday Kotak, will submit its report by September-end.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is keeping a close watch on the share price movement of Infosys Ltd, the market regulator’s chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Tuesday. “We are keeping a watch on Infosys share prices,” Tyagi told reporters after the meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council in the finance ministry.

Following resignation of its chief executive officer Vishal Sikka last week, shares of Infosys had crashed nearly 10 per cent on Friday, resulting in loss of Rs 22,500 crore of the market capitalisation of the company. On Saturday, the company had announced share buyback worth Rs 13,000 crore.

Commenting on corporate governance, Tyagi said the 21-member committee on corporate governance, led by Uday Kotak, will submit its report by September-end. The Sebi had in June set up a 21-member panel led by Kotak Mahindra Bank chairman Uday Kotak to advise it on issues relating to corporate governance in Indian firms.

On the issue of action against 331 alleged shell companies, Tyagi said that Sebi will continue to examine violations of securities laws and rules. “Wherever there is a violation of securities law, they have to be investigated and looked into irrespective of whether it is shell or whatever name you give them. One does not wait for any reference from anywhere,” he said.

Tyagi added the regulator will stick to the December deadline for linking Aadhaar with Know Your Customer norms for share trading accounts. Sebi has asked existing clients to submit the Aadhaar numbers to their brokers by December 31, while new clients must furnish the details within six months of starting the Demat account.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday chaired the 17th meeting of FSDC to take stock of challenges facing the economy, underscoring the need for keeping a constant vigil on them.

Anger boils over at Charlottesville council meeting,"Protesters yell during the Charlottesville City Council meeting. (Source: AP) Protesters yell during the Charlottesville City Council meeting. (Source: AP)

Anger boiled over at the first Charlottesville City Council meeting since a white nationalist rally in the city descended into violent chaos, with some residents screaming and cursing at councilors Monday night and calling for their resignations.

Scores of people packed the council’s chambers, and The Daily Progress reported Mayor Mike Signer was interrupted by shouting several times in the first few minutes of the meeting. As tensions escalated, the meeting was halted. Live video showed protesters standing on a dais with a sign that said, “Blood on your hands.”

After talking with members of the crowd, Councilor Wes Bellamy said the council would drop its agenda and focus on the crowd’s concerns, the newspaper reported.

Speakers, some yelling and hurling profanities, then took turns addressing the council, some expressing frustration that leaders had granted a permit for the Aug. 12 rally that had turned violent. Others criticized the police response to the event, which drew hundreds of white nationalists and other counter-protesters.

The two sides clashed violently in the street that day, largely uninterrupted by authorities, until the event was declared an unlawful assembly and the crowd was forced to disperse. Later, a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring 19 others. The death toll for the day climbed to three when a helicopter that had been monitoring the event and assisting with the governor’s motorcade crashed, killing two state troopers.

The event dubbed “Unite the Right” was sparked by the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Neither a city spokeswoman nor a Charlottesville police spokesman immediately responded to questions from The Associated Press about reports that three people were arrested Monday. At one point, the crowd chanted, “Signer must go.”

Elsewhere in Charlottesville, dozens of students rallied Monday night at the University of Virginia in rejection of the violence. Video of the event streamed by the newspaper on social media showed students marching on the stately grounds of Virginia’s flagship public university.

The event was billed as a “reclaim our grounds” rally and organizers said it was held to highlight the advances made at the university to end racism and discrimination in recent decades. The organizers also said via social media that they were seeking to send a message to the university leadership that more advances were still needed.

Earlier Monday, the man who authorities say drove his car into the crowd of counter-protesters Aug. 12 made a second court appearance. The Charlottesville Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office said James Alex Fields Jr., 20, appeared by video Monday. It was his first hearing on a second set of charges filed against him last week.

Senior assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Nina Antony says a judge declined for now to set bond for Fields, who has another hearing Friday. The charges against Fields include second-degree murder. In addition to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, police said, some of the 19 people injured when the crowd was rammed by the car suffered serious and permanent injuries. Fields’ attorney couldn’t immediately be reached.

"Free speech supporters: Outnumbered, but rally was a success","Thousands of demonstrators marched Saturday from the city’s Roxbury neighborhood to Boston Common, where the “Free Speech Rally” was held. (AP Photo) Thousands of demonstrators marched Saturday from the city’s Roxbury neighborhood to Boston Common, where the “Free Speech Rally” was held. (AP Photo)

Supporters of a small, conservative “free speech rally” held in Boston said that despite being outnumbered by tens of thousands of counter-protesters, their event was a success.

Demonstrators protesting against racism and white supremacy had descended upon historic Boston Common, dwarfing the rally’s few dozen attendees and leading to what appeared to be an abrupt end of the event. Less than an hour after rallygoers arrived, they were escorted out of the area by police, as boisterous counter-protesters scuffled with officers.

But event organisers, speakers, and participants say coverage of the event has been mischaracterised and that it accomplished its purpose to talk about the importance of free speech. “We were there to discuss the spectrum of American views,” said Dr Shiva Ayyadurai, who gave the keynote at the rally. Ayyadurai, a Cambridge technology entrepreneur who is seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic US Sen. Elizabeth Warren, added that the crowd was a politically and racially diverse group of mostly students.

In the days leading up to Saturday’s long-planned event, organisers publicly distanced themselves from the Aug. 12 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left a woman dead and many more injured. Addressing concerns that a similar event might come to Boston, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh had denounced “hate groups” that would potentially attend Saturday’s gathering.

But when asked about the atmosphere at the Parkman Bandstand on the Common where supporters gathered Saturday, participants described the opposite of what opponents had feared.

“I was holding one of the ‘Black Lives Do Matter’ signs,” said attendee April Sutherland, 25, of Seattle. Photos show the signs being held up as Ayyadurai is speaking. “It was powerful to have our voices heard. The police were very good at escorting us out (and) we were met with people who were so encouraging. Forty thousand people were objecting to something they didn’t realise was a lie.” Melissa Smith, 32, of Brookline, said she participated in the rally because free speech is important to her. “(The event) was very successful,” she said.

Despite multiple confrontations, fights breaking out and objects getting thrown at police, authorities touted the events as mostly peaceful, reporting a total of 33 arrests for disorderly conduct, assaulting a police officer and other offenses. Those arrested are expected in court this week. Officials say about 40,000 people attended.

The counter-demonstration received praise from Walsh, who said Boston “stood for peace and love” and President Donald Trump, who said the people in Boston were “speaking out” against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that “Our country will soon come together as one!”

My main aim is to fight for gold at Badminton World Championships: Carolina Marin,"Carolina Marin of Spain got a bye in the opening round. (Source: File) Carolina Marin of Spain got a bye in the opening round. (Source: File)

Eyeing her third title at Badminton World Championships, Carolina Marin said she is better prepared than Rio 2016 Olympics, where she won gold after beating India’s PV Sindhu in the final, and will fight for gold in Glasgow.

“It’s been two months of preparation; I’ve prepared better than I had before the Rio Olympics,” Marin told reporters in Glasgow.

“My main aim is to fight for gold. I have some tough matches coming up but I’m not thinking of the title defence. I will take it match by match.”

After the Rio high, Marin had to deal with thigh injury and conceded two walkovers during the period. She failed to win a title and saw her ranking dip to the number four position.

“The Olympics was a year ago. I have to forget that. After the Olympics, I had some injuries and couldn’t do well and it was frustrating. Now I’m playing well again,” said the former World No. 1.

Seeded third at Badminton World Championships, the Spaniard got a bye in the opening round and will commence her campaign against the winner of the match between Hong Kong’s Yip Pui Yin and Russia’s Natalia Perminova in the second round.

"It’s more difficult to bat at number three than playing as an opener, says Imrul Kayes","Imrul Kayes will play against Australia in upcoming two-match Test series. (Source: AP) Imrul Kayes will play against Australia in upcoming two-match Test series. (Source: AP)

Bangladesh will face Australia in a two-match Test series at home which is scheduled to begin from Sunday. The hosts are looking to make few changes in their batting line up and batsman Imrul Kayes might have to come in at number three position and talking about the same Kayes has said that he needs to adjust as he is more comfortable while playing as an opener than at three.

“I think it is more difficult to bat at number three than playing as an opener,” Imrul told reporters on Tuesday (August 22). “But I have to adjust with that. I batted at number three in the last Test match I played in Sri Lanka. I have talked with the coach and he told me to bat at number three. I have been batting in the nets keeping that in mind,” he added.

“I think the team management has a plan and that’s why I am at number three. Soumya has done a lot better at the opening position in the last few matches,” he said.

Kayes did admit that he is more comfortable as an opener but suggested that he would be ready to do whatever his team requires.

“I become very impatient to go to the field when I pad up for batting in the dressing room. Eventually, I have to adjust. If you tell Tamim to do similar kind of stuff, he won’t be able to do that. Once I could not do that, but I have to do it now for the sake of team’s requirement. I have to do whatever the team wants from me. I feel that I can bat in both positions either in number three or as an opener; I am ready to accept it,” Kayes told.

Talking about facing new ball, the batsman suggested when you bat at number three, bowlers become cautious and they control their line and length by the time

“There are both benefits and difficulties in facing the new ball. Bowlers don’t know about the strengths of a batsman, batsmen also don’t know what the bowlers can do. But when you bat at number three, bowlers become cautious and they control their line and length by the time,” he said.

Speaking about the choices that Bangladesh selectors now have, he said that it is a positive sign for Bangladesh cricket.

“It is a positive sign. It is really great for Bangladesh cricket to have a healthy competition in the team,” he said. “Team management can pick the best player if there is a competition around. I think it is very good for us and players will perform as well,” he added.

Though he accepted that he is more comfortable as an opener, Kayes looked confident about facing the Aussie pace attack.

“I have been playing international cricket for the last seven to eight years. I have played against South Africa and England as well. They also have the best pace attack. I survived against them, so I don’t think it will be difficult for me; I think I can play against the Aussie pace attack as well,” he said.

"Substitutes can play an important role in last few minutes of the match, says Pep Guardiola","Manchester City will be up against Everton at the Etihad stadium on Monday. (Source: Reuters) Manchester City will be up against Everton at the Etihad stadium on Monday. (Source: Reuters)

Manchester City will be up against Everton at the Etihad stadium on Monday. Ahead of the game, City boss Pep Guardiola said that for the club to win the title, the substitutes will play an important role, which can also help the club to clinch victories in last few minutes of the match.

“When the game is in the last 15 or 20 minutes, the opponent is tired and we’ve moved them during the game, and we can put in dynamic players… It’s a point where we can win games in the last minutes.”, Guardiola told British media.

City’s new signings of Bernardo Silva and Olarenwaju Kayode have added more strength to their attacking line-up. The club already has top-notch players like Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Leroy Sane.

With the title race beginning to heat up, Guardiola said that for every position in the side there will be tough competition among the players and also focused on the importance of substitutes in the side.

“Hopefully they will understand that at the big clubs you cannot have 11 players, so they have to compete with each other. In that kind of level in the Premier League, the people who are 12, 13, 14 and play in the game, they are so, so important.” Guardiola concluded.

"China’s second aircraft carrier to undergo trial soon, says report","Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Source: CCTV via AP Video) Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Source: CCTV via AP Video)

China’s second aircraft carrier is likely to start its first sea trials soon with the development to be presented as a key achievement of President Xi Jinping at the ruling Communist Party’s Congress expected to take place in October. The “key project” team has completed tasks ahead of schedule, Hu Wenming, the head and Party chief of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), the manufacturer of the Type 001A said. China has one aircraft carrier in operation now — the ‘Liaoning’, which went into commission in 2012. The Type 001A is the country’s first home-grown aircraft carrier.

The Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Corp (DSIC) where it was built will greet the 19th CPC National Congress by delivering key achievements on a special product in this special time,” DSIC Chairman Liu Zheng was quoted as saying by state-run Global Times on Wednesday.

The Congress which is held every five years is expected to be held in October here. Xi, 64, who is completing his five year tenure as party general secretary, President and head of the Army, is widely believed to get a second term.

As per the practice of the CPC, top leaders will have a ten year tenure.

Liu said all personnel working on the key project led by the CSIC will stick to the directions of Xi to provide world-class naval equipment for a world-leading navy.

The “special time” refers to the 19th Congress, which marks the opening of a new phase of China’s reforms. And the enhancement of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy’s combat capabilities is an important part of the country’s military reforms,” Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Daily.

Zhang Ye, a research fellow at the PLA Naval Research Institute said that if the Type 001A made in China can start its sea trials before the event, which is the last stage prior to turning the warship over to the navy, it would mark a huge step forward in China’s development of a stronger navy.

China has successfully tested the Type 001A’s power system and the carrier will undergo a mooring test in September ahead of schedule, meaning that the ship’s power system is all set.

Zhang said he believed part of the mooring test has already started even during the power test, so the mooring test period could be shorter than expected.

The schedule for the sea trials will depend on how long the mooring test takes, Zhang noted.

The sea trials will include an even more comprehensive performance test, which would cover the propelling and communications systems under different maritime conditions, which would usually take two years, Zhang said. He added the trials would not be limited to a specific weather condition.

“The Type 001A is an improved version of the Type 001 Liaoning, so the similarity and experience can largely speed things up,” Song Zhongping, a military expert who served in the Rocket (Missile Force) said.

China’s ‘Liaoning’ is a refurbished aircraft carrier built from the hull of a Soviet ship bought from Ukraine in 1998. Regarded as an experimental vessel, it is taking part in battle group exercises in different seas.

The second ship, Type 001A weighs about 70,000 tonnes, is 315 metres long, 75 metres wide and has a cruising speed of 31 knots.

Past talaq cases recalled by SC,"The Supreme Court of India The Supreme Court of India

SC judgment refers to several cases and court rulings

Rashid Ahmad v. Anisa Khatun

Privy Council, 1905

Ghiyas-ud-din pronounced triple talaq in 1905, in the presence of witnesses but in the absence of Anita Khatun. She challenged the divorce since she had not been present and because, even after that, they cohabited for 15 years and had 5 children until Ghiyas-ud-din’s death. The Privy Council upheld the triple talaq.

Jiauddin Ahmed v. Anwara Begum Gauhati High Court, 1981

Anwara Begum, who left her husband alleging torture, was granted maintenance by a magistrate court. Her husband Jiauddin contested it in Gauhati High Court, saying he had divorced her. The court ruled that talaq-e-biddat without reasonable cause, reconciliation attempts and involvement of arbitrators would not lead to a valid divorce, and upheld the order awarding maintenance.

Rukia Khatun v. Abdul K Laskar Gauhati High Court, 1981

Rukia Khatun alleged that Abdul Khalique Laskar abandoned and neglected her. He contested her claim for maintenance, asserting he had divorced her by way of talaq-e-biddat. Gauhati High Court listed several ingredients of a valid talaq. It held that triple talaq pronounced by Laskar did not satisfy these, concluded the marriage was subsisting, and held the wife to be entitled to maintenance.

Masroor Ahmed v. state (NCT Delhi) Delhi High Court, 2007

Aisha Anjum alleged that her husband’s family threw her out. Masroor Ahmed filed for restitution of conjugal rights, and she returned. She alleged that she later came to know that he had divorced her by talaq-e-biddat in the presence of her brothers. She said she would not have agreed to conjugal relations had she known of this, and accused Masroor of rape. Delhi HC held that triple talaq can be regarded as one revocable talaq, giving the husband an opportunity to revoke the same.

Nazeer v. Shemeema Kerala High Court, 2016

In a number of petitions where divorced persons had sought deletion of their ex-spouses’ names from their passports, Kerala High Court observed: “This case depicts the misuse of triple talaq, wife appears to have accepted the talaq and moved the court on a folly created by husband… It is for the subordinate court to decide whether there was application of Islamic law in effecting divorce by triple talaq…”

‘I Do What I Do’: Ex-RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan to publish book about ‘those turbulent but exciting times’,"Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan’s book ‘I do what I do’ will release in Chennai on September 5. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan’s book ‘I do what I do’ will release in Chennai on September 5.

Exactly one year after his term as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India came to an end, Raghuram Rajan is all set to publish a new book with his “commentary and speeches” to convey what it was like to be at the helm of the central bank in “those turbulent but exciting times”.

Titled, “I Do What I Do”, the book is published by HarperCollins India and will be launched in Chennai on September 5, followed by launches in Delhi and Mumbai on September 7 and 8, respectively.

“When Raghuram G. Rajan took charge as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in September 2013, the rupee was in free fall, inflation was high, India had a large current account deficit, and India’s exchange reserves were falling. As measure after measure failed to stabilise markets, speculators sensed a full-blown crisis and labelled India one of the Fragile Five economies.

“Rajan’s response was to go all out, not just to tackle the crisis of confidence, but also to send a strong message about the strength of India’s institutions and the country’s ongoing programme of reform. He outlined a vision that went beyond the immediate crisis to focus on long-term growth and stability, thus restoring investor confidence. Boldness and farsightedness would be characteristic of the decisions he took in the ensuing three years,” the publisher said in a statement.

In the book, Rajan is said to explain economic concepts in a readily accessible way. He also addresses key issues that are not in any banking manual but essential to growth: the need for tolerance and respect to assure India’s economic progress, for instance, or the connection between political freedom and prosperity.

“‘I Do What I Do’ offers a front-row view into the thinking of one of the world’s most respected economists, one whose commitment to India’s progress shines through in the essays and speeches here. It also brings home what every RBI Governor discovers for himself when he sits down at his desk on the 18th floor: the rupee stops here. Right here,” HarperCollins added.

Rajan was Governor of the Reserve Bank of India between 2013 and 2016 and also served as Vice Chairman of the Board of the Bank for International Settlements.

He has previously co-authored “Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists” with Luigi Zingales and wrote “Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy”, for which he was awarded the Financial Times-Goldman Sachs prize for best business book.

"Won’t attend meets if Sukhu present, says Virbhadra","CM Virbhadra said he had decided not to attend any more public or workers’ meetings in which Sukhu would be present. CM Virbhadra said he had decided not to attend any more public or workers’ meetings in which Sukhu would be present.

After attending a joint meeting with PCC president Sukhwinder Sukhu during AICC general-secretary Sushil Kumar Shinde’s four-day visit to Kangra, Mandi and Kullu, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has said he had chosen to go “ekla” (alone) in future.

During a Congress Legislature Party meeting on Monday ahead of the Assembly’s monsoon session, the CM said he had decided not to attend any more public or workers’ meetings in which Sukhu would be present.

During most of the Congress workers’ meetings attended by the CM and PCC president, the rift within the party had come out in the open, leaving little scope for meaningful deliberation on poll strategy and unity in the party ranks.

“I have decided: Ekla Chalo Re,” he told MLAs, raising grievances over how he was treated by some party leaders, including Transport Minister G S Bali, who had hosted a meeting in his constituency and coined the slogan of ‘raja to runk’ against him.

"The Judgment: ‘By a majority of 3:2, the practice of triple talaq is set aside’","Express Express

CJI J S Khehar, Justice S Abdul Nazeer call to consider legislation; injunction for now

“We have arrived at the conclusion that talaq-e-biddat is a matter of ‘personal law’ of Sunni Muslims… We have examined whether the practice satisfies the constraints provided for under Article 25 (freedom to practice and propagate religion), and have arrived at the conclusion that it does not breach any of them… We direct the Union of India to consider appropriate legislation… Till such time as legislation is considered, we are satisfied in injuncting Muslim husbands from pronouncing talaq-e-biddat… If the legislative process commences before the expiry of six months, and a positive decision emerges towards redefining talaq-e-biddat … or alternatively, if it is decided that the practice of talaq-e-biddat be done away with, the injunction would continue, till legislation is finally enacted. Failing which, the injunction shall cease to operate.”

Justice Kurian Joseph

‘Can’t be any constitutional protection to such a practice’

“The simple question that needs to be answered in this case is only whether triple talaq has any legal sanctity… The Holy Quran has attributed sanctity and permanence to matrimony. However, in extremely unavoidable situations, talaq is permissible. But an attempt for reconciliation and if it succeeds, then revocation are the Quranic essential steps before talaq attains finality. In triple talaq, this door is closed, hence, triple talaq is against the basic tenets of the Holy Quran and consequently, it violates Shariat…

I find it extremely difficult to agree with the learned Chief Justice that the practice of triple talaq has to be considered integral to the religious denomination in question and that the same is part of their personal law… Merely because a practice has continued for long, that by itself cannot make it valid if it has been expressly declared to be impermissible.

The whole purpose of the 1937 Act [Muslim Personal Law Shariat Application Act, 1937] was to declare Shariat as the rule of decision and to discontinue anti-Shariat practices… which include talaq… Hence, there cannot be any Constitutional protection to such a practice and thus, my disagreement with the learned Chief Justice for the constitutional protection given to triple talaq.

I believe that a reconciliation [between religion and constitutional rights] is possible, but the process of harmonising different interests is within the powers of the legislature. Of course, this power has to be exercised within the constitutional parameters without curbing the religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India. However, it is not for the Courts to direct for any legislation.

Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Uday Umesh Lalit

‘Law must be struck down (where) it enforces triple talaq’

Stating that triple talaq is instant and irrevocable and would prevent any attempt at reconciliation between husband and wife, Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Uday Umesh Lalit ruled, “This form of talaq must, therefore, be held to be violative of the fundamental right contained under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In our opinion, therefore, the 1937 Act, insofar as it seeks to recognise and enforce triple talaq, is within the meaning of the expression ‘laws in force’ in Article 13(1) and must be struck down as being void to the extent that it recognises and enforces triple talaq.

Since we have declared Section 2 of the 1937 Act [Muslim Personal Law Shariat Application Act, 1937] to be void to the extent indicated above on the narrower ground of it being manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of discrimination in these cases.”

Autumn of the Patriarch,"Actor Naseeruddin Shah in scene from the play The Father. Actor Naseeruddin Shah in scene from the play The Father.

About a year ago, Naseeruddin Shah received a call from Paresh Rawal, who was overwhelmed by the theatrical production of French playwright Florian Zeller’s The Father that he watched during a trip to America. Rawal had even managed to obtain a copy of the play. However, before handing it over to Shah, the actor-turned parliamentarian wished to extract the promise that the former would direct this play. Shah, who recounts this with a chuckle, says, “When I read it, I was totally floored. On the surface, it is a family drama. But it is the study of a man who used to be perfectly normal, healthy, reasonable and authoritative. His daughter hero-worshipped him. He has reached a stage when he is dependent on others. The play examines his deterioration”.

Shah, who recounts this with a chuckle, says, “When I read it, I was totally floored. On the surface, it is a family drama. But it is the study of a man who used to be perfectly normal, healthy, reasonable and authoritative. His daughter hero-worshipped him. He has reached a stage when he is dependent on others. The play examines his deterioration”.

Once Shah decided to create a theatrical production of The Father by his group Motley, the first thing he did was to call up Khushroo Suntook, chairman of the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai, and book its Experimental Theatre for the month of September. Next, he booked Mumbai’s Prithvi Theatre from October 21 to November 17. While performing at Experimental Theatre, The Father team would take a break once a week; at Prithvi it would have an uninterrupted run. Such a long outing of an experimental play is unusual in India, where after the play’s opening, there is often a long interval between the shows. Worse, many productions close after about 20 shows. So, for Shah, The Father’s two-month run is a dream come true. “Ever since my dream of becoming a professional actor crystallized, and even before that happened, I had read that plays in the West sometimes ran for years. It seemed too good to be true that the actors in these plays trod the boards every single night,” he says.

There have been many plays and movies about people suffering from Alzheimer’s. What’s most interesting for Shah is that the play is a “tragic farce”. According to Shah, who plays the character of Andre, an Alzheimer’s patient living with his daughter and son-in-law, the drama, rather than creating sympathy in the audience for the central character, acquaints them with what’s going on in his mind. When Shah read the play, he had a vision for it: there will be no sets or entries and exits. Just a ground plan of two rooms and a door demarcated on the floor. The props are imaginary too. The director-actor hoped to create a kind of disjointed reality. He has also done away with the traditional proscenium setting. “The audience will be seated on all four sides,” says the 68-year-old thespian when we meet during the lunch break at the rehearsals’ space in Yashwantrao Centre in Mumbai.

Is the form of the play Motley’s big experiment? Or, is it the decision to stage it every evening? “Both,” says Shah and adds, “I’m certain about the experiments with the production. In acting classes, we do a lot of

exercises of imagination. When the action of handling an imaginary object is performed correctly, you will never find a disagreement among the observers as to what this actor was doing,” he says, and to demonstrate it he takes a gulp from an imaginary cup of tea. “If you can stimulate the audience’s imagination, there is no magic like that on stage,”

he adds.

The play itself has a disconnected narrative. The scenes jump back and forth. Yet, Shah believes that it won’t be difficult for the audience to follow what’s happening. “They will be left with the feeling that they don’t know what happened. That’s what any family that has an Alzheimer patient feels,” says Shah. He adds, “It is the form that fascinated me. It was not the temptation to essay the role of an Alzheimer’s patient. Otherwise, I could have done King Lear, which is a study of Alzheimer’s in a way.”

Is The Father a commercially viable option to have a long run? “The nature of this play is such that I want the actors to be completely focussed. It requires a lot of concentration as their actions have to match the corresponding sound. For example, there will be no bottle or glass but the sound of wine being poured,” he says, adding that the play’s lighting is “very critical”. He is confident that the cast will benefit immensely from the experience of doing a show every evening. “This is an experience I wish to create even though I might lose a lot of money,” he says. The play, co-directed by Ratna Pathak Shah, features her in the cast along with Heeba Shah, Saahil Vaid, Bhavna Pani, Aahana Kumra, Neeraj Kabi, Faisal Rashid and Trishla Patel.

Though the play is disturbing, Shah is confident that it would make for “a very dramatic evening of theatre”. On a

lighter vein, the thespian hopes to survive the next two months of demanding theatre as his role is not double cast, unlike other characters. After The Father’s November run, he wants to take up something lighter. Most likely, he will work on Ismat Apa Ke Naam 3. “I have already zeroed in on three of Ismat Chughtai’s stories for the new show. This show would be about joyous storytelling.”

Delhi HC dismisses plea of Justice Karnan against contempt of law,"Justice CS Karnan (Source: File photo) Justice CS Karnan (Source: File photo)

The Delhi High Court today dismissed a plea of jailed former Calcutta High Court judge C S Karnan challenging the constitutional validity of the Contempt of Courts Act. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said the petition, challenging the Supreme Court’s decision holding him in contempt and sending him to jail for six months, was “completely misdirected and untenable”.

“The writ petition laying such challenge before us is misconceived for the same reason and has to be rejected,” it said. The bench further said the constitutionality of the contempt law cannot be challenged in the instant case as the apex court “had not exercised power under the Contempt of Courts Act but invoked its inherent jurisdiction under Article 129 (to initiate matters on its own) of the Constitution”.

The high court in its 30-page verdict also said that if the apex court’s Registrar had refused to receive Karnan’s petition against the May 9 decision holding him in contempt, then he could have appealed against this as provided in the Supreme Court Rules. “The petitioner, therefore, had an efficacious alternate remedy available to him by way of an appeal prescribed under the Rules and has admittedly failed to invoke the same,” it said.

Karnan’s lawyer, Mathews J Nedumpara, had argued before the high court that the May 9 order was passed without following the principles of natural justice.

The high court rejected this contention, saying that “the record establishes that the petitioner was given more than ample opportunity to file his response”. “He was afforded at least three opportunities to tender his response, on February 8, March 31 as well as on May 1. Instead of availing the opportunities and doing so (tender his response), the petitioner resorted to passing orders against judges of the Supreme Court and making further contumacious statements to the press, as have been noted in the order of May 1,” the bench said.

The high court also said that “the petitioner was served with the notice to show cause. He was given repeated and adequate opportunity to present his defence. “The petitioner’s communications, orders and conduct establish that he had full knowledge of the orders of the court, proceedings as well as the material against him.”

The bench said the instant issue did not pertain to an illiterate or impoverished person, but an individual who was “legally trained” and was “an adjudicator holding a constitutional position”.

“The submission that principles of natural justice were not complied with is clearly not borne out from the record,” it added. Nedumpara had also argued that Karnan was under no legal obligation to file a response and was entitled to maintain silence.

To this, the high court has said, “Unfortunately, the petitioner did not remain silent.” The bench noted that Karnan, instead of filing a response before the court, chose to make public declarations of his defence and issued orders against the proceedings before the apex court. “In view of the above discussion, we find no merit in this writ petition which is hereby dismissed,” it said.

Bollywood actress Diana Penty walked the ramp for Hyderabad-based designer Shriya Bhupal who unveiled her collection ‘Vignette Vista’ under her label Shriya Som on Sunday.

The designer narrated a tale of wilderness with elegance that was suave, which was clearly visible in the detailed presentation.



Diana Penty looked radiantly stunning as she strutted down the ramp in a structured, ball-room worthy, floral, ivory gown with intricate detail.

The garments were conventional yet trendy; and ranged from body-con creations, shifts, and midi dresses with ruffle detail to cropped top, power suits, exaggerated gowns, power-shoulder top teamed with a fish tail skirt, faux fur jackets.

Experimentation in pastel hues was seen with the use of ivory, blush pink and tones of grey to bring the attires alive. Feathers incorporated with bugle and minute beads, stones, sequins, crystals and fine silk thread composed exquisite and exaggerated motifs served as the soul of this ingenious composition.

Designer Sonaakshi Raaj's collection spells ultra-glam looks on the ramp and the designer’s latest offering ‘Skin’ at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 was just that. It was a modern yet slightly whimsical look as the designer presented a peep show with the very unconventionally embellished PVC.

The colour palette spoke glamour, from rose gold, crimson to champagne, smoke grey and charcoal black. And showstopper Pooja Hegde walked the ramp in an embellished gold jumpsuit with a trail, looking like an absolute diva while doing it.

The show opened with Indian singer and multi-instrumentalist Raghav Sachar who performed some foot-tapping songs and grooved around the models with music that elevated the mood on the runway with soulful trumpet melodies.



Making a strong fashion statement on the catwalk was the one-shoulder, black asymmetric drape teamed wonderfully with a white corset and tantalizing sheer yoke.

The seductive drapes wove magic around the graceful models’ figures as tulle, blended georgette; fringing and ornate embellishments were the cynosure of the garments.



Using PVC in a truly innovative style, Sonaakshi ensured that the ‘Skin’ collection was a mélange of various genres of fashion. Moving from street wear to high fashion accents, the ensembles were ideal for all style setters.

The all-black dhoti inspired sari with a matching cropped blouse offered a PVC peep show at the hem. Grecian drama appeared for the one-sleeved asymmetric white pant/gown while dazzle was the focal point for the off-shoulder sleek maxi with floor length cape sleeves.

At Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, ‘Aiyana’ (ever blooming) presented by Amoh by Jade was their take on reviving the cult fashion of the 60’s and 70’s eras, with a rather inventive approach in terms of construction and presentation.

Bollywood debutant Nidhi Agerwal of ‘Munna Michael’ fame opened the show in a embroidered lehenga with a backless cropped blouse and pleasantly surprised the audience. While pop- culture, youth icon, Ananya Birla took the stage, while sporting a look from the collection and performed her hit number ‘Meant to Be’ alongside the models and received the loudest cheer from the crowd.

The silhouettes ranged from well-tailored corsets and capes to floor length sheer jackets with scallop detail teamed with flared skirts and inventive drapes with cowl detailing. The bold palette consisting of tangerine, royal blue, ox-blood, mauve, chestnut, bottle green and a hint of gold elevated the collection.

Monica and Karishma of Jade portrayed the various layers of a woman’s personality, defining her flaws and depth with grace and artistry through their extremely innovative pieces for their collection ‘Aiyana’.

The ensembles were delicately ornamented with beads, stones in intricate patterns and motifs, which highlighted the regal essence of the sharply conceived line.

The sustainable fabrics were used to create these majestic attires with added textures (ruffles, pleats) that enhanced the oomph factor.

Inspired by the colours and fashion of the Byzantine period, which was seen during the Roman Empire, designer Jayanti Reddy brought the razzle-dazzle of the past onto the catwalk. The ensembles worked wonders in accentuating women’s curves with fitted and flared shapes.

Aditi Rao Hydari turned showstopper for her in a black full-flared lehenga, maxi Anarkali style jacket, soft gold bandeau blouse and dupatta, all embroidered in golden hues and looked like a Byzantine period princess.

The rich fabrics like silks, velvets and tulles were ideal for the creations but it was the construction and the colours that were the focal point of the garments. Deep hues of smoky grey, rich mustard, royal blue, elegant mauve, hot pink, pastel teal and dramatic black, gave intense style directions to the garments.

There was a variety of silhouettes with lehengas, jackets, shararas, blouses, shawls, tunics and pants. Numerous blouses offered a fashion twist - either asymmetric hemline, peplum fits or were teamed with full-length jackets. Heavy ruffles and exaggerated tassels added to the royal element in the collection.

Divya Reddy made a strong fashion statement when she declared ‘green’ as the new black, at 6Degree Studio during Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Gearing her designs to ethical, ecological, sustainable fashion, her collection ‘Sage’ projected a harmonious peaceful vibe.

In true show stopper fashion, the critically acclaimed actress, Tapsee Pannu wore the hottest shade of pink. Wearing a stunning floor-length, long-sleeved, intricately, embellished jacket over a sheer delicately embroidered piece, her outfit was a definite trendsetter for women who want to make their mark in the crowd and look glamorous.

The USP of Divya’s collection was the fabric, which had a great fashion story. The Kolam tribe in the Kawal forest collected the cocoons after the flight of the butterflies. These were turned into exquisite silk, spun by using double spun technique, where the broken strands are double spun and stuck together to create strong silk yarn with a slubby nature called Madhepur Tussar. The deep moss green hue was a constant for most ensembles.

ayered, frilled, maxi skirts were worn with matching body-hugging, long-sleeved, embroidered cholis with flouncy cuffs; while the modern version of the lehenga with abstract work and graduating yellow, brown, blue, maroon, striped, hemline looked stunning with an embellished fan-sleeved cropped top. Sheer and bell-sleeves teamed with heavy oxidised pieces of chunky jewellery gave the silhouettes that extra touch of perfection.

Kusum and Karishma Luharuwal for their label Faabiiana presented a mélange of unconventional textiles with their collection “Desert Rose” at the Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Bringing the glow in the dark elements, the silhouettes were inspired by moody, moonlit florals mesmerizingly blended with hues of ash rose and blush to show the lighter side of the day.

The lovely Dia Mirza left the audience in awe when she walked the ramp in a fully embroidered deep ‘V’ neck, floor-length Chikankari jacket and ghaghra with perfect Gota work.

Grandeur and glamour came alive on the ramp as breathtaking supreme craftsmanship was entwined with the garments that spoke a language of the Rajasthani royalty and its magnificence. Offering the New Age woman a fashion option that was experimental yet timeless were unconventional, understated yet classic silhouettes that added a tinge of romanticism to the designs.

Fashion took an interesting path as delicate zardosi was intricately fused with Mukaish, Chikankari, Gota, Aari work to showcase a pleasant blend of fashion and earthly glamour. The colours merged seamlessly as dusty shades of ash rose; blush came alive with olive green and slate grey.

Highlighting the similarities between the ensembles and the season the idea showed “growth and fall” in a mesmerizing manner, Ruchi Roongta and Rashi Agarwal for their label ‘Ruceru’ offered a collection “The Fallen Leaves” that was flamboyant yet eccentric on Day 5.

The classy Bollywood actor from the hit movie ‘Toilet’ Bhumi Pednekar graced the ramp in a red floral, embroidered Ghaghra. The merger of the sleeve with the bodice and honey combed embroidery along the hem, complemented the ensemble.

Putting embellishments to a minimal so as to allow each piece to stand out as a work of art by itself, the designers opted for fluid fabrics like silk, tissue, Chanderi, Habutai, raw silks and silk organza. Fabrics were dyed in autumn colour palette like beige, brown, olive and warm red that gave the garments an edgy and intriguing appeal.

An interesting and unique concept was the blending of the sleeves with the bodice, dupatta and lehenga. Honey combed embroidery and fringes on the silhouettes spoke of a trend setting look. Deriving its surface development techniques along with its colour palette from nature, the range aimed to depict emotions – raw and unaltered by using silhouettes for a canvas.

Nancy Luharuwalla’s label ‘De Belle’ presented an exciting and innovative but totally wearable women’s wear collection “Allure By De Belle” at the 6Degree Studio. Inspired from an early era of 1950’s, the line aimed at making the woman of today as beautiful as she envisaged it.

Blending western and Indian designs with textile fabrics were a range of silhouettes with tenderness and softness in them to make them look glamorous. The gorgeous Bollywood actor, Illeana D’Cruz graced the ramp in a black off- shoulder, full-flared dress with floor-kissing sleeves. Bold floral motifs mesmerizingly added the right touches of glamour.

A touch of the retro revolution was witnessed as trench coats, short jackets with puff sleeves, boleros, waistcoats and extreme shoulders with oxidized embroidery made their classy and bold attempt on the ramp.

Enthralling the audience with her stunning fashion offerings, the fabrics used were raw silk and crêpe alongside a treasure trove of sari jackets that derived their inspiration from great Ancient history. The silhouettes came alive in a riot of pastel colours ranging from aqua marine, baby pink and moving onto darker shades like forest green and deep wine.

Hardika Gulati presented a line of silhouettes with high-octane creativity that will set the look for the coming season with its mystical yet dramatic appeal.



Inspired by mythological characters, specifically the human traits of love, courage, valour, righteousness, hatred, revenge and violence, the collection, focused on “Sita” and “Draupadi” renowned as the icons of Indian womanhood.

Gorgeous Kiara Advani from the blockbuster film ‘M S Dhoni’, wore a black fitted dress with a layered, textured and structured bodice. The floor - length cape sleeves were a perfect addition to this fierce yet mesmerizingly appealing silhouette.

With silhouettes inspired by the 1960’s the range showcased striking ensembles that matched the Avant-garde look. Creating a blend of new techniques and classics, were suiting textured fabrics like checks with a woollen blend progressing to Neoprene."

Lack of generosity from spouse drives women to be unfaithful: Survey,"As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images) As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images)

Once the wooing stage is over and the couple has settled down, some men become far less generous and downright stingy. This leads to most women becoming unfaithful to their partners, according to a survey. Gleeden, a European dating site for married individuals, catering to people seeking affairs outside their relationships, conducted a research on 5,000 Indian women users of the dating site who belong to the age group of 23-35 years.

According to the study, married women do not ask to be showered with gifts, but they do appreciate being looked after and valued. As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue.

Most women link infidelity to the lack of generosity from their husbands. Around 69 per cent women think that the lack of sweet words, tenderness, small gestures and initiatives is because their spouse is cheating on them or is in the process.

To explain their own infidelity as a result of their spouse’s ignorant behaviour, 39 per cent of the women members stated that it was their need to feel valued.

Around 29 per cent women admitted their self-esteem is hurt when their spouse does not make sufficient effort. Over a quarter of them declared that stinginess has suppressed their desire for their spouse, and that they consider this defect to be a real romance killer.

“We are delighted to see the increasing number of Indian users in our site and how encounters outside marriage is no more a taboo or something to be shy about in India. In this survey, we have seen what could be the reason for the women to move out from their marital bond to find new encounters,” Solène Paillet, head of communications and a manager at Gleeden, said in a statement.

“The company’s aim is not only to bring members together but to anticipate their expectations and needs and providing them with reliable content, a high-quality interface and many innovative services and I believe, this survey gave us a ray of hope to provide more tempting services to our users,” Paillet added.

Armed group stopping migrant boats leaving Libya,"July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. (Source: AP) July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. (Source: AP)

An armed group is stopping migrant boats from setting off across the Mediterranean from a city west of Tripoli that has been a springboard for people smugglers, causing a sudden drop in departures over the past month, sources in the area said. The revelation throws new light on the sharp reduction in migrant arrivals from Italy, which took over from the Aegean route as the main focus of European concerns in the crisis.

Arrivals in Italy from North Africa, the main route for migration to Europe this year, dropped by more than 50 percent in July from a year earlier, and August arrivals so far are down even further. July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. Sources in Sabratha, 70 km (45 miles) west of the capital, said the sudden drop had been caused by a new force in the seaside city, which is preventing migrants from leaving, often by locking them up.

The group in Sabratha “works on the ground, the beach, to prevent the migrants leaving on boats towards Italy,” said a civil society organiser from the city, speaking on condition of anonymity. The group is made up of several hundred “civilians, policemen, army figures,” he said. It is conducting a “very strong campaign” that was launched by a “former mafia boss”, said a second Sabratha source who follows smuggling activity closely. A third source with contacts in Libya, who also asked not to be named, said the Sabratha group was making “a significant effort to police the area”. The two Sabratha sources said the group was running a detention centre for migrants who are turned back or taken from smugglers. One sent a picture of hundreds of migrants sitting in the sand in front of a high wall.

One of the sources said he thought the group was seeking legitimacy and financial support from Tripoli, where European states have tried to partner with a U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) to stem migrant flows. An official from the interior ministry’s department for combating illegal migration in Sabratha did not respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to contact the group, which the third source said was called Brigade 48, although other sources did not confirm this. Italy has been trying to bolster the GNA’s ability to stop people smuggling with cash, training and by sending a ship to help repair Tripoli’s coastguard and navy vessels. Some 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by sea from North Africa since 2014, testing the country’s ability to cope. More than 12,000 have died trying.

Most leave from Libya’s western coast. Following a local backlash against smugglers in Zuwara in the west in 2015, Sabratha became the most frequently used departure point. Italy wants to replicate a deal with Libya that the EU struck with Turkey last year, largely shutting down the migrant route through Greece and the Balkans. With a national election looming during the first half of next year, the government in Rome is under pressure to show it can stop, or at least slow, migration.

But any progress in Libya is likely to be fragile, with the country in a state of conflict since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted six years ago. Rival governments are vying for power and local militias battle each other for territory and smuggling profits. Last week Italy seized on the drop in arrivals, with Interior Minister Marco Minniti saying he saw a “light at the end of the tunnel”.

LEAVING POINT SHIFTS

Migrants rescued last week in the Mediterranean confirmed that conditions had changed in Sabratha, according to a spokesman at the International Organization for Migration, which interviewed migrants who arrived in Trapani, Sicily, on Saturday. “They said that it was very difficult to depart from Sabratha. There are people stopping the boats before they set out, and if they get out to sea they’re immediately sent back,” said Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesman in Rome. Some migrants were also turned back before reaching Sabratha, he said. The European Union’s border control agency Frontex last week said “clashes in Sabratha” contributed to July’s decline, also citing changeable weather and increased Libyan coastguard presence. The Sabratha sources were not aware of any clashes.

Another shift in recent weeks has been a clampdown on smuggling of Bangladeshi and North African migrants through Tripoli’s Mitiga airport, after a militia that controlled the trade was forced out by a GNA-aligned armed group at the start of July, Libyan and European officials said. But that, like a slowing of flows into Libya through Niger, might take time to take effect. Hundreds of thousands of migrants are already in Libya. In Sabratha, the changes may not stick. In the past, with no central authority to constrain them, smugglers have adapted and routes have shifted, as already is happening.

Last week smugglers moved departures to east of Tripoli, near Al Khoms, Chris Catrambone, co-founder of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) charity, told Reuters. Three large rubber boats set out from the east, he said, while only a small boat with 26 people was found west of Tripoli. “The sea was like a lake last week and yet there were few boats,” Catrambone said. Everyone on the Phoenix, a rescue vessel operated by MOAS, was taken aback because it was so unusual, he said.

The GNA has little control over armed groups in western Libya, including the capital, and none over factions that control the east of the country. The civil society member from Sabratha said the new group there might stop working if it does not receive support from Tripoli. The power of the smuggling networks would not be broken until there was a “legitimate source of order” in Libya, said a senior diplomat, speaking of the change in Tripoli airport and comparing the situation to broken vase. “In one corner we stuck it together, but everything else is in pieces.”

Women hail Supreme Court verdict on ‘triple talaq’,"Representational purpose. Representational purpose.

Several women on Wednesday celebrated the Supreme Court ruling striking down the practice of ‘triple talaq’ among Muslims at the Telangana BJP office at Hyderabad. They congratulated state BJP president K Laxman by offering sweets and flower bouquets, the BJP said in a release. A victim of ‘triple talaq’ said “Her marriage would have been saved and her one year daughter’s life secured had the verdict come three months ago,” the release said.

Speaking on the occasion, Laxman said the verdict is not a victory or defeat of anyone but it is the Constitutional rights of the women that were upheld.

In a path-breaking verdict, the apex court on Tuesday banned the 1,400-year-old practice of instant ‘triple talaq’ among Sunni Muslims and set it aside on several grounds including that it was against the basic tenets of the Holy Quran and violated the Islamic law Shariat.

Voting rights of MC nominated Councillors: HC to pronounce judgment,"A division bench of the High Court comprising acting Chief Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan will pronounce the judgment on the two petitions filed by former Municipal Councillor Satinder Singh and PIL activist advocate Hari Chand Arora in the morning. A division bench of the High Court comprising acting Chief Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan will pronounce the judgment on the two petitions filed by former Municipal Councillor Satinder Singh and PIL activist advocate Hari Chand Arora in the morning.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday will pronounce its judgement on the validity of voting rights provided to the nominated members of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation. A division bench had reserved its judgment on the cases challenging the voting rights on July 19.

A division bench of the High Court comprising acting Chief Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan will pronounce the judgment on the two petitions filed by former Municipal Councillor Satinder Singh and PIL activist advocate Hari Chand Arora in the morning. The petitioners have challenged the voting right to the nominated members saying it is contrary to the provisions of law and the right to vote by the members tilts the balance against the wishes of the electorate.

There are a total number of 26 elected councillors in the corporation and nine nominated councillors. The petitioners in the case have challenged the provisions of Section 4(3)(ii) of the Punjab Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, as extended to Chandigarh. The provisions entitle the nominated councillors to cast their vote in the meetings of the corporation.

FC Goa today confirmed the signing of Spanish winger Manuel Lanzarote for the upcoming season of the Hero Indian Super League, becoming Sergio Lobera’s sixth foreign recruit.

The winger who was last plying his trade for Real Zaragoza in the second division of Spain.

A product of the La Masia, Lanzarote largely operates from the right wing but can also play in a more central attacking midfield position and on the wide left. With over 35 goals in the top two divisions of Spanish football, Lanzarote brings a wealth of experience with him and is expected to play a vital part in the Gaurs’ charge for the title.

Having spent a majority of his career in Spain with the likes of Zaragoza, Espanyol, Deportivo Alaves and Eibar among a few, this will be Lanzarote’s second foray outside of Spain having previously turned out for Asteras Tripolis in Greece where he was a part of their Europa League campaign.

Having beaten several ISL clubs in the race to his signature, the Goan club will be hopeful Lanzarote can reproduce his form from the previous season where he scored six goals and assisted a further eight in Zaragoza’s campaign.

With Lanzarote’s signature, FC Goa’s compliment of foreigners is now upto six having signed the likes of Bruno Pinheiro, Ahmed Jahouh, Ferran Corominas, Manuel Arana and Sergio Juste previously.

Sunil Joshi roped in by Bangladesh for Australia series,"Sunil Joshi (left) was coaching the senior Assam side earlier. (Source: Express Archive) Sunil Joshi (left) was coaching the senior Assam side earlier. (Source: Express Archive)

Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) have availed the services of former India left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi for their upcoming series against Australia with the first Test starting on Sunday. Joshi would help the Bangladesh team as a spin bowling consultant. Joshi will be flying out to Dhaka soon to join up with the side in their quest to beat Australia in the two-Test series.

“I am just going to Bangladesh for two Test matches. I will be helping them out with the spin department,” said Joshi to The Hindu, who played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs for India.

The prospect of Joshi aiding the Bangladesh spinners would become additionally interesting given Australia have brought in S. Sriram to aid their spinners.

The development was confirmed by a BCB official who said, “He (Joshi) is expected to arrive in Dhaka soon and the preparations will begin for the first Test. Bangladesh has been looking for a spin consultant for a while and Mr Joshi will help strengthen our support staff.”

“He has currently been hired for the two-match series against Australia and a decision on future assignments will be taken after a meeting with the BCB members,” the official was quoted as saying by CricketNext.

Bangladesh had been on the look out for a spin bowling consultant following Australian leggie Stuart McGill’s decision to turn down the position due to illness.

The way back home: Will we ever be the India that was envisioned?,"The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it. The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it.

Reena Kallat Synapse, Single channel video projection, 2011

Studies say that the eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it and no two people see anything exactly alike. We create meaning through a mental bridge that the mind forms to complete gaps.

My video Synapse is an ironic play on legibility, where we witness 14 individuals’ attempts at reading the letters on a Snellen chart at an ophthalmologist’s clinic. The traditional Snellen (eye chart), meant to measure visual acuity, in this case happens to have been replaced by a variation comprising the fragmented letters of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, which commences with “We the people of India…” Each person tries to make sense of the alphabets before them with hesitations and uncertainties, interrupted recurrently with change of lenses and monotonous questions regarding clarity of vision. Their pauses seem less about the limitations of their vision, and, instead, appear to metaphorically demonstrate an ordinary citizen’s blurred view of the most inclusive document of the nation.

Some of these ideas have preoccupied me for years and I’ve made several works that refer to the Preamble of the Constitution of India to examine our role as citizens vis-a-vis the republic. Through this video I made in 2011, I reflect upon our own limitations in understanding our responsibilities that come along with the freedom promised through the Constitution and how we choose to interpret it. Nearly 70 years after the fundamental principles of the Constitution were first laid down, we are far from having achieved these values. Fulfilling these can, perhaps, only be made possible if we collectively strive towards attaining them rather than allowing ourselves to be divided as a people, by being fooled into believing that these would be provided for.

Samit Das, Bibliography in Progress, 2016

History depends on archaeology and its excavation, on myths and archives. For a long time now, I have been looking at history not just as an unchangeable culture or a particular person’s assumption/ studies, but as a documentation of the growth process of society through a contemporary approach. History should be open for everyone to understand and interpret.

It is the same with art. One cannot be contemporary if one denies history. In the series ‘Bibliography in Progress’, I have looked at the Harappan civilization and I am working with images from the Constitution of India for another set. I attained a copy of the Illustrated Constitution published in 2000/2001, and am looking at the illustrations done by Nandalal Bose and his students. It is difficult to say if we are the India that our Constitution promised — there are various dimensions, and, something might be right according to one person and wrong according to other. All of these point to a multi-layered thought process intrinsic to a democracy.

Venkat Shyam, Freedom, acrylic on canvas, 2016

We have a long way to go before we become the India that was envisioned, where everyone is equal and enjoys liberty and justice. This particular work discusses gender equality and shows a woman walking hand-in-hand with a man. We speak of equality between men and women, but that is hardly a reality. A woman has to carry the burden of household responsibilities, despite whatever work she does outside her home. In this image, she has the globe inside her, representing the universe, but also a scorpion crawling on her, depicting her daily struggles.

LN Tallur, Eraser Pro, bronze, 2012

We are living in times when personal greed is overtaking the ideas that our society was built on. This erasure is, of course, incomplete, dependent as it is on the demands of that hour. For instance, we save things on the computer, but when we want to remove the data from the hard disk, maintaining privacy is not as simple as it may have seemed at first. The first thought is that when you “delete” the file, the data is gone. Not quite — it only removes the reference of the file from the file system table. The file remains on the disk and can be retrieved. Similarly, we are aware of the values and principles that we have inherited, but are choosing to ignore them.

Riyas Komu, Fourth World, terracotta installation, 2017

The Lion Capital from the Buddhist tradition is one of the best images any nation can have to represent its diversity, multiculturalism and secularism. It represents the four dimensions that India as a country has always upheld, and that is something I have always enjoyed in the symbolism.

We are getting a feeling that this symbolism is crumbling. The four dimensions represent the “unity in diversity” that our Constitution enshrines. Though we do not see the fourth dimension, its presence is there, always unified with the other three and that was the strength of this republic. Conceptually, when this unity breaks, when we are no longer able to rely on the unseen fourth dimension, that’s when the anxieties of the State, and political and administrative processes surface. We’re excluded from these, making it easier for power structures to erase cultural differences and instill ideas of homogenisation in its citizens.

"SC verdict raises questions on fundamental rights, other forms of talaq","Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq in Mumbai on Tuesday. Prashant Nadkar Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq in Mumbai on Tuesday. Prashant Nadkar

While the petitioners were happy with the setting aside of instant triple talaq, the Muslim clergy took comfort in the safeguarding of personal laws, but certain issues in the three judgments appeared as grey areas. “We have also come to the conclusion that the practice being a component of ‘personal law’ has the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution,” read the minority judgment by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Justice Abdul Nazeer.

However, the injunction to suspend the “practice” despite admitted protection of fundamental rights under Article 25 of the Constitution for a period of six months had one lawyer-politician asking how it could be suspended if it was indeed recognised as a fundamental right. Justice Kurian Joseph in his judgment expressed “serious doubts” over the injunction of a fundamental right.

“Till such time as legislation in the matter is considered, we are satisfied in injuncting Muslim husbands from pronouncing ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as a means for severing their matrimonial relationship. The instant injunction, shall in the first instance, be operative for a period of six months,” read the minority judgment.

Likewise, the majority judgment of Justice Rohinton Nariman and Justice U U Lalit, which got support from Justice Joseph, who wrote a separate judgment, also got many ruling party members wondering about its long-term import. “It is at this point that it is necessary to see whether a fundamental right has been violated by the 1937 Act insofar as it seeks to enforce Triple Talaq as a rule of Law in the Courts in India,” read the judgment by Justice Nariman and Justice Lalit. Their judgment goes on to conclude that it falls foul of the fundamental right to equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution.

“In our opinion, therefore, the 1937 Act, insofar as it seeks to recognise and enforce Triple Talaq, is within the meaning of the expression ‘laws in force’ in Article 13(1) and must be struck down as being void to the extent that it recognises and enforces Triple Talaq,” read the judgment, declaring “Section 2 of the 1937 Act” to be void on “narrower ground” of being “arbitrary”.

However, the entire mechanism of talaq derives its sanctity from the same Section 2 of the 1937 Act (popularly known as Shariat Act). Lawyers active in politics wondered whether the setting aside of instant talaq (talaq-e-biddat) would opne up other forms of talaq (talaq-e-hasan or talaq-e-ahsan) for challenge. Though Justice Joseph’s argument has agreed and disagreed in parts with the two other judgments of his fellow judges, his judgment relies heavily on the theological interpretation of whether the practice under Shariat fits under the tenets of the Quran.

“After the introduction of the 1937 Act, no practice against the tenets of Quran is permissible,” wrote Justice Joseph, relying upon the theological Suras of Quran — Sura-II, Sura-IV and Sura-LXV — to conclude that “triple talaq is against the basic tenets of the Holy Quran and consequently, it violates Shariat”.

“What is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well,” concluded Justice Joseph’s judgment, prompting many to ask how it fit into the constitutional principles.

Dark Eden,"Title: Swarga Author: Ambikasuthan mangad

Publication: Juggernaut

256 pages

Swarga is an ambitious attempt to fictionalise an ecocide that has been unravelling in Kasaragode district in Kerala for many years. Thousands of people, particularly children, have been afflicted by a host of debilitating diseases, that are blamed on the aerial spraying of Endosulphan, a pesticide, in cashew plantations ringing the Kasaragode ghats. The public debates triggered by the tragedy has raised fundamental questions about modern agricultural practices and the responsibility of public institutions towards citizens. Endosulphan spraying was banned in 2000 and reports from the region point to the regeneration of local flora and fauna that had disappeared when pesticide use was rampant in large government-plantations.

Swarga, first published to much acclaim in Malayalam as Enmakaje in 2009, tells the story of the villagers of Swarga, Enmakaje and many other such hamlets who fought the PCK, which meant the state itself. The novelist, Ambikasuthan Mangad, however, has sought to turn what could have been a dry, grim catalogue of data and protests into an epic about modern man’s search for meaning in a technology-mediated world of consumption.

His narrators are a couple who, disgusted with urban life, have taken refuge in the forests of the Jadadhari hill in the shadow of which lies Swarga. Mangad calls them the Man and the Woman, since the two had decided to strip themselves of their past, identities and memories, when they left the city to retire to the jungle. Their attempt to reject an anthropomorphic worldview and journey back to a life in nature almost becomes a parable of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, retracing the steps back to the Garden of Eden. When the woman — her name, we are told later, is Devayani — returns home with an orphan, the Man revolts. However, the baby, who turns out to be a stunted child, exposes them to the world beyond their Eden.

It is a world of a people, whose ancestors had sinned against nature and built a society of exploitation. The couple joins the struggle launched by a visiting activist, a local doctor and a journalist to bring justice to the people. The novel ends with a manipulative politician attacked by a golden serpent, who had worked against the interests of the people, and the couple, Devayani and Neelakantan, finding their awakening in a cave in the Jadadhari hill.

The patches, where Mangad tries to sketch a life for the couple in the city, jars the narrative. Blame it on the activist self of Mangad, parts of the novel assume a didactic tone which disturbs the philosphical armature he seeks for the subject. These anomalies, however, do not detract from the novel’s importance as flagging a seminal issue of our time: How best do we build our lives without violating the basic tenets of life itself.

FC Barcelona to sue Neymar for 8.5 million euros,"Neymar recently moved from Barcelona to PSG. (Source: AP) Neymar recently moved from Barcelona to PSG. (Source: AP)

Barcelona are suing Neymar for 8.5 million euros ($10.00 million) for breach of contract as they want him to return the bonus he was paid when he signed a new five-year deal just nine months before joining Paris St Germain, the Spanish club said on Tuesday.

The Catalans are asking for an additional 10 percent payment due to a delay in their demands being met.

“Barcelona have taken these actions in defence of their interests, after Neymar’s contract was rescinded just a few months after he signed on until 2021,” a club statement said.

Brazilian striker Neymar, who joined PSG earlier this month after the French club triggered his 222 million euros release clause, said he was surprised by the decision but warned he was not going to give in.

“It is noteworthy that this news was received with surprise, since the athlete completely fulfilled the contract then in force, with the full deposit of the amounts set out in the buy-out clause freely agreed with F.C. Barcelona for his release,” Neymar’s representatives said in a statement.

The statement added that the 25-year-old forward’s lawyers were preparing a formal defence to the demands.

PSG activated Neymar’s release clause as Barcelona were unwilling to negotiate the sale of one of their best players.

Barcelona have passed the complaint to the Spanish football federation (RFEF) after first filing the lawsuit in court, as well as demanding PSG subsidise it, should Neymar not be able to take responsibility for it.

PSG brushed off that suggestion and said they had done all that was required of them.

“Paris Saint-Germain reiterates that, like Neymar Jr., it has always respected all applicable laws and rules in its dealings and, once again, regrets the attitude of FC Barcelona,” the club said in a statement.

In the days after he signed for the French club, Barcelona refused to pay the reported 26 million euro instalment of the loyalty bonus which he was due to receive this summer, citing breach of contract.

On Sunday, Neymar criticised the Barcelona board after helping PSG beat Toulouse in Ligue 1.

“I am disappointed with them (Barcelona directors). I spent four very happy years there and left happy, but not with them. For me they shouldn’t be in charge of Barcelona. Barca deserve much better and everyone knows this,” Neymar said.

Distance runner Shalane Flanagan received her 2008 Olympic silver medal on Monday after the Turkish runner who finished ahead of her tested positive for a performance enhancing drug, the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Track & Field said.

Flanagan was the bronze medallist in the 10,000 metres at the Beijing Games until second-placed finisher Elvan Abeylegesse was disqualified in March after a re-test of a 2007 sample showed positive for the banned steroid stanozolol.

The USOC and USA Track & Field said Flanagan, who preferred not to have an official ceremony, received her silver medal at her home in Portland, Oregon, earlier on Monday.

“Receiving my proper medal and having the record books changed is a dream come true,” Flanagan, said in a statement. “I greatly appreciate the USOC’s efforts to host a more formal medal ceremony in my honor, but with my coach and my family, I have decided to forego that option and instead celebrate in private.

“This news, and receiving my medal, are all that I need to feel incredibly fulfilled and happy.” The 2008 bronze medal previously owned by Flanagan, 36, has been returned to the IOC.

Dozens killed in airstrikes on Syrian city of Raqqa,"The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces now hold more than half of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group’s self-styled Islamic caliphate. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces now hold more than half of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group’s self-styled Islamic caliphate.

Syrian state media and opposition activists said on Tuesday that airstrikes on the northern city of Raqqa have killed dozens of civilians. US-backed Syrian opposition fighters have been trying to capture the city from the Islamic State group since June 6, and have been fighting under the cover of airstrikes by the US-led coalition.

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces now hold more than half of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group’s self-styled Islamic caliphate. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said airstrikes in Raqqa on Monday killed 42 civilians, including 19 children and 12 women. The activist-run group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said 32 people were killed in airstrikes on one neighborhood alone.

Syrian state media said the airstrikes killed dozens. They all blamed the US-led coalition. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said humanitarian staff in Syria are “deeply concerned by unconfirmed reports of a high number of civilians killed by airstrikes in Raqqa City over the last 24 hours.”

“These attacks, if confirmed, are a shocking reminder that civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict in many parts of Syria,” he added. “In recent days and weeks, scores of civilians have been killed and injured in Raqqa due to airstrikes and shelling, and up to 25,000 people remain trapped in the city,” he said.

"Government, BJP hail triple talaq verdict, will ‘wait and watch’ on legislation option","Earlier this year, during the run-up to the UP assembly elections, Prasad was the first senior BJP leader to state that the Central government could take appropriate steps to ban instant triple talaq. Earlier this year, during the run-up to the UP assembly elections, Prasad was the first senior BJP leader to state that the Central government could take appropriate steps to ban instant triple talaq.

Describing as “historic” the Supreme Court judgment against the practice of instant triple talaq, the Government and the ruling BJP Tuesday said the verdict marked the beginning of a new era of equality for Muslim women in the country. The leadership, however, struck a cautious note on the minority view of the Constitution Bench, which sought a legislation to ban the practice.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “We will consider the issue in a structured manner. Prima facie, the court has categorically held it unconstitutional and illegal… It is a great dawn for women in the country. The judgment is special and historic… it’s not only a Constitutional and legal victory, but also a moral victory for Muslim women.”

Earlier this year, during the run-up to the UP assembly elections, Prasad was the first senior BJP leader to state that the Central government could take appropriate steps to ban instant triple talaq. On Tuesday, the five-judge Constitution bench was divided in its verdict: Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer held that instant triple talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, was part of the fundamental right to religion and not unconstitutional, but Justices Kurian Joseph, Rohinton F Nariman and Uday U Lalit said the practice violated fundamental rights.

The carefully framed reactions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah on the split verdict revealed the cautious stance taken by the ruling dispensation. Both of them hailed the verdict as “historic” but did not dwell on the legislative option suggested in the minority view of the judgment.

In their judgment, CJI Khehar and Justice Nazeer said, “We would also beseech different political parties to keep their individual political gains apart, while considering the necessary measures requiring legislation.” Prime Minister Modi posted on Twitter: “Judgment of the Hon’ble SC on Triple Talaq is historic. It grants equality to Muslim women and is a powerful measure for women empowerment.”

Shah echoed the Chief Justice’s reference to the abolition of instant triple talaq in theocratic Islamic countries. “Sansaar ke bahut saare Muslim deshon mein bhi triple talaq ka kanoon astitva mein nahin hai (The provision of triple talaq does not exist even in many Muslim countries),” Shah said. Prasad pointed out that the CJI had referred to “obscurantism” in the Muslim personal law.

Other BJP leaders said that the party was “carefully examining” the verdict and would “wait and watch” how the debate on the issue evolved — they did not rule out the option of legislative action. “The court has called one particular type of talaq as invalid. This creates a vacuum whether future transgression through this invalid provision will be dealt under the domestic violence act or under personal laws. So, the contours or definition of this particular talaq need to be legislated,” said senior BJP functionary.

“Politically, there has been no discussion on it (legislation),” said a top BJP leader. However, he added that if the Government planned to bring a legislation now, it will find favour among a majority of people.

Incidentally, the then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, while appearing for the Central government in this matter, had argued that two other modes of talaq, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, were also “liable to be declared as unconstitutional”, for the same reasons referred to for talaq-e-biddat.

Talaq-e-ahsan refers to a single pronouncement of divorce during a tuhr (period between the menstrual cycle) followed by abstinence from intercourse for the period of waiting. Talaq-e-hasan relates to three pronouncements made during successive tuhrs, with no intercourse taking place during this period.

The Government’s top law officer had, at the time, also described these two procedures to be “equally arbitrary and unreasonable” as instant triple talaq. In his minority judgment, CJI Khehar referred to this submission while directing a legislative option. “It was contended that the challenge to talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan would follow immediately after this Court had rendered its pronouncement” with reference to talaq-e-biddat,” said the CJI’s judgment.

Immediately after the verdict was delivered, Shah held a meeting with senior party leaders and briefed the party’s spokespersons about its stand. “Triple Talaq is illegal now. It was a big battle. The Prime Minister and our Government have been sensitive to Muslim women’s concerns. The Government has through a number of its affidavits taken their side. There is no need for a legislation (on talaq-e-biddat). The practice has always been illegal and the Supreme Court has now declared it illegal,” BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.

"Donald Trump’s harsh words for Pakistan reflects US government’s frustration, says former AS Nisha Desai Biswal","President Donald Trump speaks at Fort Myer in Arlington during a Presidential Address to the Nation. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump speaks at Fort Myer in Arlington during a Presidential Address to the Nation. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump’s harsh words for Pakistan while announcing his Afghanistan and South Asia strategy reflects the growing frustration within the US government over Islamabad’s continued support for cross-border terrorism, a former American diplomat said. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. He ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America’s longest war. “President Trump tonight presented the nation with his strategy for Afghanistan — a strategy that largely continued the approach of the previous administration, with a few key distinctions,” former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia in the Obama administration Nisha Desai Biswal.

“First let me say — the most dramatic shifts were not in US policy towards Afghanistan but in the attitude of the president himself—going from the withdrawal he had advocated during the campaign to essentially continuing, and even augmenting the troop levels for the foreseeable future,” she told PTI. In announcing the strategy, she said Trump acknowledged the potential vacuum, and instability that would result from a precipitous withdrawal. “Continued US presence at current or near current levels,while not enough to stabilise Afghanistan, can at least keep it from collapsing entirely. The president’s announcement will provide some reassurances to the region which feared a US vacuum,” she said. Biswal said Trump seemed to focus almost entirely on the counter-terrorism mission, again pointing to a narrow mission aimed not at building a stable and viable Afghanistan but merely on preventing deterioration and preventing threats to the American homeland.

“A military strategy without an accompanying diplomatic and development strategy can at best be a band-aid to stop the bleeding but it will not address the underlying problems. To be fair, the two prior administrations also failed to successfully address the underlying challenges,” she said. The president’s harsh language for Pakistan reflect the”growing frustration” within the US government —including in military and intelligence circles—with Pakistan’s continued support for terror groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan and India and its diminishing cooperation with the US, Biswal said. “While the tougher stance may be warranted, I have not seen high-level diplomatic engagement to manage there actions,” said the former top American diplomat.

The president also prioritised India as a partner that can play a larger role, she said. “While India has provided significant economic assistance to Afghanistan, it has not played a larger political or military role. That has largely been a mutually supported decision — the US, sensitive to Pakistani reactions, did not want Indian boots on the ground, and India for its part also did not want to put its troops into Afghanistan,” she noted. However, with the US patience with Pakistan wearing thinner by the day, there is less heed being paid to Pakistan sensitivities and a greater expectation that India, with much at stake, should take on a greater share of the burden, Biswal said. And there is much India can do, without taking on a kinetic role. It can provide training and equipment to the Afghan military and provide more substantial support for the Afghan trust fund, she said.

“While many will take issue with the president’s blunt language linking trade and burden sharing, I already seee fforts by State and Department of Defence to soften the approach to India,” she said. However, for Afghanistan to be successful, stable and economically viable, there must be a robust regional diplomatic strategy, she added.

US and South Korean troops start drills amid North Korea standoff,"The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature. (Representational image/Agencies) The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature. (Representational image/Agencies)

US and South Korean troops kicked off their annual drills Monday that come after President Donald Trump and North Korea exchanged warlike rhetoric in the wake of the North’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills are largely computer-simulated war games held every summer and have drawn furious responses from North Korea, which views them as an invasion rehearsal. Pyongyang’s state media on Sunday called this year’s drills a “reckless” move that could trigger the “uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war.”

Despite the threat, US and South Korean militaries launched this year’s 11-day training on Monday morning as scheduled. The exercise involves 17,500 American troops and 50,000 South Korean soldiers, according to the US military command in South Korea and Seoul’s Defense Ministry.

No field training like live-fire exercises or tank maneuvering is involved in the Ulchi drills, in which alliance officers sit at computers to practice how they engage in battles and hone their decision-making capabilities. The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said Monday that North Korea must not use the drills as a pretext to launch fresh provocation, saying the training is held regularly because of repeated provocations by North Korea.

North Korea typically responds to South Korea-US military exercises with weapons tests and a string of belligerent rhetoric. During last year’s Ulchi drills, North Korea test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile that flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in the longest flight by that type of weapon. Days after the drills, the North carried out its fifth and biggest nuclear test to date.

Last month North Korea test-launched two ICBMs at highly lofted angles, and outside experts say those missiles can reach some US parts like Alaska, Los Angeles or Chicago if fired at normal, flattened trajectories. Analysts say it would be only a matter of time for the North to achieve its long-stated goal of acquiring a nuclear missile that can strike anywhere in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with “fire and fury.” North Korea, for its part, threatened to launch missiles toward the American territory of Guam before its leader Kim Jong Un backed off saying he would first watch how Washington acts before going ahead with the missile launch plans.

After slamming a 42-ball century Hampshire opener Shahid Afridi has revealed that the gamble to open the innings had paid off and one of the reasons behind his brilliant knock was his risk-taking ability.

Speaking to Cricinfo, Afridi said, “I asked the captain and coach yesterday if I could bat higher up the order because seven or eight is not my position. In crucial games you have to take chances. The first six overs are important and you need batters who play aggressively like me to utilise this.

“I wanted to put pressure on them from the start although it was not easy because the new ball was seaming. The first six overs are important and I tried to start on the attack. “I tried to start with attack – attack is your defence,” Afridi, who had not opened a T20 innings since 2011 Finals Day, told BBC Radio Solent.

Recalling the last instance when he opened for the county side, Afridi said,”The last time I opened the batting for Hampshire was finals day in 2011 but the main thing is confidence and I felt confident today.”

Meanwhile, Wayne Madsen, who dropped Afridi’s catch on 65, recalled the moment and said, “I saw it all the way and I thought it was coming straight in, to be fair,” Madsen said, having manfully agreed to front up and discuss the moment. I would probably catch those 98 times out of 100. It was just one of those things, it just hit me straight in the middle of the hand and popped right out again. He had already done us quite a lot of damage but that cost us another 40 runs and it was very disappointing obviously.”

Boca threaten legal action over non-payment of Carlos Tevez fee,"Carlos Tevez met with Angelici soon after his arrival in Argentina last week amid rumours he is seeking a third stint at the club. (Source: Reuters) Carlos Tevez met with Angelici soon after his arrival in Argentina last week amid rumours he is seeking a third stint at the club. (Source: Reuters)

Boca Juniors president Daniel Angelici has threatened to take Shanghai Shenhua to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to demand payment of more than $3 million related to the transfer of striker Carlos Tevez.

Tevez joined Shenhua in January for a transfer fee in the region of 11 million euros ($12.96 million) and Angelici claims the Chinese side have not paid the Argentine club since the initial payment was made when the transfer was completed.

“We are preparing a claim to present to the Court of Arbitration for Sport because we have written several times to the club and have had no response,” Angelici told local media, claiming Shenhua owed Boca more than $3 million.

The 33-year-old former Manchester United and Juventus forward is currently in Buenos Aires for treatment on a calf injury that has seen him miss much of his first season in China.

Tevez has played just 11 times in the Chinese Super League since his highly anticipated arrival ahead of the current season, scoring two goals as Shenhua have struggled.

He was granted leave to return to Argentina after signing an agreement with the club guaranteeing he would return before the resumption of the Chinese Super League following the upcoming international break.

Tevez met with Angelici soon after his arrival in Argentina last week amid rumours he is seeking a third stint at the club.

“Tevez had lunch with the president of Boca? Well, we know nothing about that,” a spokesman for Shenhua said.

“He is now on holiday, he has the right to meet anyone he wants to, this is his freedom. We won’t comment on something like that, let alone interfere with it. “But we want to stress again that he will report to the club on August 30.”

Today, when a total solar eclipse sweeps across the United States for the first time in 99 years, people gathering in Charleston, South Carolina, will be the last on the continent to experience it. They are ready. Historic Charleston, with its cobblestone streets and elegant antebellum mansions, was a-bustle on Sunday in full pre-eclipse mode. Its restaurants were packed and downtown parking was at a premium as excited locals and tourists strolled cheerfully along the seafront Battery promenade. “It has been crazy since Friday night,” said bar owner Chaz Wendell. “This is probably going to be our busiest weekend all year.”

Weather predictions for Monday were iffy — with clouds and scattered thunderstorms predicted through the hours when the eclipse is due, from the moment when the moon first obscures a small arc of the sun, to totality, and through the end of the whole cosmic viewing experience.

For locals, and for those who have come from far away, it is a big deal. “We’re very excited,” said Brandy Mullins, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mother who moved to Charleston six weeks ago with her family. She and her three children all have solar glasses and are planning to watch the eclipse from an open area — weather permitting. “It’s not looking very good,” she said of the weather forecasts, “but it’s OK — we still get to experience it and see the darkness.”

Nick Willder, 59, and his wife, Sarah Boylan, 60, of Nottingham, England had planned their two-week vacation through the southern US to end in Charleston in time for the eclipse. It will be their third try to see a total eclipse, earlier attempts in England and China, Willder said, were both rained out.

The “Great American Eclipse,” as it is being called, will move diagonally across the country, northwest to southeast, providing a spectacular solar show — again, weather permitting — and an excellent excuse for scores of eclipse- viewing parties and music festivals. It will first be visible in the northwestern state of Oregon at 9:05 am (1605 GMT), with totality there coming 75 minutes later. Oregon authorities say they expect a million people to flood into the state for the event, clogging roadways and overflowing campgrounds, the Oregonian newspaper reported.

“This is the trip of a lifetime,” said Deirdre Duignan, visiting Oregon from Dublin, Ireland. It will be one of those moments that will just take your breath away.” In all, about 12 million people living in 14 states will be in the path of totality, with many millions of others able to witness at least a partial eclipse, according to the American Astronomical Society. Some street vendors sold T-shirts and buttons to mark the eclipse.

Jan Dahouas, a vendor from Atlanta, Georgia, sold eclipse-themed shirts he designed for USD 20 each, and buttons that read, “Keep Calm and Stare at the Sun.” Some restaurants advertised sales of the prized solar glasses that make eclipse-viewing safe.

"Rolling back Taliban grip on Afghan territory key aim of Trump plan, says official","US Marine stands next to an Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier during a training in Helmand province, Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters) US Marine stands next to an Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier during a training in Helmand province, Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters)

Rolling back territorial gains by the Taliban and strengthening the Afghanistan army’s ability to fight will be two key objectives of President Donald Trump’s new strategy for the country, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. Trump, in a televised speech on Monday, promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the US-backed Afghan government.

In outlining his strategy to give the US military more authority to make battlefield decisions, Trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress.

The senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the Afghan government or by the Taliban and other extremist groups such as Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate.

“It’s also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al Qaeda and ISIS, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Also key will be the effectiveness of the Afghan army and whether US-led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the Taliban, the official added.

Trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in Afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said.

“I think we’re going to be taking the temperature continuously,” the official said. “I don’t think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. But from that point on, it’s going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating.”

US-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban’s hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.

US forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 US troops have died there in America’s longest military conflict.

‘PROGRESSIVE PROCESS’

Three US officials said on Tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in Afghanistan and assess the contributions of the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and America’s NATO allies.

One of the officials said there was no point “in setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didn’t have to do more.”

“What we’re after is a progressive process,” the official said, “so for example the Afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don’t need us anymore, the government in Kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance.”

But Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, struck a critical tone on Tuesday.

“While a ‘conditions based’ approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the Taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the

Afghan government to reform itself and give the Afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely,” Schiff said in a statement.

17 schools refunded excess fee: Delhi Government,"Representational Image/ Express Representational Image/ Express

Even as the Delhi government’s proposal to take over 449 private unaided schools “as a last resort” got the official nod by L-G Anil Baijal, government officials said at least 17 schools had already “refunded excess fee charged from parents despite government orders”. Officials maintained that the proposal would allow the schools to initially respond to the showcause notice within “two weeks” as to why “they should not be taken over the government”.

The official added, “The L-G office has also cautioned the government to ensure that studies in the present term are not impacted.” In doing so, the L-G office echoed the concerns raised by the Delhi HC, which said that “our paramount interest is to ensure that students don’t suffer”. Last week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said, “The schools will not be allowed to loot students like they used to do under previous governments due to political collusion. But if they don’t implement, we will take them over as a last resort. I hope we don’t have to take over.”

According to a government official, the amount collectively owed by the schools amounted to around Rs 300 crore. S K Bhattacharya, president of Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, said schools would respond to the showcause notices. “There are two types of schools — a large number of schools have grievances and are not satisfied with the order, and want to challenge it. Then there are some who have excess money, which they will refund,” he said.

“But government cannot take over schools unless and until there is substantial proof against them… This is not a simple matter,” he added. DPS Mathura Road Principal Manohar Lal said he is yet to receive the order from the L-G’s office. “A writ petition in the matter would have been filed in the High Court today, or it will be filed tomorrow. We are ready to obey whatever the court says,” he said.

"WWE Raw: Braun Strowman obliterates Brock Lesnar, watch video","Braun Strowman continued his brutality on Brock Lesnar. (Source: WWE) Braun Strowman continued his brutality on Brock Lesnar. (Source: WWE)

Braun Strowman had left Brock Lesnar in a mess at the WWE SummerSlam on Sunday. The two giants had collided, alongside Roman Reigns and Samoa Joe, in a fatal four way match for the Universal Championship title at the Brooklyn Center in New York. Strowman had thumped Lesnar through the announcer’s table and the image of Lesnar underneath the table is one of the lasting memories from the night. So much so, Lesnar needed medical attention and left in a stretcher – only to return later and successfully defend his title. But there was a score to settle.

Even though he had put Lesnar through three tables and put him on a stretcher, The Gift of Destruction clearly wasn’t done with The Beast and still had more to do as he went after the title. Even as Lesnar and Paul Heyman celebrated the title defense, Strowman chose to let his beatdowns do the talking. And he had one more at his disposal. And that was done courtesy a pair of bone-jarring Running Powerslams and to top it all off, he made his intentions clear by posing with the Universal Title.

Fittingly enough, their match for the title, was confirmed later in the night to be contested at WWE No Mercy. And the words are extremely suitable for the two – there will be NO MERCY.

Wayne Rooney announces retirement from international football,"Wayne Rooney has announced his retirement from International football. (Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney has announced his retirement from International football. (Source: Reuters)

Wayne Rooney has drawn curtains on his international career and made the announcement on Wednesday after a glittering 14-year spell as England forward. The 31-year old played 119 games in national colours out of which he captained 22 to score a total of 53 goals.

In a statement on his official website, he said, “It was great Gareth Southgate called me this week to tell me he wanted me back in the England squad for the upcoming matches. I really appreciated that. However, having already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football.”

“It is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton and those closest to me. Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me. But I believe now is the time to bow out.”

He further added that he wants to focus all his energy on helping Everton become successful. “Leaving Manchester United was a tough call but I know I made the right decision in coming home to Everton. Now I want to focus all my energies on helping them be successful,” he said.

Dreams can come true and playing for @England has been exactly that. Thanks to everyone involved it’s been amazing – http://t.co/GfiT7oVCpx — Wayne Rooney (@WayneRooney) 23 August 2017

“I will always remain a passionate England fan. One of my very few regrets is not to have been part of a successful England tournament side. Hopefully the exciting players Gareth is bringing through can take that ambition further and I hope everyone will get behind the team.”

“One day the dream will come true and I look forward to being there as a fan – or in any capacity,” he added.

AITA terminates Vijay Amritraj backed CTL contract over non-payment,"Vijay Amritraj was one of the Directors of SSPL. (Source: Express photo) Vijay Amritraj was one of the Directors of SSPL. (Source: Express photo)

The All India Tennis Association (AITA) on Tuesday terminated the contract of Vijay Amritraj’s Champions Tennis League due to non-payment of annual fee of Rs 30 lakh for the 2016 season.

The All India Tennis Association (AITA) had entered into a nine-year contract with Second Serve Private Limited (SSPL), led by former star Amritraj, who was one of the Directors of the company. However, the AITA would allow them to place a fresh bid when tender will be floated next year (2018).

AITA Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee confirmed that the organisers have failed to pay Rs 30 lakh to them as per contract apart from 10 percent of surplus amount.

“They did not conduct league last year and the contract was to have it for nine years without any break. They did not pay the fixed fee of Rs 30 lakh. We had given them a chance to conduct it this year to which they initially agreed,” Chatterjee told PTI.

“But later on, they said that the franchises would not agree to have it for just 2017 season. They insisted that we allow them to conduct it for nine year as per the agreement but our Executive Committee rejected it,” Chatterjee.

The senior AITA official also said CTL organisers also failed to pay 10 per cent of surplus amount. “They never paid that 10 per cent citing losses,” Chatterjee further added.

The AITA though will allow SSPL to place a fresh bid next year. “We have told them they can apply next year, we won’t stop them. We will give them preference,” he said.

Some of the global stars such as Martina Hingis, Feliciano Lopez, Jelena Jankovic, Agnieszka Radwanska, Garbine Muguruza and India’s very own Leander Paes had competed in the League in the first two editions.

CTL CEO Arjun Rao did not take calls when efforts were made to get his comments on the development and Vijay Amritraj also could not be reached for his reaction.

"US media dishonest, lobbying tool: Donald Trump","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

President Donald Trump called a majority of the mainstream American media dishonest, bad and a “lobbying tool” for allegedly giving a platform to hate groups after the violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia. Trump, whose controversial remarks after the violence in Charlottesville on August 12 drew widespread criticism, said most of the media was propagating incorrect information about him and fomenting divisions in the United States.

Trump had earlier said that “both sides” were to blame for the clashes. But he changed course after severe backlash and said there was no room for prejudice, bigotry and hate. At a campaign-style rally on Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona, Trump singled out popular media organisations like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN for his criticism. He, however, praised Fox News for its coverage of his presidency. “For the most part honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, they’re bad people,” Trump said. “I really think they don’t like our country, I really believe that.”

He claimed The Times apologised to him after he won the November election and called The Post “a lobbying tool for Amazon”. “Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down,” he said.

“They are trying to take away our history and our heritage, you see that,” he said in an apparent reference to the removal of monuments of Confederate generals following the the death of a woman during clashes among hundreds of white supremacists and counter protesters in Charlottesville. “The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news,” he said and added that had it not been for the social media, where he is very active, he would not have been in the White House.

The media “don’t want to make our country great again,” he said. “They have double standards. You never heard them say that. And in fact, if you use the term you’d get criticised. But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it. And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on,” he said.

Trump also alleged that the mainstream media “turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should have never been allowed to be politicians.”

AB de Villiers has stepped down as the skipper of the ODI team but will be available for selection across all formats of the game. In a video posted on his official Twitter account, de Villiers said, “A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months, and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear. Over the past year or so, I have tried to manage many commitments. I have felt mentally and physically tired; my wife and I are bringing up two fantastic kids and playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll.”

“Together with Cricket South Africa, we have tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say I am picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas, and even to suggest I am somehow putting myself before the team. That is simply not true. That has never been true. Playing for South Africa is, and will always be, the greatest privilege of my life,” he added.

Looking forward to a great summer #ProteaFire pic.twitter.com/yojybIrvjZ — AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) 23 August 2017

The right-hander last played for South Africa in a T20I in June 2017 while made an appearance in an ODI earlier in the same month. “Following this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived,” de Villiers said.

Talking about making a comeback the South African suggested that he is eager to get back on the field. “I want to get back on the field and I have today assured the national selectors that I will be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. “There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly, but I will be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.”

Hailing, Faf du Plessis’ captaincy abilities, de Villiers praised his teammate and further went on to say that he has been an outstanding skipper.

“Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I have informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,” he said.

“It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for someone else to take the ODI side forward. Whoever is chosen as the new ODI captain will have my complete support,” he added.

Petra Kvitova’s final tuneup for the U.S. Open ended with a 6-2, 6-1 loss to Shuai Zhang of China in the first round of the Connecticut Open.

Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion and a three-time champion in New Haven, is just 4-4 on hard courts this season. The Czech player returned to the tour at the French Open in May after she was stabbed during a home invasion in December, leaving her dominant left hand seriously injured.

Zhang, ranked 29th, was playing her first match in the United States since April. “I just arrived in New Haven last night, coming straight from China,” she said. “It’s a big change. It’s 12 hours’ time difference. Before the match I was still sleeping.”

Earlier yesterday, Canadian Eugenie Bouchard breezed past higher-ranked American Lauren Davis 6-3, 6-1. Bouchard, a

wild-card entry, next faces top-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska.

Bouchard, who reached a career-best No. 5 in the rankings in 2014, has struggled recently, slipping to 74th. In other matches, Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium beat Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine 6-2, 6-3, and Romania’s Ana Bogdan got past Russia’s Elena Vesnina, 7-5, 7-5.

The U.S. Open begins August 28.

"Conor McGregor must stick to what he knows, says former sparring partner Steve Collins Junior","The boxing world has scoffed at the notion that McGregor can bring himself up to Floyd’s level in the space of a few weeks. (Source: AP) The boxing world has scoffed at the notion that McGregor can bring himself up to Floyd’s level in the space of a few weeks. (Source: AP)

Conor McGregor should rely on the skills that have made him a two-weight UFC champ and not try to out-box unbeaten American Floyd Mayweather when the two clash in Las Vegas on Saturday, former sparring partner Steve Collins Junior told Reuters.

The Irish mixed martial arts fighter turned up at the Dublin gym run by Collins Jnr’s uncle Paschal about two years ago looking to hone his boxing skills, and the 27-year-old light heavyweight was happy to go toe to toe with him.

“I arrived early as my uncle told me to come in to do some pad work before the place opened and Conor came up. He must have cleared it with my uncle as he had the place to himself, he had the gym closed off,” Collins Jnr said in a telephone interview.

“He started off sparring a guy for a round or two but the guy couldn’t keep up with Conor’s pace, so my uncle asked me if I’d spar him. I said fine, and got in there for five, six, seven rounds,” he explained.

“Conor didn’t care about the size difference between us, he just kept going. He barely took a break in between rounds, he’d just take a sip of water or whatever.”

The Collins family are as close to boxing royalty as it gets in Ireland, with Steve Collins Senior a former WBO middleweight and super-middleweight world champ, and uncle Paschal a renowned boxing coach.

Collins Jnr, who has 10 wins, one loss and one draw in his 12 professional fights, was impressed by the offensive skills of the 29-year-old McGregor, who has never fought as a pro boxer.

“As an MMA fighter his boxing skills were brilliant – great stance, great balance, great shot selection and timing, he judged distance very well, superior to most MMA fighters.” However, the boxer did find chinks in the armour of the UFC lightweight champion.

“His only weakness really was his defence. I didn’t find it to hard to land leather on him, and if you’ve got a guy like Floyd, he may find it even easier. If I had to pick one thing, it was that his defence wasn’t brilliant,” he said.

The boxing world has scoffed at the notion that McGregor can bring himself up to Floyd’s level in the space of a few weeks, but Collins says he may not have to.

“I think he’ll have to rely on what he already knows. There is so much to learn in boxing, even Mayweather is still learning, so Conor has to work with what he has. “It takes years to be a complete fighter, and it will all be new to him on the day,” he said.

Mayweather, who has not fought in nearly two years, needs a win to surpass Rocky Marciano’s record and reach 50-0 for his career, while McGregor, who is making his professional boxing debut, is 21-3 in mixed martial arts.

Currently in training for a fight in Belfast in September, Collins Jnr says he will watch the fight but he won’t travel to Las Vegas or stay up into the small hours to do so.

“If I was on Mayweather or McGregor money I’d go to Vegas, but I’m not! “I’m in training so I can’t afford to stay up all night, but we’re going to record it and watch it together at the gym the next morning,” he said, adding that he expected an exciting fight. “Things Conor never expected are going to happen to him in the ring, and how he reacts to that will say a lot about him.”

"World Badminton Championships 2017: Kidambi Srikanth, Saina Nehwal book pre-quarters berth","India’s Srikanth Kidambi in action against France’s Lucas Corvee. (Source: Reuters) India’s Srikanth Kidambi in action against France’s Lucas Corvee. (Source: Reuters)

It was another good day for India at the BWF World Championships in Glasgow , Scotland as Kidambi Srikanth, Saina Nehwal and Sai Praneeth booked pre-quarters berth with wins in their respective rounds on Wednesday.

After PV Sindhu’s comfortable victory on Tuesday, Saina took the court to register 21-11, 21-12 victory in just 33 minutes against Sabrina Jacquet of Switzerland. The 12th seeded Indian, who got a bye in her first round, started off on a strong note and swiftly raced to take a 7-2 lead in the opening game after coming out of a long term injury.

The 2010 London Olympics bronze medalist said after the win, “It was a tricky match I felt. Sabrina is a formidable opponent but I am happy that I overpowered her nicely in the match.” She will now be up against the winner of the match between her compatriot Tanvi Lad and old nemesis Sung Ji Hyun of Korea.

Sai Praneeth also made his way into the round of 32 after a hard-fought 14-21, 21-18, 21-19 win over Anthony Ginting of Indonesia. Not being able to adjust to the pace of the Indonesian in the beginning, Sai lost the first game 14-21 but returned back to win five of the seven points and restore the second game 21-18.

“It was a very tough match and even though I played well, I must I must admit that I had luck on my side today. I am very thrilled with the outcome and the victory will for sure give me a lot of confidence going ahead in the tournament,” Sai said after the match. “I was getting caught initially as the shuttle speed was very slow and he was playing very fast. I could not match him initially but slowly adjusted to his speed. He is a tough player and his game has improved a lot since I last played him. I am really happy to win and now I am focused on my next match,” he further added.

“I am going through the best phase of my career and I am confident that if I could continue the way I have been playing, I would do very well in the tournament,” the 25-year-old added.

Srikanth also registered a win on the third day of the competition to continue his flawless winning streak. He’s now won 12 matches in a row after beating France’s Lucas Corvee 21-9, 21-19 in 32 minutes. This is his second straight game win after registering 21-13 21-12 in less than 30 minutes in the first round match against Russia’s Sergey Sirant on Monday.

The 24-year old tweeted after the match, “Good second round win today and very happy with my performance. #2ndround #WorldChampionships2017 #teamindia #believe #achieve”

A guilty verdict for Thailand’s Yingluck may stoke anger but military firmly in charge,"Opposition activists said a guilty verdict would fuel anti-government anger and could spark a smattering of small protests in defiance of a government ban, particularly in the north and northeast where support for the Shinawatras appears unwavering. Opposition activists said a guilty verdict would fuel anti-government anger and could spark a smattering of small protests in defiance of a government ban, particularly in the north and northeast where support for the Shinawatras appears unwavering.

A long-awaited verdict in the trial of former Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra this week could inflame tension and would likely have far-reaching implications in the politically divided kingdom.

The ruling military said more than 3,000 of Yingluck’s supporters could show up at the court on Friday in what would be one of the biggest political gatherings since Yingluck’s government was ousted in a 2014 coup.

Thousands of policemen will be on hand in a bid to head off the sort of trouble that has become a hallmark of antagonistic Thai politics over the past decade or more.

Yingluck has been accused of negligence in her handling of a multi-billion dollar rice subsidy scheme, under which the government bought rice from farmers at inflated prices.

That led to stockpiles of rotting grain, distorted world prices and lost Thailand its crown as the world’s top exporter. Losses amounted to $8 billion, this government says.

Critics said the scheme was engineered by Yingluck’s brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, to shore up support among rural voters who have handed electoral victory to a Shinawatra party in every election since 2001.

Yingluck has denied wrongdoing and has said she is the victim of political persecution. She faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of negligence.

A military-backed legislature found her guilty in a separate impeachment case in 2015, and banned her from politics for five years, for failing to exercise sufficient oversight of the subsidy scheme.

Despite that, Yingluck remains the unofficial face of the Shinawatra political machine, which, supporters say, the royalist-military establishment is determined to sideline once and for all.

Opposition activists said a guilty verdict would fuel anti-government anger and could spark a smattering of small protests in defiance of a government ban, particularly in the north and northeast where support for the Shinawatras appears unwavering.

“If she is found guilty there will surely be some action by underground resistance forces,” said a leader of the pro-Shinawatra “red shirt” movement in the northeastern city of Khon Kaen who declined to be identified.

“There are plans to burn tyres at up to 10 locations in Khon Kaen.”

A spokeswoman said Yingluck did not agree with the threat by the activist leader to use force, and her party said any support for her should be peaceful.

Yingluck was at her Bangkok home on Wednesday, where she donated alms to Buddhist monks, and was preparing for the court’s decision, her lawyer said.

“The defence team and former prime minister Yingluck are ready to hear the verdict,” her lawyer, Norrawit Larlaeng, Yingluck’s lawyer, told Reuters.

Police were setting up a barricades and a checkpoint outside the Supreme Court, where the verdict will be delivered, while Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the government wanted to avoid trouble.

“The government is worried about the people. We don’t want to use force,” Prayuth, a former army chief who ousted Yingluck’s government in the 2014 coup, told reporters.

POLITICAL IMPACT

Former telecommunications tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, overthrown in a 2006 coup and living quietly in self-exile to avoid a 2008 conviction for graft he said was politically motivated, has made no public comment on his sister’s case.

Trakool Meechai, a former political science professor at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, said widespread sustained protests in response to a conviction of Yingluck were unlikely, given the firm grip the military has imposed.

But in the long-term, a conviction could deter future governments from intervening to support markets.

“No matter how this case turns out it will have an impact on Thai politics,” Trakool told Reuters. “This case will be a litmus test for how future politicians will manage the country.”

A verdict of innocent would invigorate the rank and file of the Shinawatras’ embattled Puea Thai Party and boost its prospects in a general election the junta has promised to hold in 2018.

“If the case is thrown out it will increase the strength of Yingluck and her Puea Thai Party and this will show in the next election,” Trakool said.

Two potential leaders have emerged to lead the party in the election, one of them from within the Shinawatra family.

But a guilty verdict would spell the end of Yingluck’s political career, deal a heavy blow to the Shinawatras and their loyalists, and deepen the political divisions that the military has vowed to heal.

President Donald Trump voices mild optimism about ties with North Korea,"US President Donald Trump (Source: AP) US President Donald Trump (Source: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday expressed his cautious optimism that his aggressive stance against North Korea was paying off and that there was room for improvement in relations with North Korea after months of mounting tension over its weapons programs. “I respect the fact that he is starting to respect us,” Trump said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un

“And maybe – probably not, but maybe – something positive can come about,” he said at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona.

Trump’s comments echoed that of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had earlier in the day extended a olive leaf to North Korea, while welcoming what he called the restraint it had shown in the past few days with regarding its weapons programs and saying he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue “sometime in the near future.”

“We have had no missile launches or provocative acts on the part of North Korea since the unanimous adoption of the UN Security Council resolution,” Tillerson had told reporters, while referring to UN sanctions on North Korea agreed on August 5.

North Korea had last tested a Intercontinental Missile on July 28, which put US within striking distance of its nuclear weapons. This had sparked off tension between Pyongyang and West.

US President Donald Trump consequently warned North Korea that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States.

Pyongyang had responded by threatening to fire missiles at US Pacific island territory of Guam, but later said it was holding off such attacks and see what what US did next.

Soha Ali Khan shares power-packed pic doing prenatal yoga; here’s why you should follow her lead,"Soha Ali Khan practising the warrior pose. (Source: Instagram/sakpataudi) Soha Ali Khan practising the warrior pose. (Source: Instagram/sakpataudi)

When you are a celebrity, the need to stay fit is more of a necessity than just an overpowering desire to have a toned body. In the entertainment industry, not having a slender figure means setting off a torrent of criticism where bodyshaming simply becomes a part of reality. So, when Kareena Kapoor Khan walked about in unbridled abandon during her pregnancy, it ushered in a new outlook towards body weight and, of course, expecting celebrities. Over the past year, we’ve seen the pregnant Bollywood mom-to-be brigade flaunt their pregnancy, and Kareena was there leading the pack.

Well, following her footsteps at the moment is sister-in-law, Soha Ali Khan. Not only is the actor, dressing up in beautiful maternity wear and enjoying every bit of her pregnancy, she is also showing others on how to stay fit during the nine months.

Recently, Khan shared a photo on Instagram where she can be seen practising yoga, the warrior pose to be precise, dressed in simple black leggings and a yellow crop top. Earlier this year, she shared another photo which she captioned: “Who says you can’t stay fit when pregnant ?!”.

Certainly, not us!

Prenatal yoga has always been a favourite of A-listers as it believed to keep limbs toned, improve balance and circulation, and make labour easier. Actually, it is considered as one of the best forms of exercise during pregnancy. Here’s why:

1) Prenatal yoga increases stamina and helps maintain balance. With the growth of a life inside the mother, more energy and strength is needed to function and yoga strengthens the hips, back, arms and shoulders. It also helps maintain balance physically and aids in emotional growth. A 2012 University of Michigan study showed that mindfulness yoga, which combines physical poses with meditation practices, can bring measurable relief to women who may face depression during pregnancy.

2) Prenatal yoga prepares for the birth of the child by focusing on relaxation and breathing techniques. This works as a good tool for labour during contractions because deep breathing can regulate blood pressure and heart rate and provide the much-needed oxygen to your baby and your muscles.

3) It increases circulation within the joints and muscles with regular practice, which, in turn, reduces swelling caused during pregnancy and increases immunity. It also calms the nervous system through deep breathing which benefits the body with an improved digestive system, and good sleep.

4) Common pregnancy complaints like lower back pain, nausea, insomnia, headaches, shortness of breath, and carpal tunnel syndrome can be reduced with regular practice. Like we have said earlier, stretching and toning the muscles help in improved blood circulation.

5) It’s a good way to channelise attention towards what’s going on within your bodies. Certain poses, like the Hero pose, in which you are required to sit back on your heels and then sit up straight to lengthen your spine, can become meaningful and a good way to connect with your unborn child.

St. Kitts and Nevis coach Jacques Passy looks confident ahead of the Hero Tri-nation International Football Series taking place in India where his side will face the higher ranked host country and Mauritius.

In an exclusive interview to http://www.aiff.com, Passy said, “You don’t travel around the world only to compete but not win. Obviously, our first priority is to win. First, we will try to conquer Mauritius tomorrow and then win the game against India. We’ll take one game at a time.”

“You don’t get the opportunity like this everyday. The Challenge lies in playing outside our continent, our comfort zone. The character of the players will be significant”, he added.

On playing India, a higher ranked team, Passy said, “4 months back, we were 70 and India were much below than us. Now, it’s the other way around. Frankly speaking, I don’t prefer to buy the ranking formula. The game is played on the pitch and it’ll always be so. Rankings are irrelevant.”

He, however, was all praise for Indian hospitality saying, “The Indian hospitality has been excellent so far in all true senses. Whoever we’ve interacted to appeared so dearer and nicer to us, we can’t think of complaining about anything. We’re already started to feel at home.”

St. Kitts & Nevis will first play Mauritius on Tuesday at 5.30 pm.

Manny Pacquiao vs Jeff Horn rematch confirmed for Brisbane,"The fight is expected to be held in November at the Lang Park stadium. (Source: File) The fight is expected to be held in November at the Lang Park stadium. (Source: File)

Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao’s rematch with Australian Jeff Horn has been confirmed for Brisbane later this year, the city’s mayor said on Monday.

Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk had earlier threatened to pull funding without confirmation from the Pacquiao camp but said he had been reassured at a meeting with promoters on Monday.

“I have had a meeting earlier today which has confirmed that Manny Pacquiao will definitely be in Brisbane this year for a rematch with Jeff Horn,” Quirk told local media.

The fight is expected to be held in November at the same Lang Park stadium where a packed crowd of 50,000 saw former schoolteacher Horn upset Pacquiao for the WBO welterweight belt in an unanimous 12-round decision last month.

Quirk said Brisbane Marketing, the city council’s major events subsidiary, would be re-engaged for negotiations with promoters Top Rank and Duco Events.

“It was a matter of Manny Pacquiao deciding whether he wanted to take up that clause in the contract to give a rematch in the event that he lost,” Quirk added.

Horn’s surprise win over 38-year-old Pacquiao caused controversy, with many observers outraged by the decision. But a WBO scoring review later endorsed Horn as the rightful winner.

Decoded: Why whisky tastes better with water,"Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Adding a few drops of water enhances the taste of whisky, say scientists who confirm what alcohol connoisseurs have long known. Researchers at Linnaeus University in Sweden have found that adding water to whisky alters the drink’s molecules to make it taste better. Whisky is a chemically complicated beverage. After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled.

However, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 per cent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly. Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. “The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,” said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University.

“One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,” Karlsson said.

Researchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions. They found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid.

“This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,” said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University. “Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface.

“An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,” Friedman said. These findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass.

“How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual. Some people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,” Karlsson added. The research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

LFW Winter/Festive 2017 Day 4: Elli Avram turns into a gorgeous bride for designer Manoj Agarrwal,"The bespoke bridal wear designer, Manoj Agarrwal composed an iconic collection that was authentic and rich in heritage at Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Elli Avram turned into a gorgeous bride in her all-red, embroidered, lehenga with a long embellished trail and well draped dupatta.



The line was tastefully constructed, in order to impersonate the elegance of an authoritative historical figure as impactful as Jodhaa Bai. Royal architecture played a pivotal role in the design process of the garments.

He made the audience time travel to the grand era of the Rajputs and the Mughals, who were known for their extravagant lives and effortlessly delivered, a stunning bridal wear collection on the runway.

Subtle embroidery motifs in pastel hues were seen on a palette of crimson, ink blue and brown that looked ravishing. Raw silk and tulle were used to create the ambitious ethnic attires that elevated the appeal of the imperial theme. The designer took an important piece of history and artistically transformed it with the magic of his craft.

At the Johnnie Walker – The Journey show, Asa Kazingmei made fashion lovers in the audience applaud his amazing creativity. ""Inspired by ancient warriors with metal punk as the main focus and a touch of modern culture, my collection this season shows strength and courage of individuals through various aspects in their life. The outfits portray glamour and power and the message is to strive harder every day to be more. Our Johnnie Walker inspired collection is an extension of my belief that like the striding man, every individual must keep walking through whatever hardships come across our path,"" said Asa.



Ali Fazal walked the ramp for the designer.

Asa has always presented fearless fashion and this season he brought ‘Invincible’ haute couture with his customary strong, styling, elements. For the designer, fashion has to be beyond simplicity so the mix of ancient warriors’ influences and contemporary punk culture made a dramatic, emphatic, style statement on the ramp. Asa worked only with a fabric base that comprised leather and denim but detailing was once again with the intelligent use of metal work that featured chains, spikes and fringes. The sharply cut garments in myriad silhouettes offered structural cuts, detailing and were further enhanced with clever embroidery.

Ending the show was the ‘true blue warrior’ Vidyut Jamwal, whose leather /denim jacket, multi pocket pant with zippered detailing and vest proved that he was all ready to fight it out. And that is just what the Commando actor did on the ramp! He demonstrated his expertise with two swords in a perfect warrior like demeanour.

Shreeya Somaiya's collection was inspired by Carine Roitfeld’s CR fashion book on Marie Antoinette. Marie Antoinette, the last queen before the French Revolution was the ultimate risk taker of the time in terms of being bold and edgy. The designer's take was to contemporise and make the fashion wearable for the modern Indian women. The silhouettes had a wide range including Duchess satin slip dresses, asymmetric skirts, jackets and shift dresses in soft pink and crimson with ruffle detailing.

White shirts under denim bustier and jackets, with pearl edging, teamed with a scarlet and pale pink tulle skirts with 3D flowers appliques were other impressive looks. Organza, chiffon and denim were the fabrics used to create innovative textures along with pearl and crystals to reinvent the charm of the astonishing historical figure. The designer improvised the jewels and accessories of that era and infused them as surface ornamentation while floral appliqués were another technique used to add to the ladylike approach to the line.

Making a strong fashion statement with his new colour forecast, Ujjawal Dubey for his label Antar Agni at Lakme Fashion Week Winter/festive 2017 unveiled his ‘Disobedient’ collection for both men and women. Ujjawal’s construction and designing techniques have been his signature that has revolutionised the concept of menswear and womenswear. His new line amalgamated the timeless quality of eastern classic silhouettes with international trends, thus bringing a certain amount of disobedience to his collection.

Menswear had the characteristic asymmetric silhouettes for waist coats and kurtas. Knit sherwanis, collarless shirts and shawl collar jackets made for great fashion statements.

Womenswear had a gentle, feminine, touch with stark shapes. Asymmetrical, double-breasted coat and dress were simple with machine embroidery; while jumpsuits with side pockets looked comfortable and relaxed. The double-breasted dress with a soft backless coat, grey midi with cowl cover, two-toned kurta, maxi dress with asymmetric cover and rouched back drape proved it was a balanced collection.

Delhi based duo Monika and Nidhi brought together a line that was exquisite, yet, experimental in its own way. Pernia Qureshi gracefully walked the ramp in an embellished ivory lehenga with stylised choli that had intricate details. It was the perfect winter wedding outfit for the new age women.

The collection had all the elements for a perfect fairy tale, right from the extravagant ensembles to the fragile embroidery and the vintage style quotient. The silhouettes were an ode to the Victorian era, but a contemporary twist was given to the ballroom skirts teamed with well-tailored corsets, cholis, cropped tops with elongated sleeves and capes with feather and fringe detail along with a metallic sari that sparkled like pixie dust. Waists were cinched to add a more figure-hugging accent to the collection.

Georgette, tulle, organza, satin and crepe were the fabrics chosen to construct this mystical labour of love. Salmon pink, colonial blue, Edwardian vanilla and jade were the hues picked to glorify the narration of tales from the ancient period.

When the inspirations for the collection are the draping styles of the Buddhist monks with the multiple layers and interesting waist belts; then the look has to be serene, spiritual and sophisticated. Divyam Mehta's 'The Black Monk' collection at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 had subtle glamour. With the collection predominantly in black and cement grey, the effortless styling was interpreted with layered drapes, skirts, and relaxed wide leg monk trousers. Divyam also took a hint of inspiration from the artworks of French artist Jean Degottex to give a more comprehensive angle to his theme and designs.

The delicate Shibori patterns and interesting block prints gave an innovative texturing to the handloom wool and matka silks. But it was the imaginative Kantha work from Bengal and the thread embroidery that finally completed the ethereal look. The menswear started with a fluid kurta and loose trousers, black/ white coat, cropped/crushed shirt and dhoti pants. The low buttoned double-breasted jacket with draped baggy pants was an interesting addition. The cowled waistcoat worn with matching pants and jacket was an unusual version; while the Sherwani/shawl and bundi/kurta combos with asymmetric lapels and the black/white poncho with low-crotch pleated pant further confirmed the theme of the show.

When it comes to the colourful fantasy of digital prints, Ajay Kumar is the master of the genre. For Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, the designer's 'Bhu-Svah' collection was inspired by the beauty, culture, flora, and fauna of India. The collection brought to the forefront the sustainability of style with the use of natural fabrics."
The women behind the petitions: ‘Historic day for all Muslim women in India’,"Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq in Mumbai on Tuesday. Prashant Nadkar Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq in Mumbai on Tuesday. Prashant Nadkar

Outside the cramped lawyer’s chamber on the Supreme Court premises where Shayara Bano was sitting, journalists were interviewing every Muslim woman willing to share their stories. Bano, the main petitioner in the triple talaq case, didn’t know many of them were being mistaken for her. The 36-year-old, now an MBA student, had become a key face of Muslim women’s fight for justice. Her face gave away no signs of the recent victory, that came after a fight of more than a year. But she was not at a loss for words. “I am feeling very good. I hugged my family when the verdict came, they congratulated me, told me it was a historic day for Muslim women in India. We have been vindicated —not just I, for all those like me, even those who were not present, this is for all of them,” she told The Indian Express.

On the other side of the room, her brother Arshad Ali was busy taking calls from TV channels seeking interviews with her. For Shayara’s father Iqbal Ahmed, though, the verdict was just one small victory. “Now that triple talaq has been termed illegal, we have to get a similar judgment for nikah halala [which requires a divorced woman to first remarry another man if her former husband is willing to take her back] and polygamy. Then we have to wage a battle for codification of Muslim personal law in all matters concerning gender justice, from property rights to maintenance,” he said.

Iqbal, 58, an accountant in the Army, and his family live in a cantonment town in Kashipur tehsil of Uttarakhand. “I have seen women from my community falling victim to these practices in my hometown of Allahabad, but it was only when my own daughter was subject to triple talaq that I decided to challenge the practice,” he said.

Shayara was divorced by her husband of 15 years in December 2015 through a talaqnama that she received by post in her parents’ home. Two months later she moved the Supreme Court arguing “the Muslim husband’s right to ask for divorce by uttering talaq three times in a row is completely unilateral, unguided, absolute and has no rationale. It cannot be identified with Muslim culture and is not part of Muslim law.”

From a woman who came back to Kashipur battling infections after multiple abortions and depression, she is now a first-year student of MBA at Teerthanker Mahaveer University in Moradabad. And she does not want to marry. “I will become independent, build a career. Marriage is just not on my mind right now,” she said.

Iqbal and his wife Feroza Begum had always been clear that their daughter should never go back to her former husband. Shayara, however, vacillated since her two children, a boy and a girl, were in the custody of her husband Rizwan Ahmed, an Allahabad-based property dealer. Her father said the issue was laid to rest when Rizwan remarried a few months after Shayara filed her petition. In Allahabad, Rizwan was not at his home, which he is said to rent at Rs 3,000, and was unreachable by phone. His 14-year-old son was offering his prayers, his 12-year-old daughter sat with a book refusing to speak, and his second wife was apparently not in. Neighbours said Rizwan had been down with fever. “When he comes back, we will let you know. His phone has been switched off all day,” said Mashoor Ullah, another tenant in the building.

USS John S McCain collides with tanker in Singapore: All you need to know,"The USS John S. McCain is seen docked at Changi naval base after its accident on Monday in Singapore.

Ten US Navy sailors are missing and five injured after the USS John S McCain collided with a oil tanker early Monday morning, east of Singapore and the Strait of Malacca. This is the second accident involving a ship from the US Navy’s 7th Fleet, in the Pacific, in two months.

The guided-missile destroyer was on its way to Singapore on a routine port visit when it collided with the 83-meter (600-foot) Alnic MC, an oil and chemical tanker at 5.24 am. Out of the five injured soldiers, four were evacuated by a Singaporean navy helicopter to a hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries, while the fifth did not require further medical attention.

The destroyer sustained damage on its port side but headed to the port on its own. The tanker it collided with, sustained damage to a tank at the front above the waterline. However, none of its crew were injured and there are no reports of any oil spill. The tanker is also making its way to Singapore. According to Reuters, the ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore.

“Significant damage to the hull resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms. Damage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding,” said a statement issued by the US Navy.

Rescue operations are in full swing with efforts being put in collectively by US military helicopters as well as Singaporean coast guards and Malaysian navies. In a tweet, Malaysia’s navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin said that two ships, as well as aircraft from its navy and air force, were helping with the search for the missing sailors. The Navy said Osprey aircraft and Seahawk helicopters from the USS America were assisting in the search.

President Donald Trump, responding to reporters questions about McCain said, “That’s too bad.” Post strong criticism, taking to Twitter, he said, “Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway.”

Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway. http://t.co/DQU0zTRXNU — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2017

The ship is named after US Sen. John McCain’s father and grandfather, who were both US admirals and is based at the 7th Fleet’s homeport of Yokosuka, Japan. It was commissioned in 1994 and has a crew of 23 officers, 24 chief petty officers and 291 enlisted sailors, according to the Navy’s website. The warship is 154 meters (505 feet) in length. The Alnic MC is a 183-meter (600-foot) oil and chemical tanker. McCain said on Twitter that he and his wife, Cindy, are “keeping America’s sailors aboard the USS John S McCain in our prayers tonight _ appreciate the work of search & rescue crews.”

There was no immediate explanation for the collision, and the Navy said an investigation would be conducted.

India vs Sri Lanka: No more national anthems before remaining ODIs,"The series between India and Sri Lanka will no longer witness the two teams singing their respective national anthems in the remaining ODI’s. (Source: PTI) The series between India and Sri Lanka will no longer witness the two teams singing their respective national anthems in the remaining ODI’s. (Source: PTI)

The India vs Sri Lanka one-day series will no longer witness the practice of, two teams, singing their respective national anthems. However, the first T20 encounter between the two will once again see the two teams recite their anthems. The latest development was confirmed by Sri Lanka cricket team’s media manager Dinesh Ratnasingham.

“We have adopted the practice of singing National Anthem only at the beginning of each format of the game”, Dinesh Ratnasingham said while speaking to pakobserver.com.

“The practice of singing National Anthem was followed in the first ODI (on Sunday at Dambulla) and again it will be sung at the R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo before the commencement of the only T-20 match (6th September) on this tour. Rest of the venues will have the immediate start of the match without the Anthem Ceremony”, he added.

It may be recalled here that in the first ODI, both India and Sri Lanka had sung their national teams. But henceforth, with the adoption of this measure, national anthems will only be sung in the first ODI of the series.

Meanwhile, in the first ODI, India registered a thumping win over Sri Lanka by 9 wickets. Axar Patel picked up three wickets to restrict the hosts for a mere 216. However, Shikhar Dhawan stole the show with a brilliant unbeaten 132 of just 90 deliveries. He was ably supported by skipper Virat Kohli who scored 82 of just 70 balls. Together they forged a partnership of 197 which is the second highest stand for India against Sri Lanka. It was also India’s biggest win in terms of balls to spare.

Alastair Cook remains threat to Sachin Tendulkar’s record,"Alastair Cook scored 243 in first Test against West Indies. (Source: Reuters) Alastair Cook scored 243 in first Test against West Indies. (Source: Reuters)

Sachin Tendulkar’s record of most Test runs and most Test matches played are something (of many!) that put him apart. His absolute awe inspiring numbers of playing 200 Tests and then calling it a day in a splendid career spanning 24 years will leave anyone’s jaw dropped. His Test runs tally of 15,921 with 51 centuries at an average of 53.78 only add to the legend of the Master Blaster and the herculean task it must have been to dismiss him.

There are many more legends of the sport behind him – Ricky Ponting (13,378 runs), Jacques Kallis (13,289 runs), Rahul Dravid (13,288 runs), Kumar Sangakkara (12,400 runs), Brian Lara (11,953 runs), Shivnarine Chanderpaul (11,867 runs), Mahela Jayawardene (11,814 runs) and then comes the only player who can surpass Tendulkar’s record – Alastair Cook (11,568 runs). Only Cook is the player who is still around and playing the sport. And he remains the only threat to Sachin’s record which was set four years back when the Indian batsman played his last against West Indies.

With the current numbers, Cook stands 4,353 runs behind Sachin’s tally and given the England batsman’s propensity to hit the bowlers around, the odds of the total being surpassed don’t look too grim. There are multiple things that go in Cook’s favour – he is 32 years old and comes up to bat at the top of the order. He gave a perfect example of what he can do to mediocre bowling by scoring 243 runs against West Indies in the opening day-night Test at Edgbaston. Further, England play at least 15 Tests in a single calendar year (they played 17 in 2016) which gives lots of room to breach the tally.

Additionally, Cook has his sight firmly focused on Test matches. His last T20I came in 2009 and ODI in 2014. His intention is clear – keep an eye on the longest format of the game. Should Cook play for four or five more years, which is expected given how long cricketers play for, he can quite easily surpass Sachin’s record.

"Little doubt that Umar Akmal is alleging Micky Arthur of abusing out of frustration, says Aamer Sohail","Umar Akmal had accused Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur of abusing him. Umar Akmal had accused Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur of abusing him.

Pakistan isn’t new to controversy in cricket and former Test opener Aamer Sohail believes that the allegations made by batsman Umar Akmal against coach Micky Arthur is the latest to hit them. He said that there is lot of promise shown by Akmal in his career but whatever he is doing now is out of frustration.

“It appears that there is a new controversy brewing in Pakistan cricket with Umar Akmal’s allegations of abusive language used by Pakistan Head Coach Mickey Arthur. In my view, there is little doubt in the fact that Umar Akmal is doing this out of frustration at the manner in which his career is progressing so far.

“There was a lot of promise in his career at the onset but that has failed to materialize and not been fulfilled,” Pakpassion.net quoted Sohail as saying.

Akmal had alleged that the Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur had abused him and dropped him from Champions Trophy squad. He was also not allowed to take the fitness Test at the NCA.

But, Sohail also said that Pakistan Cricket Board have failed to provide any support to the batsmen who could have been mentored.

“The PCB on their part have also been lax in the way they have failed to provide support to the batsman. If he had any drawbacks or faults in his skills or personality, then they should have mentored him in a proper way.

“If you compare Pakistan to other countries in the world, talented players are given attention and work done with them not only on cricketing aspects but also on matters related to off the field as well,” he said.

PCB backed Arthur and blasted Akmal for false accusations against the coach. In a statement released on Friday, PCB said that Akmal was attempting to deviate attention away from his own failures.

“While making frivolous allegations against the national team management, Umar has made a bogus attempt to deviate attention from his own failings. Umar was given as many as seven chances to improve his fitness and match the standards of his teammates, laid out by the team management.”

The 50-year-old said that Akmal’s chances of making a comeback under Arthur have gone down after the latest outburst.

“I also believe that Umar Akmal’s chances of making a comeback into this team under the current Head Coach have been greatly diminished by his outburst as now there may be an element of personal like or dislike in selection matters. His international career will now go on hold but really what he should have done is to work hard on all aspects of his cricket which were identified as weak by others and followed that route to come back into the team,” he added.

"Billy Payne retires as Masters, Augusta National chairman","Billy Payne announced on Wednesday that he is retiring as chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club. (Source: AP) Billy Payne announced on Wednesday that he is retiring as chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club. (Source: AP)

Billy Payne is retiring as chairman of Augusta National and the Masters, ending 11 years of substantial change that included the club having its first female members and playing a leading role in growing the game around the world.

Payne officially retires on Oct. 16 when the club opens for a new season.

“There are two people that matter here _ Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones,” Payne said of the Augusta National co-founders. “The rest of us are custodians. We do our best to first embrace, and thereafter hopefully to advance their philosophies for this club and for the game of golf _ their obsession for detail, their passion to be the best. And I’ve done that now for a considerable number of years.”

Payne will be succeeded by Fred Ridley, a former U.S. Amateur champion and USGA president who is chairman of the Masters competition committee. Ridley will be the seventh chairman, and the first to have played in the Masters.

Payne stays on as chairman emeritus.

He ends a remarkable career marked by two sporting events in which he had little previous experience. Payne, 69, had never been to the Olympics when he led a long-shot bid to bring the Summer Games to Atlanta in 1996, relying heavily on corporate support and showing early signs of his feelings for diversity and inclusion with whom he selected to serve on the Atlanta organizing committee. Two of the first five were women.

Payne, who did not take up golf until his adult years, was invited to join Augusta National in 1997, a year after he concluded his work with the Atlanta Games. He became media chairman of the Masters three years later, and he was Hootie Johnson’s choice to succeed him as chairman in 2006.

He spent 11 years blending his ideas for progress with the traditions of a club that dates to 1931. As chairman, he ruled more with an open mind than an iron fist. He spoke openly about the support of his staff, and of the members.

Ten years after Johnson stubbornly stood his ground under pressure to have female members, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore joined Augusta National in 2012.

That was but a small part of Payne’s influence over the club and that Masters.

Wanting to expand the reach of golf, he worked with the R&A to start the Asia-Pacific Amateur, awarding the winner a spot in the Masters. The idea was to create heroes in an emerging market. The second winner was Hideki Matsuyama of Japan, who now is No. 2 in the world. The USGA and R&A joined with Augusta National’s next venture, the Latin America Amateur.

Payne also brought in the USGA and PGA of America to start the Drive, Chip and Putt competition, which attracts children all over the country to compete in golf skills, with the finals held at Augusta National on the Sunday before the Masters.

Payne considers those grow-the-game initiatives and enhancing the experience and camaraderie for club members the two achievements that bring him the most pride.

“It’s pretty clear that both our founders were proponents and advocates and lovers of the game of golf,” he said. “What has changed lately is that we have significantly more resources to fulfill objectives that they had from the very early years. So all these `grow-the-game initiatives,’ it’s nothing new at Augusta National. It’s just that one day we said, `Let’s make a bigger investment.”’

The investments included work at the home of the Masters.

The club has scooped up land around the perimeter and turned Augusta National into more of a campus than a golf course. That includes free parking for the spectators, and the opening of Berckmans Place, a state-of-the-art hospitality area just beyond the fifth fairway.

Payne loves to tell the story of how his father would always ask him, “Did you do your best?” Payne says he never felt he could answer affirmatively, which drove him to a relentless work ethic in bringing the Olympics to Atlanta and in his role as Augusta National chairman.

“Yes, there’s a striving for perfection,” Payne said. “Striving for perfection is truly an obsession here, in the context of the Masters. We want to be able to provide for our patrons, our fans around the world, the absolute best sporting experience they have ever encountered. And we go to extremes to try to do that.”

Augusta National last year added a two-story press building, the latest and most grandiose of buildings it has created with the Southern architectural style that Payne feels fans around the world have come to expect when they think of Augusta National and the Masters.

“We never get it quite right,” he said. “But man, we try hard.”

Payne was the first chairman who had never met either Jones or Roberts.

Ridley first met Roberts when he played the Masters in 1976 as the U.S. Amateur champion. Like Payne, his background is in real estate law. Payne recalls that when he began his tenure as chairman, his predecessor told him the most important job he faced was finding his own successor.

“This honor … is too great for one person to claim as their own for too long a period of time,” Payne said. “I retire knowing it is simply the right thing to do _ and at the right moment _ to open the door and invite someone new to be called upon to lead.”

"Libya’s former PM Ali Zeidan kidnapped in Tripoli, say family members","Since Kadhafi’s fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country. Since Kadhafi’s fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

Libya’s former prime minister Ali Zeidan has been kidnapped by an armed group in war-torn Tripoli and not been heard from in nine days, family members and friends said today. Zeidan, who became premier in November 2012, was dismissed by Libya’s parliament in March 2014 amid accusations that public funds had been embezzled. He left the country soon afterwards, in defiance of a travel ban issued by the attorney general.

Zeidan had returned to Libya in early August for the first time since his dismissal and was planning a Tripoli press conference to respond to his critics, according to Karam Khaled, a friend who accompanied him. He said the former premier’s visit had been coordinated with Fayez al-Sarraj, premier in the country’s United Nations-backed Government of National Accord.

“It was the GNA that prepared the visit, including protocol at the airport and the hotel reservation,” Khaled said. He said an armed group’s first attempt to seize Zeidan on August 12 was foiled by hotel guards.

He said the gunmen were from the GNA-linked Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade, a militia of former rebels from the NATO-backed 2011 uprising that led to the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. “Gunmen from the same group returned the next day and we were obliged to hand them Zeidan,” Khaled said.

“Since then, we have had no information on where he is being held or his condition,” he said, criticising the “silence” of the unity government. The ex-prime minister’s son Zeidan Zeidan said the family had no news of his father’s whereabouts. “We have nothing so far,” he said by phone from the United Arab Emirates, where he lives.

He said his father’s lawyer had told him no court cases had been brought against the former premier. “This was indeed a kidnapping and not an arrest,” he said, adding that the family is worried for the health of his father, who is 67.

In October 2013, gunmen seized the then premier from Tripoli’s luxury Corinthia Hotel, but he was released after several hours. Since Kadhafi’s fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

Pep Guardiola left frustrated after Manchester City’s missed chances,"Pep Guardiola could not disguise his frustration with his side’s failure to convert their chances. (Source: Reuters) Pep Guardiola could not disguise his frustration with his side’s failure to convert their chances. (Source: Reuters)

It was a familiar tale for Manchester City — waves of attacks, relentless pressure but missed chances meant Pep Guardiola’s side needed an 82nd minute equaliser from Raheem Sterling to earn a 1-1 draw at home to Everton.

In City’s defence, they had to play the entire second half with 10 men after full-back Kyle Walker was shown a red card on the stroke of halftime.

But while pleased with the spirit his team showed, City’s Spanish coach could not disguise his frustration with his side’s failure to convert their chances.

“The second half we made a good performance, similar like last season when we played them here. We created the chances in the first half but we did not finish them,” said Guardiola.

“We created chances, before their goal, three or four… our amount of opportunities on target or close to target was good, we were there all the time but we never gave up.

“All you can do is try to create the chances. Maybe one day it will change. I think last season we were the team who made the most chances,” added the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach.

Everton manager Ronald Koeman said despite the disappointment of conceding a late equaliser he was pleased with a point from a difficult trip.

“When you play at City it is always tough, how they play, how they try to play but I think the gameplan was perfect, we had a good defensive organisation… it was really tough, we had good man-marking.

“But with the quality they have they will always create chances and you need to be a little bit lucky,” he said. That luck perhaps came with the red card for Walker but Everton faced relentless pressure from a City team down a man.

“We scored the goal, of course I am disappointed now to be one-nil up, 11 against 10, but I think we did wrong thing in the second half, we played too much long ball,” said the Dutchman.

“It is a good point. I am happy, we worked hard for that point.”

India faced disappointment in the first round of US Open qualifiers with both players in action on the opening day crashing out early. Yuki Bhambri and Prajnesh Gunneswaran both were defeated in their first round matches at Flushing Meadows reducing India’s hopes of seeing an Indian in the singles department to just one – Ramkumar Ramanathan. Bhambri’s loss came as a surprise considering how well he had been playing on the US hard courts.

Bhambri lost 6-4, 1-6, 3-6 to number 22 seed Japan’s Go Soeda in a match lasting an hour and 44 minutes. Meanwhile Prajnesh lost 1-6, 4-6 to Germany’s Yannick Hanfmann.

Now the onus falls firmly on Ramkumar to keep India’s flag flying when he takes on France’s Paul-Henri Mathieu.

There was disappointment for more Indians in the United States on Tuesday as newly formed pairing of Leander Paes and Purav Raja lost in the first round of the Winston-Salem Open. Raja chose to partner with Paes to qualify for the tournament and the upcoming US Open after his usual partner of Divij Sharan and him dropped some crucial points earlier this season.

Trump blames media for condemnation of comments on Virginia,"“You know where my heart is,” Trump said. “I’m only doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.” said Trump at the Charlottesville protest. “You know where my heart is,” Trump said. “I’m only doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.” said Trump at the Charlottesville protest.

President Donald Trump blamed the media Tuesday for the widespread condemnation of his response to a Charlottesville, Virginia, protest organized by white supremacists that led to the killing of a counter-protester.

Trump opened his political rally in Phoenix with a call for unity, saying, “What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America and tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs that perpetrated hatred and violence.”

But he quickly trained his ire on the media, shouting that he “openly called for healing unity and love” in the immediate aftermath of Charlottesville and claiming the media had misrepresented him. He read from his three responses to the violence _ getting more animated with each one.

Democrats and fellow Republicans had denounced Trump for placing blame for the Charlottesville violence on “both sides.” Trump omitted that part of his reaction from his recap Tuesday night.

“You know where my heart is,” Trump said. “I’m only doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.”

After the rally, a day of noisy but largely peaceful protests outside the Phoenix convention center turned unruly as police fired pepper spray at crowds after someone apparently lobbed rocks and bottles at officers.

Trump spoke after Vice President Mike Pence and others called repeatedly for unity.

Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Dr. Alveda King, the niece of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., were among the openers. Franklin Graham, son of the evangelist Billy Graham, led the rally-goers in prayer, saying, “We’re divided racially, and we’re adrift morally.”

Trump teased a pardon for former sheriff Joe Arpaio, asking the crowd what they thought of him. Loud cheers erupted. The former Maricopa County sheriff is awaiting sentencing after his conviction in federal court for disobeying court orders to stop his immigration patrols.

“So was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” Trump asked. “I’ll make a prediction: I think he’s going to be just fine.”

Earlier, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump wouldn’t discuss or take action on a pardon “at any point today,” even though the president had told Fox News he was considering it.

Trump said at the rally that the only reason he wouldn’t pardon Arpaio from the stage was to avoid controversy for the moment.

In the comfort of his most fervent fans, Trump often resurrects his free-wheeling 2016 campaign style, pinging insults at perceived enemies such as the media and meandering from topic to topic without a clear theme. Although Trump’s high-profile warm-up acts suggested the president’s speech would be about unity, the president was more intent on settling scores. And the tone of the event took on a combative tone.

At one point, the president threatened to shut down the federal government unless Congress, mired in gridlock over spending bills, agrees to provide funding for the border wall he wants to have built between the United States and Mexico.

Trump told the crowd, he said he has a message for “obstructionist” Democrats. “If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall.”

He skewered both of Arizona’s Republican senators _ but coyly refused to mention their names, describing his own restraint as “very presidential.”

Instead, Trump bemoaned that the Senate was only “one vote away” from passing a health care overhaul. Sen. John McCain, who is undergoing treatment for an aggressive form of brain cancer, voted against a Republican health care bill.

Trump called another unnamed senator “weak on borders, weak on crime.” Trump has lashed out at Sen. Jeff Flake, a frequent critic, using the same language in the past.

The president tweeted last week: “Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He’s toxic!” Flake has been on tour promoting his book that says the Republican Party’s embrace of Trump has left conservatism withering.

Ward attended Trump’s rally, but did not appear onstage.

In a modest but telling swipe at Ward _ and, by extension, at Trump _ the Senate Leadership Fund, a political committee closely aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is spending $10,000 on digital ads that say of her, “Not conservative, just crazy ideas.”

Trump began his Arizona visit with a brief trip to the southern edge of the country.

While touring a Marine Corps base in Yuma that is a hub of operations for the U.S. Border Patrol, Trump inspected a drone and other border equipment on display in a hangar.

Trump shook his head as he was shown a series of everyday objects, such as a fire extinguisher, that had been refashioned to secretly transport drugs across the border. Afterward, he spent about 20 minutes greeting service members in the grueling, 106-degree heat, signing caps with his “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan and posing for selfies on the tarmac just steps from Air Force One.

Despite a great start to the new season of the English Premier League after a rather lackluster season, Manchester United’s midfielder Juan Mata said that they would not read too much into it yet.

Jose Mourinho’s men currently stand on top of the table with six points and most number of goals. They faced West Ham and Swansea City in 2017-18 season, defeating both the teams by 4-0. Mata, in his weekly blog wrote, “In terms of football, the week ends with a very good feeling again, following another convincing victory, although perhaps the score was too high.”

“One thing is for sure, we have reasons to be happy with the confidence and determination that we are showing on the pitch, but we also know that this is just the beginning.”

“The next weekend we have a new opportunity to keep gaining momentum, this time against Leicester, always a tough opponent,” said the Spaniard. “It would be great to take the first international break of the season with nine points out of nine.”

New signing from Everton has impressed critics and fans alike with his performance, having scored a brace in his debut.

In recent reports, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to sign a new contract with the Old Trafford side. He was the leading goal-scorer of last season, despite missing most of the second half due to injury.

"‘So lucky, you know… I will be first engineering graduate from my tribe’","C Kalyani (left) and roommate R Soumika on the JNTU campus. Sreenivas Janyala C Kalyani (left) and roommate R Soumika on the JNTU campus. Sreenivas Janyala

There is a spring in C Kalyani’s step as she walks out of the girls’ hostel on the sprawling, leafy campus of Jawaharlal Nehru Technology University (JNTU) at Sulthanpur in Telangana. It is her first day in college. The diminutive girl is the first from her vanishing community, the Primitive Tribal Group (PTG) Thoti, to go to an engineering college.

“I cannot believe that I am here on this huge and beautiful campus and such a great college. I am so lucky, you know? It is a dream come true,” she says. She arrived at the campus earlier this month to complete the formalities for joining. “This is the first time I am staying so far away from home. It is a six-hour drive to my home from here,” says Kalyani, who belongs to Dubarpet in Adilabad district.

“I am happier because my roommate happens to be a friend from the tribal coaching centre,” she says. Her roommate, R Soumika, is from the Lambada community and has joined electronics and communications engineering. Kalyani, who aims to become a scientist, has opted for material science and nanotechnology engineering. She is eagerly waiting for classes to start.

“Especially maths, I love it,” she says. “I like the regimen here. Breakfast is at 8 am at the dining hall, then it’s back to room to get ready to go to classes at 10. At 1:30 we will break for lunch and go back at 2 and study again till 4:30. Then, back to the room. I am loving it already.” Fighting against various odds including poverty in their communities,Kalyani and Soumika made it up to Intermediate, then were selected for coaching for JEE and Engineering Agricultural Medical Common Entrance Test (Eamcet) along with 28 other tribal students at Telangana’s tribal students’ welfare residential schools in Adilabad district under a special coaching programme called Star-30. The tribal students cracked JEE Main, JEE Advanced (for IITs) or Eamcet to secure admission to top engineering colleges.

Kalyani says her father C Krishna, a labourer, struggled to send her to school. “He wept for joy when I told him I had made it to engineering college. No girl in my tribe has studied beyond class V. Boys drop out after X. But I insisted I want to study and my father struggled hard to pay school fees and buy books,” she says. “I will be the first engineering graduate from my community. My brother is in second year Intermediate and sister is in VII. I did not get much time to prepare for JEE but I passed Eamcet. I am lucky to get admission to a top college like JNTU.’’

At a time when populations of forest-dwelling tribal communities are dwindling across the country, seven boys and girls from three primitive and vanishing tribes of Telangana created history this year by becoming the first from their communities to join engineering colleges – Pujari Adharsh, Pudari Srinivas, P Pavan Kalyan, M Pushpalatha from the PTG Manne community, and K Ramatha and A Parmeshwar from PTG Kolam, besides Kalyani from PTG Thoti. Counselling ended last fortnight. In another first, two boys from the Lambada community got admissions in IIT Varanasi and VNIT Nagpur.

Mancherial district collector R V Karnan, Adilabad DC Dr Jyothi Buddha Prakash, and in-charge Anura Jayanthi were given Telangana Excellence Awards on Independence Day for the project Star-30. Less than 2,000 people each of the three PTG groups live in Telangana. Most of them live in tribal hamlets on the periphery of forests in Adilabad and Karimnagar districts. Literacy levels are very low and most of them work as farm labour.

Last Tuesday, Adharsh joined JNTU at Karimnagar, opting for information technology. He ranked 2594th in JEE in the ST category. Hailing from Ippalaguda, a tribal settlement in Kouthala mandal of the newly created Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, Adharsh made it through extreme poverty. His father P Buchaiah, who used to work as a farm labourer, was paralysed three years ago and remains bedridden now while his mother Sharada now works for daily wages.

“After I passed JEE, someone gave me a cheque for Rs 10,000. I added another Rs 500 and paid the fees of Rs 10,500 at JNTU. I borrowed another Rs 5,000 and paid hostel fees,” Adharsh says. “When I started from my village to go to college, my mother had just Rs 100 which she gave me for bus fare. I am hoping the government will reimburse the fees and I will be able to pay fees next year.”

In his community, few study beyond class X. “Girls drop out after V. Until I joined special coaching camp, I did not know about IIT or Eamcet,” he says. “There were many reasons including severe financial hardships for me, too, to drop out. It was constant encouragement from my teachers and Mancherial district collector and ITDA project officer R V Karnan that I made it this far,’’ he said.

Pavan Kalyan’s parents work as labourers in Kompalle village in Mancherial district. “My maths teacher in junior college told me about the coaching camp for tribal students started by Karnan. Until then I did not know about IIT,” he says. “I could not clear it but cracked Eamcet because of the coaching. I got admission at CMR College of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad,” he says.

Srinivas, also of the Manne tribal group like Adharsh and Pavan, cleared JEE Advanced. He wants to start an IT start-up company after his engineering. “As soon as I make some money, I want to adopt my village Nambal in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district and set up schools and a college. I want to arrange free coaching to my village students to compete in all-India entrance tests,” he says. Srinivas has joined electronics and communication engineering in Arjun College of Science and Technology. His father P Ganesh works as a farm labourer.

Ramatha is the first woman from her Kolam community to get admission in an engineering college. Her brother Jyotiram became the first man to go to college when he got a seat in B Ed recently. Ramatha got a seat at Kakatiya Institute of Technology and Science for Women at Nizamabad on Monday. Hailing from Arkapur village in Nizamabad district, her father Atram Abhiman, a poor farmer, was in a quandary initially. “I can pay fees for only one of them. I don’t have enough money to send both my son and daughter to college. I am very happy that my daughter has been offered a seat in a top engineering college, and she is the first in our small community, but I may not be able to afford the fees,” Abhiman says. A week later, he borrowed and paid for Ramatha’s fees.

“There are only 2,000 people of my tribal community left in,” Ramatha says. “Most of them still live in hamlets in forests or on the periphery, mostly working as farm labour. They do not know anything about engineering or medical colleges or IIT or EAMCET. Their life just revolves around ensuring one proper meal a day. The coaching given to students in tribal schools will change the lives of tribal students for ever. I want to complete my computer science engineering course.” S Bujangarao of the Gond community got admission at VNIT at Nagpur in metallurgical and materials science engineering after becoming the first Gond to clear JEE. Although three students from the Lambada community cracked JEE last year, this year Badavath Rajender secured a better rank and went to VNIT.

AHEAD OF verdict in a rape case against Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, hospitals across the Tricity have been put on alert, officials said on Tuesday. While the Haryana health department officials said that they had decided to depute additional staff in Panchkula civil hospital, the Chandigarh and Mohali authorities maintain hospitals have been put on alert for the next few days.

“We are geared up to deal with any situation. The staff at civil hospital is on high alert and additional doctors will be deputed on August 24 and 25,” Panchkula Civil Surgeon V K Bansal told Chandigarh Newsline on Tuesday. “At the general hospital, we have kept rooms reserved in ICU and other areas.” The health department has brought 10 ambulances from different districts and they have been deployed in Panchkula. “So far we had called 10 ambulances, but on Tuesday evening in a meeting it was decided to bring more ambulances from other places,” Dr Bansal said.

He said that on August 24 and 25, specialists, including surgeons, orthopaedics would remain available at the hospital round the clock. According to the Haryana health department, they have also named four nodal officers at Panchkula hospital, who have been asked to coordinate with the other departments.

On Tuesday, Chandigarh health department officials said that they received information from their Haryana counterparts. “We have been asked to keep 10 beds reserved at GMSH in Sector 16,” said Chandigarh Director Health Service Rakesh Kashyap. “The department will keep all its civil hospitals on alert to tackle any emergency situation. Every kind of support will be provided to Haryana health department.”

Dr A K Janmeja, director principal of GMCH in Sector 32, said that they too received a communication from the authorities to remain alert in view of the court verdict. However, Mohali civil surgeon Rita Bhardwaj said, “So far we have not received any communication. But in the district, we have put our medical staff on alert and we are prepared to tackle any situation.”

Skin care regime for new mothers,"It is very important for new mothers to take care of their skin after pregnancy (Source: File Photo) It is very important for new mothers to take care of their skin after pregnancy (Source: File Photo)

During and after pregnancy, every part of your body needs extra care and attention. Hormonal changes, stretched skin and sweat can sometimes trigger painful skin conditions that may cause discomfort and irritation. Experts suggest these are managed right from the time they appear.

Subhashini N.S., Natural Product Innovations, Research and Development, The Himalaya Drug Company and Hema Divakar, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, share a few common conditions and tips to help keep skin hydrated and moisturised:

Some of the common conditions you may experience during and after pregnancy are acne, rashes, stretch marks and dry skin. It is important to care of them.

* Choose a mild yet effective body butter which has ingredients like cocoa butter, a natural antioxidant that soothes, hydrates and balances the skin.

* Choose a moisturiser with invigorating fragrances of rose, lavender, or jasmine that help relax the mind.

* Body butter helps to replenish and moisturise the skin more effectively than lotions, keeping the skin hydrated for longer.

* Avoid wearing synthetic and rough materials that cause rash and irritation on the skin.

* Avoid using strong soaps, instead use mild, moisturising soap which prevents the post bath dryness.

* During the initial days of breastfeeding, you may experience sore and cracked nipples. Use products with natural ingredients that are especially enriched with virgin coconut oil that helps protect the skin from cracks and fissures.

* Massage your skin daily with oil that is enriched with sesame oil, known for its skin firming properties.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Haryana Steelers pip Dabang Delhi in a thrilling encounter,"Haryana Steelers registered 27-25 win over Dabang Delhi. (Source: AP) Haryana Steelers registered 27-25 win over Dabang Delhi. (Source: AP)

It was the first time that Haryana Steelers dominated a game from the word go. Deepak Kumar Dhaiya proved to be salient for the Steelers as they registered a narrow 27-25 win over Dabang Delhi in Lucknow. However, a late surge from Meraj Sheykh brought his side back into the game before Steelers sealed the game by taking the Delhi captain down in the left corner.

While Surender Nada and Mohit Chhillar commanded Haryana to a strapping start, the debutants forced the first all out on Delhi in the seventh minute itself. Haryana Steelers were cruising smoothly while Delhi raiders found it difficult in breaking through Steelers’ defence. The score at half time was 17-9.

With Haryana dominating most of the game, Delhi managed to recover with Meraj Sheykh’s successful raid in the third minute of the second half. Meraj’s full body dive in the do-or-die raid not only got them two points but sent Nada and Mohit out of the mat. With both the key defenders taken off, Haryana were soon forced an all-out.

If the first few minutes of the second half belonged to Haryana, the latter minutes were Delhi’s. The momentum shifted to Delhi with Abolfazl Maghsodlou coming into support of Meraj. The Iranian duo brought the score to 19-19. Which was followed by back to back successful raids from Meraj bringing Delhi into the game.

In the dying minutes of the game, Haryana surged ahead picking two quick points and took full advantage of Meraj’s unsuccessful raid to register their third win and move to second spot in Zone A points table.

Injury concerns might rule out Sam Whiteman for 2017/18 season,"Sam Whiteman is in doubt for the entire Australian summer. (Source: AP) Sam Whiteman is in doubt for the entire Australian summer. (Source: AP)

25-year old Australian wicketkeeper, Sam Whiteman is in doubt for the entire Australian summer due to complications that have arisen from a serious finger injury. It may be recalled here that Whiteman fractured his right index finger during Perth Scorchers’ Big Bash League final.

In a statement released the WA Cricket Association(WACA) said, “Sam Whiteman is continuing to experience ongoing pain and swelling in his left index finger related to the complex intra-articular fracture he sustained in the BBL|06 final. To date, surgical intervention and targeted rehabilitation has been unable to reduce the pain he is experiencing to a satisfactory level for state level wicketkeeping”.

“WACA Sports Medicine Staff and Sam are consulting further with hand specialists in the coming week and will soon be in a position to make a decision on the future direction of Sam’s management. At this stage a timeframe for his return to play is unknown although further surgical intervention is being considered.”

Meanwhile, former Australian batsman, Justin Langer rued the setback and said, “It’s really unfortunate, he’s had two surgeries now on his finger. He’s seeing another surgeon in a week’s time to maybe have a look at having another operation. “So he could be having extended period out.

“For such a talented kid, who’s played in three Scorchers finals for us, he’s been part of Shield finals and (WA’s 2014-15) Matador Cup win, we’re going to look at the bigger picture for him.”, Langer concluded.

Premier League clubs smash own transfer spending record,"Romelu Lukaku was picked up by Manchester United from Everton. (Source: Reuters) Romelu Lukaku was picked up by Manchester United from Everton. (Source: Reuters)

Premier League clubs have broken their own spending record for the transfer window, a sports analyst group said on Wednesday, with more deals expected before business closes next Thursday.

Southampton’s 15 million pound ($19.19 million) purchase of Lazio centre back Wesley Hoedt brought the overall spend by England’s 20 elite clubs to 1.184.9 billion pounds, the respected website Sporting Intelligence said.

The figure exceeded the £1.18 billion pounds the clubs spent in last summer’s window.

Across the 20 clubs, net spending stands at 565 million pounds, with 619.9 million pounds received. The figures do not include add-ons or agent fees.

Although the biggest deal of the window was done by French club Paris St Germain, who paid Barcelona 222 million euros ($261.58 million) for Neymar, English clubs have rivalled them for overall spend with Manchester City (221.5 million pounds) leading the way, ahead of Manchester United (145.8) and Everton (139.9).

Barcelona could yet emerge as the biggest spending club, however, with British and Spanish media reporting they are about to table a 138 million pound bid, including add-ons, for Liverpool’s Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho.

The Spanish club have already paid China’s Guangzhou Evergrande 40 million euros for Paulinho and been heavily linked with a move for Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele.

Should the Coutinho deal go through, it would trigger a chain reaction with Liverpool reported to be interested in signing Southampton centre back Virgil van Dijk and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in deals that would exceed 100 million pounds.

Poverty-level of Indian-origin people in S Africa decreases,"The poverty level of Indian-origin people in South Africa has consistently decreased over the past two decades from almost 21 per cent to under six per cent, according to official data released on Tuesday. The South African-Indian community, with about 1.4-million people, are not far behind from their white counterparts, who enjoyed special privileges in the apartheid era and have a poverty rate of just one per cent.

Coloured (mixed race) and the majority black Africans are lagging way behind with 41 and 61 per cent respectively, latest results from Statistics South Africa (SSA) show.

Statistician-General Pali Lehohla released the ‘Poverty Trends in South Africa’ report which shows that despite the general decline in poverty between 2006 and 2011, overall poverty level in South Africa rose in 2015.

Black people continued to bear the brunt of poverty but that education remains the key to escaping poverty, Lehohla told reporters.

“Three out of five blacks are poor. Poor whites are (almost) non-existent. Indians moved… we could see this in the numbers when we talked about education. (Indians) caught up with whites in education, poverty dropped and education increased,” Lehola said.

“Unlike the other population groups, the proportion of poor Indians consistently decreased between 2006 and 2015, reporting a decrease of 71.8 per cent.

“It is worthwhile to note that the decrease between 2011 and 2015 was less pronounced than the decrease experienced between 2006 and 2011. Nevertheless, Indians appear to have made strong gains in the war on poverty,” the report said.

Once subjected to restrictive apartheid laws, the first indentured labourers who arrived in the country from 1860 placed huge emphasis on education, pooling resources from their often meagre wages to build their own schools and send children to universities.

This practice, continued by future generations, resulted in poverty levels getting decreased over the past 167 years, with the 20.9 per cent poverty among the 1.4 million citizens of Indian-origin in 2006 having dropped to 5.9 per cent in the latest survey, the report added.

"CJI in minority view: It is integral to Sunni Islam, consider a law","The CJI, who wrote for himself and Justice S Abdul Nazeer, said the practice has “the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution” and will “not be subjected to any challenge, even though they may seem to others (and even rationalists practising the same faith) unacceptable, in today’s world and age”. The CJI, who wrote for himself and Justice S Abdul Nazeer, said the practice has “the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution” and will “not be subjected to any challenge, even though they may seem to others (and even rationalists practising the same faith) unacceptable, in today’s world and age”.

Writing the minority ruling on the challenge to triple talaq, Chief Justice of India J S Khehar held that the practice is “a matter of personal law of Sunni Muslims, belonging to the Hanafi school” and “interference in matters of personal law is clearly beyond judicial examination”.

The CJI, who wrote for himself and Justice S Abdul Nazeer, said the practice has “the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution” and will “not be subjected to any challenge, even though they may seem to others (and even rationalists practising the same faith) unacceptable, in today’s world and age”.

The two judges said that judiciary must exercise “absolute restraint, no matter how compelling and attractive the opportunity to do societal good may seem”. “We therefore hereby direct the Union of India to consider appropriate legislation, particularly with reference to talaq-e-biddat. We hope and expect that the contemplated legislation will also take into consideration advances in Muslim personal law — Shariat, as have been corrected by legislation the world over, even by theocratic Islamic states,” they said.

To facilitate such a legislation, the two judges injuncted (stayed) Muslim men from pronouncing instant triple talaq. “The instant injunction shall, in the first instance, be operative for a period of six months. If the legislative process commences before the expiry of the period of six months, and a positive decision emerges towards redefining talaq-e-biddat… if it is decided that the practice of talaq-e-biddat be done away with altogether, the injunction would continue till legislation is finally enacted. Failing which, the injunction shall cease to operate,” they said.

Maintaining that “personal law has constitutional protection”, the judges said: “This protection is extended to personal law through Article 25 of the Constitution. It needs to be kept in mind that the stature of personal law is that of a fundamental right… personal law of every religious denomination is protected from invasion and breach, except as provided by and under Article 25.”

The two judges concluded that The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 was not a law in force within the meaning of Article 13(3)(b) of the Constitution, but was made to “preserve Muslim personal law — Shariat, as it existed from time immemorial”. The order sought to explain how the practice was “integral” to the Sunnis: “It constitutes a matter of their faith. It has been practised by them, for at least 1400 years.”

The minority ruling recalled that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which had challenged the petitioners, “had undertaken to issue an advisory” to Muslims getting married “to agree in the nikah-nama that their marriage would not be dissolvable by talaq-e-biddat… it would not be incorrect to assume that even the AIMPLB is on board to assuage the petitioner’s cause”.

The judges referred to the “aggressive posture” of the Union of India and said that “a call of conscience, as the petitioners desire us to accept, may well have a cascading effect. We say so, because the contention of the learned Attorney General was that talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan were also liable to be declared unconstitutional for the same reasons as have been expressed with reference to talaq-e-biddat”. The ruling noted the Centre’s “support” to the cause of the petitioners and wondered why it had not legislated on it so far. “Unfortunately, the Union seeks at our hands, what truly falls in its own,” the judges said.

NBA: Cleveland Cavaliers trade Kyrie Irving to Boston Celtics for Isaiah Thomas,"Kyrie Irving had demanded a trade to be the focal point of a team, something he couldn’t do alongside LeBron James. (Source: AP) Kyrie Irving had demanded a trade to be the focal point of a team, something he couldn’t do alongside LeBron James. (Source: AP)

Kyrie Irving was tired of being teammates with LeBron James. Now he has to figure out how to beat him. Cleveland’s All-Star guard, who asked owner Dan Gilbert to trade him earlier this summer, was dealt Tuesday night to the Boston Celtics for fellow All-Star Isaiah Thomas, forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Nets’ unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick.

“It’s extremely rare to trade for a 25-year-old player that’s done what he’s done, the offensive weapon that he is,” Celtics president Danny Ainge said. “We feel like his best basketball is still ahead of him.

“We have a player that’s proven to be a sure thing. We know how unpredictable the draft can be. You do pay a heavy price for a player of that age and that caliber.”

Irving, whose late 3-pointer helped Cleveland win the 2016 NBA championship – and the city’s first title since 1964 – is on his way to Boston, where he’ll join a Celtics team that lost to the Cavs in last season’s conference finals.

And as fate will have it, the Cavs will host the Celtics in their season opener on Oct. 17.

“Of course we know who our competition is, and we know who are biggest threats are each year,” Ainge said. “But we feel like this is a trade that can make us better, and that’s why we did it.”

The blockbuster deal caps a wild summer for the Cavs, who lost their title defense in five games to Golden State in June. Since then, general manager David Griffin left, the team failed to convince Chauncey Billups to join its front office and James has played with fans’ emotions with veiled postings on social media about his future.

Irving’s trade demand cast a shadow over the entire organization.

But Cleveland may have salvaged its offseason.

“This trade needed to include both players and assets that we felt strongly could help us continue to compete for championships and we believe it does,” said new general manager Koby Altman, who pulled off a deal that protects Cleveland’s present and future.

In Thomas, they’re getting a proven playmaker with a stellar reputation. The 5-foot-9 guard is one of the league’s most dynamic backcourt players with an uncanny ability to get to the basket. Irving may be the only better finisher among point guards.

The 28-year-old Thomas was taken with the final selection in the 2011 draft – 59 picks after Irving was picked first overall. But he has steadily scaled his way up to elite status.

Thomas’ reputation in Boston was cemented when he led the Celtics through the playoffs last season despite the death of his sister on the eve of the postseason. He also had a front tooth knocked out during the second-round series against Washington and a hip injury eventually forced the team to shut him down early in the East finals, won by the Cavaliers in five games.

“Isaiah had just an amazing season this year and entertained us all, the whole city of Boston. And everybody fell in love with him,” Ainge said. “He’s such an underdog because of his size and his heart and his spirit which he plays.”

Thomas is eligible for free agency next summer and believes he is worthy of a maximum contract. He has been quoted saying, “They better bring out the Brinks truck.”

Cleveland also is getting Crowder, a solid perimeter defender, and a first-round pick that Boston got from Brooklyn. The package could help the Cavs reload if James opts out of his contract next summer and leaves Cleveland for a second time.

The Cavs drafted Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in 2011. He struggled in his first few seasons but blossomed in recent years alongside James. However, that didn’t seem to be enough for the 25-year-old, who has wanted to be the focal point on his own team.

Asked about trading a fan favorite who rose from the depths of the draft for a player who asked out of a team with the NBA’s best player, one year removed from a championship, Ainge said he has done his homework.

“We feel comfortable with who Kyrie is and who he can be,” he said.

Minnesota showed some interest in Irving after his trade request became public, but were unwilling to part with young star Andrew Wiggins as the centerpiece of a deal. Wiggins is expected to sign a max contract extension in the coming weeks to stay with the Timberwolves.

The Phoenix Suns reportedly were not interested in parting with rookie Josh Jackson in a deal that also would have required Eric Bledsoe and the New York Knicks gave no indication that Kristaps Porzingis was ever on the table in a potential Irving trade.

Then the Celtics swooped in, landing the kind of star Ainge has long coveted. With the possibility of having to break the bank to retain Thomas next summer, Boston finally tapped into the treasure trove of assets that Ainge has assembled to get Irving, who is under contract for two more years.

Irving got his wish to get away from James, but he’s not free of him yet.

Former Libyan premier Ali Zeidan freed after nine-day kidnapping,"Ali Zeidan (File Photo) Ali Zeidan (File Photo)

An armed group has released former Libyan premier Ali Zeidan, nine days after he was kidnapped in Tripoli while making his first visit home for three years, a family member and friend said today. Zeidan, 67, who served as premier from November 2012 to March 2014, was snatched on August 13 from his hotel.

He was on his first visit to Tripoli since leaving the country following his ouster by parliament on charges of embezzling public funds. “Mr Zeidan was released on Tuesday night. He is in very good health and should be leaving Libya” on Wednesday, said Karam Khaled, a close friend.

He declined to give details on the release but has blamed a militia loyal to Libya’s UN-backed Government for National Accord (GNA) for the kidnapping. Zeidan Zeidan, a son of the former premier, said they had spoken several times on the telephone since his release.

“For the time being, we have no details on the circumstances of his detention,” he told AFP. “But the most important thing is that he’s very well and was not mistreated.” Zeidan returned to Libya in early August for the first time since his dismissal and was planning a Tripoli press conference to respond to the embezzlement charges, according to Khaled, who accompanied him.

He said the former prime minister’s visit had been coordinated with Fayez al-Sarraj, the current premier in the GNA. “It was the GNA that prepared the visit, including protocol at the airport and the hotel reservation,” Khaled said, adding that an armed group’s initial attempt to seize Zeidan on August 12 had been foiled by hotel guards.

In October 2013, gunmen seized then premier Zeidan from another hotel in the capital but he was released after several hours. Since a 2011 revolution that ousted longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have had to depend on rival militias battling for control of the country.

Matteo Trentin beat Spaniard Juan Jose Lobato in a final straight sprint to win stage four of the Vuelta A Espana on Tuesday when Chris Froome retained the overall lead.

Italian Quick-Step Floor rider Trentin completed a hat-trick of stage wins in grand tours, adding victory in the Vuelta to the Tour de France and the Giro d’Italia.

He rode the 198.2km route from Andorra’s Escaldes-Engordany to Tarragona, Catalonia in 4:43:57.

“I was really looking for this stage win because I’m really going well in this last part of the season,” Trentin told reporters.

“After my crash that spoiled my time in the Tour de France, I was just thinking about coming here and winning stages.”

This was Quick-Step’s second stage win of the Vuelta after Yves Lampaert took stage two.

Belgium’s Tom Van Asbroeck of Cannondale-Drapac came third.

Team Sky’s Froome stays in the red jersey after finishing in the bunch, leading David de la Cruz, Nicolas Roche and Tejay van Garderen by two seconds, with an overall time of 13:37:41.

The Briton is attempting to become the first rider to do a Tour de France and Vuelta double since Bernard Hinault in 1978, when the Spanish race took place earlier in the year instead of in gruelling August heat.

“It’s a great feeling to be back in red after six years,” said Froome. “It’s a huge privilege to be in this position. “We’ll get to tomorrow, tomorrow. I’m taking it one day at a time and just enjoying being in the red jersey.”

Iraq must ensure that women and girls subjected to sexual violence at the hands of Islamic State militants have access to justice and reparations, U.N. investigators said on Tuesday.

Thousands of people, predominantly from Iraq’s ethnic and religious minorities, have been subjected to sexual violence since Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of Iraq in 2014. The report pays particular attention to members of the country’s Yazidi community, who were kidnapped and forcibly converted, enslaved or conscripted to fight for the militants.

“Women and girls under the control of ISIL, in particular women from the Yazidi and other minority communities, have been especially vulnerable to abuses of human rights and violation of international humanitarian law,” the report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Iraq and the U.N. Human Rights Office said.

More than 6,800 Yazidis were kidnapped by Islamic State. About 3,000 of them are still believed to be held captive.

Victims must be provided with access to appropriate medical, psychosocial and financial support, the report said. “The physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension. If victims are to rebuild their lives, and indeed those of their children, they need justice and they need redress,” said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein.

The report, based on interviews with survivors, found that support for the victims must come with significant changes to the criminal justice system to prove effective. U.N. investigators highlighted gaps in the legal frameworks of both Iraq and Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish Region, which “largely fail to ensure the appropriate respect and protection of women and children who have been subjected to sexual and other forms of violence”. Iraq’s laws governing sexual and domestic violence offer inadequate protections for women, and would be an obstacle to the prosecution of Islamic State-related crimes, the report said.

The report comes three days after Iraqi security forces launched their offensive to retake the city of Tal Afar, one of the militant groups’ last remaining strongholds in Iraq. “With significant areas under the control of ISIL having been reclaimed, it is now urgent to consider what steps need to be taken to ensure the protection, recovery, reintegration and redress for the thousands of women and girls,” the report states.

Though the report focuses on crimes committed by Islamic State, it also references abuses committed by groups fighting against the militants. These include “revenge attacks” against women thought to have been affiliated with IS, sometimes sanctioned by tribal agreements.

Marriage licenses and birth certificates issued in IS-held territories are generally not recognized by Iraqi and Kurdish officials. The report recommends that this be rectified, to avoid leaving women and babies without legal status, particularly those born of sexual slavery. UNHCR has identified nearly 800 children whose births had been registered by Islamic State in areas under its control. Investigators found that men and boys had also been subjected to sexual violence by the militants.

Tuesday’s report builds on last year’s finding that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidi people. The rare designation under international law marked the first time genocide was recognized as being carried out by non-state actors.

Donald Trump warns Pakistan against providing safe havens to terrorists: Full text of his speech,"“In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter”, Donald Trump said. “In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter”, Donald Trump said.

Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, Deputy Secretary Shanahan, and Colonel Duggan. Most especially, thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer and every member of the United States military at home and abroad.We send our thoughts and prayers to the families of our brave sailors who were injured and lost after a tragic collision at sea, as well as to those conducting the search and recovery efforts.

I am here tonight to lay out our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. But before I provide the details of our new strategy, I want to say a few words to the servicemembers here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts, and to all Americans listening at home.

Since the founding of our republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage, and resolve is unmatched in human history. American patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our nation and for our freedom. Through their lives — and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality.

Donald Trump: India’s role critical in Afghanistan’s stability; Pakistan must stop sheltering terrorists

By following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal, and to remain one nation under God. The men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission, and one shared sense of purpose.

They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed, and color to serve together — and sacrifice together — in absolutely perfect cohesion. That is because all servicemembers are brothers and sisters. They’re all part of the same family; it’s called the American family. They take the same oath, fight for the same flag, and live according to the same law. They are bound together by common purpose, mutual trust, and selfless devotion to our nation and to each other.

The soldier understands what we, as a nation, too often forget that a wound inflicted upon a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together.

Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people. When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate.

The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other.

As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas — and we will always win — let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name that, when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one.

Thanks to the vigilance and skill of the American military and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of September 11th — and nobody can ever forget that — have not been repeated on our shores.

But we must also acknowledge the reality I am here to talk about tonight: that nearly 16 years after September 11th attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the American people are weary of war without victory. Nowhere is this more evident than with the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history — 17 years.

I share the American people’s frustration. I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly lives, trying to rebuild countries in our own image, instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.

That is why, shortly after my inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia.

My original instinct was to pull out — and, historically, I like following my instincts. But all my life I’ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you’re President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusions about America’s core interests in Afghanistan.

First, our nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives. The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need, and the trust they have earned, to fight and to win.

Second, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable. 9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists. A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill, just as happened before September 11th.

And, as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq. As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies. Our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for, and bled to liberate, and won, were occupied by a terrorist group called ISIS. The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit, and launch attacks. We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.

Third and finally, I concluded that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense. Today, 20 U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan — the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.

For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen.

No one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in Afghanistan and South Asia, but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions. When I became President, I was given a bad and very complex hand, but I fully knew what I was getting into: big and intricate problems. But, one way or another, these problems will be solved — I’m a problem solver — and, in the end, we will win.

We must address the reality of the world as it exists right now — the threats we face, and the confronting of all of the problems of today, and extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal.

We need look no further than last week’s vile, vicious attack in Barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women and children. You saw it for yourself. Horrible.

As I outlined in my speech in Saudi Arabia three months ago, America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding, and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology.

Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. They are nothing but thugs, and criminals, and predators, and — that’s right — losers. Working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders, and yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.

But to prosecute this war, we will learn from history. As a result of our comprehensive review, American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically in the following ways:

A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I’ve said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military options. We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities.

Conditions on the ground — not arbitrary timetables — will guide our strategy from now on. America’s enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.

Another fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of American power — diplomatic, economic, and military — toward a successful outcome.

Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen. America will continue its support for the Afghan government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field.

Ultimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace. We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live, or how to govern their own complex society. We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.

The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan. We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.

In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices.

But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country’s harboring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace.

Another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India — the world’s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India’s important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.

Finally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the American people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work, and work effectively and work quickly.

I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our warfighters that prevented the Secretary of Defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy. Micromanagement from Washington, D.C. does not win battles. They are won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers acting in real time, with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy.

That’s why we will also expand authority for American armed forces to target the terrorist and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan. These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans arms. Retribution will be fast and powerful.

As we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field, we are already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat ISIS, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq.

Since my inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard. We will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror. When America commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive, and overwhelming force.

Our troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.

We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will. Since taking office, I have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense, and they have done so.

In this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of Afghanistan and their courageous armed forces. As the prime minister of Afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us.

Afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us. The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. Afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future. We want them to succeed.

But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands, or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests. We are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives. This principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward.

Military power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country. But strategically applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace.

America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress. However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. The government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited. We will keep our eyes wide open.

In abiding by the oath I took on January 20th, I will remain steadfast in protecting American lives and American interests. In this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat. Terrorists take heed: America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat.

Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense.

In every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed. We prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for.

Not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of America’s greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at Arlington National Cemetery. There is more courage, sacrifice, and love in those hallowed grounds than in any other spot on the face of the Earth.

Many of those who have fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted in the months after September 11th, 2001. They volunteered for a simple reason: They loved America, and they were determined to protect her.

Now we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives. We must unite to defend America from its enemies abroad. We must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home, and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid.

Our actions, and in the months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation. With our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace.

We will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls, and everlasting pride in each and every one of you.

Thank you. May God bless our military. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Patrick Patterson: Journey in finding one of West Indies’ most lethal bowlers,"Updated: July 23, 2017 1:20 pm

The most fearsome of Caribbean pacers disappeared into oblivion in the 1990s. Patrick Patterson is still around, though he does not quite remember the man he was, or his bowling spells which went down in history. But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door — to hear his story.

There had been murmurs around about Patterson’s present state — that he’s lost in the bush or is in an asylum; maybe, even roaming the streets as a destitute."
Integrity unit assessing Alexandr Dolgopolov-Thiago Monteiro match,"Concerns on suspicious betting patterns surrounded the match between Alexandr Dolgopolov and Thiago Monteiro (Source: Reuters) Concerns on suspicious betting patterns surrounded the match between Alexandr Dolgopolov and Thiago Monteiro (Source: Reuters)

The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) have confirmed they are looking into a match between Alexandr Dolgopolov and Thiago Monteiro after concerns were raised over suspicious betting patterns surrounding the contest on Sunday.

A spokesman for the TIU, the anti-corruption body that covers all professional tennis around the world, told Reuters on Monday that they were making an assessment of the match while also insisting that no formal investigation had been launched.

Brazil’s Monteiro beat Ukrainian Dolgopolov 6-3 6-3 at the Winston-Salem Open, an ATP 250 event in the U.S., in Sunday’s first round match.

Monteiro, ranked 114 in the world, took just 55 minutes to beat Dolgopolov, who was ranked 51 places higher at 63, in a match which saw the Ukrainian fail to earn even one break point.

Dolgopolov had been the pre-match favourite but in the hours leading up to the match, so much money was placed on Monteiro that he started the match as an odds-on chance. It prompted several leading bookmakers to stop taking bets.

The TIU statement on Monday said it had been “made aware of concerns over betting patterns during the match.

“As with all match alerts, the TIU will assess, make a judgement and take appropriate action on the information received through its co-operative agreements with betting operators.”

"‘Don’t like our rules? Then leave’, says China newspaper after journal censored","CUP said it complied so that the larger body of its academic and educational materials could remain available in China. CUP said it complied so that the larger body of its academic and educational materials could remain available in China.

The censorship in China of hundreds of academic papers from a prominent journal will have little impact because readership is so small, but if Western institutions don’t like the way things are done in China they can leave, the state-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Monday. The editorial appeared after news that Cambridge University Press (CUP) had blocked access on its site in China to a list of some 300 papers and book reviews from the China Quarterly that the Chinese government had asked to be removed.

CUP said it complied so that the larger body of its academic and educational materials could remain available in China. But critics argue that the publisher had undermined the principles of academic freedom and independence and lent its name to China’s censorship efforts. The articles and book reviews touched on subjects deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, including the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, the 1965-75 Cultural Revolution, Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet.

“Western institutions have the freedom to choose. If they don’t like the Chinese way, they can stop engaging with us,” said the editorial in the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid under the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper. “If they think China’s Internet market is so important that they can’t miss out, they need to respect Chinese law and adapt to the Chinese way.”

The Chinese version of the editorial characterised the clash of principles as a “contest of power”. “Time will tell who’s right and who’s wrong,” it said. News about the decision by CUP, the centuries-old publishing arm of Cambridge University, set off a torrent of criticism including from overseas scholars of Chinese affairs. In an open letter posted on Medium, James A. Millward, a history professor at Georgetown University, said the decision was “a craven, shameful and destructive concession to (China’s) growing censorship regime” and a violation of academic independence.

“The result is a misleading, neutered simulacrum of China Quarterly for the China market,” he wrote. “This is not only disrespectful of CUP’s authors; it demonstrates a repugnant disdain for Chinese readers, for whom CUP apparently deems a watered-down product to be good enough.” President Xi Jinping has tightened China’s already strict censorship since coming to power in 2012 as he seeks to cement the Communist Party’s grip on power.

U.S. Navy and Marine Corps divers on Tuesday found some remains of missing sailors inside sections of a U.S. guided-missile destroyer that collided with a merchant vessel near Singapore, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet said. The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided on Monday while the U.S. ship was approaching Singapore on a routine port call. The impact tore a hole in the warship’s port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area.

U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Scott Swift said an international search-and-rescue operation had found some remains and that the wider search for 10 sailors missing from the accident would continue until all hope was exhausted. “The divers were able to locate some remains in those sealed compartments during their search,” Swift told reporters at Singapore’s Changi Naval Base where the USS John S McCain is docked for damage assessment. “Additionally, the Malaysian authorities have reported that they have located potential remains. They are working to confirm and identify those remains.” He did not specify how many remains had been found.

The Malaysian navy said in a statement it had found a body eight nautical miles northwest of the collision site and it would transfer it to the U.S. Navy on Wednesday. Swift also said Monday’s collision – the fourth major accident in the U.S. Pacific fleet this year – could not be viewed in isolation from other incidents and that investigations were seeking to find a “common cause at the root of these events”.

The John S. McCain’s sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan after colliding with a Philippine container ship on June 17. The bodies of seven U.S. sailors were found in a flooded berthing area after that collision. The latest accident has already prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said to have sailors killed in two collisions this year was disconcerting. “It’s just unacceptable and we’ll get to the bottom of it,” Pence told Fox News. “But right now our hearts are with the families of those that are lost and we honor them.”

Ships, aircraft and divers from an international search-and-rescue operation have been looking for the missing U.S. sailors to the east of Singapore and peninsula Malaysia, near where the accident happened. Aircraft from the amphibious assault ship the USS America, which was in port at Changi Naval Base, joined the search.

Earlier on Tuesday, divers equipped with surface-supplied air rigs got into compartments in damaged parts of the USS John S McCain. Immediate efforts by the ship’s crew after the collision on Monday were able to halt flooding into other parts of the hull, the Seventh Fleet said in a statement on its website.

CNN, citing unidentified U.S. Navy officials, said early indications suggested the collision was caused by a steering malfunction as the warship approached the Strait of Malacca. Swift said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause and whether it was the result of human error. Aircraft and vessels from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have been helping with the search.

HOLE IN HULL

Swift said the U.S. Navy was sending a team to assess the damage before making a decision whether to move the ship or place it in drydock. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority said it had deployed 250 personnel for the search-and-rescue effort over an expanded area of 2,620 square kilometres. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said it had deployed more than 500. Five U.S. sailors were injured in the accident, although the U.S. Navy said none of those injuries was life-threatening.

On Monday, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said there were no indications so far the collision was intentional or the result of cyber intrusion or sabotage. “But review will consider all possibilities,” he said on Twitter. Richardson said he was asking his fleet commanders worldwide for a one-to-two-day, staggered “operational pause” to discuss action to ensure safe and effective operations. He also said a comprehensive review would examine the training of U.S. forces deployed to Japan. The U.S. Seventh Fleet is headquartered in Japan.

The accident comes at a tense time for the U.S. Navy in Asia. This month, the John S. McCain sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built by China in the disputed South China Sea, the latest “freedom of navigation” operation to counter what the United States sees as China’s efforts to control the waters.

The state-run China Daily said in an editorial that increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific were a growing risk to commercial shipping.

Also this month, North Korea threatened to fire ballistic missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam in a standoff over its nuclear and missile programmes.

Syrian President Bashar Assad rejects security cooperation with the West,"Syrian President Bashar Assad. (File/Photo) Syrian President Bashar Assad. (File/Photo)

Syrian President Bashar Assad refused any security cooperation with Western nations or the reopening of their embassies, until they cut ties with opposition and insurgent groups. Shortly after Assad gave his speech on Sunday, a shell hit the first international fair in the country since the war began six years ago, killing and wounding several people. Assad’s defiant comments come at a time when his troops and pro-Iranian militiamen are gaining ground across the country under the cover of Russian airstrikes. Many countries have ceased calling for him to step down.

Speaking before dozens of Syrian diplomats in Damascus, Assad praised Russia, Iran, China and Lebanon’s Hezbollah for supporting his government during the conflict.

He said Syria will look east when it comes to political, economic and cultural relations.

“The direct support of our friends, politically, economically and militarily, made our advance on the ground greater and the losses of war less. Therefore, they are our partners in these achievements on the road to crush terrorism,” Assad said.

“Let’s be clear. There will be no security cooperation nor opening of embassies or even a role for some countries that say that they want to play a role in ending the crisis in Syria before they clearly and frankly cut their relations with terrorism,” Assad said. “At that point maybe we can speak about opening embassies.”

The Syrian crisis began in March 2011 with a peaceful uprising against Assad’s government, later escalating into a full-fledged civil war after a brutal government crackdown and the rise of an armed insurgency. The conflict has since killed an estimated 400,000 people and displaced half the country’s population.

In the early years of the conflict, many Western and Arab countries called on Assad to step down, and both the U.S. and the European Union have imposed sanctions on his government. Several Arab and Western countries also withdrew their diplomats from Damascus.

But after the Islamic State group declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq, the international focus turned to crushing the extremists, who have planned attacks around the world that killed and wounded hundreds of people.

The Syrian president said his country’s economy is turning to growth again “at a very slow pace, although we are under an almost complete embargo.”

Assad said that hardly a week passes without an attack in the West, referring to assaults carried out by IS supporters. “These facts are what forced them (the West) to change their stance,” Assad said.

He welcomed recent deals to de-escalate violence in Syria, but vowed not to give the opposition in politics what it failed to gain through arms.

The de-escalation zones in central, northern and southern Syria were proposed in a plan approved in May by Russia, Turkey and Iran in the Kazakh capital, Astana. The plan included a cessation of hostilities, a halt to Syrian government air raids over designated areas, and provisions for humanitarian aid access.

Despite that deal, Assad said Syrians don’t trust Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and that the Syrian leader does not consider him to be a guarantor. Erdogan’s government is a main backer of Syrian rebels, and sent troops into Syria a year ago to battle IS and to halt the advance of Kurdish forces. Those troops, and allied Syrian forces, now control a stretch of Syrian territory along the border.

“Any Turkish citizen who is in Syria without permission from the Syrian government will be considered an occupier,” Assad said.

"Badminton World Championships: I want to change the colour of my medal, says PV Sindhu","PV Sindhu got a bye in the opening round. (Source: File) PV Sindhu got a bye in the opening round. (Source: File)

PV Sindhu, who will lead India’s challenge at Badminton World Championships, said she is determined to change the colour of her previous two bronze medals.

“I think it has been two months since Australia Open, so I got enough time to practice. Form wise, I am perfectly all right, so I hope I give my best and do well,” Rio 2016 Olympics silver medallist Sindhu told reporters in Glasgow.

“I am definitely looking for a medal here and hopefully, better one than bronze this time, I also want to change the colour, so will fight for that,” added the 22-year-old.

Much before her medal at Rio 2016 Olympics and triumphs at China Open and 2017 India Open, Sindhu grabbed the limelight for her bronze medals at 2013 and 2014 editions of the World Championships. After getting a bye in the opening round, she will either face Korea’s Kim Hyo Min or Egypt’s Hadia Hosny in the second round.

Sindhu lost to Spain’s Carolina Marin in the Rio final but had her revenge when the Indian beat her in the Indian Open final earlier this year.

“It was important for me to win the India Open. It was good to win in front of the home crowd – there were a lot of people in India who couldn’t make it to Rio and were excited to be there,” said Sindhu.

"Kalimpong blast: ‘Miscreants did recee before attack’, police conduct raids","Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo) Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo)

Police suspect that miscreants did a recce before carrying out the grenade blast at Kalimpong police station that killed a civic volunteer and injured two others on Saturday night. Sources in the police said they have collected CCTV footages and are trying to identify the accused. The CID and forensic experts have already collected chemical samples of the grenade after the explosion.

“We suspect that the miscreants did a recce before the bomb was hurled at the police station. We are conducting raids,” SP (Kalimpong) Ajit Kumar Yadav told The Indian Express.

Sources said that the hand grenade was of high-intensity. “A specific material called ‘nitrogeletin’ was used in an improvised metal pipe. It was of such a high intensity that the splinters were found 30 meters away from the blast spot,” said a source.

The technique of the explosion, sources said, was archaic. It was exploded non-electrically like how petrol bombs are burnt during festive season. A fuse was used to initiate the detonation of the grenade, they said. Sources said that though they suspect Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leaders behind the explosion, a breakthrough in the case will only be achieved after the police are able to identify the two motorcycle-borne miscreants captured in the CCTV cameras near the police station.

GJM chief Bimal Gurung and four other party leaders have been booked under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for the grenade blast. The UAPA had already been slapped against Gurung after a blast in Darjeeling’s Chowkbazar on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.

President Donald Trump to address nation on new US Afghan policy,"President Donald Trump. President Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump will address the US troops and the nation on his plans for Afghanistan and South Asia, the White House has said.

“President Donald J Trump will address our nation’s troops and the American people tomorrow night at 9:00 pm (EDT) from Fort Myer in Arlington, VA, to provide an update on the path forward for America’s engagement in Afghanistan and South Asia,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

On Friday, Trump had a meeting with his national security officials at Camp David. On Saturday, Trump said he has taken a decision on his new Afghan policy. The much-awaited policy announcement comes eight months after he became the US President.

Former President Barack Obama had announced his Afghan policy in the first 100 days of his office, which was based on the recommendations of a three-member committee. While Obama’s Afghan policy focused primarily on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Trump Administration during its policy review looked into possibilities of role and responsibilities of India.

Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had said that Trump administration has almost reached a decision on a new approach for fighting the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan. Months ago the Pentagon had settled on a plan to send approximately 3,800 additional troops to help strengthen the Afghan army, which is stuck in what some call a deteriorating stalemate with the Taliban insurgency.

Afghanistan has been battling insurgency for more than a decade. The Taliban offensive against the west-backed government in the country increased this summer.

(Express Photo) On the security cover around the Nam Charcha Ghar, Rulda Singh said that the Chandigarh Police as well as Punjab Police visited them. (Express Photo)

AHEAD OF the verdict in a murder case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, even as the police tightened security in the district, the Nam Charcha Ghar of the Dera at Khuda Lahora village on Nayagaon border witnessed frantic activity. Some Dera followers arrived at the Nam Charcha Ghar.

“Dera followers from Chandigarh, Nayagaon and nearby villages visit the Nam Charcha Ghar. Some followers have arrived in the last two days and staying here. We will do whatever the Dera management asks us to,” said Rulda Singh, a Dera follower. He said that the Dera management had ordered them to remain peaceful and they were following the instructions.

On the security cover around the Nam Charcha Ghar, Rulda Singh said that the Chandigarh Police as well as Punjab Police visited them. “We did not see any danger, so we did not ask for security cover. Police parties of Chandigarh and Mohali patrol the area throughout day and night,” he told Chandigarh Newsline. Rulda Singh said that some of the Dera followers living in Nayagaon area were approached by the local police three days ago and were asked to give the details of their visitors.

Heavy police force was deployed in Derabassi and Zirakpur areas bordering Haryana. The police teams also carried out checking in various hotels, guesthouses and lodges in these areas and directed all the hotel owners to provide the identity of all their visitors. Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Singh Chahal said that they were keeping tabs on the activities of the Dera followers. He said that the force had been deployed in the entire district but special focus was kept on Derabassi and Zirakpur side as both the towns border Haryana.

Sketches of a Poet’s soul,"Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature.

Book- Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems

Translated by- Baran Farooqi

Publication- Penguin Random House India

Pages- 304

Price- Rs 499

The name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds most people of melodious voices of Noor Jahan and Nayyara Noor, and the songs Mujh Se Pahli Si Muhobbat Meri Mehboob Na Mang, Ham Dekhenge or Aaj Bazar Mein Paa-ba Jolan Chalo. For those who have a deeper interest in Urdu poetry, it evokes many more images. Faiz symbolises a turning point in the history of the Urdu language — his name evokes memories of the Progressive Writers Association (PWA), his poetry is reminiscent of an era when the best of minds produced great literature in Urdu, which inspires writers and poets even today.

Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. No nation state has been able to create impermeable fortifications thick enough to withstand the osmotic pressure which arts and literature produces. Even if these walls are constructed on the dense bedrock of hate and animosity.

Faiz’s poetry kept on transcending geographical boundaries and made him the most celebrated poet of the Indian subcontinent. But what makes Faiz unique, and I have said this earlier in an article, is that his poetry also transcends caste, class, regional and even linguistic boundaries. It is not unusual to see processions in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where workers, students or political activists walk on streets with posters on which Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere or Nisar Main Teri Galyon Pe Aye Watan Ke Jahan, Chali Hai Rasm Ke Koi Na Sar Uttha Ke Chale is written. If you walk into a five star hotel and witness Faiz being sung by a renowned singer, it would not be considered out of the ordinary. Faiz is the only poet who has no adversaries. Even the mullahs in Pakistan did not pass a fatwa against him.

Faiz Ahmad Faiz (centre) with Javed Akhtar (right). Express Archives Faiz Ahmad Faiz (centre) with Javed Akhtar (right). Express Archives

Faiz’s name also reminds us of the great divide between taraqqi pasand (the progressives) and jadidiyat pasand (modernists). Those who called themselves modernists in India were essentially anti-communist, backed by international groups who professed ‘art for the sake of art’ and ‘art with no political objective’. This group consistently attacked all writers, poets, filmmakers and artists who were members of PWA. Their politics drove them to condemn and reject all those who were committed to the idea of equality and justice, and created literature to build consciousness around these ideals.

Faiz demolished the wall created by the modernists. They initially tried to ignore him but did not succeed. In an Urdu magazine, Tehrik (Silver Jubilee Number), Wazir Agha wrote an article on ‘25 years of Urdu literature in Pakistan’. He listed the names of 30 poets, without mentioning Faiz. In passing elsewhere in the article, he mentioned Faiz as a progressive poet who “did not toe the party line and therefore created some good literary pieces”.

Similarly in Guftugoo, Balraj Komal, in an article titled ‘Poetry of Straight and Curvilinear Lines’, placed Faiz’s work on the border of this divide vis-a-vis Ali Sardar Jafri, Sahir Ludhyanvi and Josh Malihabadi; and, therefore categorised it as ‘effective’. These assertions were utterly false because Faiz remained committed to the ideals of socialism till his last breath. These were only excuses for liking a revolutionary poet. Almost every word of his poetry is dedicated to the idea of building an equitable and just society, yet his grandeur was accepted by even those who stood on the other side of the political fence.

The book Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems provides yet more proof of my assertion. In her introduction, the translator, Baran Farooqui, has made her political position very clear. She has referred to Faiz and many other progressive writers as “armchair socialists”, ignoring the fact that some of them, including Faiz, spent long years in jail for their ideological commitment. An unnecessary reference to Stalin could also have been avoided. She has not minced her words to reveal her unsympathetic attitude towards Faiz’s political views. The rest of the introduction is full of ‘illuminating’ information and she has translated the poems with utmost care, restrain and thoughtfulness. The soft, firm and robust ‘king of romantic realism’ deserves no less, even from those who do not agree with him. The ideological bias is completely absent in the translation.

When I read the list of 57 selected poems I was a bit disappointed that Intisab, Raqeeb Se, and Mauzu-e-Sukhan were missing. But when I moved on to the introduction it was clear that these poems did not measure up to the taste of the selector for obvious reasons.

If you are in love with a piece of literature in its original form — and I am an unashamed lover of every poem that Faiz wrote — then it is painful to read its translation. For me there are two indicators of good translation. The first test is: choose lines from the middle of a poem, read, and if you are able to recollect the original, then it is a good translation. I performed this test on every poem in this book. The second test is: the translated poem must invoke the same or similar feeling which the original does. Farooqi’s translation passes both these tests with very high marks. For all those who understand Urdu but cannot read ‘farsi rasm-ul khat’ the appendix provides transliteration of all selected poems, carefully scripted with the correct pronunciation of each word.

Farooqi refers to seven translators who introduced Faiz to non-Urdu readers, during his lifetime. I have not read all of them, but on the basis of whatever I’ve gone through, Farooqi’s translation is incredibly close to the spirit of Faiz’s poetry. I’m sure after reading this book, non-Urdu-Hindi readers will gain a deeper understanding of his life and poetry.

"In 3-2 verdict, SC walks fine line, strikes down instant triple talaq","Under talaq ahsan, a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing talaq once every month in three consecutive months and this would be signified by menstruation cycles. Under talaq ahsan, a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing talaq once every month in three consecutive months and this would be signified by menstruation cycles.

In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the Supreme Court on Tuesday “set aside” the centuries-old practice of instant triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat in which Muslim men divorce their wives by uttering talaq three times in quick succession. Three of the five judges on the Constitution Bench — Justices Rohinton F Nariman, Uday U Lalit and Kurian Joseph — called the practice un-Islamic and “arbitrary” and disagreed with the view that triple talaq was an integral part of religious practice. But the minority ruling of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer underlined the primacy of Muslim personal law and said the practice enjoyed constitutional protection and was beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny. They were of the view that Parliament should consider an “appropriate” law to deal with the issue of talaq-e-biddat.

Justice Joseph, who disagreed that triple talaq had constitutional protection, reiterated the Shamim Ara ruling in which it was held that triple talaq lacked legal sanctity: “What is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well.”

The 395-page judgment, on a clutch of petitions by Muslim women challenging the validity of instant triple talaq, comprised three separate rulings — Chief Justice Khehar wrote for himself and Justice Nazeer, Justice Nariman for himself and Justice Lalit while Justice Joseph came out with his own order. The verdict was immediately welcomed by the government, political parties, activists and the petitioners, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailing it as “historic” and saying it has granted equality to Muslim women.

Justice Joseph said: “I find it extremely difficult to agree with the learned Chief Justice that the practice of triple talaq has to be considered integral to the religious denomination in question and that the same is part of their personal law… on the statement that triple talaq is an integral part of the religious practice, I respectfully disagree. Merely because a practice has continued for long, that by itself cannot make it valid if it has been expressly declared to be impermissible.”

He disagreed with the minority verdict which held that though triple talaq was part of religion, its operation can be stayed (injuncted) under Article 142 (extraordinary power of the SC) for six months to enable the State to frame a law to deal with it. “I also have serious doubts as to whether, even under Article 142, the exercise of a Fundamental Right can be injuncted,” he said.

Justice Nariman too wrote that triple talaq did not satisfy the test laid down by the Supreme Court to decide whether a practice was integral to the practice of a faith. “Applying the test of manifest arbitrariness… it is clear that triple talaq is a form of talaq which is itself considered to be something innovative, namely, that it is not in the Sunna, being an irregular or heretical form of talaq…”

“…it is clear that this form of talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it. This form of talaq must, therefore, be held to be violative of the fundamental right contained under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In our opinion, therefore, the 1937 Act, insofar as it seeks to recognise and enforce triple talaq, is within the meaning of the expression ‘laws in force’ in Article 13(1) and must be struck down as being void to the extent that it recognises and enforces triple talaq,” Justice Nariman wrote.

PTI adds: With triple talaq being set aside, now Sunni Muslims, among whom triple talaq was prevalent, will not be able to take recourse to this mode as it would be “void ab initio” (illegal at the outset). They are now left with two other modes of securing divorce — talaq hasan and talaq ahsan after the apex court set aside the talaq-e-biddat.

Under talaq ahsan, a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing talaq once every month in three consecutive months and this would be signified by menstruation cycles. As per talaq hasan, divorce can be given by pronouncing talaq “during successive tuhrs (menstruation cycle)” with no intercourse during any of the three tuhrs.

"Congress welcomes SC order, divided on need for legislation","Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq in Mumbai on Tuesday. Prashant Nadkar Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq in Mumbai on Tuesday. Prashant Nadkar

HOURS AFTER the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq on Tuesday, Congress leaders were divided on whether a law should be enacted on the subject even as they welcomed the ruling. While former Law minister and senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily said Parliament will have to pass a legislation to give effect to the order, at the party’s official briefing, Congress communication department head Randeep Surjewala said there is “no need to bring a law” once the Supreme Court has quashed it.

The government is of the opinion that there is no need for immediate legislation, as the practice of instant triple talaq has been declared unconstitutional by the apex court. Welcoming the Supreme Court decision, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “I congratulate the women who fought for justice.”

Moily told The Indian Express, “This should not be a political agenda of any party. The BJP has projected (the judgment) as a political agenda, which is not proper; it is a social agenda. There are personal laws in this country — not only for Muslims but also for Hindus and Christians…. While you deal with that, you have to extra-careful. That is why the Congress is not taking it as a political agenda.”

Stating that a legislation “has to be made” following a “a wider consultation”, Moily said, “I don’t think the Supreme Court’s decision as such can be implemented. It has to be brought to Parliament, and the government should think of that process. Before they draft a Bill, there should be a consensus — personal laws of any community, any religion is a very sensitive issue, and (we) will have to deal with it properly.”

Surjewala, however, said, “Justice Khehar has in his minority view said clearly (that) he does not propose to interfere because it is a 1,400-year-old practice. The remaining three judges have said that a practice, that is unrecognised by the core of Islamic jurisprudence for which there are two essential sources – the Holy Quran and the Hadith – is unacceptable, irrespective of the period for which it may have been followed. So I think that has been decided: there is no need or occasion to bring any law any further.”

“Majority judgement is a resounding affirmation of gender justice and of equality of spouses.Triple talaq was a distortion of original Quranic legal principles. Good it has been declared unconstitutional,” senior Congress leader P Chidambaram tweeted. A senior Union minister said, “What would you abolish through a legislation? The practice has already been declared illegal…(the SC) judgment has already declared the state of law.”

The minister added that clauses in existing marriage laws can be applied against those still instant triple talaq. Asked why he thought there should be a legislation, Moily said, “Without a law, how can you do that (implement the court’s verdict)? You are interfering with the personal law of a community. You want to undo that (instant triple talaq), you will have to bring a legislation – legislation is a must.”

“To give effect to such an intent….amendment to personal law, you will have to bring a legislation,” he added. “Parliament has to legislate. Before that there should be a national consensus arising out of national consultation…and appropriate ecosystem should also be created…by a proper understanding and not by creating a sense of intolerance for any religion,” he added.

Surjewala said, “The verdict is an affirmation of the rights of women and gives relief to them against being subjected to discrimination by a practice that had been perverted over the years. We welcome the acceptance of this reality by (the) court.” Surjewala said that even the Muslim Personal Law Board had pleaded before Supreme Court that the practice of ‘instant triple talaq’ is per se wrong. “The Supreme Court verdict is a culmination and acceptance of this wider wisdom, as also recognition of the rights of Muslim women,” he said.

Photo: How about Katrina Kaif as the new Daenerys in Game of Thrones?,"Katrina Kaif would love to be a part of fantasy drama, Game of Thrones. Katrina Kaif would love to be a part of fantasy drama, Game of Thrones.

If given a chance, Katrina Kaif would love to be a part of the stellar cast of much-talked about television series, Game Of Thrones. Reason? Like millions of you, she too is a Jon Snow fan and wants to be a part of the global blockbuster that GOT is. And to make her request reach the makers of the show, the Jagga Jasoos actor has made a public request on her social media account. The hashtags Katrina has used are proof of her being in awe of the ‘moody and broody’ Jon Snow. Who wouldn’t be?

On Tuesday, sharing her latest photoshoot picture which she did for the brand, Vogue, Katrina pleaded the GOT makers to cast her in the show. She wrote, “Can I be in #gameofthrones pleeeeeasseee… #ilovejonsnow #pleasetakemeintheshow #moodyandbroodingismything @luismonteirophotography @anaitashroffadajania @vogueindia.” In the designer swimwear and those heavy anklets, Katrina looked like a Queen and after looking at the picture you would agree that she might fit into the world of Game Of Thrones.

While the casting directors of the show consider Katrina’s application, it is her fans who have already decided on what role they would like to see their favourite star play. Most of her fans want her to step into the shoes of Khaleesi aka Danaerys Targaryen. One of the comments on Katrina’s post read, “mam’ u look like DAENERYS TARGARYEN……..,” while her other fan wrote, “U should be the next Khaleesi.”

The seventh season of Game of Thrones has reached its finale with only one episode left. Going by the trailer, we are expecting nothing less than 81 minutes of bloody battles and epic encounters. Ever since Jon Snow and Daenerys held hands in Beyond The Wall, fans are awaiting a romance between the two. Game of Thrones Season 7 airs in India on Star World and Star World HD every Tuesday at 11 PM.

US warship collides with tanker near Singapore; 10 missing,"It is the second collision involving a ship from the Navy’s 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months. (Representational) It is the second collision involving a ship from the Navy’s 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months. (Representational)

At least 10 U.S. sailors are missing after the USS John S. McCain collided with a tanker early Monday east of Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, the second collision involving a ship from the Navy’s 7th fleet in the Pacific in two months. The Navy said five other sailors were hurt in the collision involving the guided-missile destroyer. It had been heading to Singapore on a routine port visit after last week conducting a sensitive freedom of navigation operation by sailing near one of China’s man-made islands in the South China Sea.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the oil and chemical tanker Alnic MC sustained damage or casualties. The McCain was damaged on its port side aft, or left rear, from the accident that happened at 5:24 a.m., the Navy’s 7th Fleet said, but was heading to port under its own power. Malaysia’s navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin tweeted that two ships as well as aircraft from its navy and air force have been deployed to help look for the missing U.S. sailors. The Navy said Osprey aircraft and Seahawk helicopters from the USS America were assisting in the search. It also said tugboats and Singaporean naval and coast guard vessels were in the area to render assistance.

The Strait of Malacca is a narrow and busy body of water between Malaysia to the northeast and Indonesia to the southwest, with the city-state of Singapore at the tip of the Malay Peninsula. The collision is the second involving a ship from the Navy’s 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship hit each other in waters off Japan. The Fitzgerald’s captain was relieved of command and other sailors were being punished after the Navy found poor seamanship and flaws in keeping watch contributed to the collision, the Navy announced last week. An investigation into how and why the Fitzgerald collided with the other ship was not finished, but enough details were known to take those actions, the Navy said.

The ship is based at the 7th Fleet’s homeport of Yokosuka, Japan. It was commissioned in 1994 and has a crew of 23 officers, 24 chief petty officers and 291 enlisted sailors, according the Navy’s website. The warship is 154 meters (505 feet) in length. The Alnic MC is a 183-meter (600-foot) oil and chemical tanker.

Confirmed: New Rs 200 note will be rolled out soon by RBI,"New Rs 200 note: The Finance Ministry has confirmed that the new denomination note will be issued soon New Rs 200 note: The Finance Ministry has confirmed that the new denomination note will be issued soon

The Union government on Wednesday confirmed that a new Rs 200 note will be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. While no immediate date was made known, the new denomination could well hit ATMs and banks as early as next week.

“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 24 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and on the recommendations of the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Government hereby specifies the denomination of bank notes of the value of two hundred rupees,” an official government notification said.

Last month, images of the new denomination note hit social media with several looking for a confirmation. Along with the new Rs 200 note, the government has also confirmed a new Rs 50 note. The earlier Rs 50 notes will continue to remain legal tender.

The new Rs 200 note will help in day-to-day transactions and will replenish the reduction in Rs 500 notes following the demonetisation move by the Union government on November 8 last year.

“The new 200 notes will carry advanced security features. The authorities are taking extra precaution to prevent counterfeiting,” an official aware of the printing schedule had said.

"Our Stories, Their Stories: When an Indian and a Pakistani walk into a coffee shop in a foreign land","These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

Here in Sydney, I have met a lot of Pakistanis. Contrary to what we have been made to believe, we get along well. Why? I think it is because far away from our mulks, the baggage of history seems a bit lighter. We don’t have to flaunt and feign patriotism by turning against the other. In faraway lands, our patriotism isn’t defined by hating the other as easily as it is in our respective countries.

It isn’t a way to counter racism — a “white vs brown” thing. At least, not yet in my case.

Is it because, mostly, we speak the same language? Maybe, yes. It could also be because we eat the same food. Does it matter when my Pakistani neighbours make kadi pakora they can share with us? I think it does. Sometimes, I think inherently we are the same.

So what defines this “sameness”? Is it a few big things coming together or too many trivial things that are difficult to keep count of? That we use the same cuss words and stock the same masalas in our kitchen cabinets? Or the bigger similarities: we have the same kind of media that fans the same kind of fires amongst us, provoked by politicians who play the same games, on both sides of our borders?

I was returning from Sydney Cricket Ground the other night. My Uber driver happened to be a young man from Karachi. After a few minutes, he opened up and we were talking like old friends. He hadn’t been to Karachi in eight years, since he arrived in Australia. These years, he says, were a revelation to him. The media back home had poisoned him against Indians, he said, but here he found us Indians to be just like them Pakistanis.

At the end of the ride, I asked him for a favour: to take something of me to Pakistan, when he visits Karachi at the end of this month. He was surprised. What could I be sending? And to whom? Who did I know there? I told him to take dher sara pyaar from this fellow Indian for his friends and family. That we need love between us and he could be that messenger. “Sure”, he said, “we are the same.”

But, maybe, we are not.

Well, for many of us, our mazhabs are different. But that’s not it. The problem, Indians have been told, is Pakistan itself. Here, though, if our communities try to mingle with each other, brotherhood does not seem too difficult. But if we get too close, the suspicions surface eventually. “That Indian fellow, he sent some chicken xacuti and claimed that it is halal meat. But is it really?” We trust each other and then we don’t.

Or when it comes to the wars, and Kashmir. Every time you hear that the other side has violated the ceasefire on LoC, try opening a website, any reputed news website, from the other side. You will see the inverse version. The two news reports won’t have a single thing in common (except, of course, guns firing and people dying).

On Kashmir, the unshakeable belief is that your own country and your own army is doing nothing wrong. The other side is always to blame. But we, mere citizens forced by circumstances in a foreign land, choose to ignore these issues and carry on.

If you make us talk about it, the layers of suspicion and mistrust slowly become evident. The propaganda of generations of politics, narrated by generations of editors, journalists and historians (for each nation writes its own version of history) to generation of uncles and chachas and nanas and dadas, over and over, has been cemented and fixed in our minds.

When a Pakistani colleague and I met over a cup of coffee and tried discussing politics, it was like putting the very basics of my strongly held beliefs to test. The stories they have heard on their side are just as one-sided as ours. Eventually, we realised that we are all reluctantly loitering in the grey areas here.

These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. My friend from Karachi went on: “Look, I understand. You call Muslims invaders. We invaded your land and ruled it for 400 years and when we left, we took away a piece of it and called it Pakistan — it is not fair but it happened. Par ab kya? It has been 70 years. Can’t we move on?”

I gulped, tried not to look startled and asked myself, how does one prepare for plainspeak like this? This is not Facebook or Twitter. The stakes are much higher than your typically timid and fickle social media timeline that changes loyalties with every hashtag. These are real conversations and we are real people — we work, attend meetings, eat lunch together and wish each other on our respective Independence days.

Meanwhile, we realise, yet again, that we aren’t the same.

The unlearning that we have to do, if we choose to do, is colossal. And with every passing generation, it becomes more difficult. It can happen when we talk to someone from the other side — something practically impossible in our respective countries. But, here, in a foreign land, we meet by circumstance and are bound by it. We talk with each other, first because we need to and then because we want to. And, as we talk, we can see ourselves being deconstructed. When that happens, yes, we are the same.

Then, of course, there is the matter of patriotism. If you are patriotic, you can’t be nice to anyone from the other side. It makes you a traitor. The other day, a woman from Pakistan asked Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj for help on Twitter — a visa request to treat her two-year-old son, who needed an urgent bone marrow transplant. Few “proud” Indians, as they generally are, replying to her tweet, asked her why she did not go to China to seek assistance. Some Pakistanis shamed her for “begging” medical facilities from India. A two-year-old boy is fighting for life and Twitter warriors from India and Pakistan are defining patriotism. So yes, I guess, we are the same.

It does not matter if you are an Indian or a Pakistani who is reading this, because the question for us, aam janta, remains the same. How long will we let our patriotism be defined by hate?

Donald Trump: India’s role critical in Afghanistan’s stability; Pakistan must stop sheltering terrorists,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters) U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters)

After months of speculation and delays over his plans about Afghanistan, US President Donald Trump finally unveiled his strategy to win a war which has stretched over 16 years. Targetting Pakistan for its safe harbour to terrorism over the years, Trump said that America needs to change its approach in dealing with Pakistan, “We cannot be silent about Pakistan’s safe heaven for terror groups.” He was addressing Army troops at Fort Myer.

Identifying Pakistan as a refuge state to terrorism the President said, “Pakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence and terror.” Trump went on to add that more than 20 US designated terror organisation are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.

Taking a strong stance against Pakistan, Trump said, “Pakistan has much to gain from our efforts in Afghanistan and it has much to loose by continuing to harbour criminals and terrorists. It has sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill our people.” Stressing that things will have to change Trump said that America has been paying Pakistan billions of dollars while at the same time they are housing terror organisation that America is fighting, “but that will have to change immediately.”

Recognising India’s critical role in furthering peace and security in the south Asia region, Trump appreciated India’s contribution to stability in Afghanistan saying, “We want India to help us more with Afghanistan in the area of economic assistance and development and in the broader indo-pacific region.”

Talking about the simmering tensions between India and Pakistan, Trump said, “The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict, and that could happen.” Trump unveiled his approach towards Afghanistan by vowing to continue the fight to avoid any “predictable and unacceptable” results of a rapid and sudden withdrawal of troops from the country.

Calling himself a “problem solver”, Trump said that he inherited a “bad and very complex hand.” Acting completely opposite to his views as expressed during the presidential campaign of pulling out from Afghanistan which was an unsolvable quagmire, Trump said that the decision to pull off might create a vacuum that terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS could instant fill just as happened before September 11. Attacking former president Barack Obama for pulling out “hastily” from Iraq, Trump said that due to those policies Iraq “slipped back into the hands of terrorists, enemies, and we cannot repeat in Afghanistan our leaders made in Iraq.” He added, Working alongside our allies we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our border, yes we will defeat them.”

Expressing that American interest in Afghanistan and Pakistan are clear, Trump said, “We must stop the resurgence of safe heavens that enable terrorist to threat America, and we must prevent Nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us or anywhere in the world.”

Saying that the American support to Afghanistan is not a “blank cheque” Trump said that the strategy in Afghanistan will now shift from time based approach to one based on conditions. Without revealing the number of troops to remain stationed in Afghanistan or figures of new deployment in the mountainous country, Trump said, “We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities, conditions on ground not arbitrary time table will guide our strategy.”

Expressing that it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future trump said We are partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or govern their own complex society.”

Trump’s speech after months of speculation, revealed a renewed strategy by Pentagon in Afghanistan which had been advocating to stay in the country to ensure that Afghan lands are not used as a terror heaven to threaten America again.

Chennaiyin FC sign Spaniard Jaime Gavilan Martinez,"Chennaiyin FC has signed Spanish attacking midfielder Jaime Gavilan Martinez for the upcoming season of the Indian Super League.

The 32-year-old has joined the 2015 ISL champions on a free transfer after the expiry of his contract at South Korean club Suwon FC.

Gavilan played in the second season of the ISL for Atletico de Kolkata. He made 15 starts for the Kolkata franchise, bagging three assists and helped them reach the semifinals, where they lost to eventual champions Chennaiyin FC 4-2 on aggregate.

Blunt instrument? What a list of banned articles says about China’s censors,"ar from being well-oiled machine, though, China’s censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps, workarounds, and perhaps even hasty officials, say academics specialising in Chinese politics. (File) ar from being well-oiled machine, though, China’s censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps, workarounds, and perhaps even hasty officials, say academics specialising in Chinese politics. (File)

An old review of an academic monograph on agrarian revolutionaries in 1930s China is hardly a political third rail in Beijing on Wednesday, even by the increasingly sensitive standards of the ruling Communist Party. That such a piece appeared on a list of some 300 scholarly works that Cambridge University Press (CUP) said last week the Chinese government had asked it to block from its website offers clues about the inner workings of China’s vast and secretive censorship apparatus, say experts.

President Xi Jinping has stepped up censorship and tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, as well as reasserting Communist Party authority over academia and other institutions, since coming to power in 2012. Far from being well-oiled machine, though, China’s censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps, workarounds, and perhaps even hasty officials, say academics specialising in Chinese politics. “Crude is the word,” said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain. “The blunt way in which articles were chosen for censoring … suggest to me that there was not a lot of thought put into it.”

CUP, the publishing arm of Britain’s elite Cambridge University, on Monday reversed its decision to comply with the request to censor the articles published in the journal China Quarterly following outcry over academic freedom. China’s response remains to be seen. The education ministry, foreign ministry, cyberspace administration and state publishing authority all declined to comment.

The list of articles the authorities wanted blocked covered topics that are considered sensitive by the government, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Tibet, Taiwan and the violence-prone far-western region of Xinjiang. But it was far from thorough or comprehensive. The article on 1930s agrarian revolutionaries may have got there by mistake, say experts.

What appears to have condemned the scathing but otherwise innocuous 1991 review of Kamal Sheel’s book about a Communist base area in China’s southern heartland was the fact the place was named Xinjiang, and the word appeared in the book title.

The Chinese characters are different for Xinjiang, the village, and Xinjiang, the mostly-Muslim region more than 2,500 km (1,550 miles) to the northwest that is beset by ethnic tensions and occasional unrest. But in English they are indistinguishable.

KEYWORD SEARCHES

Xu Xibai, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oxford, tweeted a brief analysis of the list that noted that its creators appear to have hastily searched the China Quarterly database for taboo words in titles and abstracts. “The censors probably used a few keyword searches to locate just enough articles to make a nice, long list to impress their superiors,” Xu’s post said. “They did not bother to read the articles or go through the content list manually.”

An article defending Mao Zedong was on the censored list, for instance, while others more critical of the former paramount leader were not. Some sensitive subjects seem to have eluded the officials’ net. The Communist Party tightly controls discourse on the 1958-61 Great Leap Forward, in which millions starved to death due to ill-conceived economic policies. Censors have banned books on the topic but it was apparently not on this list.

Nor were the brutal, Communist-led land reforms of the 1950s, or the Hundred Flowers Movement, an effort by Mao to lure critics out of the woodwork by feigning openness, only to punish them. The party’s efforts to censor news and information have sometimes backfired or left outsiders perplexed.

In 2009, software designed to check pornographic and violent images on PCs blocked images of a movie poster for cartoon cat Garfield, dishes of flesh-colour cooked pork and on one search engine a close-up of film star Johnny Depp’s face. Citizen Lab, a group of researchers based at the University of Toronto, compiled a list of words banned as of last year on popular live streaming sites in China. Among them: “Moulin Rouge”, “braised rabbit”, “helicopter” and “zen”.

The request to block the articles was passed to Cambridge University Press by its import agent, but without knowing where it originated it is hard to draw firm conclusions, said Sebastian Veg, a China scholar at the School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences in Paris. “The censorship system is of course centrally directed, but not uniform,” Veg said.

Lee Siu-yau, assistant professor of Greater China studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, suspects the request was a trial balloon. “They usually start with something small-scale and gradually expand and make their requirements more difficult,” he said.

“This might be one of the first steps that the Chinese government would take to see if it could actually influence international academic publishers.”

With the upcoming Ashes series, Stuart Broad not only seems hopeful about the upcoming series but also expressed his desire to the play the next one in 2019.

According to a report in cricket.au.com, expressing hope to play in the next Ashes series, Broad, said, “Oh God, yes, I hope so. I’ll be just turned 33. Jimmy is 35 now so I’d certainly hope my performances will keep improving to be a part of that Ashes for sure.

“I’m not someone who looks too far ahead because I think it slows you down as a performer. This winter is a hugely exciting one because I think that series is going to be a belter with two teams that look really similar. But obviously, I have the hunger to go further than that.”

Commenting on senior partner James Anderson, Broad, said, “To be fair, Jimmy is bowling as well as I’ve seen him bowl. He’s turned 35 but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him challenge both sides of the bat as consistently as he has done this summer. Fielding at mid-on and mid-off to him, I feel like he is in the game all the time. He’s not bowling bad balls, he looks in a rhythm that’s awesome. Long may that continue.”

“He is taking regular wickets, both LB and bowled and nicking off. That’s a great place for him to be. Look, he’s going to be crucial for our chances this winter for sure and hopefully he can keep that rhythm going because he is picking up wickets at a huge speed at the moment and, not only will he be looking at 500, he’ll be looking way past that the way he is going.”, Broad added.

Broad also spoke on his current fitness and longevity, Broad said, “I’m 31 now and still feel like I have quite a bit of cricket left in me. I’m loving the energy around this team, I’m loving being part of it. At 31 I’ve hopefully, touch wood, got a few more miles in the tank.”

"It’s hard work being a video referee, says Italy’s VAR chief","VAR cheif said that VARs should not interfere after the match ends. VAR cheif said that VARs should not interfere after the match ends.

The official responsible for implementing the use of video replays at the Italian league said on Monday that the job of Video Assistant referees (VARs) is harder than it looks.

After VARs were implemented in the Italian league this season, former referee Roberto Rosetti told Reuters, “It is an irreversible process that needs to be improved in times and procedures.”

“After a friendly match in front of 80,000 people, a VAR told me that he had never been so tired in his life. It is another concept, a different assessment structure and it takes time and patience to do things the right way.”

“The technical decision was right but there was a clear error on the disciplinary side,” said Rosetti. “The VAR controlled a situation where it could have been assumed that there was a serious mistake,” he said.

Rosetti said that the VAR should not intervene after the referee blows his whistle. “When the referee blows his whistle, the game stops and from that moment the VAR should not intervene. We know that every change needs a phase of adaptation, the procedures have to optimised and the time taken needs to be limited and improved.”

He had the impression that the players were “more restrained and accepting refereeing decisions very well.”

German police apologise after officers taunt player in video,"Leipzig’s Timo Werner, right, and Schalke’s Thilo Kehrer challenge for the ball. (Source: AP) Leipzig’s Timo Werner, right, and Schalke’s Thilo Kehrer challenge for the ball. (Source: AP)

Police in the central German state of Hessen say they have opened disciplinary proceedings against officers in uniform who were filmed singing a disparaging song about Leipzig player Timo Werner.

Police say they were made aware of the YouTube video on Sunday, it appears to have been filmed in a changing room of the Hessian riot police, and “the officers’ behavior is contrary to official principals.”

Werner, who played in Leipzig’s 2-0 Bundesliga loss at Schalke on Sunday, is unpopular among rival fans for earning a penalty with a blatant dive in the sides’ clash last season.

The Hessen police say they “expressly disapprove of the officials’ behavior,” and they have apologized to Leipzig general manager Ulrich Wolter. Wolter said he would pass the apology on to Werner.

"If I had the opportunity to play with modern bats, I would have done so, says Sanath Jayasuriya","Sanath Jayasuriya (L) is now the chief selector of Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Sanath Jayasuriya (L) is now the chief selector of Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

Sanath Jayasuriya, along with Romesh Kaluwitharana, redefined the art of opening in limited-overs in the 1990s. The former Sri Lanka captain, now the chief selector, played with 2.6-2.7 pounds bat with thin edges. He talks to The Indian Express on ICC’s bat-dimension regulations, besides some of the issues plaguing Sri Lankan cricket.

Do you think modern bats have made the game lopsided? And has the ICC done the right thing by ringing in restrictions?

Time to time, bats have changed. Bat manufacturers come up with different ideas to give their products an advantage, to show the world that they’re better than the others. So they have been trying lots of things. Recently, they have been having thick edges with a lot of wood, but still they managed to keep a nice weight. We need to strike the right balance. The changes are for everyone, which is good. Umpires will come to the dressing room and check, which is a good thing.

What were the dimensions of your bat?

When I was playing, the only thing that mattered to me was a lighter bat and making sure I get the proper wood. We never thought anything about bat dimensions. Whatever the manufacturers did, we used to play. It all depended on the manufacturers. In countries where pitches had higher bounce, I used to have more meat at the top half of the bat. In the subcontinent, the bottom half used to be heavier. It was like that only, when we were playing. We never got worried about the thickness and edges. In fact, I always preferred thinner edges (to keep the bat to 2.6-2.7 pounds).

David Warner’s bat depth is 85mm for limited-overs cricket and he isn’t supportive of the change. He feels a lot of high-scoring matches are due to benign pitches. Do you agree?

Still, at the same time, you need to have a proper bat in terms of having the right balance between bat and ball. If you have more thickness or huge edges, it’s a big advantage to the batters.

Do you agree that pitches have generally become flatter?

In Test cricket, home teams prepare pitches according to their strengths. In ODIs and T20s, maybe spectators want to see high-scoring matches, which is why flatter pitches are prepared. When we played, the character of pitches used to vary significantly, from the subcontinent to England to Australia. Now I think, leaving aside the basic differences like higher bounce or lower bounce etc, wickets more or less follow a similar pattern in limited-overs cricket.

You, along with Romesh Kaluwitharana, redefined limited-overs opening batting without the advantage of modern-day bats. How do you explain this?

Mostly I would have got the best bats from the manufacturer. You need to have confidence in your bats. I played with Kookaburra, Reebok, SG, and I also used have bats from a guy from New Zealand, a private bat manufacturer. My bat handles used to be thin and the bottom of the handle was oval-shaped. That gave confidence to my hands. And I always watched the ball. My batting was basically hand-eye coordination, bat speed and timing.

You spoke about having thin bat handles. Did you prefer it because of your grip?

I gripped very hard, both hands very tight. I kept my hands pretty close and I gripped it right under the handle.

Did it allow you to play more shots square of the wicket?

Yes, cut and pull are easier. It helped me play the short ball better. But I could also hit through mid-on and mid-off.

The Jayasuriya-Kaluwitharana show started in Australia before the 1996 World Cup. What was the thought process behind such aggressive batting?

We had similar ways of batting right from our school days (different schools). Duleep Mendis, Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva had seen us playing attacking cricket at club level. So they gave us the licence to go out there and hit even in international cricket. The idea was to set the platform for a big score with quick-fire opening.

Did you change your batting approach and technique depending on conditions?

I didn’t change much. We played positive cricket everywhere. Some modifications were required, like while playing in England, focus was more on playing straight. Australia was easier, because pitches there had more bounce.

Coming to modern cricket, we have Warner and Chris Gayle, who are aggressive. How do you assess their batting?

They are attacking cricketers by nature. And even though they are very attacking cricketers, they always aim for big hundreds.

Do you agree modern bats helped their game?

Yes, modern bats have helped. But at the same time, you need to think and play. Because, it’s not only the bat and the wood. If you don’t watch the ball and hit properly, you will get out. But yes, with these modern bats, mishits can go for a boundary or a six. That’s why I said what the ICC did is good for everyone.

Any possibility of mishits going over the rope during your time?

Very rare. We didn’t have the advantage of such thick edges. But if I had the opportunity to play with these modern bats, I would have obviously picked one. It gives you a lot of confidence — top edge going for a six.

After the restrictions, do you see totals coming down gradually, especially in T20s?

Bat manufacturers are creative people. They will come up with some other ideas to make up for this. But now I think the ability to time the ball would be important.

In Sri Lanka, several former cricketers join politics and then come to cricket administration. In India, the Lodha Committee recommendations have encouraged former players to come into administration but politicians were kept at an arm’s length. How do you look at it?

Different countries look at it differently. Earlier, we used to have interim committees. Now we have returned to a democratically elected system. But former cricketers coming into administration is good for the game.

Don’t you think it’s better to not have political influence in sport?

As I told you, the system in Sri Lanka is different. Our sports law allows this. The only thing I want as a former cricketer is the game to be run properly.

But the Sri Lankan board has never been one of the best-run bodies in the world, affected by turmoil and government interventions.

You can’t say that. The cricketers have been provided with everything. Administration is separate. There had been ups and downs. There were ups and downs in Indian board also. There’s stability in the Sri Lankan board (now). The only thing is, when you are not doing well, people come and talk. When this team was winning against Australia one year ago, did you hear anything? We have to face this. We are always open to constructive criticisms. These are difficult times.

Are you disappointed with the way Arjuna Ranatunga is constantly criticising Sri Lankan cricket?

He is a former captain. He has the right to express his opinion. It is for me to decide whether it is correct or not. From August last year up till now, we had 24 players injured.

Has the Sri Lankan board chalked out a plan to take the game to the grassroots?

Now we have spread the game to all provinces. The current president wants the provincial tournament to be on top. The process has been initiated. But it will take some time to get the desired results.

Nokia 6 review: This phone is trademark Nokia,"Nokia 6 review: Nokia has always been known for a very European design philosophy, one that is practical, sturdy and stylish, while not tending to be outlandish. The Nokia 6 is no exception. Nokia 6 review: Nokia has always been known for a very European design philosophy, one that is practical, sturdy and stylish, while not tending to be outlandish. The Nokia 6 is no exception.

There are some brands around the world that come with a certain amount of consumer trust attached to it. And this is not something gained by marketing gimmicks or expensive brand ambassadors, but by the experience of customers and that too over many years.

When it comes to technology and smartphones, Nokia is still one of the most trusted brands though it has been going through a rollercoaster ride over the past few years. But with its comeback, aided by Finnish startup HMD Global, this brand is showing us what brand loyalty can do. The company’s new mid-budget phone is the Nokia 6, aimed at the masses.

Nokia 6 price in India: Rs 14,999

Nokia 6 specifications: Full-metal body | 5.5-inch full-HD display | Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 with 3GB RAM | 32GB storage (expandable up to 128GB) | 16 MP phase detection autofocus camera + 8 MP front camera | Dual speakers and dedicated amplifier, Dolby Atmos | Android Nougat | Dual SIM 4G VoLTE | 3000 mAh battery

Nokia 6 design and display review

Nokia has always been known for a very European design philosophy, one that is practical, sturdy and stylish, while not tending to be outlandish. The Nokia 6 is no exception, but HMD Global has focussed on the style part too and this could well be one of the most stylish phones in this price range. And the lack of plastic — this phone is all-metal and in a very flagship kind of way — also makes it stand out from the rest of the phones. Plus the metal chassis frame gives this phone a feeling of durability and dependability hard to find in a phone that costs Rs 14,990.

While the phone has a matte finish and metallic edges, the screen itself is a bit too glossy and reflects your face when you are out in the sun. So you will need to use this display at full brightness when outdoors. The fingerprint scanner, embedded in the home button just under the display, is one of the fastest I have used. The camera bump at the rear is ever so slight and comes with a chrome frame adding to the style quotient.

Nokia 6 performance review

The Nokia 6 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor which is well in the mid-range. However, the overall performance of the phone will not disappoint you in anyway. However, you should be ready to encounter some jumpy graphics while playing top-end games. I could notice this even while running the 3D benchmark.

Nokia 6 review: Nokia 6 UI is almost stock Android, though it is not plain vanilla. There are some tweaks, like the app dock at the bottom with a pull up app tray. Nokia 6 review: Nokia 6 UI is almost stock Android, though it is not plain vanilla. There are some tweaks, like the app dock at the bottom with a pull up app tray.

If benchmarks are something you take seriously, then this phone is placed near where a two-year-old flagship would be. That should not bother the average user, I don’t expect them to have any issues with multi-tasking on consuming content from YouTube and other sources. Yes, gaming could be a bit of a challenge for those who want to look beyond Candy Crush.

Nokia 6 UI and software review

The Nokia 6 UI is almost stock Android, though it is not plain vanilla. There are some tweaks, like the app dock at the bottom with a pull up app tray. The native app icons stand out for their blue colour code and round shape. Overall, this makes the phone easy to get used to, with very little or no learning involved. That said, I would have loved for Nokia to have some sort of an app play, offering something that differentiates its phone from rivals.

Nokia camera review

The Nokia 6 is not a phone that is being sold for its camera, unlike the flagship Nokia 8. But the camera of this mid-range phone is no pushover either. It can do a good job of most of the situations and performs reasonably well in low light too. The camera app is basic and offers just Panorama and Beautify modes in addition to regular camera.

But in the end the results were quite impressive though without any flourish or extravagance when it comes to colours. The Nokia 6 has a camera that will not leave you wanting at any point of time, with the ability to throw up some really good results if the conditions are suitable.

Nokia 6 battery review

The Nokia 6 has a 3000 mAh battery that can last close to 10 hours with regular use over 4G VoLTE. You can get a couple of hours more by keeping the brightness lower.

Nokia 6 verdict

The Nokia 6 is trademark Nokia. This is a phone which does not have one strong USP, but this is a phone you will be able to trust and depend upon. This is a phone you know will work every time you turn to it and does not cost a bomb. The mid-range segment has a serious new challenger and I won’t be surprised if this phone ends up being a big success. This is the new no-nonsense phone. Nokia 6 reiterates that a good phone just needs to get the basics right and does not need gimmicks to gain attention.

Riders on the storm: Six women get ready to sail the world,"Wonder women: Aishwarya Bodapatti, Pratibha Jamwal, Vartika Joshi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and Patarapalli Swathi. (Express photo by Arul Horizon) Wonder women: Aishwarya Bodapatti, Pratibha Jamwal, Vartika Joshi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and Patarapalli Swathi. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)

The girls are busy stocking up on some of their favourite things. “Movies, music, games, books, Kindle, laptops,” says Aishwarya Bodapatti, with a smile. It’s not exactly a long vacation, though. Lieutenant Bodapatti and five other women are preparing to go on an adventure of a lifetime — the stuff of adrenalin addled dreams for many: to travel the world on a sailboat.

This Indian Navy initiative (the first such attempt by any navy in the world) will see the team set off on board the 56-ft-long oceangoing sloop, INSV (Indian Navy sailing vessel) Tarini, docked at Mandovi in Goa since the beginning of 2017, by end-August or the first week of September. The crew will look to complete the whole trip in about seven months with four stops in between at Fremantle (Australia), Christ Church (New Zealand), Falklands (Argentina) and Cape Town (South Africa).

Bodapatti remembers her maiden voyage to Mauritius from Goa earlier this year aboard INS Tarini. As it tossed and turned, water filled the deck and soaked the women on board. And Bodapatti found herself thinking back to the time when she had bravely opted to be part of the crew that was to circumnavigate the globe. “I had thought being on the sea meant just sitting back and looking at the waters. Then, our auto pilot went on a blink and the radar packed up. I felt an unfamiliar sense of dread and realised what the sea truly was,” says the 28-year-old naval officer. It was her first experience of sailing the high seas and it taught her never to take anything for granted. A BTech graduate, Bodapatti says that her schooling at the Air Force station in Hakimpeth in Hyderabad (her father worked with the CISF), had a lot to do with her choice of career.

“I saw lots of planes flying (Hakimpeth air force base was very close by) and joining the air force first came to mind. But then I saw the naval uniform and it just looked so smart,” she says with a grin. Bodapatti’s always sought out adventure, though, whether it’s in her love for bungee jumping or river rafting.

The idea for this ambitious expedition was apparently floated a few years ago by the Indian Navy, which had already notched up records with the iconic sailboat Mhadei, commissioned in February 2009. Mhadei made two solo circumnavigations in 2009 and a non-stop one in 2013, before the Navy decided it was time to push the boundaries further. Women don’t typically go to the sea in the Navy, and solo circumnavigation would be practically unviable. Hence, the concept of Navika Sagar Parikrama — the First Indian All Women Circumnavigation of the Globe — was born. Almost immediately, a look-out was sounded for volunteers from the Navy.

One of the first to come on board, however, was Lt Commander Vartika Joshi, who will now lead the expedition as the skipper. “I volunteered for this for the same reason I joined the Navy — to explore the oceans,” says the 28-year-old BTech graduate from Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.

Growing up near rivers — her mother taught at a college in Rishikesh and father worked in Garhwal — made Vartika keen to explore the waters more. “The oceans were the next logical step,” she says, adding that her family was delighted when she joined the navy and again when she opted for the circumnavigation. On what qualities led to her becoming captain, Joshi says, “Perhaps, my ability to be balanced, not take hasty decisions and take each person’s opinion into consideration when deciding things.”

Are they prepared for the challenge ahead? The answer is a resounding yes. “We’ve undergone intensive training since 2015, not to mention the many sailings from Karwar to Porbandar within India (2015 to ’17), and Rio to Cape Town to Mauritius (2016 to ’17) on international waters,” says Lt Commander Pratibha Jamwal, 28, and a BTech from Himachal Pradesh. “We’ve been especially trained to work with the boat’s equipment and its repairs because that’s one of the biggest challenges out in the waters,” she says.

After her graduation, Jamwal had landed a job with an MNC but she opted for the Navy instead as “being a pahadi I had a special inclination towards defence forces.” Labelling the opportunity as the “rarest of rare”, she feels she lucked out with her career selection. “Here, we are paid to travel the world and have the best experiences.”

Lt Vijaya Devi from Manipur, another member of the expedition, says she was inspired by her father, who was with the Manipur Rifles, to take on the challenge of circumnavigation. Devi has four siblings and she’s the only girl. Her family had initial apprehensions about the journey. “But once they visited me here, they melted,” she says.

Lt Patarapalli Swathi, the only married member of the crew, says she had the full support of her parents and husband, also a naval officer. “He knew this would happen before marriage and was well prepared,” says Swathi, who did her post graduation in computer science from Vizag.

The Ocean Sailing Node, where the women were trained, was established in 2016. However, informally, their training had already begun sometime in 2013, aboard the Mhadei. It started to come together in 2015, when all six women were transferred from their bases and stationed in Goa, where the Ocean Sailing Node took over their training. What followed were basic sail training courses at the Indian Naval Watermanship Training Centre, and, Navigation, Seamanship, Communication and Meteorology courses at various naval training schools in Kochi. After com pletion of these, the team sailed from Vizag to Goa independently in February 2016 and then to Mauritius and back, covering a distance of 4000 nautical miles in July 2016.

“By now, the girls have done 18,000 nautical miles of sailing on their own,” says Captain (retd) Dilip Dhonde, under whose tutelage the Tarini crew first learned the ropes in 2015. “When I trained them, I didn’t make any concession because they were women. I always told them, the boat and the sea are gender-neutral. The challenges they throw will not discriminate between men and women, hence, the response has to be likewise,” says Dhonde, who took premature retirement from the Navy last December.

Challenges don’t always come from the sea. The drudgery of long days is a real issue. “It’s important to keep motivation levels high. During long voyages, we sing, have discussions on different issues and reminisce about our childhood and dreams for the future,” says 26-year-old Lieutenant Payal Gupta, another crew member.

“Six people living with each other continuously has its problems — about hygiene, food choices etc. Small things can irritate you at sea and the fact that none of us are very domesticated doesn’t make it easier!” says Bodapatti. Joshi has a solution: dividing the boat area into six parts and making each member responsible for its cleanliness, ensuring no one feels that they’re making more effort at maintenance than the others.

From what it seems, the six women team have it all figured. As they strike a pose, you hear one of them shout to the others, as they perch themselves on the deck, and make the sign of a time-out. “Not V for Victory, Let’s make a T for Tarini.”

* Trump defends Virginia response in raucous, rambling speech

* Police use pepper spray on protesters outside Phoenix arena

* Defiant Trump mocks U.S. news media: “They’re bad people”

* Former intelligence director question’s Trump’s fitness for office

* Trump promises government shutdown to build Mexico border wall

U.S. President Donald Trump revved up supporters on Tuesday with a defense of his response to a white supremacist-organized rally in Virginia and a promise to shut down the U.S. government if necessary to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

Under fire for saying “both sides” were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left-wing counter protesters in Virginia on Aug. 12, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath.

“I didn’t say I love you because you’re black, or I love you because you’re white,” Trump said. “I love all the people of our country.”

Police used pepper spray to disperse crowds after protesters threw rocks and bottles outside the convention center where Trump spoke, police said.

Trump, who often uses news organizations as a foil, repeatedly singled out the media for criticism of how it covered the violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville and the resulting political fallout.

“These are truly dishonest people. They’re bad people. I really think they don’t like our country,” Trump said. “The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media.”

Adopting a glib tone, Trump said many reporters ignored his condemnation of white supremacists, including the Ku Klux Klan.

“I hit ’em with neo-Nazi, I hit ’em with everything … KKK? We have KKK. I got ’em all,” he said.

James Clapper, a former director of U.S. national intelligence, expressed concern at Trump’s performance, calling it “downright scary and disturbing.”

“I question his fitness to be in office,” Clapper told CNN.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Funding for the border wall has flagged in the U.S. Congress as many lawmakers question whether Trump’s main promise during the 2016 presidential election campaign is really necessary.

But with a budget battle looming, Trump said he would be willing to risk a politically damaging government shutdown in order to secure funding for the wall. He visited the border region in Yuma, Arizona, earlier on Tuesday.

“If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” Trump said. “We’re going to have our wall. The American people voted for immigration control. We’re going to get that wall.”

With thousands of supporters cheering him on, Trump also weighed in on another racially charged issue, hinting he would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

Arpaio, 85, who battled illegal immigration in the Phoenix area, was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

NAFTA, NORTH KOREA

Trump covered the gamut of issues, from NAFTA trade talks to the U.S. showdown with North Korea, during a raucous, rambling and defiant political speech lasting an hour and 15 minutes.

He said he might terminate the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada to jumpstart negotiations, and said the standoff with North Korea over its weapons programs might have taken a positive turn.

However, it was unclear whether the speech would help lay the foundation for a comeback from the deep political crisis Trump finds himself in after only seven months in office and an approval rating below 40 percent.

He expressed frustration that the Republican-controlled Congress was unable to approve healthcare legislation that failed to pass the Senate by one vote last month. One of the votes against the legislation was cast by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer.

Without mentioning their names, Trump criticized both McCain and his fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake.

Neither McCain nor Flake attended the event.

Trump complained repeatedly about the “one vote” that stopped the Senate from repealing and replacing Obamacare, the signature domestic policy of his predecessor, Barack Obama.

“One vote away. I will not mention any names – very presidential. And nobody wants me to mention your other senator, who’s weak on border, weak on crime. Nobody knows who the hell he is! See, I haven’t mentioned any names, so now everybody’s happy,” he said.

“SHERIFF JOE”

The White House had said earlier when asked about Arpaio that “there will be no discussion of that today.” That did not stop Trump from raising the subject.

“Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?” Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of “Pardon Joe!” “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good,” he said.

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed.

He mocked left-wing protesters in his speech.

Protesters outside Tuesday’s rally yelled: “Shame, shame, shame” and “No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA” as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: “Build the wall.” Many wore red hats with Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January.

Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday’s event while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville.

A heavy police presence was deployed around the Phoenix venue for Trump’s first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election.

"Harmanpreet Kaur, Punam Raut and Diana Edulji will be guests at the Express Adda today","Diana Edulji (L) Harmanpreet Kaur (C) and Punam Raut (R) Diana Edulji (L) Harmanpreet Kaur (C) and Punam Raut (R)

AFTER DECADES of playing second fiddle to their male counterparts, the Indian women’s cricket team captured the nation’s imagination for three exhilarating weeks this July. Harmanpreet Kaur unleashed a breathtaking assault, scoring an unbeaten 171 off 115 balls against Australia in the semi-finals, and Punam Raut established herself as the bedrock of the top order, top-scoring in the final.

Kaur and Raut, along with former India captain-turned-administrator Diana Edulji, will be the guests at Express Adda in Mumbai on Tuesday.

Edulji was the only cricketer picked by the Supreme Court as a member of the Committee of Administrators (CoA) to run the Indian cricket board. With the CoA entrusted with implementing the Lodha panel reforms and engineering a change in the BCCI constitution, in line with the directions of the Supreme Court, the former all-rounder has a lot on her plate.

With captain Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami having announced that they have played their last World Cup, Kaur and Raut are the new faces of Indian women’s cricket.

Kaur’s innings against the six-time world champions is considered a seminal moment for Indian women’s cricket, with some comparing the knock with Kapil Dev’s 175 against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup. Her strokeplay, poise and hitting ability are pointers to the direction the women’s game will take in the future.

Though the Indian women’s team reached the World Cup final in 2005 as well, that achievement did not make heads turn like their recent exploits in England. Already, there is some talk about starting a women’s IPL in the not-so-distant future.

Kaur, Raut and Edulji will be in conversation with The Indian Express Deputy Editor Seema Chishti and Assistant Editor Bharat Sundaresan.

The Express Adda is a series of informal interactions organised by The Indian Express Group and features people who have been at the centre of change. Guests at the event in the past include the Dalai Lama, economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, filmmaker Karan Johar, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, writer Amitav Ghosh and cricketer Virat Kohli.

Manchester City’s Samir Nasri completes move to Antalyaspor,"Samir Nasri joined Antalyaspor from Manchester City. (Source: Reuters) Samir Nasri joined Antalyaspor from Manchester City. (Source: Reuters)

Samir Nasri has completed his move from Manchester City to Turkish side Antalyaspor, signing a two-year deal, the Premier League side said on Monday.

Nasri, who scored 27 goals in 176 appearances for City and won both the league title and the League Cup twice, ends a six-year spell at the club.

The 30-year-old was loaned out to La Liga side Sevilla by manager Pep Guardiola at the start of last season in a bid to reignite his career.

The French forward played 30 games for the Spanish team before returning to Manchester during pre-season training.

Nasri excelled in the 2013-14 season, scoring 11 times to help the side capture a second league title in three years.

Despite signing a five-year contract extension in 2014, the former Arsenal player was unable to replicate his high standards from the previous season, failing to secure a regular starting place in the team.

Nasri won 41 international caps for France, scoring five goals.

Vitamin C jabs may stave off blood cancer: Study,"To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off.

Vitamin C injections may halt the progression of blood cancer by encouraging faulty stem cells in the bone marrow to die, a study in mice has found. Certain genetic changes are known to reduce the ability of an enzyme called TET2 to encourage stem cells to become mature blood cells, which eventually die, in many patients with certain kinds of leukemia, researchers said. “We are excited by the prospect that high-dose vitamin C might become a safe treatment for blood diseases caused by TET2-deficient leukemia stem cells, most likely in combination with other targeted therapies,” said Benjamin Neel, professor at New York University (NYU) in the US.

Changes in the genetic code (mutations) that reduce TET2 function are found in 10 per cent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 30 per cent of those with a form of pre-leukemia called myelodysplastic syndrome, and in nearly 50 per cent of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

Such cancers cause anemia, infection risk, and bleeding as abnormal stem cells multiply in the bone marrow until they interfere with blood cell production, with the number of cases increasing as the population ages. Researchers studied the relationship between TET2 and cytosine, one of the four nucleic acid “letters” that comprise the DNA code in genes.

To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off. They found that similar to the naturally occurring effects of TET2 mutations in mice or humans, using molecular biology techniques to turn off TET2 in mice caused abnormal stem cell behaviour. These changes were reversed when TET2 expression was restored by a genetic trick.

Previous studies had shown that vitamin C could stimulate the activity of TET2 and its relatives TET1 and TET3.

Since only one of the two copies of the TET2 gene in each stem cell is usually affected in TET2-mutant blood diseases, researchers hypothesised that high doses of vitamin C, which can only be given intravenously, might reverse the effects of TET2 deficiency by turning up the action of the remaining functional gene.

They found that vitamin C did the same thing as restoring TET2 function genetically. By promoting DNA demethylation, high-dose vitamin C treatment induced stem cells to mature, and also suppressed the growth of leukemia cancer stem cells from human patients implanted in mice. “Interestingly, we also found that vitamin C treatment had an effect on leukemic stem cells that resembled damage to their DNA,” said Luisa Cimmino, assistant professor at NYU Langone Health.

Researchers combined vitamin C with a PARP inhibitor, a drug type known to cause cancer cell death by blocking the repair of DNA damage. They found that the combination had an enhanced effect on leukemia stem cells, further shifting them from self-renewal back toward maturity and cell death.

The results also suggest that vitamin C might drive leukemic stem cells without TET2 mutations toward death, given that it turns up any TET2 activity normally in place, Cimmino said. The study was published in the journal Cell.

Iran to be able to resume high-level uranium enrichment ‘in 5 days’ if US quits nuclear deal,"“If we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),” Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB. (File – AP Photo) “If we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),” Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB. (File – AP Photo)

Iran can resume high-level uranium enrichment within five days if the United States tears up the nuclear deal, the head of its Atomic Energy Organisation said today. “If we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),” Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB.

“Of course we would not like such a thing to happen as we made a lot of effort to achieve the JCPOA (nuclear deal),” he added.

The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers saw sanctions eased in exchange for curbs to Iran’s nuclear programme. That included a ban on high-level enrichment of uranium of 20 per cent or more – a process which would take Iran close to the level needed for a nuclear weapon.

US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to tear up the nuclear deal during his campaign, and it has come under mounting pressure after Tehran carried out missile tests and Washington imposed new sanctions – with each accusing the other of violating the spirit of the agreement.

"US President Donald Trump administration had to put pressure on India for Afghan role, says UN envoy Nikki Haley","US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (File/Photo) US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (File/Photo)

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that the Trump administration had to put pressure on India to step up its role in bringing about a political solution to end the prolonged war in Afghanistan. Her comments came as Trump today unveiled his new Afghan strategy retracting from his initial instinct to pull out from Afghanistan. Instead, the US president said, the American troops will “fight to win” the 16-year-long conflict. In a prime-time address, Trump called out Pakistan for for providing safe havens to terrorists but also said that India was making “billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan…”

“We’ve got to put the pressure on India that they have to be part of the political solution,” Haley told CNN.

The Indian-origin US ambassador to the UN said that Trump was taking a regional approach to end the Afghan conflict.

“This is not just about Afghanistan. This is about the region, and so that means that we’ve got to put the pressure on Pakistan,” she said, adding that Pakistan can no longer harbour safe havens for terrorists.

“We need to continue to let Iran know that all of this terrorism and their sponsorship of it is not something we’re going to put up with. And we need the international community to step up and say, look, if we’re going to do this, we’re doing it together. It’s not the US alone,” Haley said.

She said America’s enemies were no longer going to know “what the timeline is”.

“What our enemies are going to know is, we’re not putting up with the terrorism anymore and we’re going to do whatever it takes,” she told the network.

Senator Ben Cardin, a ranking member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, supported Trump’s Afghan policy.

“I think the president, is calling on regional cooperation. That is the right thing. We need to have Pakistan as a more cooperative partner in dealing with Afghanistan. India could be an important partner in dealing with this,” he told on MSNBC News.

“What I find difficult to follow is what he’s doing on the military side. It looks like he is dealing another surge with additional troops being put into Afghanistan,” he said.

Cardin said the US needed a diplomatic surge. “That, to me, is going to be the key, whether he can implement a surge and have the confidence of our regional partners that we can really bring peace to Afghanistan,” the Democratic Senator said.

Watford lose in EFL Cup to second tier Bristol City,"Bristol City scored their third and the eventual winner courtesy Niclas Eliasson. (Source: Reuters) Bristol City scored their third and the eventual winner courtesy Niclas Eliasson. (Source: Reuters)

Marco Silva’s promising start as Watford manager came to a halt when the Premier League team was knocked out of the League Cup by second-tier side Bristol City on Tuesday.

The southwest England side fought back to win 3-2 despite making nine changes for the trip to Vicarage Road, with City’s priority being to gain promotion from the League Championship.

“Bad night,” said Silva, who left Hull for Watford in the offseason. “A really bad result for us, a disappointing result.”

Watford has opened the Premier League season with a draw against Liverpool and victory over Bournemouth. But it was the only Premier League casualty on Tuesday night with the other six top-flight teams in action advancing from the second round against opponents from lower divisions.

Leicester won 4-1 at Sheffield United, West Bromwich Albion ousted Accrington Stanley 3-1, Swansea beat Milton Keynes Dons 4-1, Crystal Palace eliminated Ipswich 2-1, Bournemouth defeated Birmingham 2-1 and Brighton edged Barnet 1-0.

At Watford, Etienne Capoue put the hosts ahead early in the second half, only for 18-year-old Freddie Hinds to draw City level and Bobby Reid to put the visitors in front.

Watford’s night took a further turn for the worse when defender Jose Holebas was shown a second yellow card in the 88th minute and Niclas Eliasson then extended Bristol City’s lead. Adrian Mariappa’s header reduced the deficit deep into injury time but Watford ran out of time to produce an equalizer.

“In the first half we controlled the match but we played very slow,” Silva said. “Very, very slow, too slow all the first half. We controlled the match, we don’t give a lot of solutions for our opponents to make problems for us but we need to do something different in our fast decisions, in our counter attack as well, to create more chances to finish.”

Another six Premier League teams are in action on Wednesday in English football’s second-tier knockout competition and they are all playing teams from other divisions. Top-flight teams involved in European competitions don’t enter until the third round.

The draw is being held on Thursday in the Chinese capital Beijing, as competition organizers seek to attract commercial backing and new fans in Asia.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe defiant over selection pressure,"Eddie Howe is not fazed by external pressure while choosing his squad. (Source: AP) Eddie Howe is not fazed by external pressure while choosing his squad. (Source: AP)

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is not fazed by external pressure while choosing his squad and is only focused on doing what is right for the club, the 39-year-old said ahead of Tuesday’s second round League Cup match at Birmingham City.

Howe faced criticism for his team selections during cup competitions last season after fielding reserve players during defeats to lower tier sides, leading to early exits from the FA Cup and League Cup.

“I am certainly not going to bow to pressure from anybody to do anything other than what is right for us,” Howe told the Daily Echo. “When I say that, what I mean is developing young players, giving an opportunity to our squad…Everyone cries out in this country for more chances for young players to play and, when you do play them and rotate the team, you get criticised for it.

“Sometimes, when you are in this seat, you are in a no-win situation but I will do what is right for Bournemouth and take the consequences.”

Despite their dismal results in cup competitions, Bournemouth secured their highest ever league finish at ninth last season. Howe said the league was still their main priority but that does not change their ambitions in other domestic competitions.

“When you enter a cup competition, you want to do well for the supporters, the club and the team and you want to go as far as you can,” Howe said. “The fact I am making changes doesn’t change that and we still want those things.

“You are trying to manage your squad in a productive way so everyone feels like they have had an opportunity to play and everyone is ready to play when called upon for the Premier League, which ultimately… is our priority.

“We still want to do well in the cup competitions and we want to start well against Birmingham if we can.” Following their match against Birmingham, Bournemouth host Manchester City in the league on Saturday.

Need to follow Apeda standards for organic produce: Amitabh Kant,"CEO, NITI Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra) CEO, NITI Aayog Shri Amitabh Kant. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)

Optimistic that organic farming is set to expand in India, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant on Wednesday suggested that quality standards set by export promotion body Apeda should be followed for organic products to push deeper into global as well as domestic markets. He said the existing wholesale mandi system poses a “serious challenge” for marketing organic produce and therefore, a separate organic market with direct consumer access model is the need of the hour.

Besides ensuring better market linkages, he emphasised on making available quality organic seeds and planting material, private investment in organic seed breeding and creating a role model of organic farmers for others to emulate. “Organic farming has many opportunities and these challenges are like we face in every single sector in India and we need to overcome,” Kant said, after the release of a study on ‘Organic farming in India: Status, Issues and Way Forward’ by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).

He said he was not “despondent” about what has been made out in the report. “I am an optimist… If you want organic farming to take off in India, just keep the government aside,” he added. Food safety regulator FSSAI Chairman Ashish Bahuguna, Amway India CEO Anshu Budhraja and ICRIER Director and Chief Executive Rajat Kathuria and co-author of the report Aripita Mukherjee were present at the event.

Lauding states, especially Sikkim, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh for adopting organic farming, Kant said there is a need to push organic farming in rain-fed areas of central and western India and also in eastern parts where there is very low use of chemical fertilisers.

On challenges related to multiple organic standards and certification highlighted in the report, he said, “I think we should go with Apeda (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) standards. Get everything else and just push for Apeda standards, which are the export standards.”

Asserting that there are more opportunities for organic agri-business in the country, he called upon private companies to make available organic seeds and planting material which is key for achieving consistent quality production. “Some farmers organisations have made solitary attempts and you need good solid private companies in this area. Once you are able to get consistent quality product, you will see the organic farming taking off,” he said.

The country has organic seed production in certain crops like tomato, okra, beans and others. Observing that future of organic farming depends on a well-established market, the Niti Aayog chief said there is a need to link small and marginal farmers with market so that they are able to get the right price. Also, the existing mandi model poses serious challenges to organic farming due to the issue of mixing organic and inorganic products and lack of direct access to consumers, he pointed out.

Speaking on the issue, Budhraja said the country has huge potential and the company is keen to source more organic produce.

At present, it is sourcing nine crops like ginger and cinnamon from six states and helping farmers grow as per its required standards, he added. Among recommendations, the ICRIER report pitched for a uniform standard and clearly lay out labelling requirements, logo and punishment for fraudulent practices by unscrupulous traders through a comprehensive policy and guideline.

In the absence of FSSAI guidelines for the domestic market, the growth of the sector is mired in fraudulence and malpractices such as selling inorganic products as organic, and making things worse is lack of a framework to penalise such offences, it added. The report also underscored the urgent need for creation of a single nodal agency for the organic sector.

India’s organic food market is growing at 14 per cent and is expected to rise to 20 per cent in the next five years, it added.

The Doklam miscalculation,"Representational Image Representational Image

The ongoing stand-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Doklam tri-junction area is not an unexpected outcome of the steady slide in India-China relations over the last few years. While the construction of a road by the Chinese for military purposes in Bhutanese territory — disputed by the Chinese — was most likely a calculated provocation, the underlying strategic motives as also the timing of this action, remain unclear. Is it a warning to India about its deepening US relationship; or a move to prise Bhutan out of the Indian embrace; or to express annoyance with the Indian rejection of OBOR? Or is it a combination of all the above and the intent is to “teach a lesson” to a disconcertingly resurgent India?

Given that China is presently confronting several issues of critical strategic import, such as the North Korean crisis, the deepening US defence relationship with Taiwan, the rising tensions in the South China sea, the logic and the timing of the confrontation with India in a remote corner of the Himalayas defies easy explanation. Add to this is the fact that President Xi Jinping is coming up for re-election for a second term in the crucial 19th plenum of the Communist Party to be held in October. Given the extreme positions taken by the Chinese, a withdrawal would involve an unacceptable loss of face. On the other hand, an escalation would scarcely buttress Xi’s standing domestically, while severely denting it internationally. In fact, an armed conflict could risk derailing the OBOR project in which Xi is heavily invested. Unlike past imperialisms, coercion and commerce do not mix easily in present times.

When Xi took over in 2012, China stood tall among the ruins of Western capitalism devastated by the great recession of 2008. The most important task facing the Chinese economy was the rebalancing necessary to address the structural problems created by the weakening of the export engines and the over reliance on investment, which together had been the primary drivers of its spectacular growth. Xi, however, has been preoccupied with consolidating his political power, leaving issues of economic reform largely on the back burner. Since China requires rising prosperity to justify the draconian curbs on individual freedoms, allowing growth to slow is a risk which Xi has been unwilling to take. In effect, the Chinese economy remains precariously leveraged and investment-driven with escalating risks of a hard landing in the future. On the political front, Xi’s anti-corruption campaign — mainly targeted at opponents — has fostered fear and riven the party into several factions. Thus, despite Xi being designated as “core” leader and his re-election for another term virtually certain, the insecurity in the party leadership is palpable.

Growing state repression is an expected response from an authoritarian regime to internal problems. Under Xi, this has been accompanied by an aggressive articulation of territorial claims as an important plank of foreign policy. By this, China has, in effect, abandoned its stated “doctrine of peaceful rise” which had provided to the world an anodyne explanation of its growth. However, as Edward Luttwak has argued, China’s “premature assertiveness” could prove self-defeating as it may propel other powers such as the US, Japan and India to unite against it.

The Doklam venture is almost certainly a Chinese miscalculation. It was likely born of the confidence that the strategy of threats and belligerence, which proved so effective against some South-East Asian nations, would quickly settle the matter in their favour — as in a Sun Tzu script — without firing a shot. However, given the unwavering stand taken by India, supported by Bhutan, there do not appear to be any winning options for the Chinese at present.

The abiding India-China hostility is only partly explained by a jostling for strategic space between powerful neighbours — also relevant is the usually downplayed factor of ideological competition between two antithetical political systems. “Democracy” is the most hated word in the lexicon of the Chinese state.

The threat to China from a rising India is not military. It is from the demonstration effect of a successful democracy which could prove potentially destabilising to a totalitarian system under visible signs of strain.

Former England manager Steve McClaren has agreed to join Israel’s Maccabi Tel Aviv as a coaching consultant to new manager Jordi Cruyff, the Israeli Premier League club said on Monday.

McClaren coached England for 16 months from 2006 before being sacked following the team’s failure to qualify for the 2008 European Championships. He also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United.

“I have huge respect for such a well known club both in Israel and in Europe and I intend to help Jordi and the players achieve success for the fans this season,” McClaren told Tel Aviv’s website (www.maccabi-tlv.co.il).

The 56-year-old previously worked with Cruyff at Manchester United where McClaren was assistant manager under Alex Ferguson from 1999-2001 while Cruyff played for the Premier League club.

McClaren also coached Dutch side FC Twente in two separate spells from 2008-10, leading them to the Dutch league title in 2010, and from 2012-13, where he resigned after a year due to poor performances that led to widespread criticism from fans.

"Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif call for accountability after train derailments","Utkal Express derailment left more than 20 people dead. Utkal Express derailment left more than 20 people dead.

Within a span of four days, two trains have derailed on India’s massive railway network which has claimed lives of over 20 people and left over a hundred passengers injured. Following these accidents, former cricketers have called for some accountability from the government and the ministers over the hapless response to the crisis.

One of the best opening batsmen India produced, Virender Sehwag wrote on his Twitter account, “Being on time was difficult enough,now trains struggling even to be on track.No accountability.Wish human lives valued more,”. While Mohammed Kaif condemned the lives lost with the cavalier attitude, “2 train derailments within a week.There has to be an accountability.”Chalta hai” attitude isappointing.Innocent lives lost,” he wrote.

The first incident happened on August 19 when 14 coaches of Utkal Express derailed near Muzzafarnagar, in western Uttar Pradesh, leaving over 20 passengers dead and 97 injured. The recent incident witnessed nine coaches of Kaifyat Express derailed in Auraiya, Uttar Pradesh, which resulted in more than 70 people getting injured.

In the aftermath of the two derailments, Railway Board chairman AK Mital tendered his resignation. It is still unclear whether it has been accepted by Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu or not.

The tendering process for the Rs 12,000-crore Coastal Road project has entered the last stage, as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is set to invite proposals from the qualified bidders this week. At the current pace of the tendering process, the work on the ground is expected to begin from January next year, instead of the previous plan of starting it by end of this year.

When the BMC had invited interested companies to submit their qualifications back in November last year, 13 companies in the form of eight joint ventures had bid for the three parts of the southern phase of the project.

While civic officials were not keen on divulging further details, they said some of the bidders have not qualified for the Request for Proposal stage.

“We will intimate the bidders who did not qualify for the project in writing today with the reasons for their disqualification. They will then have a chance to put up a representation in case they wish to object to our decision and they will be entitled to a hearing as well,” said an official on Tuesday.

Within the next couple of days, invitations will be send to the bidders who qualified and they will have time until November 21 to submit their proposals. After their proposals have been analysed by the BMC-appointed consultant, the financial bids will be opened and as per the norms, the project will be given to the lowest bidder. Senior officials said that after the contract has been awarded, the agencies will have a month for mobilisation of resources, after which the work will begin, most likely from January.

The Coastal Road project has been divided into the northern and southern phase. While the south phase will run from the Princess Street flyover till the south end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, the North phase will cover the stretch from the north end of the Bandra Worli Sea Link till Kandivli.

Nine coaches of the Kaifiyat Express derailed near Aurariya in Uttar Pradesh in the wee hours of Wednesday, injuring at least 70 people. However, no casualties have been reported so far in the accident. The derailment comes just days after a major accident on the Haridwar-Delhi railway route when 14 coaches of the Utkal Express derailed, killing over 20 passengers. The train met with an accident after a dumper carrying sand overturned on the road parallel to the track.

According to railway officials in North Central Railway (NCR), the collision happened around 2.40 am between Pata and Achhalda railway stations. While eight coaches have been derailed, one coach overturned due to the massive impact of the collision.

“An unauthorised dumper broke the railway fence and hit the engine of Kaifiyat Express causing derailment,” the Railway Ministry said in a statement. “There are no casualties but 25 persons have been injured,” the statement said.

Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted, “A dumper hit the locomotive of the Kaifiyat Express, resulting in derailment. Some passengers have received injuries and have been shifted to nearby hospitals”.

National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) immediately reached the accident site and began rescue and relief work. According to GK Bansal, NCR Railway CPRO, no passenger suffered serious injuries. He also added that Accident Relief Train (ART) train has reached the spot for re-railment and the railway line will be operational soon.

The Railways has diverted several trains in the aftermath of the accident on the route. NCR Chief PRO GK Bansal said, “A number of trains have been cancelled following derailment of Kaifiyat Express. These include the Kanpur-New Delhi Shatabdi Express, the Lucknow-Agra Cantt intercity express, the Lucknow-New Delhi Gomti Express and all passenger trains running on the Kanpur-Tundla section..”.

“New Delhi-bound Rajdhani trains originating from Howrah, Rajendra Nagar (Patna) and Bhubaneswar, besides the Garibrath from Ranchi, have been diverted via Lucknow-Moradabad”, he added.

In addition, more than 40 trains scheduled to run through the Kanpur-Tundla route have also been diverted, he said.

Neymar targets improvement after phenomenal home debut,"The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco. (Source: AP) The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco. (Source: AP)

Neymar said he was already feeling at home at Paris St Germain after scoring twice in a dazzling display in his second match for the French club following his record transfer from Barcelona.

In addition to his two goals in his first match at Parc des Princes, Neymar set up two more and won a penalty as 10-man PSG trounced Toulouse 6-2 to go top of Ligue 1 on Sunday.

“I already feel at home here,” he told local media. “The team plays in the Brazilian style and this helps my integration. “I love the atmosphere of the Parc des Princes. The fans supported us until the last minute. They made a lot of noise.

“Now I want to adapt quicker… I think I can improve.” Neymar, who moved from Barcelona for 222 million euros ($260.61 million) earlier this month, has now scored three goals in two matches for his new club after opening his account on debut against Guingamp last week.

The 25-year-old left his best until last on Sunday, showing brilliant control, and benefiting from a bit of luck, as he danced around five defenders before planting the ball in the back of the net in stoppage time.

“I do not really remember what happened on my second goal, the most important thing is that it went into the back of the net,” he said.

Toulouse striker Andy Delort, whose foul on the Brazilian led to the penalty converted by Edinson Cavani, compared Neymar’s skills to those of another Brazilian who made his mark at Barcelona and PSG.

“He’s a phenomenon, an artist,” he told L’Equipe. “It was like Ronaldinho, we never knew what to expect when he got the ball. I do not know if there’s a way to stop him.

“The only positive thing is that we have only have to face him once more in the championship.”

The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco and Saint-Etienne also maintaining their 100 percent records with three wins each.

PSG, last year’s runners-up, host Saint-Etienne next weekend in their fourth match of the season.

"Clinton, in book, says Trump’s debate stalking made her skin crawl","FILE PHOTO: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump after the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/John Locher) FILE PHOTO: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump after the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/John Locher)

Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says in her new book that Donald Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage in a campaign debate and she wonders if she should have told him to “back up, you creep.” In audio excerpts of the book “What Happened” aired on Wednesday on MSNBC, Clinton described her 2016 campaign as “joyful, humbling, infuriating and just plain baffling” and acknowledged she failed her millions of supporters by losing to Trump in the November election.

In the excerpts, Clinton described the Oct. 9 debate in St. Louis in which Trump followed her closely about the stage, lurking behind her as she fielded questions from a live television audience. The debate came two days after an audiotape emerged in which Trump was heard bragging about groping women. “This is not OK, I thought,” Clinton says. “It was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me.

“We were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. It was incredibly uncomfortable. He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled,” Clinton said. “It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching: ‘Well, what would you do?’ Do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he weren’t repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly: ‘Back up, you creep. Get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women but you can’t intimidate me.'”

Clinton says she chose the first option. “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off,” she says.

But Clinton questions whether she should have chosen the second option. “It certainly would have been better TV,” she says. “Maybe I have over-learned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world.”

Clinton says writing the book, due to be released in the coming weeks, “wasn’t easy.” “Every day that I was a candidate for president, I knew that millions of people were counting on me and I couldn’t bear the idea of letting them down. But I did,” she says. “I couldn’t get the job done.”

"Triple talaq verdict: ‘Allah’s message is for all Muslims, no room for middlemen’","Zakia Soman Zakia Soman

“When they started reading the judgment, I got scared for a bit. Then came Justice Kurian’s part and I was relieved,” said Zakia Soman of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan. BMMA’s petition, ‘Muslim Women’s Quest for Equality’, was suo motu turned into a PIL by a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court before Shayara Bano’s case against triple talaq was filed. That petition eventually became one of six.

Soman described the verdict as a victory, not just for Muslim women but for all women of India. “Rich or poor, literate or illiterate, Hindu, Muslim or Christian — all women supported us in our fight. The BMMA believes that gender justice is fundamental to Islam. It has been distorted by self-appointed guardians of religion like the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. Allah’s message is for all Muslims, men and women, there is no room for middlemen,” she told The Indian Express.

‘A big opportunity’

For Bebaak Collective, an intervener in the case, the judgment provides “a big opportunity to Muslim women” to fight patriarchy within religious institutions and the family. “In arguing that… triple talaq is both un-Quranic and unconstitutional, it is an important departure from earlier judgments on all women’s rights, because it is based on the tenets of equality, dignity and secularism as enshrined in the Constitution… We recognise that the current political climate of communalisation and violence, when the entire Muslim community is under attack in India and much of the Islamophobic world today, makes the fight for minority and gender rights an even more uphill task,” the collective said in a statement.

“Our intervention in court was on three issues — triple talaq, polygamy and nikah halala. On the first day, the court said only triple talaq would be talked about. Today, majority of the judges on the bench said that triple talaq was unconstitutional,” said Hasina Khan of Bebaak Collective, who was present in the Supreme Court Tuesday.

Government puts common engineering entrance test move on hold,"CBSE conducts JEE Main every year CBSE conducts JEE Main every year

The Human Resource Development Ministry has decided to junk the plan of introducing a common engineering entrance exam like NEET from next year. In March, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), had announced that from 2018, the government will introduce a national-level common entrance examination for government colleges. This regulation was opposed by the representatives of West Bengal and Tamil Nadu government.

However, the Ministry had decided to put the idea on hold for reviewing the success of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for admission into medical colleges, before moving ahead. “It has been decided that there will be no common engineering exam next year. However, the idea has not been completely discarded. The AICTE will submit a report about feasibility of conducting the exam in future,” a senior official said.

At present the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducts Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) for admission to in IITs, NITs and other engineering colleges. Over 11 lakh students appear for it every year.

Besides, many state boards have their own entrance examinations for admissions in government and private colleges. Some states also grant admission based on marks of the Class 12 board exams.

There are over 3,300 approved engineering colleges in the country affiliated to universities, with an annual intake of around 16 lakh students.

"Sensitise police on Blue Whale, Home Ministry tells states","Blue Whale: A reported suicide game (Source: Twitter) Blue Whale: A reported suicide game (Source: Twitter)

The Union Home Ministry has written to states and Union territories, urging them to initiate legal action and sensitise police force regarding the Blue Whale challenge. Officials from the ministry said the advisory has been sent to state home secretaries and DGPs. The letter cites instructions issued by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to Internet majors — Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Microsoft and Yahoo — to immediately remove links to the online game that is learnt to have led children to commit suicide in India and abroad. “Action will be taken against those who violate the instructions and police will book them under IT Act,” a senior MHA official said.

The MHA has also shown concern over lack of awareness among policemen regarding misuse of social media. “We have urged state governments to train police officials at district and police station levels to handle such crimes,” the official added.

“Clear instructions have been issued to all the technology platforms that they must delink this game immediately because under the Indian IT ecosystem, no initiative shall be permitted which provokes young boys to commit suicide,” said a senior official. Expressing concern over the availability of such games on the Internet, the IT ministry in its communication said, “It is understood that an administrator of the game uses social media platform to invite /incite children to play this game, which may eventually lead them to take extreme steps for self inflicting injuries including suicide.”

Four suspected Barcelona attack plotters appear in court,"People stand next to candles and flower tributes placed on the ground after a terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

Four men accused of being members of an Islamist cell behind a van attack that killed 13 people in Barcelona last week appeared in court on Tuesday, a day after the alleged driver was shot dead by police. The four, the only ones still alive among the 12 men thought to constitute the group, were brought from Barcelona to Madrid where they were taken to the High Court under tight security for the hearing.

Police on Monday shot dead 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who they had identified as the driver of the van that careered along the packed Las Ramblas boulevard in Barcelona on Thursday, leaving a trail of dead and 120 injured from 34 countries. After the attack, Abouyaaqoub escaped on foot, stabbing to death a man who was parking his car and fleeing in the vehicle.

Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia said on Tuesday he walked some 40 km (25 miles) from Sant Just Desvern, the town on the outskirts of Barcelona where he ditched the hijacked car, to Subirats, where he was shot dead. Abouyaaqoub, who had changed clothes, walked by night and hid during the day, the paper said citing sources involved in the investigation. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the van attack and a separate deadly assault, hours later, in the coastal resort of Cambrils, south of Barcelona.

In Cambrils, a car rammed into passers-by and its occupants got out and tried to stab people. The five assailants were shot dead by police, while a Spanish woman died in the attack. Most of the 12 suspects lived in the town of Ripoll, set in forested hills beneath the Pyrenees north of Barcelona near the French border, and most were young men of Moroccan descent.

One of those who appeared before investigating magistrate Fernando Andreu was Driss Oukabir, whose passport was found in the abandoned van after the Barcelona attack. He turned himself in to police, protesting his innocence and saying his younger brother Moussa Oukabir, 17, who was killed in Cambrils, had stolen his documents. Also in court was Mohammed Aalla, owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. One of his brothers, Said, was killed in Cambrils and a second, Youssef, is believed by police to have died in an explosion at a house used by the plotters at Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, the day before the Barcelona attack.

Mohamed Houli Chemlal, arrested after being hurt in the blast at Alcanar, also appeared in court as did Salah el Karib, who ran an internet cafe in Ripoll that, according to La Vanguardia newspaper, was used to send money to Morocco. At Tuesday’s closed-door hearing, Andreu planned to read out charges against the men expected to include counts of terrorism, murder and weapons possession. Andreu was then to ask the accused if they wish to testify, in which case he would question them.

The hearing was likely to end in the suspects being remanded in custody while the judge conducts an investigation that could take months or even years before a trial is organised. A Ripoll imam who police suspect may have radicalised the young men, Abdelbaki Es Satty, is believed to have died in the explosion in Alcanar. Police believe the blast foiled the group’s plans for a much bigger attack using explosives.

Netanyahu to press Putin over Iran’s Syrian foothold,"“I will discuss with (Putin) Iran’s accelerated effort to entrench militarily in Syria,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. “This creates a problem not just for Israel, but for all the of countries of the Middle East and the whole world.” (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP) “I will discuss with (Putin) Iran’s accelerated effort to entrench militarily in Syria,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. “This creates a problem not just for Israel, but for all the of countries of the Middle East and the whole world.” (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP)

* Netanyahu says Iran seeking military entrenchment in Syria

* Russia a main power broker in Syrian conflict

* Black Sea resort of Sochi venue for Netanyahu-Putin talks

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will tell Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that he is concerned for Iran and its Shiite allies are expanding their presence in Syria as Moscow works to tamp down the Syrian civil war, Israeli officials said.

Russia has been the main broker of de-escalation zones set up in Syria in recent weeks. Israel worries those zones will allow Damascus’s Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements to deploy in greater strength along its northern front.

Another sponsor of the zones is the United States, which shares Moscow’s focus on defeating Islamic State insurgents. Israel argues that Iran is the greater common threat.

Netanyahu and Putin will meet in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi for their sixth series of talks since September 2015. Netanyahu is due back in Israel later in the day for talks with White House peace envoys Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and Dina Powell.

“I will discuss with (Putin) Iran’s accelerated effort to entrench militarily in Syria,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. “This creates a problem not just for Israel, but for all the of countries of the Middle East and the whole world.”

A Kremlin statement said Putin and Netanyahu would “exchange opinions on bilateral relations and the situation in the Middle East, primarily Syria, on fighting international terrorism, a Palestinian-Israeli settlement and other global and regional issues.”

Russia intervened in Syria on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, its forces fighting what it deems Sunni Islamist “terrorists” in partnership with Iran and Hezbollah, Israel’s arch-foes. Moscow argues its big-power clout deters Iran or Hezbollah from opening a new front with Israel.

“We take the Israeli interests in Syria into account,” Alexander Petrovich Shein, Russia’s ambassador to Israel, told its Channel One television on Tuesday. “Were it up to Russia, the foreign forces would not stay.”

Netanyahu has publicly alleged, without providing details, that Iran plans to set up air and naval bases in Syria and his government has issued veiled threats to take pre-emptive action.

“We will find the common diplomatic and political interest with the United States, and later on with Russia, in order to combine our efforts and effect Iran’s return to its place,” Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanyahu’s security cabinet, told Israel’s Channel Two television.

“We should also prepare the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) so it … has relevant plans (for Syria), should that be required.”

In comments published this week, the chief of Israel’s air force said Israel had struck suspected Hezbollah arms shipments in Syria around 100 times during the Syrian civil war, apparently without Russian interference and rarely drawing retaliation.

St Kitts and Nevis hold Mauritius to 1-1 draw in tri-nation football tournament,"St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. (Source: PTI) St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. (Source: PTI)

St Kitts and Nevis found a late equaliser as their match against Mauritius ended in a 1-1 draw in the tri-nation football tournament in Mumbai on Tuesday. Rogers Kimaree struck in the 87th minute after Jean Frederic Sarah had put Mauritius ahead in the 19th minute off a header.

Mauritius looked organised, adopted an aggressive approach from the start and had better possession of the ball.

It helped them take a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute. From a cross from the flank by defender Pascal Damien Balisson, Sarah gave Mauritius the lead off a header.

St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. Assisted by forward Tishan Hanley, Kimaree ran in and netted the ball even as a handful of fans cheered at the Andheri Sports Complex.

Going into the game, Mauritian coach Francisco Filo left out goalkeeper Kevin Obrian Jean-Louis and replaced him with James Caserne.

After the break, Mauritius missed a chance to extend their lead as Jean Mervyn Jocelyn’s shot was on target only to be saved by St Kitts and Nevis custodian with a dive.

A few minutes after that, Sarah’s header went completely off target, even as the St Kitts and Nevis defence was tested all through the game.

Mauritius again had a chance but Louis Guiyano Chiffone, who got a pass from Sarah, hit marginally wide. Sarah, who was the best Mauritian player, had another chance but this time, he too missed the target.

The other notable chance for St Kitts and Nevis came when Kimaree shot at the goal after a through ball which was saved by the goalkeeper.

St Kitts and Nevis coach Jacques Passy said that his team played a “very bad first half”.

“I would not call an excellent, but an above average performance. We had six goal opportunities, (but) a draw leaves me with a smile,” said Passy.

His boys play India on August 24 and Passy termed the hosts as favourites.

“I have no excuse philosophy, If we win, we are the champions. If India win, they are champions. I am facing a great team (India), which everyone should be proud of. We can do much better. “The absolute favourite to win the tournament is India. It is no more a three nation, but a two-nation tournament. Our focus is on India,” the coach said.

“Today, our display was below than what the team can do, it was not a tactical problem. We were not just comfortable. India are the favourites,” he maintained.

Mauritian coach Filo said his side will hope to improve. St Kitts and Nevis play hosts India on August 24 at the same venue.

Ranveer was in a fix looking at Ramdev’s energy but even he was no less in setting the stage on fire.

Purists eager for fight after Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor,"The backlash is out there, even as the relentless hype switches into another gear. (Source: AP) The backlash is out there, even as the relentless hype switches into another gear. (Source: AP)

Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s fight with Conor McGregor is a joke, a spectacle that has little to do with real boxing. No reason to spend two cents on it, much less $100, when there’s a real super fight coming up a few weeks later between Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez.

The backlash is out there, even as the relentless hype switches into another gear. It’s one reason that plenty of tickets remain available a week before the fight, and entire rows of $150 closed-circuit seats remain available at hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.

Yes, the pay-per-view sales will be massive simply because of the freak show nature of the event. We love our reality TV, and it doesn’t get any more real than two colorful personalities who know how to talk the talk stepping into the unknown in a boxing ring.

It might even be somewhat competitive, if you believe UFC fans who don’t seem to get the concept that their man is a boxing novice going up against the master defensive fighter of his generation.

Boxing purists, though, may be saving their money for Golovkin and Alvarez. “If you are one of those die-hard boxing fans you might be waiting for that one,” said StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp, in analyzing the slow ticket sales at least so far in the secondary ticket market.

Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya certainly hopes so. He made the Sept. 16 GGG-Canelo fight at the same T-Mobile arena Mayweather and McGregor will compete before that event became a reality..

De La Hoya who helped make Mayweather a star when the two men fought in 2007 blasted the McGregor bout as a farce when it was being negotiated and urged boxing fans not to buy it, saying “Our sport might not ever recover.”

Indeed, there’s some evidence that boxing fans aren’t putting their money into what they see as one-sided event, at least yet. Ticket prices are dropping quickly and the closed-circuit seats that sold out in one day for Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are available in plentiful supply from the original sellers.

Meanwhile, host hotel MGM Grand has cut its room prices three times for the weekend, and there are hotel rooms readily available on the Las Vegas Strip for less than $200.

But promoters and Showtime executives believe there is enough excitement being generated that the pay-per-view even at a cost of $99.95 could exceed the record of 4.6 million set by Mayweather-Pacquiao.

“There are the boxing purists who aren’t as enthusiastic about this fight, and I understand that,” said Stephen Espinoza, who heads the sports division at Showtime. “But I think that’s more than compensated by the huge crush of mainstream interest in the event. The event as a whole remains compelling. It’s something we’ve never seen before and no one can reliably predict how it is going to go.”

Many in the boxing press have made that prediction, writing that the fight is a mismatch and McGregor doesn’t stand a chance. That led Mayweather’s promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, to scold writers at his media day for hurting boxing by being too negative about the fight.

“Floyd has single-handedly put boxing on his back. (He’s) the reason boxing is being talked about, as much as it is,” Ellerbe said. “Just imagine the two years Floyd’s been gone, where was boxing then? With the exception of Canelo and the little fight he had, people weren’t really talking about boxing. The minute you mention Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, then this thing opens back up.”

The best guess is, no matter how many boxing fans boycott the fight, it will do monster pay-per-view numbers from UFC fans and from the simply curious who want to invite a few friends over to watch the spectacle unfold. That will be enough to elevate it to Mayweather-Pacquiao status, even if it doesn’t fare as well at the box office in Las Vegas.

But that may say more about America’s appetite for reality TV and spectacle than it does about the two sports themselves.

"3 judgments, 3 takeaways","Breaking Through: Women in old Delhi’s Jama Masjid area on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq. Tashi Tobgyal Breaking Through: Women in old Delhi’s Jama Masjid area on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq. Tashi Tobgyal

The constitution Bench of five judges, belonging to five different religious communities, took more than three months to author its 395-page judgment on triple divorce. The historic verdict marks a red-letter day for gender justice in India. However, even judges who held triple divorce unconstitutional based their decision on arbitrariness rather than on the discriminatory nature of triple divorce. Thus, gender justice was not the basis of the majority judgment. The case before the Supreme Court was born out of an unrelated matter regarding the denial of inheritance rights to Hindu women under a 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act (Prakash and Ors versus Phulavati and Ors, October 16, 2015). A Hindu woman had won against her brothers in the High Court but lost in the Supreme Court. At the end of the judgment, the Bench of Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and Anil R Dave ordered that Muslim law too is discriminatory, for which a separate Public Interest Litigation should be initiated.

The current case was filed by Shayara Bano to get triple divorce, polygamy and halala declared unconstitutional. The case had an interesting twist — her husband had, prior to giving her triple divorce, filed a case for the restitution of conjugal rights, and it was Shayara who had left her matrimonial home. While Phulavati did not get justice and the property to which she was entitled under the progressive 2005 amendment, Muslim women who are victims of instant triple divorce, have got some relief.

The issues in the case were so complicated that we have as many as three judgments. Chief Justice of India J S Khehar authored one opinion, with which Justice S Abdul Nazeer agreed. The second opinion was authored by Justice Kurian Joseph. The third judgment was written by Justice Rohinton F Nariman on behalf of himself and of Justice Uday U Lalit. Justice Kurian agreed with Justice Khehar on some points, and with Justice Nariman on others. Let us understand the judgments and reasons for the different opinions. All the opinions have clearly stated that they are dealing just with instant triple divorce, and not with other forms of divorces under Muslim Personal Law.

Nariman: Triple divorce is unconstitutional

Justice Nariman has held that instant irrevocable triple talaq not preceded by the efforts at reconciliation is unconstitutional, as it is contrary to the right to equality, which includes the right against arbitrariness. The basis of his decision is the recognition of triple divorce by the Shariat Act, 1937. The Act laid down that in matters of talaq, gift, will, inheritance etc., “the rule of decision where parties are Muslims shall be Muslim Personal Law”. He quoted the 1932 decision of the Privy Council in which triple divorce was held as valid under Sharia to conclude that since instant triple divorce is “manifestly arbitrary”, the Shariat Act, to the extent it recognised triple divorce, is ultra vires the Constitution.

He also observed that the duties or obligations of a Muslim can be divided into five categories, viz., Farz, which must be obeyed and Wajib, which is slightly less important; Mustahab, or recommendatory; Jaiz, which is permissible, and to which religion is indifferent; Makruh, or unworthy; and finally, Haram, or forbidden. Instant triple talaq, he said, is either in category 3 (permissible) or, probably, in category 4, which is undesirable.

Since it is not obligatory or recommended, and is rather sinful or undesirable, it cannot meet the “essentiality test”, and is, thus, not protected by Article 25 (freedom of religion). Also, triple talaq, which is irrevocable and is valid under Muslim Personal law even when the husband assigns no reason for his action, is arbitrary, and therefore, unconstitutional, Justice Nariman has said.

He has struck down Section 2 of the Shariat Act, which recognises and enforces triple divorce. All parent laws, subordinate legislation and executive orders are subject to fundamental rights, and must be struck down if they are not compatible. Justice Nariman dissented with the judgment of the CJI on the issue of the judiciary not being the right forum to dispose of such matters. The Supreme Court cannot refuse to decide when approached by a litigant under Article 32 against the violation of his/her fundamental rights, and put the ball in Parliament’s court, he said.

Khehar: Major milestone on freedom of religion

Justice Khehar’s judgment is the most detailed — 272 pages — and a major milestone in the history of freedom of religion in India. For the first time in Indian judicial history, freedom of religion subject to restrictions given in Articles 25 and 26 has been held to be “absolute”. After quoting Constituent Assembly debates on Articles 25 and 44, the CJI held that personal law is part of the freedom of religion, which courts are duty-bound to protect. He also said courts are not supposed to find fault with provisions of personal law, which are based on beliefs, not logic. Personal law, he said, is beyond judicial scrutiny.

The CJI explicitly said that accepting the petitioner’s prayer to hold triple talaq unconstitutional would amount to negating freedom of religion. He equated triple divorce to fundamental rights. Disagreeing with Justice Nariman, he observed that since the recognition of Muslim Personal Law by the Shariat Act of 1937 does not give it statutory status, and because Muslim Personal Law is not ‘law’ as held by the Supreme Court, the Shariat Act, or triple talaq under it, cannot be held unconstitutional. He also turned down the central government’s argument citing international conventions, saying such conventions, if they were contrary to fundamental rights, cannot be implemented.

The CJI also refused to strike down triple divorce as violative of public order, health and morality, or for being contrary to other fundamental rights such as the right to equality or the right to live with human dignity. As in the case of sati and the devdasi practice, in triple talaq, too, Parliament should take the lead, keeping in view similar reforms in Muslim countries, he said. Using the Supreme Court’s extraordinary powers under Article 142, he ordered that no triple talaq will be given for six months. Justice Joseph disagreed with the use of Article 142 in this case.

Joseph: Triple divorce is un-Islamic

The third and most important judgment was delivered by Justice Joseph who fully endorsed the CJI’s opinion on freedom of religion, thereby ensuring its majority. He agreed with Justice Nariman on triple divorce not being an essential part of Muslim Personal Law. But he disagreed with Justice Nariman on the interpretation of the Shariat Act — concurring, rather, with Justice Khehar’s opinion that the Shariat Act is not a legislation regulating triple divorce.

He held that the purpose of the 1937 Act was to remove un-Islamic and oppressive customs and usages from Muslim Personal Law, and since triple divorce is not mentioned in the Quran, it is not a part of Sharia — and thus cannot be enforced under the Shariat Act. What is sinful in theology must be held bad in law as well, Justice Joseph ruled. He also observed that the legislature, while enacting laws on gender justice, must give due weightage to freedom of religion.

"Anthony Martial is well integrated with the little French group in the team, says Jose Mourinho","Manchester United’s Paul Pogba celebrates scoring their third goal with Anthony Martial. (Source: Reuters) Manchester United’s Paul Pogba celebrates scoring their third goal with Anthony Martial. (Source: Reuters)

After talks about Anthony Martial’s future with Manchester United being in doubt, Jose Mourinho said that the former Monaco player is developing the right attitude and that they are using him well. He also added that French connection in the team is helping Martial feel integrated.

Mourinho was quoted by the Daily Mail on Monday as saying, “We’re using him well and he’s coming with the right attitude. We had a conversation about the future he has here. Of course he wants to play, of course he wants to start, of course he wants to be selected for the national team, of course he wants to go to the World Cup, so that’s good.”

“And for me it’s simple. I can’t play Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and EFL Cup with 11 players, I need a squad. I think he has a good connection on the pitch with Paul (Pogba), with Romelu (Lukaku). I think he’s growing in confidence and, of course, two periods of 20 minutes and he’s scored two goals, so for his confidence it’s good.”

Mourinho added that the French connection among Marouane Fellaini, Pogba, Lukaku and Martial has helped the forward feel well integrated. He added: “He’s working really well. Maybe that French language little group we have – Fellaini, Paul, Lukaku – is a group where he’s very well integrated now and they bring him up.”

“His professional level has improved, he’s working much, much better, so we are happy. We have lots of hopes with him and obviously he has to be happy now, and he can only improve.”

United have had a good start to the season, beating both West Ham and Swansea City 4-0 to sit at the top of the table. Mourinho, however, said that they are not getting carried away with the wins.

After Wayne Rooney announced his retirement from International football on Wednesday, the footballl world reacted to England’s all time highest goalscorer drawing curtain to his 14-year long career with the national team.

The 31-year old player, who also left Manchester United to play for Everton this season, said in a statement that he was called by coach Gareth Southgate to return back to the squad this week for the upcoming matches but he decided otherwise. “Having already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football. It is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton and those closest to me. Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me. But I believe now is the time to bow out.”

Adding that he will always remain a passionate England fan, Rooney bid farewell to his stint with England after appearing in national colours 119 times and scoring 53 goals.

Kimi Raikkonen to drive again for Ferrari in 2018 F1 championship,"Kimi Raikkonen joined from McLaren in 2007, winning the drivers’ title in his first year with Ferrari. (Source: Reuters) Kimi Raikkonen joined from McLaren in 2007, winning the drivers’ title in his first year with Ferrari. (Source: Reuters)

Kimi Raikkonen will be racing for Ferrari again next season after the Italian Formula One team announced on Tuesday a contract extension with the Finn for 2018.

The popular 2007 world champion, who will be 38 in October, would have been out of contract at the end of this year with plenty of rivals eyeing up his seat at the sport’s most successful and glamorous team.

Raikkonen has not won a race since he was at Lotus in 2013, and is currently fifth in a championship led by German team mate Sebastian Vettel, who has won four of the season’s 11 races to date.

Vettel is also out of contract at the end of the season and the short Ferrari statement did not mention him. However, he is expected to remain once a longer and more lucrative deal has been hammered out.

The timing of Ferrari’s statement was earlier than expected, since the team have often made such announcements at their home Italian round at Monza which follows on from this weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix.

They had also been tipped to confirm both drivers at the same time.

Vettel, a four times world champion with Red Bull, has also been linked in some media speculation to champions Mercedes where Finland’s Valtteri Bottas has yet to be confirmed for 2018.

By opting to keep Raikkonen, Ferrari have gone for an experienced driver who is still quick and who will not rock the boat in what is likely to be his final season. He first raced for

Ferrari between 2007-9 and then returned in 2014.

He and Vettel get on well, with the German keen on him staying, and Raikkonen has shown his loyalty this season by accepting team orders to his detriment.

The Finn has twice finished second behind Vettel, in Monaco and Hungary, while also taking third place in Britain and Russia.

He started on pole position in Monaco in May, his first appearance at the front of the grid since June 2008, and has a strong track record at Belgium’s Spa-Francorchamps where he was won four times.

His future was called into question in July, however, when Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne called him “a bit of a laggard”.

“I think Kimi has got to show a higher level of commitment to the process,” he had told reporters at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Marchionne has also emphasised that he wants Vettel to stay.

Lebanon monitored Australia bomb plot suspects: Lebanese Interior Minister,"Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told a news conference that one of the men’s brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.

(Representational Image)

Lebanon monitored the brothers accused of plotting to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi for more than a year and coordinated with the Australian government on it for a long time, the Lebanese interior minister said on Monday. Australian police charged Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat this month with two counts of planning a terrorist attack after conducting raids to disrupt what authorities described as an Islamic State-inspired plot to bomb an Etihad Airways flight.

Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told a news conference that one of the men’s brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.

Lebanon’s Internal Security Force then placed Tareq, Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat, and a fourth brother, Amer Khayat, under surveillance. Khaled, Mahmoud and Amer were all living in Australia but occasionally visited Lebanon, he said in Beirut. Machnouk said the brothers were Lebanese.

He said Amer Khayat had arrived in Lebanon on July 15, the day Australian police have said the plotters tried to smuggle a bomb onto an Etihad flight from Sydney. Australian police also said a man had tried to check in luggage without knowing that it contained a bomb, which was hidden in a meat grinder, placed there by his brother. However, Machnouk said Amer Khayat was to have carried out the attack and that a Lebanese internal intelligence agency had found he was “involved in the operation”. He said a bomb had also been hidden in a large child’s doll in the luggage.

He did not say what has happened to Amer Khayat since he landed in Lebanon. The plot was foiled because the luggage exceeded the airline’s weight limit, Machnouk said.

Australian police had previously said it appeared that one of the accused had left the airport, taking the luggage with him, while his brother boarded the plane and left Australia. On Tuesday, Australian police said it was not appropriate to comment further on the details of a current investigation that was also before Australian courts. “We have a close and cooperative relationship with the Lebanese authorities and are working closely on this investigation,” an Australian Federal Police spokeswoman said in an email.

Asked whether the operation would have been successful if the luggage had not exceeded the weight limit, Machnouk said: “Probably, yes”. He said information from Lebanese intelligence had “assisted in foiling a large operation aiming to blow up a plane”. “The plane had 120 Lebanese on board in addition to other nationalities,” Machnouk said.

Spicejet says excess baggage fee needed to keep fare lucrative,"Besides SpiceJet is also trying to increase its ancillary revenues from non-flying activities. (File/Photo) Besides SpiceJet is also trying to increase its ancillary revenues from non-flying activities. (File/Photo)

No-frills carrier Spicejet, that has hiked excess baggage rates, on Wednesday said the charges would help low-cost carriers like it remain competitive in the market. The airline, however, emphasised that it has kept reasonable amount of luggage free for passengers. The Gurgaon-based airline also said that it would expand its services on new as well as existing domestic and international routes when the company would start getting delivery of new planes from Boeing and Bombardier.

“Until and unless we do that, we would not be able to provide lucrative fares,” SpiceJet Chief Marketing Officer Debojo Maharshi told PTI when asked about excess baggage charges.

“It’s important, we have to balance and run the airline in optimally viable fare, and to achieve that these are some commercial numbers which we would have to keep,” Maharshi said.

Last week, the Delhi High Court had set aside the Rs 100 per kg fee fixed by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for excess checked-in baggage of 15-20 kg on private airlines against their earlier rates ranging from Rs 220 to Rs 350.

“While we take care that the passengers revenue should be the minimum and should make more Indian fly and we give a reasonable amount of luggage free,” he said, adding on the top if someone has additional luggage, he can fly by paying more.

On being asked that Air India is still giving full checked-in baggage up to 23 kg, he said: “It is a full service carrier and their fares and luggage limits are much more higher. Their operating guidelines are different from ours.”

Besides SpiceJet is also trying to increase its ancillary revenues from non-flying activities.

“We want to increase our ancillary revenues, while we want to keep Pax Revenue (passenger) as commercially viable as we can,” Maharshi said.

Currently, ancillary revenue contributes 16 per cent of SpiceJet’s total revenue, he added.

“The idea is to increase it as much we can. We are coming with new initiatives to increase the ancillary revenue,” Maharshi said.

Over expansion of service network, he said that SpiceJet would add more wings after it get deliveries from Boeing and Bombardier, which would take to new domestic and international destinations.

“We have a large fleet, which is coming as we have firm orders from Boeing Aircrafts. We have also placed firm order of 25 aircrafts from Bombardier mainly used for regional connectivity… we would fly to various international destinations. we would increase that,” he added.

On being asked as whether SpiceJet would rope in any personality to endorse, he said: “As such, we never had any brand ambassador but we do have plans to associate with couple of celebrities for special causes.”

However, Maharshi also added that as such, SpiceJet does not have any plans for now.

Over government’s push for regional connectivity, he said that it was a good initiative and SpiceJet has supported it.

“SpiceJet is one of the first airlines to participate in it. We are already operating under few routes under it and every month we are adding more routes,” he said.

Spicejet on Wednesday announced an initiative with Prega News, the pregnancy detection kit from Mankind Pharma, under which it would provide special facilities to pregnant women fliers.

As part of this initiative, a SpiceJet aircraft Boeing 737-800 Series has been fully body wrapped with Prega News branding.

KCB struggling to set up more immersion tanks,"Immersion tank constructed by KCB in city. Sandeep Daundkar Immersion tank constructed by KCB in city. Sandeep Daundkar

EVEN as the clamour for celebrating Ganesh festival in the most environment-friendly manner was growing in the city, the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB) appeared to be struggling to complete the construction of two immersion tanks in the cantonment area. Though there are two medium-sized tanks available for carrying out immersion processes at Dnyaneshwar ghat in east Khadki, some of the board officials admitted that the facility was falling inadequate.

“We have two permanent tanks built at the Dnyaneshwar ghat. But on many occasions, due to their small size, they are unable to cater to the number of devotees who wish to immerse the idols in these tanks in the eco-friendly manner,” said a senior official from the KCB.

The officers were not very optimistic about the completion of the ongoing construction of the two other tanks, stuck up due to crunch in funds, along the riverbank in Khadki.

When contacted, board members said that temporary fibre tanks could be set up to manage the crowd.

“Since the crowd is often manageable, we did not find the need to set up more tanks along the river. But, we are keeping tanks on standby which will be deployed whenever needed,” said Suresh Kamble, a board member.

Among the other preparedness that the board was working upon was to step up security during the festivities. The cantonment board has urged the Ganesh mandals in its limits to install CCTVs during the festivities.

“At present , there are 70 camera doing surveillance. In addition, we have also written to mandals to install cameras around their pandals and help step up the security,” added Kamble.

Mohammad Kaif trolled AGAIN after welcoming Supreme Court’s ‘triple talaq’ verdict,"This is not the first time he was under the radar. (Source: Mohammad Kaif/Facebook) This is not the first time he was under the radar. (Source: Mohammad Kaif/Facebook)

Time and again, Mohammad Kaif has had to deal with a barrage of trolls on Twitter for voicing his thoughts on the social media platform. Recently, the Supreme Court took a much welcome verdict to ban the practice of ‘triple talaq’ for six months until a permanent law comes into force. Appreciating the much-needed move, the former cricketer took to social media and wrote: “Welcome decision by Supreme Court to declare #TripleTalaq unconstitutional. Will give Muslim women security. Gender justice is much needed!”

However, his tweet did not please many of his followers, and he was targeted yet again. From asking him if he is a Muslim to questioning if he has read the Quran, there were a lot of racist comments. Moreover, one of them went on to tweet: “Women are most secure in islaam….being Muslim you should know it!”

Well, this is not the first time he has been under the radar. It all started when the cricketer took the networking website to share pictures of himself doing Surya Namaskar. Without any fault of his, he faced criticism from both Islamic as well as Hindu fanatics. Funnily enough, they raised the same question – why is a ‘Muslim’ doing a ‘Hindu Yoga’! Not long after, a sweet picture of him playing chess with his son came under fire, and the reason will annoy you to no end. Quite absurdly, their point was that “playing chess is haraam in their religion”. Sigh!

What do you think of his tweet? Tell us in the comments below.

Morocco: Sexual assault video of woman on bus sparks outrage,"While the video sparked widespread condemnation, some accused the woman of having “provoked the men with indecent clothing”. (Representational) While the video sparked widespread condemnation, some accused the woman of having “provoked the men with indecent clothing”. (Representational)

A video of a young woman being sexually assaulted by a gang of teenage boys on a bus in Casablanca has sparked outrage in Morocco, reigniting a bitter debate about violence against women in the Muslim country. The video, which was posted on social media on Sunday, shows four boys sexually molesting a woman while laughing, tearing her clothes off and insulting her in Arabic.

The woman – who the authorities said had learning difficulties – is seen in tears, crying for help, while neither the bus driver nor any of the passengers intervene. Sexual harassment and abuse of women is rife in Morocco where a national survey found that nearly two-thirds of women had experienced physical, psychological, sexual or economic abuse. Earlier in August a video showing a mob of men hounding a young woman on a street in Tangier caused uproar in the media.

On Monday the Moroccan authorities said they had arrested six boys aged 15 to 17 for their “presumed implication in the woman’s aggression” and put them under investigation. While the video sparked widespread condemnation on social and local media, some users accused the woman of having “provoked the men with indecent clothing”. One man wrote on Facebook that “I condemn the act but cover yourselves up, this one was easy to undress.”

Moroccan charity Don’t Touch My Child called for any witnesses to come forward “to bring to justice this barbaric horde who shamefully attacked a young women”. Public transport company M’Dina Bus condemned the incident and said it was collaborating with authorities in the north African kingdom, which is trying to attract investors and tourists by presenting itself as a safe haven.

"Man killed in Ambedkar Colony: Before violent altercation, a birthday party","Anil with daughter Angel at her birthday party, Monday Anil with daughter Angel at her birthday party, Monday

Angel had been waiting anxiously for her father on Monday as she knew he had planned a birthday party for her. She had just turned 12 and Anil was driving around the neighbourhood, buying toys and a cake for her. Anil, who used to drive an Eeco car and had a small property business, had been saving money to invest in his cousin’s business. “Anil had turned his life around five years ago. I work in the investment banking field and had suggested that he invest the money for his children’s sake,” said Michael, Anil’s cousin.

On Monday, Anil picked up a green custom-made cake with two tigers seated on the icing. The party started around 7 pm, as relatives streamed in and Anil played host. The party wrapped up after he gave his daughter her gifts — the toys and some cash. While the guests were leaving, Anil stepped out of his house to drop his mother-in-law, Florence, when Vishal made an unexpected appearance. “They had known each other for years. Anil had mended his ways but, Vishal stuck to the life of a thug. He would steal from the locality and would pick fights with people,” said Florence.

Amid abuses, Anil warned Vishal that he was his “senior” and should be treated with respect. “My husband was scared of fighting. He would never pick a fight with anyone and even during confrontations, he would choose to run rather than confront the attacker,” said Angelina Lovely, Anil’s wife.

After a heated exchange of words, Vishal allegedly assaulted Anil, his wife and mother-in-law with an iron rod. Angel watched the events unfold from the balcony. The following morning, when Anil’s body was shifted to the mortuary, her family broke the news to Angel. “She is shattered. I don’t know how she will deal with this at such a young age,” said Gloria, Angel’s aunt.

"Economy doing well on strong fundamentals, reforms: FSDC","The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) was chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley.. (Source: PTI Photo) The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) was chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley.. (Source: PTI Photo)

India’s macro-economic stability remains strong on the back of an improvement in fundamentals, structural reforms with the launch of the goods and services tax and steps to tackle the twin balance sheet problems, according to the deliberations at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on Tuesday, chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley.

The Council, consisting mostly of regulators and secretaries of the finance ministry, also took note of investor confidence in financial markets, which is reflected in high and rising bond and stock valuations and long-term positive consequences of demonetisation, according to a finance ministry statement.

Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian made a presentation on the state of Indian economy at the meeting. The twin balance sheet problem refers to overleveraged companies and bad-loan-encumbered banks, which has dented investments in the economy. “The Council also discussed the issues and challenges facing the Indian economy and the members agreed to the need to keep constant vigil and be in a state of preparedness of managing any external and internal vulnerabilities,” the ministry said in the statement.

RBI Governor Urjit Patel, finance secretary Ashok Lavasa, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, financial services secretary Anjuly Chib Duggal, corporate affairs secretary Tapan Ray, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY) Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi and IRDAI Chairman TS Vijayan were among those who attended the meeting.

The Council also took stock of the progress of the Financial Sector Assessment Programme for India, jointly conducted by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. “The Council directed that the assessment report should be finalised by the end of this calendar year,” it said.

A brief report on measures taken by the FSDC sub-committee, headed by the RBI Governor, was presented at the meeting. The Council also went for a comprehensive review of the action taken on the decisions at earlier meetings of the body.

The meeting deliberated on the central KYC registry system and discussed the issues and suggestions relating to the operationalisation of the registry. Sebi has already set the December deadline for linking Aadhaar with KYC for stock market transactions. The Council also discussed at length on strengthening regulation of credit rating agencies.

"Ten months after it banned toddy sales, Maharashtra govt does a U-turn","Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (PTI Photo) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (PTI Photo)

The Maharashtra government has reversed a ban it had imposed on the supply and sale of toddy in the financial capital. Last October, the Devendra Fadnavis government had enforced the ban, following an Excise department’s survey, which had found that one in five toddy depots in Mumbai had been selling toddy laced with deadly chemicals. A deadly cocktail of chloral hydrate and alprazolam was being served in the name of toddy in Mumbai and other urban belts, including Thane, Pune, Solapur and Nanded, among others, this survey had found.

While the adulterators were found to have mixed the chemicals to give sedative or muscle-relaxing effect to the consumers, senior government sources said the deadly cocktail can result in withdrawal symptoms among the addicts. In neighbouring Telangana where a similar racket was previously unearthed, some deaths were also reported owing to the adulteration. Startled by the revelation, the Fadnavis government had banned toddy sales in non-toddy growing areas. At that time, state’s Excise Minister Chandrasekhar Bavankule said the government’s new policy was to permit toddy shops only in talukas where toddy could be tapped.

Toddy trees are primarily found in the Sindhurdurg, Ratnagiri, and Palghar districts in the Konkan belt. There are also some toddy growing taluks in Western Maharashtra’s Sangli, Solapur, Pune and Marathwada’s Nanded. The new policy stated that one toddy shop would be permitted for every 1,000 mature toddy trees.

Before the prohibition policy was introduced, there were 1,250 toddy shops across the state, including about 250 in Mumbai. About 60 per cent of the toddy depots across the state, including all of them in Mumbai, were shut down, following the ban. While admitting to the pressure being imposed by the toddy lobby to overturn the decision, Bavankule had then said, “We cannot factor in revenues when lives of people are being risked.” But ten months later, the government has overturned the ban for Mumbai and Thane.

On August 21, following Bavankule’s approval, the state’s Excise department issued revised orders, making a special dispensation for Mumbai and Thane. “The 1,000 trees condition is being relaxed for Mumbai (island city), Mumbai (suburbs) and Thane as a special case. Toddy growers in adjoining Palghar and Raigad districts,” states the government resolution.

Monetarily speaking, toddy sales contribute to just Rs 45 crore out of the Excise department’s total income of over Rs 13,000 crore. But sources said there had been mounting pressure from toddy growers from Palghar and Raigad districts to allow sales in Mumbai and Thane, which continue to have a clientele for the desi liquor.

Bavankule remained unavailable for comment. But Valsa Nair Singh, Principal Secretary, Excise, said, “The relaxation had been extended as a measure to check the supply of spurious or adulterated liquor, which has continued despite the prohibition.”

While the senior bureaucrat said it had been made mandatory for toddy licence holders in Mumbai and Thane to produce evidence that the toddy being supplied had been tapped from toddy growing trees in Palghar and Raigad. Also each licence holder will have to show availability of 1000 mature trees in these district to procure the licence, which would be auctioned under prevalent norms. Further, the government has involved the district collector offices and the Excise Commissioner’s office to check supply of adulterated toddy. Some other senior government sources however remained wary that the relaxation would also bolster the supply of chemical-laced toddy.

"I think this Indian team will win 2019 World Cup, says Axar Patel","Axar Patel picked up three wickets for 34 runs in his 10 overs against Sri Lanka on Sunday. (Source: Reuters) Axar Patel picked up three wickets for 34 runs in his 10 overs against Sri Lanka on Sunday. (Source: Reuters)

India started off their ODI series with a comfortable nine wicket win over Sri Lanka in Dambulla on Sunday. For India, left arm spinner Axar Patel was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets for 34 runs in his 10 overs. After the match, India’s pacer Jasprit Bumrah spoke with Axar Patel on his performance in the match.

On being asked about the bowling plan and his emotions after getting selected into the squad, Axar said, “I am really happy to be back in the team after six or seven months, I was not too worried about making a comeback, I thought that I would continue the same way as I used to perform earlier, when playing for India.”

Jasprit also asked Axar about the game plan when Sri Lanka’s first wicket partnership was building up, to which he replied,”Initially I planned to contain the Sri Lankan batsmen as they were scoring at a high rate and even I needed two overs to settle down, then I decided to go for wickets and felt really good when I got my first wicket after two overs.”

Axar also praised Shikhar Dhawan’s knock of unbeaten 132 runs and felt that he deserved the man of the match award, “Really happy to see Dhawan score and he deserved the man of the match and it feels good when the entire team is performing to their level best in every department, and are not dependent on individuals.”

On being asked about the change which he noticed in the current Indian Team from past six-seven months when Axar last played for India, he said, “All players are young with the average age of 26-27 so I think this is a main factor and everyone is enjoying each other’s company. There is unity in the team which is helping us to gel up together so I think this team will win the 2019 ICC World Cup.” India will play their second ODI of the five match series on August 24 in Pallekele.

Fitness is not just a habit, it is a lifestyle; one that requires commitment and dedication so dont let monsoon dampen your spirits. Some quick and easy steps like working out indoors or getting few simpler exercising devices can do the trick for you, say experts.

Reebok Master Trainer Gagan Arora encourages you to keep your body engine fueled every day, with these simple things to keep in mind during rainy days.

* Run those miles: The body is waterproof so do not fret to take those extra laps in the rain. An outdoor workout keeps the body metabolism going and helps you stay fit and energized.

* Stay active through the day: If heading out in the rain is not your cup of tea, workout indoors. Pack in a short 30 – 40 minutes schedule that includes a mix of squats, push-ups, planks. Apart from homemade food, add seasonal fruits and vegetables along with lean meat and legumes to your diet.

* The ‘Right’ Gear: Wear bright coloured speed wick or Active Chill fitness gear and socks as they will keep you cool during humidity, dry quickly and reduce the chances of chaffing.

* Monsoon gateways: Take a break from your routine and unwind with a quick getaway during the rains. Plan a fun ‘Fitcation’ that includes long walks and fun outdoor games with family and friends to stay active, energized and light this monsoon.

* Vitamins are vital – Add vitamins to your diet to keep infections at bay and maintain your energy levels. Get enough rest, stay indoors and relax if not feeling well.

Additionally, Meenakshi Subramaniyam, coach at HealthifyMe.com also added few tips.

* Stick to the same time plan for workout sessions at home. Make sure the session is 45 minutes at least.

* Start with simple stretching exercises to warm-up followed by five minutes spot jogging. Follow it up with 15 minutes of rigorous cardio to get the heart beat up and start the fat burning process. One can opt for skipping, stair climbing, hopping, jumping jacks etc. To strengthen body muscles for toning the body and preventing joints from injury, do a combination of 20 squats + 20 lunges (each leg) + 20 pushups. You repeat this set 2-4 times as per your capacity.

* Get few simple exercising devices like dumbells, skipping rope, resistance tubes etc at home and try hardcore floor exercises like planks, crunches and leg raises. You can start with a plank position for 30 seconds and repeat it again. Then lie down on your back and do 20 crunches + 20 reverse crunches + 20 alternate leg raises. Repeat this set 2 times. An indoor jog on the spot or around a house jog is also beneficial, or Leslie walks which can be done indoors.

* Yoga can be performed both indoors and outdoors. Select an airy spot in your house practice simple asanas to keep yourself fit. Yoga also helps reduce respiratory problems that are very common during the monsoon season.

*Dance workouts are fun and flexible to enjoy indoor monsoon workout.

Belgian driver Stoffel Vandoorne will continue to race for struggling former world champions McLaren next season, the Formula One team announced on Wednesday ahead of his home race at Spa-Francorchamps.

The newcomer has scored just one point so far this season, with McLaren struggling to get strong performances from their Honda engine.

“I’m delighted that the team has now formally announced that I will continue to race for them next year, because I’ll be able to approach the second half of my rookie season with total focus on the job in hand,” he said in a statement.

McLaren Racing Director Eric Boullier said the plan had always been for Vandoorne to continue as part of a multi-year deal.

“That plan hasn’t changed, and I’m very happy therefore to be able to confirm that he’ll continue to race for us next season,” said the Frenchman.

“Like all rookies, he’s had to learn a lot in the first half of his first Formula One season, but we have great confidence in him, and he’s getting better and better all the time.”

McLaren’s other driver, Spain’s double world champion Fernando Alonso, has yet to decide his future and wants to be assured of a competitive car before committing to McLaren.

No guarantee of residence for migrants fleeing US for Canada,"Many said they left fearing deportation due to increased immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump and believing Canada would automatically give them residence, only to experience a rude awakening upon arrival.

Men and women with furrowed brows sat in pews alongside their children at a Montreal church as volunteers explained what to expect now that they have crossed into Canada from the United States seeking asylum.

They would receive temporary housing stipends and access to medical care. Their kids could go to school. The volunteers handed out small maple-leaf flags.

“I like Canada very much,” 26-year-old Marline Dorisma of Haiti said later. “There are lots of opportunities here.” What they did not get were any assurances that they will be allowed to stay. In fact, many will eventually be told to go back home.

The migrants are part of a recent surge of people crossing over from the United States, including some 4,000 in just the last two weeks, that is straining Canada’s immigration system to the point where officials turned a domed stadium into a makeshift shelter.

Many said they left fearing deportation due to increased immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump and believing Canada would automatically give them residence, only to experience a rude awakening upon arrival.

It’s a widely held misbelief that Transport Minister Marc Garneau sought to dispel during a recent visit to the international border near Quebec, where migrants have been crossing over from northern New York.

“Unless you are being persecuted or fleeing terror or war, you would not qualify as a refugee,” Garneau said, “and it’s important to combat that misinformation that is out there.”

Like in the United States, rules in Canada allow for asylum for people who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland based on race, religion, political opinion, nationality or membership in a group like the LBGT community.

Last year Canada granted asylum to 63 per cent of applicants, for a total of nearly 16,000, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

People can also be accepted if Canada fears they face torture or cruel or unusual punishment if they are deported.

But those deemed to be economic migrants are given orders of deportation through a process that can range from several months to many years.

Last year Canada granted asylum to 63 per cent of applicants, for a total of nearly 16,000, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

For Haitians it was 52 per cent, said Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the representative in Canada for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That was similar to the acceptance rate for Haitians in the United States, about 48 per cent.

Officials, immigration lawyers and other experts say the false belief that Canada will accept all migrants is particularly common among Haitians.

“If these people were aware of the criteria that need to be met in order to be granted refugee status in Canada, and of the likelihood of being turned down and deported from Canada back to Haiti, it’s possible many of them would probably have decided not to have left the United States,” lawyer Stephane Handfield said.

Authorities say more than 80 per cent of the 4,000 who crossed into Quebec recently are from Haiti. The rest include people from India, Mexico, Colombia and Turkey, according to the provincial ministry of immigration.

The Trump administration is considering ending a program that granted temporary residency to about 58,000 people from Haiti following the Caribbean nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Canada ended a similar program in 2014.

“We’re being threatened so we have to leave the country, because we’re illegal,” said Dorisma. “I was told that Canada isn’t a country that deports people.”

At Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, recent arrivals are sleeping on some 900 cots in a concourse near a rear entrance. Officials say the shelter is operating at 70 to 90 per cent capacity at any given time and will be open until next month.

Migrants said they have been encouraged by the reception they have received so far in Canada, where there have been only minor anti-immigration demonstrations.

Inancieu Merilien, one of hundreds of Haitians at the arena, said he and others were “being taken care of very well” and “being here is like a dream come true.”

Joseph Jr Clormeus, a pastor of Haitian descent who has been helping migrants, said many still prefer Canada to what they faced south of the border.

In January, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted in response to a US ban on travelers from some Muslim-majority nations: “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength.”

But the reality is many will be in an uncomfortable limbo while awaiting a decision on their status. Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council of Refugees, said the lingering threat of deportation will make it difficult to build new lives and get good jobs.

“They can’t invest in integrating because they don’t know what the future holds,” Dench said. “So it’s an extremely stressful situation.”

Also, despite the access to taxpayer-funded medical care and education, the housing assistance doesn’t go far. Those subsidies range between about USD 560 per month for a single adult to USD 1,900 for a family of four, meaning multiple migrant families often must squeeze in under the same roof.

Joseph Jr Clormeus, a pastor of Haitian descent who has been helping migrants, said many still prefer Canada to what they faced south of the border.

“Most of them are disoriented, weak, and don’t know what the future will bring,” Clormeus said. “But they prefer the uncertainty of life in Canada (over) the certainty of being deported from the United States.”

Arsenal failings exposed in ‘Big Six’ matches,"Arsene Wenger’s side have not won at Anfield since 2012. (Source: Reuters) Arsene Wenger’s side have not won at Anfield since 2012. (Source: Reuters)

Arsenal head to Anfield on Sunday seeking to improve their poor recent record against other ‘Big Six’ teams amid growing uncertainty surrounding their most creative players, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Arsene Wenger’s side have not won at Anfield since 2012, since when they have played 50 matches against their major rivals, only winning 11, drawing 19 and losing 20. Away from home, they have just won two of 24 games at Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and United.

Anfield also was the scene for one of their greatest humiliations when a vibrant Liverpool side thrashed them 5-1 in 2014, ripping them apart with four goals in the first 20 minutes.

The contrast between their recent failures and that last victory in September 2012, when two of their summer signings, Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla, scored the goals, could not be more stark with Wenger again this week bemoaning the state of the transfer market as he seeks to add to his summer business.

Wenger needs to sell before he can buy long-term target Monaco winger Thomas Lemar and has described his 33-man squad as “unmanageable”. But, in a familiar refrain, he this week lamented the market difficulties experienced by English clubs.

“There is no transfer market anymore because the price depends only on the identity of the buyer and when you are English, you have straight away 50 per cent on the price of a player and that makes it difficult to act,” said Wenger.

His failure to offload any underperformers, given the disappointment of last season when Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League, has surprised respected Irish commentator Johnnie Giles, the former Leeds United midfielder.

“I’ve always been a great fan of Wenger and I think he has done a great job with Arsenal over the years – I think everybody agrees with that,” said Giles on Eamon Dunphy’s The Stand podcast.

“But when you have Ozil in the team, again, and Chamberlain in the team, again, Walcott still there, Xhaka — these are proven failures, and why they are there, I don’t know. I think it will be the end of Wenger. “I thought they would be out, start from scratch, good players in, or better than he has. These are proven failures and why he is sticking with them, I do not know.”

Not everyone agrees with that assessment, particularly of Oxlade-Chamberlain, who Wenger insists is not for sale despite interest from Chelsea and Liverpool.

With Sanchez also linked with a move to Manchester City, there could be several ins and outs ahead of next week’s transfer deadline.

Before then, Wenger will be desperate for some reward at Anfield, his favourite English stadium, on Sunday after last week’s defeat at Stoke City.

Laurent Koscielny is free to return after missing the first two games through suspension. His presence should bolster a defence that has conceded four goals in two games.

Sanchez is also expected to be in contention after missing the opening games with an abdominal strain.

Donald Trump to visit section of US-Mexican border wall in Arizona,"Donald Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first.

President Donald Trump will visit a section of a US-Mexican border fence in Arizona on Tuesday as he seeks congressional funding for the wall he wants built, administration officials said on Monday. Trump, who has struggled to persuade the Republican-led Congress to approve funding for a project many see as unnecessary, is to visit a border facility at Yuma, Arizona.

The border area at Yuma is considered a success story for the US Border Patrol because illegal crossings have slowed as a result of the border installation. During his visit, Trump will be briefed on Border Patrol efforts in the region and the need for more funding for immigration and border officials to carry out the Republican president’s desire for sharp limits on illegal immigration, the officials said.

The proposed border wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the United States, was one of Trump’s major 2016 campaign promises. His vow that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors.

Cabinet approves framework for merger of public sector banks: Arun Jaitley,"New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI Photo) New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI Photo)

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that the union cabinet has given approval to the framework for consolidation of public sector banks. The decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon after State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya called for more consolidation among the public sector banks, saying this could reduce their dependence on government for capital.

“The cabinet approved the constitution of an alternate mechanism that will oversee proposals with regard to consolidation of banks, which will come from the PSBs (public sector banks),” Jaitley said in press conference after the cabinet meeting.

“As of today, there are 20 PSBs plus the State Bank of India (SBI),” he said, adding that the SBI had recently concluded the merger with its associate banks and become a larger consolidated entity.

“If any other PSB board gives a consolidation proposal, to oversee that proposal an alternative mechanism will be in place to give in principle approval for the proposal of the banks for a scheme of amalgamation,” Jaitley said.

Explaining that such an alternative mechanism “enables quick facilitation of decisions”, Jaitley said the constitution of the committee would be made by the Prime Minister.

“The decision regarding creating strong and competitive banks will be solely based on commercial considerations,” he said. “Our experience of consolidation has been positive. It increases the entity’s commercial strength, the ability to absorb market shocks,” he added.

The cabinet approval comes in the face of banking operations across the country being hit on Tuesday as over 10 lakh bank employees in more than 1,30,000 branches pan-India struck work protesting against reforms in the banking sector, including proposals of merger of state-run banks.

"Aparna Yadav’s mother forged papers to allot plot to her husband, says Lucknow Development Authority","Aparna is a Samajwadi Party leader, married to party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger son Prateek. (File Photo) Aparna is a Samajwadi Party leader, married to party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger son Prateek. (File Photo)

The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has recommended action against three of its officials including deputy secretary Ambi Bisht after an inquiry found that she had allegedly allotted a 12,000 sq ft plot at a prime location in Lucknow to her husband Arvind Singh Bisht using forged documents. While Arvind Singh Bisht is serving as the state information commissioner, the couple’s daughter Aparna, is an Samajwadi Party leader, married to party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger son Prateek. LDA Joint Secretary Mahendra Kumar Mishra told The Indian Express that a complaint received last year had claimed that Ambi Bisht got a property — B-114 in TG-Chandganj housing scheme of LDA — allotted fraudulently in her husband’s name.

“Ambi Bisht prepared a duplicate file with forged papers showing that the plot was allotted to her husband Arvind Bisht,” said Mishra. When the registrar office was contacted, the LDA was informed that there were no records related to the property being registered in Bisht’s name, he added.

Mishra further said action has been recommended against Ambi Bisht, then project officer Seema Agrawal and section officer Devendra Lal. While the property is valued at “several crores”, Bisht had not paid any amount to LDA against it, he claimed, adding, “The nature of punishment will be decided by higher-ups.” Speaking to The Indian Express, Ambi Bisht denied the allegations and claimed that a “controversy was unnecessarily being created” to insult her for “political reasons”. “This is being done because I am a relative of Mulayam Singh Yadavji. This is an attempt to malign the image of both families,” she said.

She further claimed that the property belonged to the “Nazul trust”, and that her husband had leased for the past several years. “The lease was to be renewed in 2015. I was looking after the work of leased properties in 2015 as deputy secretary. I signed the file regarding renewal of lease in the name of my husband and forwarded that to the secretary and vice-chairman. Both approved renewal. The lease amount was also paid,” she added. She further claimed that later in 2015, she had sent an application to the CM’s office requesting for the plot to be made a freehold property.

“My family visited the land site and found illegal possession there. Then, we decided not to take the property and I sent an application to LDA vice-chairman requesting to cancel the lease. But I came to know that the lease was not cancelled when LDA sent me a letter in which the status of the action on my application regarding free hold of property was inquired. I surrendered the lease deed of the property to LDA in May this year. The property and its papers are in possession of LDA now and my family has no association with that land,” she added.

Ambi Bisht also alleged that after change of government in the state, several works had been taken back from her and she was presently being given work of the LDA’s public information officer.

"‘Demonetisation benefits to be felt in long term’, says former RBI governor D Subbarao","In the last eight months, the costs of demonetisation had been paid, he said. “Thousands of jobs were lost, patients could not receive treatment, people had to stand in long lines. There had been a lot of pain,” Subbarao said. In the last eight months, the costs of demonetisation had been paid, he said. “Thousands of jobs were lost, patients could not receive treatment, people had to stand in long lines. There had been a lot of pain,” Subbarao said.

The cost of demonetisation has been paid in last eight months but benefits will be felt over the long term, former RBI governor D Subbarao said today. “Everybody agrees upon the costs of demonetisation. These were for the short term, while the benefits will be felt in the long term”, Subbarao said at the second foundation anniversary of Bandhan Bank.

In the last eight months, the costs of demonetisation had been paid, he said. “Thousands of jobs were lost, patients could not receive treatment, people had to stand in long lines. There had been a lot of pain,” Subbarao said.

All these could not be quantified though, he said adding that it was seen that the fourth quarter of the last fiscal’s GDP had suffered a substantial blow. “The benefits depends on the objectives. The objectives must have been choking black money generation, digitisation drive and dismantle counterfeiting of money,” he said.

However, the drive towards digitalisation does not necessarily require demonetisation and can be done without it, he said. The benefits would also accrue from the rise of the share of Income Tax in the GDP, he said.

"Commuter train crashes into parked train, injuring dozens","In this frame from video, a person is pulled away from the scene of a train crash in Upper Darby, Philadelphia. (Source: AP) In this frame from video, a person is pulled away from the scene of a train crash in Upper Darby, Philadelphia. (Source: AP)

A one-car commuter train crashed into a parked train at a suburban Philadelphia terminal early Tuesday, buckling the floors of both cars and injuring more than 30 passengers, authorities said.

None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, said Heather Redfern, a spokeswoman for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.“Some were considered walking wounded,” she said.

The train operator, who was treated at a hospital and released midday, submitted samples for drug and alcohol tests, said Ruben Payan, lead investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. He said the NTSB also had asked to interview the operator Wednesday, along with the operator of a train on adjacent tracks and transit supervisors.

The Norristown High Speed train crashed into the unoccupied train car at the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby around 12:15 a.m., tossing passengers from their seats.“I heard the train going real fast … like, super-fast,” passenger Raymond Woodard told WPVI-TV Woodard. “And I looked up, and I saw that we’re at 69th Street and said, `Why are we going so fast?’ And then we just hit the train. Boom! I fell out of my chair, glass from the window shattered, I hit my head. Everybody was on the floor.”

Neither train car derailed, and Payan said damage overall did not appear to be major. But he said investigators wouldn’t know for sure until the two cars could be inspected in a shop.

He said it could take up to a year to produce a final report on the cause and safety recommendations.“We haven’t ruled anything out right now,” Payan said, adding that video recovered from both cars will be reviewed.

The transit agency had put the number of injured at 42. But the NTSB said the total number of injured was 33 _ 32 passengers and the train operator. In February, four people were injured in a crash near the 69th Street Terminal involving three out-of-service commuter trains. At the time, SEPTA said one train rear-ended another on a loop where trains turn around to get back into service. Cars from that accident derailed and hit a third train on nearby tracks.

DLF board meet on Aug 25 to decide on Rs 13K cr GIC deal,"If the board approves this deal, this would be second investment from GIC into DLF group. In September 2015, GIC had invested about Rs 2,000 crore in DLF’s two housing projects in the national capital.

India’s largest realty firm DLF will hold a board meeting on Friday to decide on promoters’ proposed sale of 40 per cent stake in rental arm to investment firm GIC in a deal estimated at around Rs 13,000 crore.

DLF had announced in October 2015 that promoters would sell their entire stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd (DCCDL) that holds the bulk of commercial assets of the group.

The company had in March this year entered into an exclusivity pact with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC to negotiate on this transaction.

The promoters holds Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) in DCCDL, which is worth 40 per cent stake in the rental arm. DLF owns the rest 60 per cent in DCCDL.

In a regulatory filing, DLF said that a meeting of the audit committee will be held on August 25 to “consider and review the status of the proposed sale of CCPS held by CCPS holders to a GIC affiliate including the key terms and conditions and make appropriate recommendations to the board”.

“The board will in its meeting scheduled to be held later on August 25, 2017, consider the said recommendations and take appropriate decisions, as required,” it added.

If the board approves this deal, this would be second investment from GIC into DLF group. In September 2015, GIC had invested about Rs 2,000 crore in DLF’s two housing projects in the national capital.

Last week, sources had said that both the parties — DLF promoters and GIC — could sign definitive agreement by end of this month and pegged the deal value at around Rs 12,000-13,000 crore.

The promoters — K P Singh and family — would infuse a large portion of proceeds from this proposed deal into DLF, which in turn would use this amount to cut its net debt that has reached nearly Rs 26,000 crore.

In a latest analyst presentation, DLF had said that “the company and investor are in the final stages of discussion on the documentation. The transaction shall be put up to Audit Committee/Board for final approval”.

Last week, DLF’s Senior Executive Director (Finance) Saurabh Chawla had also said the proposed transactions is at the “fag end of the process”.

After the agreement between the two parties, he had said GIC would approach the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for approval, while DLF will have to seek shareholders’ nod. Chawla expected the CCI approval by early November.

DLF is expected to achieve a rental income of over Rs 3,000 crore in the current fiscal, of which about Rs 2,600 crore pertains to the DCCDL.

The proposed deal would help DLF in making its housing business debt free.

In view of sluggish housing sales, the company is having a deficit cash flow of about Rs 750 crore per quarter.

DLF is having an unsold inventory of about Rs 15,000 crore and is waiting for market revival to clear the stocks.

Earlier this month, DLF reported a 58 per cent fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 109.01 crore for the quarter ended June against Rs 261.85 crore in the year-ago period.

Total income rose by 9 per cent to Rs 2,211.24 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal from Rs 2,025.58 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

"I was pretty confident that I would be chosen for Arjuna award this time, says Harinder Pal Sandhu","Harinder Pal Sandhu led India to their maiden squash gold medal at the Asian Games. (Source: File) Harinder Pal Sandhu led India to their maiden squash gold medal at the Asian Games. (Source: File)

Harinder Pal Sandhu, India’s top squash player has not been considered by the Arjuna awards selection panel for the third time. He has won a gold medal at the 2014 Asian Games. The Sports Ministry announced the final list on Saturday as Sandhu will be applying for the honour next year.

“I was pretty confident that I would be chosen for the honour this time. It is deeply disappointing when you are not picked despite being a deserving candidate,” Sandhu spoke to PTI from Chennai.

Sandhu led India to their maiden squash gold medal at the Asian Games, when he and Saurav Ghosal defeated Malaysia in the final in Incheon. He has also won nine titles on the PSA pro tour.

Ghosal, being the topmost squash player in the country for a long time, has also backed Sandhu as he said that more than Anaka Alankamony, Sandhu deserves the award. Alankamony received the award in a controversial manner in 2014.

“If benchmarks used for Harry (Sandhu) and Anaka were the same, then Harry should have got the award ahead of her. There is no doubt about that. Harry has also won a national title while Anaka never won one,” said Ghosal.

Ghosal, Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa have already recieved Arjuna Award. Sandhu will have to show an impressive performance at the Asian or Commonwealth level to clinch an individual medal, which would increase his chances for Arjuna.

Sandhu is still confident about making it to the list for Arjuna next year, “We have the Asian and Commonwealth Games next year and will try to win a medal in both the events. I am sure, after I win medals there, it will become more difficult for the committee to ignore me,” said the world number 65.

Sandhu will be featuring at the 74th senior national championship, which is to be held from next week in Greater Noida.

Akansh Sen Murder case: Defence seeks reports before framing of charges,"The matter is now slated to come up for hearing on September 1. (File) The matter is now slated to come up for hearing on September 1. (File)

Lawyers of Harmehtab Singh alias Farid, an accused in the high profile BMW hit-and-run murder case of Akansh Sen, has moved an application seeking CFSL reports before framing of charges against Harmehtab. The matter is now slated to come up for hearing on September 1. On Tuesday, the charges were expected to be framed in the court of Additional Sessions Judge JS Sidhu, but the defence counsel moved an application for getting the reports pertaining to the investigation.

In his application, advocate AS Sukhija demanded the report of BMW car (CH01 AP 1133) which was taken into possession by the Chandigarh Police from Gobindgarh. The samples of blood were then taken from the car and the same was sent for examination to CFSL. Sukhija also sought the viscera report of the deceased Akansh Sen and the report of blood stained clothes of deceased Akansh Sen, and Karanyog, Rajan, who took him to hospital after the incident. The report of the car (PB 05 W 004) in which the deceased was taken to hospital has also been sought.

Akansh Sen was allegedly hit by a BMW car early in the morning on February 9. He succumbed to injuries in PGIMER the next day. Sen was a relative of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh.

Here’s why your adolescent kid is at high obesity risk,"Stopping children from eating high calorie food may not prevent obesity. (Source: Thinkstockphotos) Stopping children from eating high calorie food may not prevent obesity. (Source: Thinkstockphotos)

Don’t blame your adolescent kid for eating high calorie food — he or she may not be able to control the urge for burgers, pizzas and french fries due to an impairment in a brain region linked to self-regulation, says a study.

The findings have revealed that adolescents, who are at an increased risk of obesity, have progressively less neural activity in circuits of the brain that support self-regulation and attention.

“The study establishes that risk for obesity isn’t driven exclusively by the absence or presence of urges to eat high-calorie foods, but also, and perhaps most importantly, by the ability to control those urges,” said Bradley Peterson, Professor at the University of Southern California.

For the study, reported in the journal NeuroImage, the team used fMRI to observe relationship between neurological activity and risk for obesity in overweight compared with lean adolescents.

In adolescents who were obese or who were lean but at high familial risk for obesity, they observed less activation in attention and self-regulation circuits. Brain circuits that support attention and self-regulation showed the greatest activation in lean/low-risk adolescents, less activity in lean/high-risk participants and least activation in the overweight/obese group.

Brice Leverdez: Journeyman who played match of his life,"Brice Leverdez is not part of the national team coached by Danish legend Peter Gade, and has stuck by his personal coach of his teenaged years.(Source: Reuters) Brice Leverdez is not part of the national team coached by Danish legend Peter Gade, and has stuck by his personal coach of his teenaged years.(Source: Reuters)

As ‘Boleh Boleh Lee Chong Wei’ (Lee Chong Wei, You can) rose in crescendo, a group of French fans sitting alongside raised their clapper decibel. Brice Leverdez was playing the match of his life.

Badminton is next to nothing in France – easily overshadowed by tennis. But Leverdez had picked it as a 12-year-old on holiday – a few days after he didn’t know it even existed. He wasn’t too shabby at it and got picked for the regional centre and national team in quick time. By 18, Sydney Olympian Bertrand Gallet had decided to coach the bright kid though results took a dozen years to fetch up.

On Tuesday, when Leverdez beat Chong Wei in a thriller at the Emirates Arena, he had gone into the match sticking to a carefully discussed strategy. When the second game went into extra points after Chong Wei’s shot hit the line, the Frenchman’s coach following it online read the confused scoreline 21-19, 22-20 before the TV review reversed the line judge’s call, and messaged his congratulations. He would later send a follow-up: “You should’ve won 21-15, 21-15, you as@#$%^”

Leverdez is not part of the national team coached by Danish legend Peter Gade, and has stuck by his personal coach of his teenaged years who’s not allowed to travel with the national team. “Peter doesn’t know me yet, but we’ll figure out how to work in the future. I’m used to travelling alone. I’m old enough to travel alone,” he would say later.

Leverdez has been seeking the elusive calm needed to win matches all these years. “I want to go on court and enjoy, and I’ve been looking for that state of mind where I’m relaxed for years,” he said.

The 31-year-old Frenchman had beaten Chong Wei in a freak result in Denmark last year. “I knew that he knows that I play well against him. Tactically, I knew what to do. It was kind of crazy match. If I think of it, I’d probably say I was lucky or something,” he’d chuckle.

At the end of Game 2, he knew he was up for a long match. “I knew when the shuttle fell that it was in, and I looked at the clock and said ‘Damn, 53 minutes’. The third game was won mostly mentally, because I felt my legs tire after the second.”

Rallying is not his style of play, and he’s honest about how lucky he was with some net shots, though he underplayed the pressure he exerted on the Malaysian legend, cheered on by a stadium that came alive sensing an upset, and the two sets of vocal fans.

Leverdez owns a clothing line — “Currently my badminton does better than my business!” — and the Frenchman is keen to devote more time to the game after this win. “I need to give 40 per cent time to my business to earn money. I want to go further in the tournament, not just win first round,” he would add.

The Frenchman has no pretensions to being an exceptional player. “When you beat Chong Wei, you think you’ve opened up the draw. But nothing opens up. Knowing me, I can lose to anyone, and win against anyone.”

Preferring the larger halls in Glasgow and London to the dimly lit cauldrons of Asia, Leverdez said it’s a practical preference. “I can see properly in bigger well-lit halls to make my attack pinpointed, precise.”

On Tuesday, he saw mighty well, and might just have ensured Lee Chong Wei calls it Lights Out.

Wayne Rooney joins the 200 club and shows he isn’t done yet,"Wayne Rooney gave another display of clever passing and positioning as well as his trademark finishing.

Wayne Rooney scored his 200th Premier League goal in Everton’s 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Monday and gave another display which showed his career is far from over.

Rooney’s 35th minute goal looked to have earned Everton a surprise victory at the Etihad Stadium before substitute Raheem Sterling volleyed in an 82nd minute equaliser.

Although he did not end as the match-winning hero, Rooney was able to savour the moment he became just the second player to reach 200 Premier League goals.

Former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer, who ended his career with 260 goals, welcomed Rooney to the exclusive club by tweeting: “It’s been lonely in this @premierleague 200 club. Welcome and congratulations @WayneRooney”.

“It was nice. To do it today in such an important game for us, with tough games coming up, it was a sweet moment and I am sure the red half of Manchester will have enjoyed it as well,” said Rooney who scored 183 of his goals in the red shirt of United.

Rooney’s move last month back to the club he has supported since his youth and where he made his professional debut, was questioned by some critics who wondered whether he might have run out of steam.

But the 31-year-old, who scored on his home debut against Stoke City last week, gave another display of clever passing and positioning as well as his trademark finishing.

“It is not bad for someone who is not fit anymore and can’t get about the pitch! I have always put a shift in for the team and tonight is no different,” he said.

“The manager has made it clear he wants to play me in the attacking positions. I have done that throughout my career and the thing for me is to play. I didn’t play as much last year and if you don’t play you don’t get that match fitness,” he said.

Rooney’s revival in blue has raised the issue of whether he could earn a recall to Gareth Southgate’s England squad ahead of next month’s internationals.

“I am focusing on Everton. I am sure I will speak to Gareth Southgate over the next few days and we will see what happens,” said the forward.

"Red ball or pink, West Indies plumb to new depths","West Indies are yet to win a Test match in England since 2000. (Source: Reuters) West Indies are yet to win a Test match in England since 2000. (Source: Reuters)

It was an all too familiar story that played out at Edgbaston in the first ever day/night Test in England. West Indies lost 19 wickets in a day to lose by an innings, batting for a combined duration of six and a half hours. But the most damning fact is that this sort of capitulation was not entirely unexpected. The West Indies have been lurching from one disaster to the next for a long time. They drew with England in their last series, in the Caribbean in April-May 2015, but it has been mostly downhill ever since.

Diminishing returns

West Indies have won just two Tests in their last 18, losing 13 of those games. Clearly, while they are not winning, they don’t even seem to have the ability to hold on for a draw. Recently, their No.11 batsman Shannon Gabriel got out playing a big shot when only one over remained to be negotiated to ensure a drawn series against Pakistan.

Minus 200

In eight of their Tests over this period, the West Indies have conceded a lead of over 200 on first innings, showing the gulf of class between them and most of the other teams. They have managed to be in front on first innings in only one match out of their last 18.

Too few 5-wicket hauls

Bowlers win matches. The likes of Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo, Jason Holder and Miguel Cummins have impressed with the ball off and on, but they have not done it consistently enough or as a unit to have the desired impact. The West Indians have had 9 five-wicket hauls in the last 18 Tests, but they have translated into only two victories. Opposition bowlers have had 14 of them in the same period.

Centurions of wrong kind

Test cricket is a battle of attrition, with quality batsmen forcing opposition bowlers to a hard graft, forcing them to bowl a lot of overs and conceding a lot of runs. West Indies bowlers have conceded over a 100 runs in an innings as many as 20 times in the last 18 Tests, while their own batsmen have forced opposition bowlers to do so on just six occasions.

Different fortunes in T20

While their Test team flounders, the West Indies are an irresistible force in Twenty20 cricket. They have won two of the last three World Cups in the shortest format, in which their most famous stars join hands. They have a successful Caribbean Premier League which attracts a lot of spectators while the Test team plays in front of sparse crowds as nobody wants to pay to see their team lurch from one seemingly inevitable defeat to another.

Speaking of disaster

“This lot are the worst Test team I have seen in more than 50 years of watching, playing and commentating on cricket. They can’t bat, can’t bowl. I take no pleasure out of saying this as I played against some of the greatest players the world has ever seen wearing the maroon cap of the West Indies.”

– Geoffrey Boycott

“I talked with Sir Viv Richards and Sir Andy Roberts before and during the Test about how we used to dominate world cricket, about pride and passion. That’s what’s lacking. People feel sad for us and that’s just not right.”

– Curtly Ambrose

6 – Number of centuries West Indian batsmen have scored since their home series against England more than two years ago. Of these three have been by Roston Chase. In stark contrast, opposition batsmen have feasted on their mediocre bowling, helping themselves to 22 hundreds in the last 18 Tests.

It can be pretty tough sitting on the sidelines: Usman Khawaja,"Usman Khawaja is a part of the Australian team which is set to play a two-Test series against Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Usman Khawaja is a part of the Australian team which is set to play a two-Test series against Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Australian batsman Usman Khawaja has revealed that he sometimes finds it frustrating to remain on the sidelines. After being dropped for the India tour, he now finds himself in the reckoning in the Bangladesh series and knows how important it is.

Speaking to News Corp, he said, “Proving myself is the furthest thing from my mind. I’m not going to make it all about me and I never like playing cricket that way. It should feel like a long time between matches, but it actually doesn’t. I don’t know why.”

“It can be pretty tough sitting on the sidelines. I’m glad it’s happened now and didn’t happen about eight years ago. It was frustrating at the end of India because I was there for so long. But by the time I came home it was just nice to be home, sleeping in my own bed and training back in Brisbane,” he added.

“It’s frustrating but it’s hard because I haven’t really got to play on (spinning wickets) much and even training in the nets you can only do so much,” Khawaja said and added, “At the end of the day it’s not easy for any Australian going over there because it’s very uncommon for us to play in those conditions.

“You see the guys who have been there a lot like Smudger (Smith) who obviously does very well there. The more you play on them the better you get., he further added.

It may be recalled here that Khwaja had earlier spoken about how he wanted to test his skills in the middle and said (in an interview with cricket.com.au), “You can work on specific areas, which I did when I was over there as I always do, but at the end of the day you’ve got to be playing cricket games to test yourself and put yourself under a bit of pressure”.

The two-day fixture was scheduled to start from Tuesday but heavy rain partially flooded part of the ground. The hosts offered other venues but the Australians didn’t want to change due to security concerns.

“The BCB has been fantastic trying to get us the game. The amount of rain hasn’t helped,” Australia coach Darren Lehman told reporters in Dhaka.

“We looked at various facilities around Dhaka. We feel for the people of Bangladesh with the amount of rain they have had. There are a lot of people in this country struggling because of the rain. So the thoughts are with them.”

Bangladesh’s disaster agency claimed 115 people have died after heavy showers hit the area last week, leaving one-third of the country flooded. This is Australia’s first tour of Bangladesh since 2006 and now focus shifts on the series opener which begins next Sunday at Dhaka’s Sher-e Bangla National Stadium.

Australia were scheduled to tour in 2015 but it was cancelled at the last moment due to security fears after attacks in the country. The 2017 tour went ahead only after the hosts’ board promised beefed-up security.

"‘Poets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion’: Kiriti Sengupta","“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta.

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this — the state of a poet’s being — the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem’s purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem’s composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

“I think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,” Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no “great intention” when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of “changing the society” through his poems. “Poetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,” he added.

Sengupta’s “My Glass of Wine” is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India’s first poetry trilogy, “Dreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral”, which also bears two other works, “The Reverse Tree” and “Healing Waters Floating Lamps”. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,” quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer’s bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

“I’ve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don’t find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets’ work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,” he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible “to earn a living from writing poetry” in India. “Poets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,” said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled “Solitary Stillness” and is due to be published in August.

On Love and Desire,"Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‘The Lovers ‘ in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha) Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‘The Lovers ‘ in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha)

Amitava Kumar’s new novel maps the journey of a young man, Kailash, in “Reagan’s America” as he searches for love and meaning in life. Woven within the fabric of a larger political narrative, Kumar calls The Lovers (Aleph Book Company, Rs 599), an “in-between novel” — somewhere between fiction and non-fiction. “It speaks about the current situation, in the sense that it gives immigrants a voice. Not just a voice but a voice on their own terms. My narrator doesn’t simply declare his right to live there, he wants the right to love too,” says Kumar, who recently launched the book in Delhi.

In The Lovers, Kumar says, he has written about love and desire like never before. “I am getting old and I thought the body forgets. Through this book, I wanted to remember who I was. When I went to the US, I always thought that I would come back soon, but time kept passing. So I also thought that I must write about my life in the US, the 30 years that I have been there,” says Kumar, whose previous books include Home Products (2010) and non-fiction works such as Husband of a Fanatic (2004) and Passport Photos (2000), among others.

In the novel, Kailash’s professor and mentor, Ehsaan Ali, plays a pivotal role. Ali’s character was inspired by political scientist and anti-war activist Eqbal Ahmad, who was born in Bihar and moved to Pakistan after Partition. Ahmad studied in the US and ended up teaching there. “I never met him, but he has been an inspiring figure for me, not only because he was born in Bihar but because he embodied a radical cosmopolitanism,” says the Arrah-born author.

In the US and the UK, the book has been published with a different title — Immigrant, Montana. “I think it was David Davidar who chose this title (The Lovers). I like it because my narrator says he tore out a page from a magazine in the library that had Picasso’s The Lovers printed on it. This was the painting that Picasso did after first making love,” says Kumar, 54, who is currently the Helen D. Lockwood Professor of English at Vassar College in New York’s Poughkeepsie.

As a graduate student in the US in the late 1980s, Kumar maintained a journal that has served as inspiration for the novel. “I saved many letters from that time, some of them were written by women, which I was surprised to discover. It also includes some letters by my mother. But reading those letters was depressing — the past coming back at you like that. So I left those. Instead, I used to read the book My Mistress’s Sparrow is Dead, a collection of short stories. I read one story each day and wrote the next day. In other words, I used literature to call back some memories and also imagine other things,” he says.

Taliban suicide bomber kills five civilians in Afghanistan,"The attack occurred a little over 24 hours after Trump cleared the way for thousands more US soldiers to be sent to Afghanistan, reversing earlier pledges to pull out. The attack occurred a little over 24 hours after Trump cleared the way for thousands more US soldiers to be sent to Afghanistan, reversing earlier pledges to pull out.

A Taliban suicide bomber killed five civilians and wounded dozens of others, mainly children, when he detonated a car filled with explosives at a police headquarters in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday.

It was the insurgents’ first major attack since US President Donald Trump announced in Washington late Monday that he was committing American troops to the war-torn country indefinitely. “A suicide bomber detonated an explosive-filled car in a parking lot near the main police headquarters in Lashkar Gah,” Omar Zhwak, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand province, told AFP.

“Our initial information shows that five civilians were killed and 25 were wounded, including women and children,” he added.

The car park was full of people queueing to get into the police headquarters when the explosion happened, said Zhwak.

He added that a nearby mosque, which was being used as a madrassa or Islamic religious school, had been been damaged. Children were studying there at the time. “We have received 38 wounded — mostly schoolchildren –and five dead, including two women and two soldiers,” Mauladad Tabihdad, director of hospitals in Helmand, told AFP.

The attack occurred a little over 24 hours after Trump cleared the way for thousands more US soldiers to be sent to Afghanistan, reversing earlier pledges to pull out.

The Taliban had called for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and following Trump’s announcement vowed to make the war-weary country a “graveyard” for US forces.

The Taliban quickly claimed today’s attack in a text message sent to journalists. “We targeted army tanks, killing dozens,” it read.

Ordinary Afghans have paid a heavy price for the 16-year US-led war.

Civilian deaths are at their worst since records began in 2009. In the first half of the year, 1,662 civilians were killed and more than 3,500 injured, according to the United Nations.

The attack was also the latest blow to Afghanistan’s beleaguered security forces. “The car bomb targeted a number of army vehicles parked in the parking lot. We have reports of some casualties to army soldiers,” Salam Afghan, a police spokesman, told AFP.

The resurgent Taliban have been ramping up their campaign against government forces, underscoring rising insecurity in Afghanistan during the summer fighting season when the warmer weather tends to spur an increase in attacks.

Afghan police and troops — beset by a high death toll, desertions and non-existent “ghost soldiers” on the payroll –have been struggling to beat back the insurgents since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.

Casualties among Afghan security forces soared by 35 percent in 2016, with 6,800 soldiers and police killed, according to US watchdog SIGAR.

More than 2,500 Afghan police and troops were killed from January 1 to May 8.

Karun Nair anchors India A to six-wicket win over South Africa A,"Karun Nair scored 90 against South Africa A. (Source: PTI) Karun Nair scored 90 against South Africa A. (Source: PTI)

India A skipper Karun Nair led his side to a six-wicket win over South Africa A to level the two-matches series 1-1. Nair scored 90 runs as India A chased down a target of 224 runs at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom on the last day of the second unofficial four-day match.

Chasing the target, India lost Sudip Chatterjee for 18 after he was bowled by Dane Piedt. Shreyas Iyer too went back without making a substantial contribution as he was out caught and bowled by Shaun von Berg for 15.

After being reduced to 55/2, opener Ravikumar Samarth and skipper Nair stitched a partnership of 74 runs for the third wicket. Samarth continued his good form to score another half-century in the match. The right-hander was eventually undone by Piedt for 55.

Nair on the other side continued with his batting display and scored 93 runs for the fourth wicket with Ankit Bawne.

He was eventually out for 90 by Andile Phehlukwayo while Bawne remained unbeaten for 32. Hanuman Vihari, who replaced the captain in the middle, scored the winning runs after hitting a boundary off the only delivery he faced.

For South Africa it was Piedt who picked up two wickets while von Berg and Phehlukwayo scalped a wicket apiece. Earlier, in the second innings, India A rode on three-fors from Ankit Rajpoot and Shahbaz Nadeem to bundle out South Africa A for 177. Krishnappa Gowtham also chipped in with a couple of wickets.

India A scored 276 runs in first innings in reply to South Africa A’s 322. Stephen Cook scored 98 while Aiden Markram notched up 74 in first innings.

Ex-shareholders of EOL to get Rs 880 crore more from Essar,"“Essar Oil public shareholders to receive an additional Rs 880 crore or Rs 75.48 per share over delisting price taking the total payout to Rs 3,944 crore from Rs 3,064 crore,” the group said in a statement. “Essar Oil public shareholders to receive an additional Rs 880 crore or Rs 75.48 per share over delisting price taking the total payout to Rs 3,944 crore from Rs 3,064 crore,” the group said in a statement.

The Essar group will pay an additional Rs 75.48 per share to Essar Oil’s ex-shareholders, who tendered their shares at the open offer in the run-up to the delisting of the company that was sold to the Russian major Rosneft for $12.9 billion on Monday. Public shareholders of Essar Oil will get a total amount of Rs 880 crore from the company.

The issue of additional payout to the ex-minority shareholders followed criticism that the promoters enriched themselves too much with the delisting. This prompted Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to intervene and ask the promoters to pay back the margin between the delisting price and final transaction price between the Ruias and Rosneft and a consortium led by the Dutch commodity trader Trafigura and the Russian investment bank UCP. “This is the first instance where public shareholders are being rewarded even after tendering their shares in a delisting process,” the company said.

EOL was valued at Rs 2,000 crore when it was listed in 1995, and has now been valued at about Rs 50,400 crore, a growth of 2,420 per cent when it was taken private again. “Essar Oil public shareholders to receive an additional Rs 880 crore or Rs 75.48 per share over delisting price taking the total payout to Rs 3,944 crore from Rs 3,064 crore,” the group said in a statement.

The decision follows its public announcement and is also pursuant of the Sebi’s direction. Former minority shareholders, who had tendered EOL shares in the delisting Offer of February 2015, will receive the differential amount of Rs 75.48 for every share tendered. This is the additional payout over and above the price of Rs 262.80 per share paid to shareholders at the time of delisting on the basis of equity price per share of Rs 338.28 received by Essar upon completion of the deal, the company said.

The Essar group had concluded sale of its crown jewel Essar Oil and the adjacent to captive 58 million tonne oil terminal, a 1,010-mw power plant and over 3,500 fuel outlets to the Russian government-controlled Rosneft for an enterprise valuation of $12.9 billion. The deal is the largest foreign direct investment into the country as also the largest out of Russia till date.

Essar Energy Holdings

director Dhanpat Nahata said, “the additional payment to minority shareholders is unprecedented as they got exit and liquidity upon delisting in December 2015, retained the upside from the transaction that has closed 20 months later, without carrying any downside risk.” The promoters will shortly issue a public notice in this regard and as committed in the delisting offer of December 2015, the additional payout will be made within two months thereafter.

"Wary AIMPLB ponders what next, meet to decide on review petition","Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court’s verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal) Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court’s verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal)

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has called an executive meeting on September 10 to discuss the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq and whether the board should move a review petition. While seeking to portray the verdict as a victory for personal laws based on religion, board members appeared uncertain about the import of the verdict, including the fate of Muslim divorces.

General secretary Maulana Wali Rehmani said that for the next six months, until the government brings a law as directed by the Supreme Court, there would not be any Muslim divorces. On the other hand, member Kamal Farooqui, who is also a lawyer, said the judgment pertains to instantaneous triple talaq and hence talaq over the prescribed period of 90 days would continue as usual. “It is a big victory for us. The Supreme Court verdict means personal laws in this country are protected,” Farooqui said.

“As per the judgment triple talaq is banned for six months,” Rehmani told The Indian Express. “But the other part of the judgment that is crucial is that the court has ruled that it has nothing to do with Muslim personal laws… I cannot comment whether the government should bring a law unless I see what that law is.”

Farooqui maintained the judgment does not restrain willing Muslim couples from divorcing. “What the court has said on triple talaq is not really different from what we have been saying all along. We have been saying it should be discouraged, eradicated,” said Farooqui. “But there are different schools of thought in the country and not everybody would agree with the doing away with the practice…”

In Lucknow, AIMPLB member Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali said: “The court has put a ban on the practice for six months but what will happen if one couple decides to separate through triple talaq in this period? What will happen if a person marries someone else after triple talaq? There are several questions.”

AIMPLB lawyer Kapil Sibal called it a “marvellous judgment” that “protects the personal laws of every religious community”. “.. As far as this practice is concerned, only this practice, of triple talaq administered in one sitting, is bad for two different reasons. Two judges say it is bad because it is violative of Article 14 and one judge says it is bad because it is not accepted by the Quran,” Sibal told reporters. He noted it is a minority judgment that has asked that the government pass legislation. “There is no need to bring a law,” he said. “How this will translate on the ground is a different matter.” Minorities Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi sidestepped the question of legislation.

“India has had major social reforms periodically, we abolished Sati, outlawed child marriages. Triple talaq is inhuman, unconstitutional, a social evil. But not everything is the remit of the government, society has to come forward to create awareness. We will do everything that is required to uphold the Constitution and the dignity of Muslim women,” Naqvi said.

Other Muslim groups

From the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, which has been a party to the case from the beginning, working committee member Niaz Farooqui said: “We are studying the judgment, there is a meeting to discuss it. We can comment on it only after that.” Shaista Amber of All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board, who had been opposing triple talaq, called the verdict “historic”. Maulana Yasoob Abbas of Shia Personal Law Board said they have been fighting against “instant triple talaq” and the SC verdict will lead to its end.

Air Marshal delivers lecture on 1971 air war over Bangladesh,"The theme of his talk was Air War over Bangladesh, 1971, and his role as the commanding officer of a Gnat fighter squadron. (Express Archives) The theme of his talk was Air War over Bangladesh, 1971, and his role as the commanding officer of a Gnat fighter squadron. (Express Archives)

Delivering a lecture on the 1971 air war over Bangladesh between India and Pakistan, former commanding-in-chief, Western Air Command, Air Marshal MM Singh, said that the Indian Air Force(IAF) will never enjoy such superiority over its adversaries in the future wars.

He said any lessons learned in the air war to liberate East Pakistan were not really relevant for the future and were mainly of academic and historical interest. He said this while addressing a gathering during the 4th Maj Gen KS Bajwa Memorial – Regiment of Artillery War Experience Talk under the auspices of the Centre for Indian Military History. The theme of his talk was Air War over Bangladesh, 1971, and his role as the commanding officer of a Gnat fighter squadron.

Speaking on the order of battle of the respective air forces in the East, he stated that the Indians had a qualitative edge and considerable numerical superiority over Pakistan, which they used to good effect. He then gave a detailed description of the aircraft fielded by both sides with the help of slides including the weapons payload which they were capable of carrying. He also disclosed how a planning team of the IAF visited various unused airstrips as well as civil airports in the East and North-East to discover how best they could be activated for the upcoming war.

“It was not just a fighter and bomber aircraft war. Helicopters and transports played a vital role. The lifting of a brigade by a helicopter over Meghna to strike at the enemy’s core defence area was the turning point of the war,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, Mandeep Singh Bajwa, Chairman of the Centre for Indian Military History, informed that the organisation will jointly organise a seminar to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nathu La-Cho La clashes between the Indian Army and Chinese PLA.

He also said that Centre has been selected to be part of an annual exchange programme on military history talks between the United Service Institution, this country’s leading military think tank and the United Kingdom. Under this project, next month, Major Tony McClenaghan, the world’s leading expert on the Indian States Forces will address a talk in Chandigarh, the title of which will be ‘The Contribution of the Maharajas to the First World War’.

Boulders hit coaches of Hubballi-LTT Express: CRS to probe incident,"Representational Image Representational Image

THE COMMISSIONER of Railway Safety (CRS) will probe the incident of boulders falling on a coach of the Hubballi-LTT Express on Monday in which three passengers were injured. The inquiry, scheduled on Wednesday, will analyse whether required preventive measures and remedial actions had been taken by the railways.

On Monday, three passengers were injured after boulders fell on the roof of S 6 coach of 17317 Hubballi-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Express between Monkey Hill and Thakurwadi stations on the Central Railway (CR). A CRS inquiry is initiated if an accident on the premise of the railways is of serious nature. The Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) was present at the accident site on Tuesday, along with the CRS, who will present his views on the matter in a hearing scheduled on Wednesday.

“It will be a day-long hearing. We will also present our views to the CRS on the immediate medical aid that was offered to the passengers after the incident. Quick action was taken by officials of all ranks to prevent any major mishap,” a senior CR official said.

In July, passengers travelling on the Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)-Hyderabad Express had a narrow escape when the train’s engine jumped tracks after being hit by a boulder at Monkey Hill. “Officials face a tough time climbing the 20-30 km stretch of the ghats in that section. Before the monsoons, we take precaution and remove loose boulders, which can fall on the railway tracks, from the section. But there is no guarantee about which boulder could go loose due to rains. The particular section where the past accidents have taken place is more vulnerable,” the official added.

Sources said many senior railway officials were questioned by the General Manager of the CR over why they reached late at the accident spot. “ A serious error on part of the operations team was that the train was run all the way till LTT in spite of the fact that part of a rock was stuck inside the coach. After a coach of a train gets damaged, it is required that the same is detached or at least not declared road-worthy till an inspection. A gross negligence was witnessed,” an official added.

Officials said corrective measures like putting up lights in the area have been put in place assist trackmen at night. “We are aiming at placing CCTV cameras around the section so that the station master at Thakurwadi can gauge the movement of boulders and alert the staff members. We also aim to rope in professional talent, who can study the geography of the area and decide how such incidents can be avoided,” an official added.

Some officials also hinted at a probable lack of funding in arranging for the required safety measures, like nets that can hold rocks.The work would require maintenance blocks and blocking train traffic, which could be tedious, officials said. “As the CRS inquiry is yet to be done, no official comment can be given,” Sunil Udasi, the chief public relations officer, CR said.

"Durga idol immersion will only be stopped for 24 hours, clarifies Mamata Banerjee","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee

After issuing an order against the immersion of Durga idols on Dashami, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee clarified on Wednesday night that except a 24-hour period, immersions can take place. “This year Durga Puja and Muharram fall on same day. Except 24 hour period on Muharram day, immersions can take place on October 2, 3 and 4”.

Earlier in the day, the WB CM issued an order against immersion of Durga idol on Dashmi, during the procession of Muharram. “No idol immersion after 6 pm on Dashami (Sept 30) till October 1 due to Muharram processions, immersion will resume from October 2,” Banerjee had said in an official statement.

Muharram will be observed this year on October 1. The Chief Minister said that immersion can take place on October 2,3 and 4. Banerjee’s directive may upset the Hindu outfit, though she had issued a similar order last year. The 2016 order was, however, stayed by the Kolkata High Court.

The BJP, meanwhile, has said that it will approach the court against the chief minister’s order.

Journalist killed in Mexico at least 9th this year,"Alex Chang, a Hueyapan councilman, said Rios died on the way to a hospital in Acayucan. Late Tuesday, the state prosecutor’s office said it was investigating the killings. Alex Chang, a Hueyapan councilman, said Rios died on the way to a hospital in Acayucan. Late Tuesday, the state prosecutor’s office said it was investigating the killings.

A newspaper reporter in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz who was enrolled in a government protection program for journalists was killed Tuesday along with two other men, one of his editors and a journalist advocacy group said.

Candido Rios Vazquez, a crime reporter for the newspaper Diario de Acayucan, was at least the ninth journalist slain this year in Mexico.

The State Commission for Attention and Protection of Journalists and Cecilio Perez Cortes, deputy editor at Rios’ newspaper, said the reporter was in the federal government’s mechanism for protection of journalists and human rights workers.

Perez said Rios had been threatened repeatedly since 2012 by a former mayor of Hueyapan de Ocampo and had a panic button on his cellphone and a security camera at his home. Rios had just finished his work for the day around 3 p.m. and was on his way home, Perez said.

Rios apparently stopped alongside the highway in Hueyapan to speak with a former police inspector he knew who was also killed in the attack, Perez said.

Alex Chang, a Hueyapan councilman, said Rios died on the way to a hospital in Acayucan. Late Tuesday, the state prosecutor’s office said it was investigating the killings.

Mexico is now the world’s deadliest country for journalists. The killing of the widely respected journalist Javier Valdez in the western state of Sinaloa in May brought renewed international attention to the issue.

Veracruz has been one of the most deadly Mexican states for journalists in recent years. Rios was the second journalist killed in the state this year. Newspaper columnist Ricardo Monlui was shot to death March 19 as he left a restaurant with his wife in the town of Yanga outside Cordoba.

Rios “started to do journalism because of the social struggle,” Perez said. “He always protested against injustice.” He did not have academic training, but learned on the job, the editor said.

The reporter started his career in a mountainous and largely indigenous area and advocated for farmworkers, women and migrants, Perez said. He founded The Voice of Hueyapan and later joined Diario de Acayucan, where he had worked for 10 years. Perez characterized Rios as “combative” when it came to causes he believed in.

Acayucan and surrounding towns are largely controlled by organized crime, making it a difficult place to do journalism, Perez said.

“We constantly receive threats,” he said.

In a short audio message that Rios sent to Perez on Tuesday afternoon, Rios shouts to his boss over loud music about someone being wounded in a neighborhood. A minor story, Perez said. Rios signed off with: “May God take care of me. Good luck.”

Spanish police on Monday shot dead a man who could be Younes Abouyaaqoub, the suspected driver of a van that mowed down pedestrians in Barcelona, amid a massive manhunt for the Moroccan national described as dangerous and likely armed. “They have shot dead a suspect who could be the perpetrator of the attack,” a source close to the probe told AFP on condition of anonymity. Regional police confirmed a man wearing what appeared to be a suicide belt had been killed in Subirats, a village about 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Barcelona, without identifying the individual. Bomb disposal units have been dispatched to the site.

Earlier on Monday, police had launched an appeal for information about the 22-year-old fugitive, believed to be the last remaining member of a 12-man cell suspected of plotting last week’s deadly attacks. The other suspects have been killed by police or detained after the vehicle rampages in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the assaults, believed to be its first in Spain.

Authorities on Monday raised the death toll to 15, confirming that Pau Perez, a 34-year-old man found stabbed to death in a Ford Focus outside Barcelona on Friday, was killed by Abouyaaqoub. The police had fired at the car as it forced its way through a checkpoint shortly after the Barcelona carnage, and later found Perez in the vehicle. Investigators believe the victim was the owner of the car, which was hijacked by Abouyaaqoub to make his getaway.

Describing Abouyaaqoub as around 1.8 metres (five feet, 11 inches) tall, police tweeted four photographs of the man with short black hair, including three pictures in which he was wearing a black and white striped T-shirt. He is “dangerous and could be armed,” police in Catalonia said. Spanish authorities were also officially notifying European police of the identity of the suspect to enable the launch of a Europe-wide manhunt.

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger’s latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger’s agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa’s Shakuntala — a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‘husband,’ gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing – the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa’s story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves — how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette’s diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen’s Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‘symbols, myths, magic.’ (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger’s favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‘rape,’ for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence — emotional, physical and sexual — against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‘misremembered’) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

"I copped a bit of heat stroke on the first day of training in Bangladesh, says Glenn Maxwell","Glenn Maxwell is already facing the heat in Bangladesh. (Source: Reuters) Glenn Maxwell is already facing the heat in Bangladesh. (Source: Reuters)

Australia will be squaring-off against Bangladesh for the first Test at Dhaka. Incidentally, this is the first time in 11 years that Australia will be playing a Test in Bangladesh. Hence, most of the Aussie players are inexperienced with the testing conditions. Hard-hitting batsman Glenn Maxwell, who is touring Bangladesh for the first time to play a Test, is already facing the heat as he revealed that he had a bout of heatstroke after a grueling net session.

“I copped a bit of heat stroke on the first day, which wasn’t a good start. I think just doing some running outside then had to go inside to do some fitness testing, and then going back outside (to train) didn’t help too much. Basically, my body shut down a little bit but I was fine after a bit of an ice bath and plenty of fluids.”, Maxwell said and added, “With the morning rain and the overnight rain, I think all the moisture’s coming out of the ground and making it quite sweaty work for us. But it’s been good, we’ve got a lot out of the last few days, basically putting the finishing touches for day one.”

Speaking on the kinds of wickets that will be available in the Bangladesh, Maxwell said,”As we showed in India, we probably prefer those wickets where the ball beats our defence and we’re able to sort of just play the line and added, “When it’s spinning big consistently, you can hold your defence and you can trust that the ball’s going to miss the outside edge. We put extreme conditions in (place for) Darwin with the wickets, where we made them ridiculously tough to bat on and guys tested themselves really well during that week.”

“The wickets were perfect. Even coming here and having a couple of hits on these wickets, it’s very similar to what we were facing in Darwin, if not a little bit easier I suppose in the nets. “I think the guys are more than well-equipped to handle whatever comes at us in this first Test.”, he concluded.

Esha Gupta is someone who has always managed to give us fashion goals and with the release of her next film Baadshaho, co-starring Ajay Devgn and Ileana D’Cruz, it’s only expected of her to put her best foot forward. It’s good to see that the actor has not disappointed us so far, whether it’s flaunting a deconstructed shirt or nailing the desi look.

Recently, Gupta wowed all in an Adlyn Rae dress featuring a white lapel off-shoulder neckline and a thigh slit. The nautical striped dress hugged her curves in all the right places and showed off her toned legs perfectly.

Celebrity stylist Reann Moradian accessorised her look with minimal jewellery from Accessorize and FiFi Jewels and a pair of pretty silver Jimmy Choo heels with bright orange studs on it, while, celebrity hairstylist Mehak Oberoi styled her hair into gorgeous retro side swept waves. We are totally in love with this look.

Then, for another event Gupta kept it simple and really chic in a blue floral print jacket and fitted pants from Twelve AM:PM. We love how she wore it with the white pussy bow blouse.

The studded ankle strap heels from Charles and Keith complemented her outfit well. The entire look gave out a very relaxed vibe and that’s what we like about it. Pulling her hair up into a romantic, low bun was a good idea.

She also impressed us with her desi swag. The sage green anarkali which celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma picked for the actor looked lovely on her.

Earrings from Hazoorilal Jewellers and embellished jhuttis from Coral Haze rounded out her look.

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

Served with Love is a typical, I-hate-you-at-first-sight-then fall-in-endless-love story. Set in the kitchen of a plush hotel, the story involves Pakhi, an able sous chef and Abhimanyu Dev, another equally able chief chef — but he’s also a hard taskmaster and the owner of the hotel chain. He’s dated a lot of supermodels but has never committed to anyone. And Pakhi has put her life on hold for her three-year-old orphaned niece.Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway.

Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway. Over ‘vegetable angaara’, ‘home-made rasmalai’ and a recipe of hot chocolate laced with chilli. Kisses are stolen between hospital visits for an ailing grandfather and Abhimanyu caring for Pakhi’s orphaned niece. There’s a dash of jealousy in the form of a psychotic ex-fiance of Pakhi. But it’s never clear what the two protagonists really like in each other except her “ample” assets, and his “ponytail”.

Plot and character development in this book are competitively cringe-making, and it’s difficult to decide which is the winner. It’s easy to see who isn’t — the reader. Read this if only you wish to expand your knowledge of fancy desserts and how a five-star kitchen functions.

"Judwaa 2 trailer launch: Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu, Jacqueline Fernandez burn the stage on the tunes of ‘Tan Tana Tan’","The trailer of Judwaa 2, one of the most awaited remakes in Bollywood was released at a big bash in Mumbai today and going by the pictures, it looks like the team including Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu and Jacqueline Fernandez had a blast with their fans. Helmed by David Dhawan, Judwaa 2 is a rehash version of the Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor-starrer Judwaa which released in 1997.

The actors sportingly crooned to the tunes of ""Tan Tana Tan"" at the launch, much to the astonishment of their fans. Apart from ""Tan Tana Tan"", Judwaa 2 will also reprise the famous Anu Malik number ""Oonchi Hai Building"" in the remake.

While Salman Khan's Judwaa has found a place of its own in Bollywood, we need to see what Judwaa 2 has in store for fans. Salman Khan, who played the lead in the original flick, is also going to make a cameo appearance in this one.

The Judwaa 2 team apparently brought their own twist to the event and arrived with 50 pairs of real twins for the launch.

Looks like, the actors also shook a leg on the upcoming songs from the film. While Judwaa 2 features Varun in a double role - geeky Prem and badass Raja, Jacqueline and Taapsee are all set to step into the shoes of Karisma Kapoor and Rambha."
University of Texas removes Confederate statues,"Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina, U.S. August 17, 2017.

Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina, U.S. August 17, 2017. (REUTERS/Jonathan Drake/Representational)

University of Texas President Greg Fenves has ordered the immediate removal of statues of Robert E. Lee and other prominent Confederate figures from a main area of campus, saying such monuments have become “symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.”

Fenves announced the move late Sunday night as crews were in place to begin taking the statues down. The school also blocked off the area during the process, and the statues are expected to be gone by mid-morning Monday, a spokesman said.

The university moved a statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis from its perch near the campus clock tower to a history museum in 2015. Fenves now says statues of Lee, Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston and Confederate Postmaster General John H. Reagan, which were in the same area as Davis, also will be moved to the Brisco Center for American History on campus.

The school will also move a statue of former Texas Gov. James Stephen Hogg, which was commissioned at the same time as the others, a spokesman said. Hogg will get another place on campus.

The debate over public memorials for Confederate figures roared into national conversation last week after one person was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of people in a clash between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“Last week, the horrific displays of hatred at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville shocked and saddened the nation. These events make it clear, now more than ever, that Confederate monuments have become symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism,” Fenves said in a statement.

Moving the Davis statue in 2015 was a much more deliberate effort. The Davis statue had long been a target of vandalism. Fenves convened a special task force to discuss its future after a shooting rampage by a white supremacist at a Charleston, South Carolina, church and ultimately decided it should come down.

Confederate groups tried to block the removal of the Davis statue and the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued to stop it, but a state district judge sided with the school.

The decision to take down the others came much quicker. Fenves said he spoke last week with student leaders, students, faculty members, staff members and alumni about what to do after the events in Virginia.

“The University of Texas at Austin is a public educational and research institution, first and foremost. The historical and cultural significance of the Confederate statues on our campus — and the connections that individuals have with them — are severely compromised by what they symbolize,” Fenves said. “Erected during the period of Jim Crow laws and segregation, the statues represent the subjugation of African Americans. That remains true today for white supremacists who use them to symbolize hatred and bigotry.”

MANISH ARORA



Manish Arora’s Autumn/Winter 2017 collection celebrated his tenth anniversary of showing at Paris Fashion Week that has turned the designer’s name into a global phenomenon. He presented the glitzy, glamorous, collection called ‘Cosmic Love’. ""The line I am bringing to Mumbai is inspired by the tribes of Africa and outer reaches of the cosmos. Having spent 10 years of my working life in Paris after launching my career in Delhi, I have drawn much inspiration from my travels to the work I create,"" said Arora of his collection.

The creations were a visual interplay of colours, styles, intricate silhouettes and designs. Taking the audience on a fast-paced fashion journey from Tribal Africa to Aztec prints that reflected Art Deco touches, Manish created geometrics with patchwork and embroidery. Detailing has always been Manish’s fortè and the designer unleashed stunning velvet appliqués and optical illusion peacock embellishments in gleaming gold and green.

Astrology played a major role for embroidery, as shooting stars and golden sunrays appeared on silk crêpe drawstring dresses and cropped denim jackets. Swarovski crystals looked magnificent for paisleys that were emblazoned on burgundy, tunic dresses or velvet gowns. Colours played a celestial symphony as mustard, tangerine, midnight blue, violet, fuchsia and royal blue turned into the ideal basis for the collection."
Champion chaser Virat Kohli continues to scale new heights in 2017,"Virat Kohli is known for his prowess and calm-head-on-shoulders-approach when batting second and 2017 has been no different. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli is known for his prowess and calm-head-on-shoulders-approach when batting second and 2017 has been no different. (Source: AP)

There is no debating that Virat Kohli is one of the best batsmen in the world right now and that holds true in any format of the game. Be it Test matches where he stands comfortably to keep the runs flowing or to hold front; ODIs with steady flow of runs or T20Is where he knows how to keep his innings going and speed up when required. But what makes his performances even more worthy of applause is the fact that he doesn’t baffle under pressure. Despite being the captain of a team considered the best in the world, he is able to not just lead the side but also score runs at free will. Many players in the past and current, are unable to handle both the responsibilities – Kohli clearly has embraced the added work.

One could go back to his remarkable chase against Australia in the World T20 last year where he scored 82 runs to take India into the semifinals and see how seamlessly he added runs to the total and didn’t lose his cool during the process. No wonder the skipper called it his best innings till date.

Moving into the new year, Kohli hasn’t changed even though there have been few off days for him this season. But when it comes to chasing runs, he still continues to be one of the best in the world and the numbers tell the story. He has scored 769 runs in ODIs this year in 14 matches played at an average of 96.12 with two centuries coming in the process. While chasing, he has scored 550 runs in eight innings for an equally commendable average of 137.50 and both the hundreds have come while batting second.

Virat Kohli, with 18 hundreds in 107 innings in chases has set a record, surpassing Virat Kohli, with 18 hundreds in 107 innings in chases has set a record, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar ’s feat of 17 in 232 innings. (Source: AP)

But his true excellence can be highlighted by the fact that Kohli’s average in India wins is a staggering 487! Whenever India wins, Kohli remains unbeaten. And that is not a one off case – it has happened five times this year. The only anomaly being his 122 run knock against England at the start of the year. Later he led the side to wins against South Africa (76*), Bangladesh (96*), West Indies (111*) and most recently against Sri Lanka (82*).

Republican Ohio Gov John Kasich urges Donald Trump to end staff chaos and ‘settle it down’,"Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete, Files) Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete, Files)

Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich urged President Donald Trump on Sunday to stop the staff chaos at the White House and “settle it down.” Strategist Steve Bannon last week became the latest top White House official to follow Trump’s national security adviser, a chief of staff, two communications directors and a press secretary, and others, out the door. “You can’t keep putting new people in the lineup and think you’re going to win a world championship,” said Kasich, who is among those who think the staff churn is hampering Trump’s ability to notch a major legislative victory. He voiced his concerns on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The White House said Bannon and new White House chief of staff John Kelly had “mutually agreed” that Friday would be Bannon’s last day. Bannon immediately resumed his role as executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News website, which he led before joining Trump campaign.

David Bossie, a former deputy manager of Trump’s campaign, said Bannon wanted to give Kelly “an opportunity to have a clean slate.” Bannon repeatedly clashed with other top advisers, most notably Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. He dismissed concerns that White House staff divisions are hurting Trump’s ability to get his priorities passed, saying that “in every presidency there are factions.” Bossie blamed Republican congressional leaders instead. “No one is saying the president is not leading. There’s a lack of leadership on one side of Pennsylvania Avenue,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, urged “more cleaning house” at the White House, echoing some fellow Democrats in naming policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security aide Sebastian Gorka as two who should be fired. “There certainly are a lot of people on the White House staff and NSC staff that shouldn’t be there, people like Miller and Gorka and others, who not only, I think, represent the same thing that Steve Bannon did but also aren’t capable of doing the job well,” Schiff said, also on CNN. “So, yes, I think there’s more cleaning house that ought to take place,” Schiff added.

Schiff also questioned Trump’s capability. “There’s some attribute of his character that makes him seemingly incapable of introspection and a broad understanding of what the country really needs. And I think it’s a question that people are asking, you know, what is going on with this president?”

The lawmakers and others spoke Sunday as Trump prepared to return to the White House after more than two weeks away.

Trump spent most of what he said was a “working vacation” holed up at his private golf club in central New Jersey. He also spent two nights at his home at Trump Tower, his first visit to the New York skyscraper since taking office.

Before the President departed New Jersey, the White House announced that he planned to address the nation Monday night from Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, on US policy toward Afghanistan and South Asia. Trump and his national security team met at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland on Friday to hash out policy toward South Asia. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, traveling in Afghanistan, said Sunday that the president has agreed on a new war strategy after 16 years of conflict, but declined to discuss details before Trump announces his decision.

Trump’s upcoming week also includes travel to Arizona to visit a Marine Corps facility in Yuma and hold a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. He stops in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday to address the American Legion convention.

Back in their states and districts for the August recess, Republican lawmakers were scarce on Sunday’s talk shows, skipping opportunities to weigh in on the president’s comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Bannon’s exit from the White House.

An exception was Sen. Tim Scott, who urged Trump to spend time with people who have lived through the nation’s difficult racial past. The South Carolina Republican had said last week that Trump had compromised his moral authority by appearing to equate neo-Nazis and white supremacists with those who came out to oppose them in Charlottesville. Trump said there were “very fine people, on both sides” of the clashes. Scott said the nation is in a “very critical and sensitive time” and that Trump’s next steps would speak louder than his words. “Without that personal connection to the painful past, it will be hard for him to regain that moral authority, from my perspective,” Scott said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Any order on bungalows to former chief ministers can have ramifications: Supreme Court,"Supreme Court of India (File photo) Supreme Court of India (File photo)

The Supreme Court today said that any order against the allotment of government bungalows to former Chief Ministers may have wider ramifications as there were different state and central laws on the issue. The apex courts said the issue needed to be debated at length as its directions may affect various state and central legislations regarding allotment of government accomodation to ex-Chief Ministers. “We are of the view that the issue is of considerable importance which would have an impact on legislations in different states and also the central legislations,” a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Naveen Sinha said.

The apex court was hearing a plea filed by NGO Lok Prahari challenging recent amendments to an Uttar Pradesh legislation allowing ex-Chief Ministers of the state to continue occupying government bungalows, despite an apex court verdict on it. The bench also appointed senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam to assist the court as amicus curiae and said that advocate Gopal Shankar Narayan would assist him in the matter. It listed the matter for further hearing on October 10.

The NGO had challenged the amendments made by the erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government to the ‘UP Ministers (Salaries,Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1981’. It had also challenged another law passed by the UP government last year called ‘The Allotment of Houses under Control of the Estate Department Bill-2016’ to regulate the allotment of government accommodations to trusts, journalists, political parties, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of legislative assembly, judicial officers and government officials.

The amendments in the law enables former chief ministers of the state, including Rajnath Singh, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, to retain government bungalows in that capacity. The apex court had sought the UP government’s response on November 15, 2016, after the NGO’s plea filed through its general secretary S N Shukla claiming that the state government had sought to skirt the apex court verdict of August 1, 2016 by amending the law.

In its 2016 verdict, the apex court had held that the government bungalows allotted to the former Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh was bad in law and they should hand over possession of the bungalows occupied by them in two months. It had said the state government should also recover appropriate rent from the occupants of these bungalows for the period during their “unauthorised occupation”.

The apex court had said that local law only gave largesse to former chief ministers “without any element of reasonableness”. Dealing with the legality of the impugned provisions, the top court had said “in our opinion, the 1997 Rules, which permit the former Chief Ministers to occupy government bungalows for life cannot be said to be valid. “In the circumstances, respondent no.1 (State of Uttar Pradesh) cannot permit any former Chief Minister to occupy any government bungalow or any government accommodation after 15 days from the date on which his term comes to an end,” it said.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic expected to sign new Manchester United contract this week: Reports,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to rejoin Manchester United. (Source: Reuters) Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to rejoin Manchester United. (Source: Reuters)

If reports are to be believed, Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be joining Manchester United by the end of this week. The 35-year old, who was the highest goalscorer for the Red Devils last season, is recovering from a knee ligament injury that he suffered during the Europa League match against Anderlecht back in April.

Even though the injury is expected to keep him out of football action till 2018, a report by espn said that he is going to sign a new contract with the Old Trafford club which will be announced during this week. The development has taken place owing to the his quick recovery from knee ligament.

While he was linked to clubs like LA Galaxy, Ibrahimovic is set to return to United where he scored 17 times in 27 Premier League starts, racking up 28 goals overall. He goals were followed by Marcus Rashford and Henrikh Mkhitaryan at 11 each.

Manager Jose Mourinho had last week expressed his desire to get the Swedish player back on board. He had said, “We are discussing the possibility of him to stay with us. It was very clear from him that what he did last year was not enough for him. He wants more football at the highest level so we are having conversations and discussing the possibility of him staying for the second part of the season.

“He is injured, he needs time to recover, and is not ready to play tomorrow. It’s not something that’s urgent, it’s not desperate to have it done or not.”

United had signed the 35-year old on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in June 2016. Post his departure, United signed striker Romelu Lukaku from Everton, who has been shining at the start of United’s league season, scoring a brace on his debut.

Indian-origin boy Rahul wins UK Child Genius show with IQ higher than Einstein and Hawking,"In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject – Edward Jenner’s medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. (Source: Channel 4 via twitter) In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject – Edward Jenner’s medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. (Source: Channel 4 via twitter)

A 12-year-old Indian-origin boy, believed to be having an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has been crowned as the UK’s ‘Child Genius’ in a popular television quiz competition. Rahul Doshi, who a few days a back became an overnight sensation after answering all questions correctly in some of the earlier rounds, won the Channel 4 show ‘Child Genius’ by beating his nine-year-old opponent Ronan 10-4 in the programme’s finale last night.

The schoolboy from north London clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. “It didn’t sink in straight away, but it was really nice,” Rahul said after winning the title.

In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject – Edward Jenner’s medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. “I was bursting with pride,” said his father Minesh, an IT manager who had entered his son into the competition.

The final followed an intense competition – aired through the week – which saw the candidates showing off their maths, English, spelling and history skills as well as memory powers. Rahul had been one of the favourites throughout, after scoring very highly in previous rounds – and even bagging a full house in the very first round of the series.

Rahul is all of us and our obsession with @richardosman. #ChildGenius pic.twitter.com/f4krdaNeZu — Channel 4 (@Channel4) August 14, 2017

He had captured the imagination of audiences during the competition after he correctly memorised the order of a pack of cards. Rahul, whose ambition is to become a financial adviser, had revealed his strategy for the final as: “The key is to block out everything else and remain calm. So just focus on your goal. Mine was to answer as many questions as I could correctly and that helped me stay calm and do quite well in the early stages.”

Rahul has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club – the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world. He was cheered on by father Minesh and pharmacist mother Komal during the show. His father attracted some social media fury for laughing at a wrong answer given by his son’s closest rival, Ronan, in a tense finale.

“#ChildGenius an adult laughing at a children getting a question wrong shocking behaviour. Shame on you Rahul’s father,” read one of the comments on Twitter. But Minesh Doshi had been very vocal about his competitive side throughout the competition. He had previously said: “We are here to win. There’s no two ways about that.” Twenty contestants aged eight to 12 were whittled down to one winner over the course of a week as part of the ‘Child Genius’ 2017 series.

Hardik Pandya needs to work more on his ODI bowling skills: Bharat Arun,"Hardik Pandya has been improving steadily over the past year. (Source: AP) Hardik Pandya has been improving steadily over the past year. (Source: AP)

Indian all-rounder, Hardik Pandya has been delivering a string of good performances consistently which has led to his consistent improvement. With his recent performances in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pandya grabbed the eyeballs and drew a lot of applause. Skipper Virat Kohli even went on to the extent of saying that Hardik Pandya can be to India what Ben Stokes is to England. Now team India’s bowling coach, Bharat Arun has said that Pandya is a work in progress and can be one of India’s frontline bowling options.

Speaking to cribuzz. com, Bharat Arun spoke about Pandya’s role in the side and said, “If you look at Hardik, he works up very good speeds and bowls 135 plus consistently. We need to have our options open throughout so we like to try out different bowlers at different points of time.”

Stating that Pandya is looking to develop more skills to improve his bowling, he said, “More than me I think Hardik wants to bowl those 10 overs and he does understand that to bowl those 10 overs he needs to work more on his skill and become more skillful. He is someone who works really hard and he is not afraid of trying different things. So my job is a lot easier to be working with somebody like Hardik who wants to upgrade on his skill.”

when asked if there was a valid time-frame by which he could improve his skill-set Arun added, “If you ask me the time-frame, if I ask them to do something I would like to see them do it immediately. But each bowler takes a little while to be able to do that in a match. You need to put in some hours of practice and you need to perfect that in practice before you are able to put that skill in the match. Not only Hardik, it depends on what the bowler is capable of doing, not only their actions but what is easier for them to do. So it is my job to understand that and give them the right feedback.”

It may be recalled here that earlier, former Sri Lankan skipper, Mahela Jayawardene had also lauded Hardik Pandya for his performances and said, “He is an amazing talent, especially for the shorter formats of the game. To have someone who can bowl between 130 -140kmph is a great addition to the side. You saw his batting skills as well. He has the temperament to go big when he needs to. At the same time, he can bat for time. It gives India a lot of options.”

"Kim Jong Un orders production of more rocket engines, warhead tips","Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engines.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the production of more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips, the North’s official media said on Wednesday in a report otherwise lacking threats against Washington after weeks of heightened tension. A report about Kim’s visit to a chemical institute came not long after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to make a peace overture to Pyongyang, welcoming what he called the recent restraint shown by the reclusive North.

Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engine during his tour of the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defence Science, the North’s official KCNA news agency said. “He instructed the institute to produce more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips by further expanding engine production process and the production capacity of rocket warhead tips and engine jets by carbon/carbon compound material,” KCNA said.

North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the start of last year, significantly raising tensions on the heavily militarised Korean peninsula. Two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles in July resulted in a new round of tougher global sanctions.

The last missile test on July 28 put the U.S. mainland in range, prompting heated exchanges that raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula.

Tillerson, however, noted what he called the restraint the North had shown lately and said on Tuesday he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue some time in the near future.

South Korea and the United States are conducting an annual joint drill involving computer simulations of a possible war on the Korean peninsula, exercises that the North routinely describes as preparation for invasion. The drills started on Monday and will run through to Aug. 31. South Korea will also conduct a voluntary civil defence drill across the country later on Wednesday. The KCNA report said Kim had given “special thanks and special bonus” to officials of the institute, calling them heroes. A photograph showed Kim in a grey pinstriped suit, smiling before a large flow chart that described some kind of manufacturing process.

However, there was none of the fiery rhetoric of recent weeks, when Kim threatened to fire missiles into the sea near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam after U.S. President Donald Trump earlier warned North Korea it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States. New U.S. sanctions announced on Tuesday target Chinese and Russian firms, as well as individuals, for supporting Pyongyang’s weapons nuclear and missile programmes.

Visva Bharati gherao continues for second day,"The science students had resorted to the August 21 gherao to protest against some “objectionable” comments made by a teacher of the physics department about the students (Representational Image) The science students had resorted to the August 21 gherao to protest against some “objectionable” comments made by a teacher of the physics department about the students (Representational Image)

The gherao of the officiating registrar and eight other officials of Visva-Bharati University continued for the second day on Wednesday with the physical education department students refusing to withdraw their agitation. Officiating registrar Amit Hazra told reporters he had already communicated to the students last night that the university will sympathetically consider their demand that more hostel rooms be allotted to them and the old students, who have got hostel accomodation, will definitely be alloted rooms. “But they (students) still continued their agitation. It is not possible to allot so many seats for only physical education department,” Hazra, who is also the proctor, added.

The eight other officials, locked by a section of the students of the physical education department at the proctor’s office since 10 am yesterday, included a woman who is the deputy proctor. An agitator said the varsity administration had previously cancelled hostel seats allotted in 2014 for the physical education department students and now 55 students, including girls do not have any place to stay in after attending classes from 6 AM to 3 PM.

“We will not move from the place till the authorities allot hostel rooms for every applicant,” he said. The university had alloted hostel seats for around 25 students of physical education department, an official said. The gherao began a day after functioning of the ‘Siksha Bhavana’ (institute of science) in the university was hampered as a section of the students locked the main entrance of the institute for around four hours on August 21. The science students had resorted to the August 21 gherao to protest against some “objectionable” comments made by a teacher of the physics department about the students.

"Sri Lanka does not look confident and isn’t hungry enough in the middle, says Mahela Jayawardene","Mahela Jayawardena is hoping that Sri Lanka can find a solution for their problems soon. (Source: Express Archive) Mahela Jayawardena is hoping that Sri Lanka can find a solution for their problems soon. (Source: Express Archive)

Former Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene has claimed that fear of failure is one of the main reasons behind Sri Lanka’s poor run of form. It may be recalled here that after losing the one-day series to Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka lost the Test series to India and are now 1-0 down in the one-day series. This led to Jayawardene claiming that the Lankan side’s confidence is low and they don’t look hungry enough in the middle. Hence, he also called for an urgent need to address the problems plaguing the Lankan side and also finding solutions quickly.

“I feel the team’s confidence is low. The fear of failure factor has come out. They don’t look confident, they don’t look hungry enough in the middle. They need to address that and find solutions very quickly.”, Jayawardene said in an interview with Cricinfo and added, “Talking about the whitewash against India, Jayawardene said the team failed in all departments. I am sure the guys would be very disappointed with their performance in the Test series. It was a great challenge for them to test themselves against the number one team. They didn’t handle certain situations well. First innings batting too let them down when there was no demon in the wickets. They also never looked like getting 20 wickets.”

However, praising Indian skipper Virat Kohli, he said, “Look he is a pro active captain. He is very aggressive. He has a brilliant record to start with, though most of the games were played din India, you still have to win matches. He has led the team from the front so the rest of the boys are following on and off the field. The Test for them now will be playing away from home. They have created a good nucleus of players who are taking responsibility. There is good competition for batting and bowling positions.”

Lauding Hardik Pandya for his performance, he said, “He is an amazing talent, especially for the shorter formats of the game. To have someone who can bowl between 130 -140kmph is a great addition to the side. You saw his batting skills as well. He has the temperament to go big when he needs to. At the same time, he can bat for time. It gives India a lot of options.

“His value is no less as a fast bowler, said Jayawardene. He has given India the combination they were craving for. To have five bowlers with three quicks and two spinners. It lends a nice balance to the side,” he added.

The leader of a small New Zealand political party says he won’t contest next month’s election, making him the third leader to quit this month in a campaign that’s been transformed by the rise of Opposition Leader Jacinda Ardern. United Future leader Peter Dunne said Monday there’s a mood for change in the district where he has served as a lawmaker for 33 years.

The move comes as a blow to Prime Minister Bill English and his conservative National Party, who relied on Dunne’s support. Dunne was his party’s sole representative in Parliament. Three weeks ago, Opposition Leader Andrew Little quit following dismal polling, allowing Ardern to step into the position. A week later, Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei resigned. Polls indicate a close election race between English and Ardern.

Total Solar Eclipse 2017: Team led by Indian astrophysicist predicts solar corona,"Predicted magnetic field structure of the Sun’s corona during the August 21 solar eclipse Predicted magnetic field structure of the Sun’s corona during the August 21 solar eclipse

In what has come to be referred as the “Great American Eclipse”, a total solar eclipse will sweep across the United States on August 21. A sense of excitement is fast building up as a key group of scientists from Centre of Excellence in Space Sciences at the Indian Institute for Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata, have made predictions of how the Sun’s atmosphere — the corona — will look like when it will be visible during the total solar eclipse on Monday.

The team is led by Dr Dibyendu Nandi, head, Centre of Excellence in Space Sciences India (CESSI) at IISER, Kolkata, who is also an associate at the Pune-based Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA). The team has predicted the expected structure of the solar corona, which will become visible during the eclipse. “We will be able to predict the solar corona during the eclipse,” Nandi told The Indian Express. Dr Nandi, however, said it will take at least a day or two to analyse the data and arrive at findings whether their prediction was accurate or not. Nandi, who is also the chairman of the working group on solar stellar environments at International Astronomical Union, said it was important to understand the corona, and comparing this prediction with actual observations during the eclipse will tell us how well we understand it.

At IUCAA, Director Dr Somak Raychaudhury said it was a moment of pride, especially as the team has been working for years to predict the Sun’s atmosphere. “The Sun is very complicated and there is a very big industry trying to predict how this star is going to behave. It is just not light but also particles coming out of the Sun that are seen in the corona. Scientists worldwide are engaged in modelling the Sun — taking up computer simulations and there are very few groups who can make accurate predictions,” he said.

“At IUCAA, we provide our research resources to at least 150 associates across the country. Dr Nandi and his team have been using the facilities here and, hence, it is with a sense of expectation that scientists are now gearing up to make a diversity of observations of the solar eclipse,” he added.

Prantika Bhowmik, CESSI, IISER, Kolkata, Anthony R Yeates, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, UK, Suman Panda, CESSI and Department of Physical Sciences, IISER, Kolkata, Rajashik Tarafder, CESSI, IISER, Kolkata, Soumyaranjan Dash, CESSI, IISER, Kolkata, are graduate and undergraduate students who are part of the team working with Dr Nandi.

Coronal magnetic fields are difficult to measure under normal circumstances since the corona is much more faint that the disk of the Sun. This necessitates the development and use of theoretical and computational models to understand the problem of coronal heating, and, in turn, the origin of solar storms and severe space weather. This India-led study and modeling that aims to predict the Sun’s coronal structure is important for the world in this respect. Their prediction of the appearance of the corona during the eclipse is one of only two predictions, highlighting the difficulty of this challenge that many groups around the world are not yet ready for.

Solar eclipses offer a way around the problem of observing the corona. In a total eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the Sun’s disk, the faint light from the corona becomes visible! This allows us to see coronal structures and understand the magnetic fields that produce them. Therefore, the ‘Great American Eclipse’ will allow testing of our theoretical models and lead to their refinement through an assessment of what went right and what went wrong with the predictions, said scientists.

The CESSI team has predicted an intricate structure of the corona that is a result of computing the evolution of the magnetic fields of sunspots on the solar surface over many years. Their predictions shows lotus petal-like shapes extending from the surface in some parts of the Sun’s corona, while in other parts, magnetic field lines fan out like spokes of a wheel from the Sun and into inter-planetary space. Scientists expect that comparison of eclipse observations with these simulations will help understand our star and its influences on our space environment, said Niruj Ramanujam, chair, Public Outreach & Education Committee, Astronomical Society of India.

Bareilly Ki Barfi box office collection day 6: Will this sweet tale of romance remain strong till this Friday?,"Bareilly Ki Barfi box office collection: The film is strong during weekday. Bareilly Ki Barfi box office collection: The film is strong during weekday.

The journey of Bareilly Ki Barfi at the box office has been very interesting. Despite a slow start at the box office, the film has been showing considerable growth at the box office. Directed by Ashwini Iyer Tiwari, the film, which is small town love triangle, has so far collected around Rs 15 crores and is receiving immense love from the audience. The success of the Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon starrer proves that the audience prefer content driven films than star vehicles.

In the first half of 2017, Bollywood witnessed a dry spell at the box office. Big budget films like Jab Harry Met Sejal and Tubelight failed to bring in the crowd to the theaters. However, Akshay Kumar came to the rescue as his Toilet: Ek Prem Katha performed well. It seems this Ashiwini Iyer directorial is following in TEPK’s footsteps. While it remains far from the kind of collection Akshay’s film has fetched, its overall performance has been impressive.

Ashwini won accolades for her film Nil Battey Sannata and Bareilly Ki Barfi is another feather in her cap.

Bareilly Ki Barfi, written by Dangal director Nitesh Tiwari, is benefiting from positive word-of-mouth. Delighted with the reception garnered by the film, actor Ayushmann shared a short video on his Twitter handle thanking his fans for the amazing success of the film. The actor also praised Rajkummar Rao and his act as Pritam Vidrohi.

The film released on August 18.

US defense secretary in Iraq as troops battle for Tal Afar,"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (REUTERS/Toru Hanai) US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (REUTERS/Toru Hanai)

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Iraq on Tuesday just days after the start of an offensive to oust Islamic State from the city of Tal Afar, with talks focused on backing Iraqi efforts to stabilise areas recaptured from the militant group. Prior to arriving, Mattis said the fight against Islamic State was far from over despite recent successes by Western-backed Iraqi government forces.

The battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, US officials said. Iraqi security forces opened the offensive to take back Tal Afar on Sunday, their latest objective in the war following the recapture of Mosul after a nine-month campaign that left much of the city in ruins. Lying 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq’s far north, Tal Afar is a long-time stronghold of the hardline Sunni Muslim insurgents,

“ISIS’ days are certainly numbered, but it is not over yet and it is not going to be over anytime soon,” Mattis told reporters in Amman. Mattis said that after retaking Tal Afar, Iraqi forces would move against the western Euphrates River valley. Brigadier General Andrew Croft, responsible for coalition air operations over Iraq, said that between 10,000 and 20,000 civilians remained in Tal Afar. The plight of civilians was a big factor in the battle of Mosul as Islamic State tried to keep them areas it controlled to act as human shields against air strikes and artillery bombardments. Several thousand are believed to have been killed.

Croft said that over the past two or three months, he had seen a fracturing in Islamic State leadership. “It just seems less coordinated. It appears more fractured, less robust, and sort of flimsy, is the word I would use…it is sporadic,” Croft told reporters. Islamic State leaders fled Mosul during the fighting there and the whereabouts of its chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are unknown. Unconfirmed reports in the past few months have said he is dead.

Brett McGurk, US special envoy to the coalition, said that while the battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, Iraqi forces had retaken 235 square km (90 miles) in the first 24 hours. US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis, who will meet Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Defence Minister Arfan al-Hayali, will discuss the future of US forces in Iraq after the recapture of the remaining cities under Islamic State, and the role they could play in stabilizing operations.

The officials said that while big cities like Mosul have been largely been cleared of Islamic State militants, there were concerns about the ability of Iraqi forces to hold territory. Mattis said pockets of resistance remained in west Mosul, including sleeper cells. Iraqi security forces were capable of carrying out simultaneous operations, he added.

Islamic State is also on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the US-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its main Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. McGurk said about 2,000 Islamic State fighters remained in Raqqa and as much as 60 percent of the city had been retaken. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria.

Mattis said the next step for forces fighting Islamic State in Syria would be a move against the middle Euphrates valley, a reference to the militants’ stronghold in Deir al-Zor province southeast of Raqqa.

KURDISH REFERENDUM

A US official also said Mattis would press Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, to call off a planned referendum on independence. Iraq’s Kurds have said they will hold the referendum on Sept. 25 despite concerns from Iraq’s neighbors who have Kurdish minorities within their borders and a US request to postpone it. However, a senior Kurdish official said the Kurds may consider the possibility of a postponment in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in Baghdad.

McGurk said the Kurdish delegation’s recent visit to Baghdad was encouraging. The Pentagon signed an agreement with Peshmerga forces last year to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and equipment. The US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the memorandum of understanding would expire soon and suggested that Mattis could use it as a bargaining chip.

The United States and other Western nations fear the vote could ignite a new conflict with Baghdad and possibly neighboring countries, diverting attention from the ongoing war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

Frankfurt’s international schools see Brexit bonus,"Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Frankfurt’s international schools see a bonus from Brexit after a deluge of calls from bankers who are set to be posted to Germany’s financial centre along with their children now that Britain has decided to leave the European Union. The city is the most popular place for banks to set up their new EU headquarters, prompting a surge of interest in its 12 international schools which teach in English and follow baccalaureate programmes. Paul Fochtman, head of the Frankfurt International School, said his usually quiet summer holiday was spent this year hosting planning calls three times a week to discuss Brexit.

“There’s no question a number of people are coming here,” Fochtman told Reuters on the 1,800-person campus on the edge of a hilly forest in one of Frankfurt’s affluent suburbs. Studies show as many as 10,000 jobs could move from London to Frankfurt over the next four years, according to Frankfurt Main Finance, a lobbying group that promotes the city as a financial hub, possibly bringing with them thousands of students.

Among banks that announced plans to relocate some of their EU operations to Frankfurt are Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , and Standard Chartered. A number of Japanese banks have opted for Frankfurt including Daiwa , Sumitomo Mitsui Financial , Mizuho Financial , and Nomura Holdings. Although schools are keen on new business, they are cautious about the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, wary the influx of bankers could be lower than some lobby groups estimated or that some may commute while their children stay in London.

Even though Brexit only becomes official in March 2019, schools are proving to be an early indicator of future moves given the importance that parents put on a child’s education, which is often paid for by the employer.

NUMBER ONE BARRIER

“School is often the No. 1 barrier to a move for families,” said Fochtman, whose school is losing 50 pupils after General Motors reduced its workforce in Frankfurt following a takeover of its Opel unit by France’s PSA Group. Frankfurt’s Strothoff International School said it was looking to buy land to build a new campus which would double its student body. Paris and Dublin in their pitches to attract bankers leaving London also committed to providing new schools for bankers’ children.

In December, about six months after the Brexit vote, Eric Menges, chief executive officer of FrankfurtRheinMain, another group that markets the city, asked school officials to examine how Brexit would affect the education sector.”Within 30 minutes of the banking district, there are 30 bilingual schools, 12 of which offer the classic international school degree,” Menges said. Educators estimate about 10,000 international and bilingual students are currently enrolled.

Schools have said they will need financial guarantees to fund any significant expansion. One executive of a U.S. bank said it was in discussion with schools in Frankfurt to secure places and was asked to pay money in advance. Fochtman, whose school serves 60 nationalities, was initially sceptical that Brexit would impact his school until senior bankers began knocking on the door.

“LEFT HOLDING THE BAG”

So far this year, Fochtman has hosted nine delegations from banks considering moving to Frankfurt. Delegations typically consisted of senior bankers and human resources executives. In the spring, Fochtman formed a taskforce to consider expansion but the school board decided to put on hold plans to build a new 1,800-person campus to focus on incremental growth until they have firmer signs the influx will be significant.

Uncertainty surrounding Brexit was behind the caution. “We are left holding the bag” if the school builds for an additional 2,000 and fewer show up, Fochtman said. At Strothoff International School, south of Frankfurt, Bettina Otto, head of administration, said she was in contact with banks and was looking at “several options” for a new campus to grow the student body from 300 to 800. She has already raised teaching staff numbers by five to 60, partly due to Brexit. In Dublin, a new private international school catering for local and expatriate students aged between three and eighteen years is scheduled to open in September 2018 and is hoping to benefit from relocating bankers.

As part of Paris’ charm offensive to net employees from the big banks, France has pledged to build three more international schools targeted at expatriates’ children in the greater Paris region by 2022. Tuition fees at Frankfurt International School for a 12th-grade student are about 22,100 euros. In comparison, a place for a 12th-grader in the British School of Brussels is around 34,000 euros.

“It is also worth noting that the most expensive international school here (Frankfurt International School) would be considered to be in the lower price bracket compared to other international schools across Europe,” said Menges of the FrankfurtRheinMain marketing team.

"West Indies, Sri Lanka confirm tour to Pakistan for T20Is","Najam Sethi confirmed the tours by Sri Lanka and West Indies. (Source: AP) Najam Sethi confirmed the tours by Sri Lanka and West Indies. (Source: AP)

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday confirmed that the country will host two international teams as it tries to bring back international cricket to the country. Sri Lanka and West Indies have confirmed that they will travel to Pakistan to play T20 international in September and November respectively. The PCB confirmed this after announcing that a World XI side will be in Lahore to play three T20Is in October.

“Cricket West Indies and Pakistan Cricket Board are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies team play the T20 matches with Pakistan in Lahore in late November,” said a statement released by the PCB.

“My mission statement is to bring back international cricket to Pakistan and hopefully we will be able to announce the full World XI side in next two to three days,” PCB chairman Najam Sethi told a news conference.

Pakistan haven’t had a international season in their country since the 2009 terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus in Lahore. Though Zimbabwe did visit Pakistan two years ago, no Test playing nation has visited them.

But, the two tours will only go ahead after assessing the situation during the World XI tour which was first talked after the second edition of Pakistan Super League ended in March.

“It was a very difficult task convincing the Sri Lankan board to send their team to Lahore once again but they have shown great courage in accepting our request and hopefully if security arrangements are confirmed they will come and play T20 matches in October.”

“We will try to organise some matches of the Pakistan Super League in Karachi early next year so that we can start convincing teams to also play at other venues apart from Lahore,” he added.

Surround space: Parul Sharma’s debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma’s photographs One of Parul Sharma’s photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the “asymmetry of everydayness”. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma’s sojourns in the last couple of years — Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi — but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. “I don’t like to put anything in a box. I don’t want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,” says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. “It has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,” says Sharma.

"Kanpur police writes to state govt, Centre to decide fate of Pakistani national","Kanpur police had written to the central and state governments, seeking direction on how to proceed with the matter. Kanpur police had written to the central and state governments, seeking direction on how to proceed with the matter.

The Kanpur police is in a peculiar predicament regarding a Pakistani national. Mohammad Idris (49), who hails from Karachi, was arrested in Kanpur in 1999 for not having a valid visa. Since then, he has been in and out of jail. In 2009, Pakistani had refused to allow him to be deported, denying that he was its citizen. Two days ago, Kanpur police had written to the central and state governments, seeking direction on how to proceed with the matter.

On Monday, after spending nearly four-and-a-half years in jail for preparing a fake ID card to purchase a SIM card, Idris was released from Kanpur District Jail. Four hours later, he was back in jail. He had allegedly entered into a brawl with a man, and was arrested for breach of peace under Section 151 of the CrPC.

Kanpur District Jail Deputy Jailor Rajesh Rai said that according to records, Idris is a native of Green Town in Karachi. “He was released around 5 pm on Monday. However, police brought him back to jail after four hours in another case,” he added. “Idris entered into a brawl with a man at Meghdooth crossing. He was arrested from the spot at around 7.30 pm and booked… We decided to produce him before the magistrate immediately, keeping his security in mind as he is a foreign national,” said City Kotwali SHO Sanjay Kumar Singh.

Kanpur SSP Sonia Singh said: “We are waiting for a reply from the state home department and the Union Home Ministry, seeking direction regarding Idris’ stay after his release.” The letters were sent on August 20, she added. A Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) official said Idris was born and brought up in Mishri Bazaar area of Kanpur. In 1988, during a visit to Pakistan, he reportedly got married to Pakistani national Shabana. He later got citizenship of Pakistan and started running a leather product unit in Karachi. Idris came to India in May 1999 on a tourist visa to meet his ailing father. After his father’s death, Idris stayed on, the official added.

In July, next year, Idris was arrested under the Foreigners’ Act for not having a valid visa. He was granted bail after a few days and started doing odd jobs in Kanpur. In August 2009, a Kanpur court hearing the case instructed the LIU and local police to deport Idris to Pakistan at the earliest. “A police team took Idris to the Attari border. But Pakistani officials there asked the policemen to visit the Pakistani High Commission for formalities and then come to the border for deportation. Idris was interrogated at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi, where officials refused to allow his deportation and denied that he was a citizen of their country,” said a LIU official.

Following this, Idris was brought back to Kanpur. On February 27, 2013, he was arrested again for preparing a fake identity card to purchase a SIM card. He was booked under sections 429 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the IPC. After his release from jail on Monday, he was again arrested.

Change in mindset has made us believe we can win: Shakib Al Hasan,"Shakib Al Hasan has claimed that his side is high on confidence. (Source: AP) Shakib Al Hasan has claimed that his side is high on confidence. (Source: AP)

Ahead of the two-match Test series against Australia, Bangladesh allrounder Shakib Al Hasan has claimed that it is the change in mindset that has helped his side believe that they can win and become mentally stronger. While Australia will square-off against the Tigers at Dhaka for the first Test (their first Test in Bangladesh after a span of 11 years), Bangladesh seems upbeat about putting in a good performance.

In an interview with The Guardian Shakib said, “Previously the mindset was to draw against big teams – try to play five days, make a draw. But we never used to get the result. Then we started thinking, ‘Let’s try to win – let’s try to play and win the game’. It’s the mindset that changed, and that made us believe that we can win.” and added, “It’s been a long journey.It’s been incredible. I don’t think many people thought – even in Bangladesh – that we can come this far. We knew that we have this ability, and we needed that belief, and we can only get this belief by winning matches.”

Stating that there is a lot of confidence in the side, he further added, “But there is no shortage of self-belief at this moment … Now we feel that we are very much unbeatable at home – doesn’t matter who we are playing against. So this is the belief that makes a team a very good team, and a winning team.”

Earlier skipper Mushfiqur Rahim had also said that the Tigers can eat the mighty Australians at home.

Speaking to Cricbuzz, he said, “We have always heard that Australia play aggressive cricket. We are ready to play against them with an aggressive mindset. “If we can use the home conditions and play to our potential, I don’t think it is impossible to beat Australia. To be honest, if we can play our best cricket, we can beat any team in the world because we have that ability. “Earlier, we had to play well while others had to play badly if we wanted to achieve success but that is not the case now.”

Pro Kabaddi: How fit are Indian players from their overseas counterparts?,"Pro Kabaddi has been modified and will be played across three months. Pro Kabaddi has been modified and will be played across three months.

Fitness in today’s sporting world goes hand in hand if one aspires to achieve desired goals. We have seen Indian cricket team’s captain Virat Kohli’s work out regime which has taken his game to a different level. However, in recent times, foreign coaches have often complained about the physical and psychological fitness of Indian players. Football coach Stephen Constantine recently wrote in his autobiography that when he joined the Indian football team, he was shell-shocked to see their approach and poor performance.

While the format of the fifth season of Pro Kabaddi has been modified and will be played across three months. During a brief interaction with Indianexpress.com, Gujarat Fortunegiants’ physiotherapists Sameep Sanjiv Shah and coach Manpreet Singh revealed the current scenario of fitness among the Indian players and what separates them from the overseas players.

Coach Manpreet Singh

Every game has its own diet. You can’t get wrestling’s diet into kabaddi and one can’t expect kabaddi player follow cricketers diet. Every game requires a different diet structure, different body fitness. Kabaddi is a mixture of three games – wrestling, judo and athletics – and in this you have to have endurance. Brick muscles are important, the body must be flexible like that of gymnasts. We simply can’t put a kabaddi player on juices, or only on proteins. You need to give the right amount of proteins, carbs (carbohydrates), supplements. And this is when the role of coaches, physio, trainer to look after his diet.

Earlier, we didn’t have facilities in Kabaddi. We played in mud, and there was no trainer, physio, and coach used to do all the jobs. But, today we have every facility and technology possible. Now, a player is being guided and worked upon his prior injuries is done. Joints are more prone to injuries in a sport like kabaddi. When we organise a camp before the season, a lot of work is done on players fitness. Trainers put a lot of efforts to increase player’s power, where as physio makes sure that muscles are not tight ahead of the match to avoid any injury.

We had a 25-day preparatory camp in SAI Gandhinagar where in the first week we assessed them through medical tests. In the second week, we sat together and made charts for every player. In the remaining two weeks, we worked upon their previous injuries, increasing their endurance, stamina. Even the Iranian players joined us for the camp.

Physiotherapists Sameep Sanjiv Shah

As a Physiotherapist, I believe our hands are enough but when you are playing tournaments like IPL, ISL, I-League, and PKL, the body is prone to injuries. Thus the market has introduced so many types of equipment like for muscle recovery. We have game reading, recovery boots (used in football as well). All these machines help us reduce the recovery period of a player.

Physio’s role is to diagnose the injury. Once the basic diagnosis is done, we do a clinical assessment if it is a joint injury. And in joint injury, surrounding structures will be involved too. After analysing the actual reason behind the injury we use joint mobilisation like mfr (medical first responder)is used.

On pre-season

Pre-season is all about basic assessments. Trainer, coaches sit together and discuss the strengths, endurance of each player. After getting their basic assessments, we particularly work to turn their weaknesses into their strengths.

Foreign players are introduced to pre-season, diet, fitness at a very early stage whereas in Indian players are introduced to all this very late. We see footballers going through medical tests and play pre-season tournaments so that their bodies are ready for long tiring seasons. The concept of having a pre-season or preparatory camps has begun here.

Physio’s job on rest days

Our focus is on to have the player fit for the next match. There are plenty of electrical modalities being used to promote healing of body parts. In order to provide relief from swelling or pain, IFC, Neuromuscular stimulation, ultrasound, recovery boots, ice baths and many more techniques are being used.

Generally on a match day, stretching and pool sessions are conducted. But on rest days, we go for modalities like recovery boots or ice baths. We emphasise on improving the blood circulation. Manually a player needs around 48 hours but with recovery boots, which works on ‘pure air compression’ concept, it decreases the time to 24 hours.

Wherein ice bath or GRM work on micro injuries, muscle tears. Such methods are used right after the matches. In addition, we have foam loading, stretching, swimming pool recovery and wax recovery baths. I personally feel that we should rather work on prevention than curing them.

Also, sleep plays a major role in recovery. A player ideally should get a sleep of 7-8 hours. Certain hormones are released while sleeping thus minimising the recovery span.

Vegan diet may help lower your cholesterol,"Plant-based eating patterns leads to changes in body composition which help in reducing the cholesterol levels (Source: File Photo) Plant-based eating patterns leads to changes in body composition which help in reducing the cholesterol levels (Source: File Photo)

Are you suffering from high cholesterol? Try plant-based vegetarian diets, especially vegan diets, which can significantly help lower the levels of cholesterol — known to increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a study.

The findings showed that long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns leads to changes in body composition which help in reducing the cholesterol levels. The reductions were found to be greater compared to omnivorous diets.

The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet like weight loss, lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol are well known.

However, “our goal is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke and premature death,” said Susan Levin from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington.

Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid and is vital for the normal functioning of the body.While high levels of “good” HDL cholesterol are beneficial, too much “bad” LDL cholesterol can lead to heart disease.

Plant-based diet includes vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein and plant sterols, while an omnivorous diet includes both plant and animal foods.

For the study, appearing in the journal Nutrition Reviews, the team conducted a dietary review of 49 observational and controlled studies.

The results revealed that a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with total cholesterol that’s 29.2 mg/dL lower. Further, in clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowered total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.

Death toll in DR Congo landslide climbs to 140,"Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda. Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda.

The death toll from a landslide that swept over a fishing village on the banks of a lake in the Democratic Republic of Congo has reached 140, the government said today. “We estimate that there at least a hundred bodies buried underneath the rumble of large rocks that fell on the 48 destroyed homes,” the deputy governor of Ituri Province, Pacifique Keta, told AFP.

The landslide occurred last Wednesday in the northeast village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert when part of a mountain engulfed a fishing camp after heavy rains. At the time, the government said 40 people had died. Keta said authorities have decided to suspend the search for bodies to “prioritise the disinfection of the area” — a measure designed to prevent the spreading of possible diseases to nearby fishing villages.

Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda. The vast country has experienced several similar disasters, including a mudslide in May 2010 that killed 19 people, though the bodies of 27 others were never recovered. In February 2002, about 50 people were found dead after a wave of mud and rocks hit the eastern town of Uvira, submerging about 150 homes.

Briton hailed as hero for comforting Spain attack victim,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

A 44-year-old Briton, believed to be of Indian-origin, is being hailed as a hero after he risked his life to comfort a young victim of the terror attack in Spain in which a van ploughed into pedestrians, media reports said. Harry Athwal, from Birmingham, had been holidaying in Spain last week when the attackers drove down Las Ramblas, Barcelona, at speed, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 other.

Without considering his own safety, Athwal ran from the first floor restaurant where he was dining to the pavement and cradled a young boy who had been struck by the van, The Mirror reported. He was seen comforting the boy at the site of the attack with a photo of them going viral as a terrible symbol of the destruction wrought by extremists on the city’s freedom. Athwal ran up to the boy as the terrorist’s van swerved mindlessly past, despite the bodies being thrown high in the air and cries from police to stay back for his own safety.

Later, at a hotel, recovering from the harrowing experience, Athwal told the daily that he cast aside all thoughts for his own safety in that moment because the boy suddenly became in his eyes, his own son. As such, he could not leave him alone to suffer, or to be mowed down again by the terrorists should they reverse callously back down the street.

“He was unconscious, his leg was bent the wrong way, there was blood coming out of his head, I knew it was more than blood. I was checking for a pulse and he didn’t have one,” Athwal said. “I put my hand on his back and I thought he had gone. I was stroking his hair and in floods of tears but I stayed with him, I sat there because I was not going to leave this child in the middle of the road,” he said.

“The police were telling me to move but I would not leave him. All the time I was thinking the terrorists could come back but I was not leaving that child. To me, he looked like my own son. He was my son’s age, seven or eight. I just ran my hands through his hair, it was about comforting him,” Athwal added. The project manager, who lives with this wife Harjinder and sons Diernn, aged 19, and Khye, 8, also told the daily of how he had not even planned to visit Barcelona last week.

He visited with his own family, including his son, Khye, to celebrate the eight-year-old’s birthday earlier this month. But when his sister invited him to join her and friends in a spontaneous trip he agreed.

The group could not check into their rooms straight away when they arrived on Thursday, so decided to have a late lunch on Las Ramblas. They nearly ate down the middle of the pedestrianised street, exactly in the terrorist’s path, but a persuasive waiter luckily tempted them to try his restaurant on a first floor balcony. It was from there they watched the horrifying killing spree unfurl. Spanish police believe 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub drove the van through the crowded street.

World XI to tour Pakistan after government approves ‘President level security’,"Pakistan recently hosted the PSL final in Lahore which featured international players, including former West Indies skipper Darren Sammy. (Source: File) Pakistan recently hosted the PSL final in Lahore which featured international players, including former West Indies skipper Darren Sammy. (Source: File)

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed that a World XI series will be held in Lahore after the Punjab Government gave its nod for ‘Presidential level security’ for the tour. According to a Cricinfo report, the 15-man squad, featuring players from all top Test countries, will be in Dubai for a seven-day camp and will then head to Lahore for the three-T20 series starting September 10. Former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower will be the coach of the side.

Shahryar Khan made a lot of efforts to get a green signal for this series. Giles Clarke, ECB president and chairman of ICC’s Pakistan Task Force, also played a major role in this project. The World XI team was picked by ECB director Flower. The tour has got full backing from the ICC and, according to PCB chairman Najam Sethi, the world body has been working closely with the PCB for ensuring security for the event. All the expenses of the tour will be borne by the PCB.

With Pakistan hoping to host Sri Lanka for a one-off T20I in September, Najam Sethi feels World XI series could encourage more countries to come to Pakistan.

After the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in March 2009, only Zimbabwe and Afghanistan have toured Pakistan as the others have refused over security concerns. The major blow was not hosting 2011 World Cup which was scheduled to jointly held by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Short tour by Zimbabwe in 2015 did revive international cricket in Pakistan but another bomb blast, 800m from Gadaffi system, did no good. After that, PCB hosted the PSL final in 2017 and overseas players, including former West Indies skipper Darren Sammy, featured in the fixture on March 5 in Lahore.

"We, the People: Sketching illustrations for the Constitution of India","A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo) A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo)

While the founding fathers of the Constitution were framing the laws that would govern India, miles from the capital, Delhi, Nandalal Bose and his students in Santiniketan were sketching illustrations that would feature in the manuscript, and would encapsulate India’s rich history, diversity and unity. It was Jawaharlal Nehru who had reportedly proposed that Bose work on the Constitution of India, where the text, too, was handwritten by calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada in flowing italic.

For the world’s longest written Constitution — now carefully kept in the library of the Parliament of India — Bose and his team designed a total of 22 illustrations. Borrowing from Indian miniature tradition, Ajanta frescoes and what came to be defined as the Santiniketan style, intricate frames surround the text. The depictions span different periods. If the initial part has the popular Indus Valley seal mark, the Zebu bull, the Vedic period is represented by a scene from gurukul. We see scenes from various eras, including the Mauryan and Mughal empire, and the dancing Nataraja from the Chola tradition. The freedom movement is portrayed with a figure of Mahatma Gandhi during the Dandi March, and another frame has Subhash Chandra Bose.

Our epics find representation, too. From the Ramayana, there is Ram, Lakshman and Sita returning home; a scene from the Mahabharata has Krishna and Arjun in conversation. Buddha and Mahavira are also part of the Constitution, where the varied geographical terrain of India is also celebrated.

US admiral says diplomacy key to resolving North Korea crisis,"In this photo distributed by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, second from right, inspects the preparation of the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile. (Source: AP) In this photo distributed by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, second from right, inspects the preparation of the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile. (Source: AP)

The head of the U.S. military’s Pacific Command said on Tuesday it was more important to use diplomacy to counter North Korea’s missile threat rather than consider what actions by the reclusive North might trigger a preemptive strike. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by the U.S. and South Korean “war maniacs”. “So we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,” Harris told reporters at a U.S. air base in South Korea about an hour from the capital, Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader.

He said diplomacy was “the most important starting point” in response to the North’s threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive U.S. strike against Pyongyang. “As far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,” he added. North Korea has pursued missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and ignored all calls, including from lone major ally China, to stop. It justifies its weapons programmes by pointing to perceived U.S. hostility and regularly threatens to destroy the United States.

The United States and South Korean began long-planned joint military exercises on Monday called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said were purely defensive and did not aim to increase tension on the Korean peninsula. The drills end on Aug. 31 and involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea..

A North Korean Army spokesman repeated the threat of undisclosed retaliation against the United States for readying a preemptive strike and a war of aggression, using the drills as an excuse to mount such an attack. “The U.S. will be wholly held accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by such reckless aggressive war manoeuvres, as it chose a military confrontation,” the unnamed spokesman said in comments carried by the North’s official KCNA news agency. Harris also told reporters that a scheduled “operational pause” by the U.S. Navy’s fleet worldwide would not affect the military’s ability to defend South Korea.

The pause was ordered after a U.S. guided missile destroyer collided with an oil tanker in waters near Singapore and Malaysia on Monday.

"Varnika Kundu Case: HC refuses to interfere in probe, says by and large cops are going right","Varnika Kundu with her father Varinder Singh Kundu (PTI/File) Varnika Kundu with her father Varinder Singh Kundu (PTI/File)

THE PUNJAB and Haryana High Court on Tuesday refused to interfere in the ongoing police investigation into the stalking and attempted abduction case of Varnika Kundu after going through the police record, including the case diary on it. The police file was presented by the Chandigarh Administration before a division bench of the High Court which returned it after perusal.

The public interest litigation filed by human rights lawyer Ranjan Lakhanpal seeking judicial supervision of the ongoing police investigation and directions for a CBI probe into the incident was withdrawn after the division bench of Acting Chief Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan observed that “by and large they (police) are going right. For the present, you can withdraw it (PIL)”.

“We cannot publish it. We cannot tell it to you loudly. Divulging of something related to the case may affect the right of the victim…” remarked the division bench, adding that the Section 365 with Section 511 are already there in accordance with the complaint of attempted abduction. “The parties (in the case) are not under any difficulty. Whenever they feel the need, they can come. Let the victim make a statement if she is aggrieved. Who is stopping her?”

While refusing to entertain the PIL, the division bench quoting a 1991 judgment of the Supreme Court on Monday had said only the aggrieved parties in a criminal case have a right to file a PIL and asserted that the High Court would have no problem to take up the case if the victim herself approached the court.

“Even if there are million questions of law to be deeply gone into and examined in a criminal case, it is for them [aggrieved parties] and them alone to raise all such questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at the appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants,” the apex court has said in the judgment, which formed the basis for the High Court decision not to entertain the PIL.

The High Court had adjourned the case on Monday after a counsel representing the UT Administration said they can apprise the division bench of the latest status of the investigation into the case. No notice had been issued to the administration or police in the case.

Observing that the petitioner counsel’s knowledge of the case is based on newspaper reports which he had attached with his petition, the division bench quoting a 1969 Supreme Court judgment said the press reports “at best [are] a secondhand secondary evidence” and cannot be treated as facts.

“You will start off this. It will go off hand at some stage and at some point will affect the trial,” observed the division bench, adding that the court cannot comment anything which can prejudice the rights of any party in the case.

UT’s senior standing counsel R S Rai opposed the PIL at the outset saying it would set a dangerous trend in criminal matters. “The counsel is somebody who is nobody to the case and is alien to the investigation,” said Rai. “How can he come with the PIL? We are at advanced stage of the investigation. This is a dangerous trend to invite some comment on the case from the court.”

Speaking of Ramanujan,"When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez. When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary — urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‘Fear No Fall’, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‘possession’.

What makes Rodriguez’s volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR’s own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‘both context sensitive and reflexive’, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet — chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR’s journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‘Between’ becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as “the hyphen in Indo-American studies”.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself “a multiple monolingual”. In another: “It looks as if I live between things all the time — two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.” Or, yet again: “The whole question of roots is not relevant to me… India is me and with me…” And again, ‘It takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.’

AKR’s image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: “[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky… Each had a literature that was unlike the others…and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.”

There is no cultural machismo here — no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky — always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‘have to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet’. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet’s capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary — more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

CBSE asks all its schools to frame guidelines for safe internet usage,"The board has also asked the schools to install effective firewalls, filtering and monitoring software mechanisms in all the computers and regularly review filtering and blocking policies and procedures. The board has also asked the schools to install effective firewalls, filtering and monitoring software mechanisms in all the computers and regularly review filtering and blocking policies and procedures.

The Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE) has issue a circular to all CBSE affiliated schools, asking them to frame guidelines for safe and effective use of internet and digital technologies in schools and buses. The board has asked the schools to draft a policy on the safe use of electronic devices and implement it.

In the circular, the board has asked the schools to promote a safe and secure educational environment for effective teaching and learning and to discourage students from actions detrimental to themselves, their peers and the value system. The board has also asked the schools to avoid digital and video images of individual students or teachers on school websites for safety of children.

Regarding safety of children in buses, the schools have been told that they can provide a mobile phone to each school bus driver to deal with unprecedented emergency, but it should be of a basic model without any internet facility and data storage. “Schools are, thus, advised to take the measures to ensure that no inappropriate and illegal activity through IT enabled devices takes place in its premises and they should educate students for the safe and effective use of the internet and make children aware of the rule regarding usage of internet and display rules in this regard prominently,” the circular reads.

The board has also asked the schools to install effective firewalls, filtering and monitoring software mechanisms in all the computers and regularly review filtering and blocking policies and procedures.

Various types of unsolicited contents available on the internet must be blocked and computers should be configured with parental control filters or antivirus of appropriate standard and digital surveillance system must be deployed. The schools, however, have been asked to allow children access only per-selected websites appropriate to their age group.

Apart from these, the schools have been asked to sensitise parents about internet safety norms and they should take strict disciplinary action against those who attempt to bypass filtering or to access inappropriate or illegal material. The schools is also required to disable the usernames and passwords of those who leave the school promptly.

"After Donald Trump’s warning, Pakistan says it wants peace in Afghanistan","Highlighting Pakistan’s sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan has desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism. (File) Highlighting Pakistan’s sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan has desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism. (File)

Pakistan on Tuesday said that it wants peace in Afghanistan and pledged to work to eliminate terrorism, hours after US President Donald Trump’s stern warning to Islamabad over providing safe havens to terrorists.

A Foreign Office spokesman said US Ambassador David Hale met Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif this afternoon and briefed him about President Trump’s latest statement on the US policy review on South Asia and Afghanistan. “The Foreign Minister reiterated Pakistan’s perspective and desire for peace and stability in Afghanistan,” said the carefully worded statement from the Foreign Office.

Highlighting Pakistan’s sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Asif underlined Pakistan’s continued desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to announce his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to “agents of chaos” that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has “much to lose” by harbouring terrorists.

He also slammed Pakistan for its support to terror groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

During his meeting, Asif said that he had accepted US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s invitation to visit the US and looked forward to his early interactions in Washington.

Hale conveyed that Tillerson looked forward to meeting the foreign minister in the next few days to have an in-depth discussion on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new US policy on South Asia.

Second round of FCFS admissions today: Students with 60% marks too stand a chance,"Vacancies are highest in the Science faculty while seats in Arts and Commerce faculties are fewer, indicating the decreasing popularity of Science courses. File Vacancies are highest in the Science faculty while seats in Arts and Commerce faculties are fewer, indicating the decreasing popularity of Science courses. File

From 478 out of 500 which was the cut-off for the First Year Junior College (FYJC) admissions last year to 300 out of 500 in the second round of the first come first serve (FCFS) admissions taking place today (Wednesday), it is going to be a huge climbdown for the Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, the college with the highest cut-off marks for Class XI admissions in Pune.

But this situation is now not confined to the Laxmanrao Apte Prashala as the vacancy list for second round of the first-ever FCFS round by the Centralised Admission Process (CAP) shows vacant seats at most of the top colleges in the city. According to the rules of this round, the seat will now go to the first student who clicks on the online link where college availability is displayed. Since students scoring 60 per cent and above are eligible for this round, any student with scores above 300 will now be able to take these seats, most of whose cut-offs are 85-90 per cent and above.

A closer look at the list shows that the vacancies are highest in the Science faculty while seats in Arts and Commerce faculties are fewer in numbers, indicating the decreasing popularity of Science courses. At Fergusson College, no seats are available in the Arts English course while for Science, a total of 38 seats (aided and unaided) are available. Nowrosjee Wadia that had only 30 vacant seats in category I of FCFS for Science faculty admissions, now has 32 seats in Round II, thanks to cancellation of students. SP college has no seats in Arts English course but for Science faculty, a whopping 51 seats are available.

“It is probably the first time that we stand a real chance of getting students who have scored as less as 60 per cent marks. As a college, it doesn’t really matter as all students are welcome and can study here. But when one thinks of the bright students, who might have lost out on admissions for merely one per cent and took admission in a college they did not desire or as compromise, then one does feel bad. It is unfair to them,” said Teresa David, principal of L Apte Prashala.

College principals strongly feel the entire process is not doing justice to bright students who took admissions in previous rounds of CAP process. “The competition to get into the top colleges is so tough that many students lose out on just one or two marks. Imagine someone with higher percentage couldn’t get admission in earlier rounds due to a couple of marks and took admission elsewhere and now learns a student with at least 50 marks less is getting a seat here, is it fair to them? In a way, we are giving advantage to the students who created uncertainty till last round,” said Dilip Sheth, principal of SP College.

Meanwhile, as per the CAP schedule, Round II of FCFS will be conducted Wednesday in which any student with more than 60 per cent marks can participate.

Students have to log into the online CAP website and check vacancy at choice colleges. Once a student clicks on Apply Now, a seat will be allotted and he or she will have to pay fees on same day to confirm admissions.

(Source: File) The new coach, Jude Felix will train with the 33-member junior men’s team to defend their World Championship title. (Source: File)

Hockey India has appointed former captain Jude Felix Sebastian as the coach of the Indian junior men’s hockey team on Tuesday. The junior men’s team has recently performed well in Europe, which also included nine players from last year’s World Cup winning team.

The director of India’s High Performance, David John, has highlighted a point where he says that different programmes started by Hockey India, five-six years back, have helped in bringing more new talent and the junior players are giving their best to clinch their spot in the senior team.

The new coach Felix will train with the 33-member junior men’s team to defend their World Championship title. Expressing his views on Felix’s appointment, John said, “Jude Felix brings with him vast experience as former India captain as well as a highly reputed coach. Under him, we want to strengthen the junior core group.”

“With Hockey India’s programmes structured to bring good results in the 2020 and 2024 Olympic Games, I would expect players from this junior core group to push the seniors for a spot in the team,” he added.

While playing for the Indian team, Felix used to be an important half-back in the side. He also received Arjuna Award in 1995 while he was the captaining the side. His captaincy tenure included the 1993 World Cup and 1994 Asian Games.

He featured in more than 250 international matches, and has played for India in two World Cups and two Asian Games, in 1990 and 1994. He has also represented the country in three Champions Trophies, in the year 1985, 1987 and 1989. In 1997, he also coached the Netherlands U-18 team.

In 2014, Felix also assisted the head coach of the national team, “I am excited to take up this new role. The junior core group was picked on the basis of their performance in the National Championships and this group will be further pruned down to a 18-member squad for the Sultan of Johor Cup, our first international tournament for this year,” said Felix.

Trimming the edges: Before and after MCC’s bat regulation,"PTI Photo PTI Photo

Rule book

In Appendix E under this law, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodian of the laws of cricket, instructed that the bat length “shall not be more than 38 in/96.5 cm”. The width “shall not exceed 4.25 in/10.8 cm”. There was no mention about the depth, edges and weight.

When Jayasuriya played

There was little emphasis on the depth and edges. They all played with good pieces of wood alright, but the sweet spot was smaller and middling the ball and timing it well had been essential to get full value of the shots.

Maximum gains

As franchise-based T20 leagues became en vogue, power-hitters began to use bigger bats. David Warner, Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard and MS Dhoni commonly used bats with 45 mm or more edges, allowing top edges to go over the fence. The depth of Warner’s bat (Gray Nicolls Kaboom) in limited-overs cricket is usually 85 mm.

ICC shows concern

In February 2015, the ICC thought evaluating the dimensions of the modern bats, with its chief executive David Richardson expressing concern over the balance being shifted in favour of the batsmen. Ponting speaks up Last year, Ricky Ponting called for bat regulation. “The modern day bats and weight in particular; it’s just a completely different game,” he had said.

MCC responds

At the MCC World Cricket Committee meeting in Mumbai last year, the law-making body responded to growing concerns and took its first steps towards limiting bat dimensions. Then in March this year, they restricted the maximum dimensions to 108 mm in width, 67mm in depth with 40 mm edges. The ICC ratified it, saying the restrictions would come into effect from October 1 this year.

The Indian context

It will have negligible effect on Indian batsmen, as Kohli, Rohit, Dhawan, Rahane and KL Rahul are using the bat within the stipulated dimensions. Only Dhoni exceeds the limits in T20s.

"Left unguarded, man stabbed to death in police station","Anil with daughter Angel at her birthday party, Monday Anil with daughter Angel at her birthday party, Monday

A 34-year-old man was stabbed to death by his neighbour with a ‘file poker’ inside Ambedkar Nagar police station in the early hours of Tuesday. The victim, Anil, who drives an Eeco car for a living, had got into an altercation with his neighbour, Vishal (22), a peon, near their residence in Dakshinpuri around midnight.

The altercation snowballed into a physical confrontation when the accused, who was drunk, allegedly assaulted Anil, his wife Angelina Lovely, and Florence, Anil’s mother-in-law, with an iron rod. At 12.55 pm, Lovely made a PCR call.

The investigating officer, Brahm Prakash, who was on emergency duty, was assigned the call and deputed to the spot. He took Anil and Vishal to Ambedkar Nagar police station. “I stayed outside the police station. I kept telling police they should not put my husband and Vishal in the same room,” Lovely claimed. Lovely alleged that as she waited outside the station, one of Vishal’s relatives, Vicky, arrived with a group of men and told her that the “result of her actions will be seen in a while”.

Police said Vishal and Anil reached Ambedkar Nagar police station around 1.30 am and were initially taken to the duty officer’s room, where the duo quarrelled. Later, SI Brahm Prakash took them to the investigating officer’s room located on the first floor. Meanwhile, constable Ashok, who was supposed to stand guard, left the room unattended for two minutes as he was called by a duty officer to attend a call. When Ashok returned, he saw Vishal stabbing Anil with the ‘file poker’ used by the IO to punch holes in files. By the time the constable stopped Vishal, he had inflicted six puncture wounds on Anil’s neck, chest, abdomen and back.

Police rushed Anil to the AIIMS Trauma Centre in an autorickshaw, where doctors declared him brought dead. Lovely, however, alleged: “The police are lying. The incident lasted for 30 minutes.” The accused was arrested on the spot and, after recording Ashok’s statement, a murder case was slapped against him.

Taking stock of the negligence on the part of the police, the SHO of Ambedkar Nagar, Rakesh Kumar Sisodia, has been sent to district lines, while SI Brahm Prakash and constable Ashok have been placed under suspension. Anil is survived by his wife and three children — Angel (12), Sofia (6) and Aryan (2). After the murder was reported, locals from Dakshinpuri gathered outside Vishal’s house, where they damaged his bike and broke some flower pots.

NCP corporator seeks quality checks on mid-day meals in BMC-run schools,"Dr Saeeda Khan with the samples of mid-day meal Dr Saeeda Khan with the samples of mid-day meal

The humble dal-rice served as mid-day meal in civic schools roused strong protests at the education committee meeting of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday. Dr Saeeda Khan, NCP corporator from L ward (Kurla) alleged that mid-day meal served in BMC-run schools is unhygienic and should be tested.

Khan even carried samples of mid-day meal served at one of the BMC schools at Kurla to the meeting. The samples have been sent for testing at a laboratory. Khan has demanded a detailed probe into quality of food served in BMC-run schools. “During a round up in these schools, I found that the food served in these schools was not up to the mark and was unhygienic. I then carried sample of the food to prove my point at the meeting,” said Khan.

According to Khan, despite having a fixed weekly menu in all schools, many schools do not follow those. Khan added,”Apart from being unhygienic the food doesn’t seem to contain the required amount of proteins and vitamins. The dal was all watery, the puffed rice laddoo was all broken. Besides, on Tuesday the schools were supposed to serve “Matki chi usal” (curry made up of lentils and pulses). Quality check of mid-day meal served in all BMC schools should be conducted.”

Meanwhile, chairman of the Education Committee, Shubhada Gudekar, said, “The quality of the sample will be checked. The matter will be probed and those found guilty will not be spared.” Its been over two decades since mid-day meal (MDM) scheme was introduced in city schools. However, recently NGO Praja Foundation released data that revealed that one out of every three children studying in civic run schools in Mumbai is malnourished.

The data accessed by Praja Foundation through an RTI in May showed among screened students in BMC schools, the number of malnourished kids increased from 11,831 in 2013-14 to 53,408 in 2014-15 and further to 64,681 in 2015-16. As per the data, Kurla has 6,586 malnourished children in civic schools.

Mumbai worst

Following a review of the mid-day meal scheme across the state in February 2017, the Ministry of Human Resource Development pointed out poor coverage of the scheme in five districts of Maharashtra. Mumbai has, for the fourth consecutive year, topped the list of poorly performing districts vis-a-vis the mid-day meal, the report points out. Of the total 3,53,777 students enrolled in primary schools in the city, only 2,25,798 avail the mid-day meal scheme.

In the Paddy stubble management case, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has now summoned Secretary of Government of Punjab to be present on next date of hearing on September 1 after hearing the counsels for farmers and Punjab government. Tribunal wants to hear from the secretary of the government that what concrete steps are being taken by the government to manage straw.

In Punjab 197 lakh tonnes’ (19.7 Million tonnes) paddy stubble is produced annually and like wheat crop straw, paddy straw is not used to make fodder for cattle here. Now the government is asking farmers to attach’Super SMS’ (Straw Management System) which will cut and shred the straw at the time of harvesting of paddy only. But farmers are not ready for SMS fitment on the pretext that it is costly affair for them.

In Punjab only 45 lakh tonnes of paddy straw including nearly 25 lakh tonnes of Basmati rice crop, which is used to make fodder, is being managed currently and remaining 152 Lakh tonnes paddy straw is being burnt in fields.

The counsel of farmers IK Kapila informed the Tribunal that Punjab Government is simply issuing orders regarding to the attachment of the ‘Super SMS’ with the combine-harvesters but not doing anything substantial to help farmers in stopping crop residue burning.

Counsel Kapila said that none of other 4 states including Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi except Punjab is forcing farmers to fit super SMS with combine harvesters although Govt itself have admitted before Tribunal that it has withdrawn orders of January 4, 2017 making compulsory fitment of super SMS with combine harvesters.

“We informed the tribunal that farmers are fully supporting judgment of the tribunal banning crop residue burning but policies and action plan of Punjab Government is such that farmers are unable to meet the challenge of utilising about 20 days window before Rabi crops, which are sown in November, sowing due to reduced efficiency and almost double cost of super SMS which may lead to forced burning of crop residue by farmers in absence of facilities and incentives as directed by the tribunal,” said Advocate Kapila.

After such argument NGT summoned Secretary Punjab on September 1.

Director Punjab Agricultural JS Bains said that through they have already submitted the plan for Patiala district that how 23 lakh tonnes of paddy straw of that district would be managed by using in power plant, through stubble management machinery and same will be replicated in other districts.

Director Bains, said that they have explained their case in detail before the Tribunal and also trying to change the mentality of the farmers. He said that they are demanding Rs. 1602 crores for straw management machinery but centre is not ready to give this amount and even Punjab government has proposed Rs. 100 per incentive for per quintal paddy so as to manage the stubble but centre did not pay heed towards it too. “We are too for stopping the field fires but for that every one including farmers, combine manufacturers and centre government will have to do joint efforts as Punjab is a special case where rice is gown on nearly 29 lakh hectares land and its straw is not used for making cattle fodder.,” emphasised Director.

A senior scientist of Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, said, “no doubt that several straw chopping and spreading equipments are available in Punjab even before the proposal of ‘Super SMS’ fitment with harvester but there is no guarantee that every farmer will use this machinery after harvesting of paddy because state does not have large number of such machinery. But with the fitment of Super SMS with every harvester then every field of Punjab will have chopped straw, which can be managed easily after wards, at the time of harvesting only and it will be beneficial and cost effective in long run”.

Sandesh Jhingan is a fighter like me who loves to lead the side from the front: Stephen Constantine,"Indian football team coach Stephen Constantine and captain Sandesh Jhingan during a press conference in Mumbai. (Source: PTI) Indian football team coach Stephen Constantine and captain Sandesh Jhingan during a press conference in Mumbai. (Source: PTI)

India football coach Stephen Constantine is highly impressed with newly-appointed captain Sandesh Jhingan and feels he has what it takes to excel in the bigger league. Ahead of the tri-nation tournament fixture against St Kitts and Nevis, Constantine was full of praise for Jhingan.

“The captain has to reflect the character of the team. He has to set the tone of the team. Sandesh is a fighter like me who loves to lead the side from the front,” Constantine said. Jhingan had made his first India outing against Nepal, which was also Constantine’s first match as coach in his second term.

“Sandesh, to me, is a player who should be playing in a bigger league,” Constantine said.

India beat Mauritius 2-1 in Jhingan’s first match in charge but the skipper didn’t have much to say after the win. “Playing for your country is itself a great honour and here I am, leading my country,” he stated.

He has played a key role in the back-four with Anas Etathodika, Pritam Kotal, Narayan Das and Gurpreet Sandhu (in goal) and helped India create a new record of winning nine international matches on the trot. This also includes the unofficial fixture against Bhutan.

Very impressed with his new captain, Constantine said Jhingan could be identified as a leader after Sunil Chhetri calls it a day.

“In coming days, at least we can identify Sandesh as a leader once Sunil (Chhetri) hangs his boots,” Constantine said.

Chhetri to join camp

Chhetri, Gurpreet and Udanta Singh will be joining the national camp after Bengaluru FC’s AFC Cup stint. India have won both their matches in the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers and will now take on Macau, in Macau, on September 5.

"WWE Raw Results: Roman Reigns, John Cena form alliance","WWE Raw following SummerSlam saw John Cena shift to the red brand. (Source: WWE) WWE Raw following SummerSlam saw John Cena shift to the red brand. (Source: WWE)

In his first WWE Raw appearance in over a year, John Cena found an ally – an unlikely buddy – in Roman Reigns and the duo came together to get the better of Samoa Joe and The Miz in an incredible Raw main event following an extremely physical WWE SummerSlam event on Sunday night. The Monday night event at the same venue in New York was also a stage to more Brock Lesnar and Braun Strowman brutality. The massive Strowman continued his physical assault on Lesnar – not a small feat by any stretch of imagination – and set on course a huge WWE Universal Championship match at No Mercy.

WWE Raw General Manager Kurt Angle had been promising a big-name Superstar to come to the red brand and the name couldn’t have been bigger than John Cena. The Superstar walked in as a free agent and made his intentions clear – he wanted to go at Reigns following their numerous multi-athlete matches and Twitter spats. He wanted a one-on-one. But before his wishes could be filled, The Miz’s music blared and he questioned why the two were afforded marquee moments at his expense.

But what happened next came as a surprise to one and all. Instead of a possible, and likely, The Miz vs John Cena clash, Cena offered a team-up with Reigns to take on The Miz and any of his Miztourage members. But as it turned out, Samoa Joe threw his hat in the ring and made his presence felt immediately with a surprise punch to Cena to welcome him to the brand. What followed was a brawl from which Cena and Reigns came out safely.

In the main event of the night, things didn’t go The Miz’s way of getting a winning end. In fact, he became the pinned Superstar in the tag team match despite the uneasy alliance between Cena and Reigns. Cena, meanwhile, applied the Attitude Adjustment when The Miz took too long for his finishing move of Skull-Crushing Finale.

Geoffrey Boycott apologises after racist remarks,"Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the best defensive batsman of his generation, played for Yorkshire from 1962-1986 and had a stint as county captain. (Source: Express File) Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the best defensive batsman of his generation, played for Yorkshire from 1962-1986 and had a stint as county captain. (Source: Express File)

Former England legendary batsman Geoffrey Boycott has apologised after making racist remarks where he suggested he needed to ‘black up’ to get a knighthood. He made the crass comment to VIP guests at the day-night Test against West Indies in Edgbaston. But he has since apologised on Twitter by ‘apologise unreservedly’ for his comments. Among the 11 West Indian cricketers knighted are Sir Curtly Ambrose, Sir Garfield Sobers and Sir Viv Richards.

At a Q&A session during a break in play at Edgbaston on Saturday, the BCC Test Match Special Commentator said knighthoods were handed out like “confetti” to West Indies greats.

Boycott told Sky Sports presenter Gary Newbon, hosting the session: “Mine’s been turned down twice. I’d better black me face.” It was followed by an uneasy silence at a gathering in Birmingham where diners, including several black guests, had paid nearly £300 each for a luxury hospitality package.

Waheed Saleem, who was in the audience of the Q&A when Boycott made the remarks, told BBC Sport: “I was completely disgusted. I don’t think anyone saw it as a light-hearted joke. I was absolutely gobsmacked.”

Following the condemnation, Boycott tweeted, “Speaking at an informal gathering I was asked a question and I realise my answer was unacceptable. I meant no offence but what I said was clearly wrong and I apologise unreservedly. I have loved West Indian cricket my whole life and have the utmost respect for its players,” he wrote in three part tweets.

The European Commission has started an in-depth investigation of Bayer’s planned $66 billion takeover of US seeds group Monsanto, saying it was worried about competition in pesticide and seeds markets. The merger would create the world’s largest integrated pesticides and seeds company, the Commission said, adding this limited the amount of competitors selling herbicides and vegetable seeds in Europe.

“The Commission has preliminary concerns that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition in a number of different markets resulting in higher prices, lower quality, less choice and less innovation,” the European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Germany’s Bayer said it still aimed to have the transaction approved by the end of the year.

“Bayer looks forward to continuing to work constructively with the Commission with a view to obtaining the Commission’s approval,” the company said in a statement. Bayer had previously offered commitments aimed at easing the EU’s antitrust concerns over the deal with Monsanto, but the company declined to say what was proposed.

If approved, the deal would be the third large tie-up in the agrochemicals sector but other companies also had to offer concessions to win over regulators. Dow secured regulatory clearance to acquire DuPont only after pledging to sell key research and development activities and other major assets.

And ChemChina had to sell a large chunk of its subsidiary Adama’s pesticide, herbicides and insecticides business, its seed treatment products for cereals and sugar beet and a substantial part of its plant growth regulator business for cereals to win EU approval to buy Syngenta. The Commission said it was working with regulators in other markets, such as the Unted States, Australia and Brazil to vet the Bayer-Monsanto deal.

Bayer offered to sell its Liberty crop chemical, also known as glufosinate, and canola and cotton seeds that resist the chemical’s plant-killing effect to get approval for the deal from South African regulators. The proposed tie-up has also hit a raw nerve with some environmental activists who fear such a combination would hurt farmers and consumers.

US based campaign group Avaaz said it had submitted a petition with one million signatures to Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, calling on her to block the deal. “Over a million people are calling on her to block the merger from hell,” said Avaaz legal director Nick Flynn. The Commission said it would asses the deal only from a competition perspective.

"For women whose lives were derailed by triple talaq, verdict brings hope","In Mumbai and Delhi, for members of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, it was time to rejoice. In Mumbai and Delhi, for members of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, it was time to rejoice.

For Farhad (full name withheld), the Supreme Court verdict has come a fortnight late. Her husband, a helper at Ajmer dargah, sent her a letter with triple talaq in August first week, nine years after their marriage. On Tuesday, the 26-year-old wept, resolving to challenge the divorce following the SC’s verdict, which labelled instant triple talaq against the tenets of Islam. “She had had a love marriage but continued to hide it from her family for several years. He would often visit her from Ajmer, but never took her to his home as his wedded wife.

When her family finally came to know and pressured him to take her, he wrote a letter giving her triple talaq,” said Nirmal Hafeez, a member of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, who has come across 108 cases where women were allegedly given arbitrary verbal or written talaq by their husbands.

Farhad was also forced to undergo abortion, because her husband, a member of her extended family, did not want the baby. According to her, he would visit her in Mumbai and take her out to restaurants, but never publicly accepted her as his wife. Like Farhad, Shabnam Adil Khan (29) is happy the SC struck down the age-old practice.

“Whatever is written in shariat must be followed. I am against the concept of men divorcing their wives through WhatsApp or oral communication. Where is the sanctity of marriage in this?” she said. Shabnam was married in January 2015 to Adil Khan. She realised he already had a wife and two daughters after marriage. “My father was forced to give Rs 2 lakh in dowry. On the night of the wedding, all my jewellery was taken away,” she says. For the past two years, Khan has been living in fear of divorce after Adil allegedly threatened her with triple talaq.

“His first wife has filed a case against him. He lives in Saudi Arabia now and I live with my parents. I have been beaten up so many nights, my screams would have no effect on him. He was always drunk,” she said. Her husband has stopped calling her, and she was worried that any day, he would announce the dreaded word thrice and it would all be over. “But with this verdict, women like me have hope,” Khan said. Triple Talaq verdict: Activists welcome Supreme Court decision. Click here to read.

Following the Tuesday verdict, Hasina Khan, founder of Bebaak Collective, said, “This is the first time that judgement in a Muslim-related issue has been taken on the basis of the Constitution. We are hopeful that a law will soon come in on this. We are very happy. This will help several women fight for their rights.”

Shabina Kaleem (26), whose husband left her after verbally divorcing her, says, “Islam should be followed and I do not want to do anything that goes against it. I was divorced and my husband believed Islam permits triple talaq, but it is against the concept of Islam. I am glad the court took this decision.”

In Mumbai and Delhi, for members of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, it was time to rejoice. The convener of Maharashtra branch of the organisation, Khatoon Shaikh, is now 60. “I have been fighting for this for eight years now. I never saw such a clear judgement on this issue before,” Shaikh said, adding that they plan to take up issues of polygamy and ban on adoption of children with the Parliament now to frame laws. “The court has given the government six months to frame a law. We will keep following up with it to take the issue to its logical end,” Shaikh added.

One militant has been killed in an ongoing gunbattle in a forest in Higinkote in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district, close to the LoC. Officials said at least three militants could be hiding in the area, which is part of Hafrada forest that is used by militants to get in infiltrators. They said Rashtriya Rifles and the Special Operation Group of J&K police launched an operation after they spotted militants in the forest area.

An Army spokesperson said the encounter is underway and one militant has been killed so far. A senior police officer said, “There was information about the presence of three to four militants in the forest area. Since this area is part of a dense forest, forces are moving cautiously.’’

Pakistan Army chief asks US to respect and acknowledge their contributions,"While announcing America’s new Afghanistan and South Asia policy – which calls for greater US troop deployment and Indian involvement in Afghanistan – Trump had hit out at Pakistan for offering sanctuaries to “agents of chaos.”(Representational Image) While announcing America’s new Afghanistan and South Asia policy – which calls for greater US troop deployment and Indian involvement in Afghanistan – Trump had hit out at Pakistan for offering sanctuaries to “agents of chaos.”(Representational Image)

Pakistan is not seeking material or financial help from the US, but Washington must trust and treat it with respect, Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa today told the US envoy here, a day after President Trump asked Islamabad to stop providing safe havens to terrorists. While announcing America’s new Afghanistan and South Asia policy – which calls for greater US troop deployment and Indian involvement in Afghanistan – Trump had hit out at Pakistan for offering sanctuaries to “agents of chaos.”

The US Ambassador David Hale met Gen. Bajwa at the Army’s Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the latter was briefed on the US’s new South Asia policy announced by President Trump, according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations – the Pakistani military’s media wing. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations,” the US president had said.

Responding to the invective, Gen. Bajwa said: “We are not looking for any material or financial assistance from the US, but trust, understanding and [an] acknowledgment of our contributions.”

According to the ISPR statement, the Pakistan Army chief highlighted the importance of peace in Afghanistan for Pakistan and highlighted the efforts made by the country. He added that such efforts were “not [meant] to appease anyone but [were taken] in line with [Pakistan’s] national interest and policy,” the ISPR statement said.

Gen. Bajwa further said that collaboration between all stakeholders in the key to bringing the war in Afghanistan to its logical conclusion, the statement said. Hale said that the US values Pakistan’s role in the “War against Terror” and seeks the country’s cooperation in resolving the Afghan issue, the statement added.

The US ambassador had similarly briefed Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif yesterday on Washington’s new policy and statements made by Trump regarding Pakistan. During the meeting, Asif had told the envoy that Pakistan would continue to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

"Steve O’Keefe was excellent in India but we’ve decided to go with Ashton Agar, says Darren Lehmann","Ashton Agar was also a part of the Australia Test squad for India series earlier this year. (Source: File) Ashton Agar was also a part of the Australia Test squad for India series earlier this year. (Source: File)

Ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh in Mirpur, Australia’s left arm spinner, Ashton Agar, is most likely to feature in the starting eleven as coach Darren Lehmann is planning to include two spinners for the first match. If he players, it will be Agar’s first Test in four years. Agar made his debut in Tests against England in the 2013 Ashes series. He performed well with the bat in the two Tests.

Speaking to the reporters, Australia’s coach, Darren Lehmann said, “We obviously haven’t played too much, so we’re fairly settled in where we want to go. That decision will be made later, once we start to have a look at the Test wicket and the conditions. Most likely, I think we’ll play two spinners.”

Nathan Lyon will be spearheading Australia’s spin bowling attack and Agar has a great chance of accompanying Lyon for a twin spin combination as Steve O’Keefe was dropped out of the team. Another youngster, Mitchell Swepson, who is yet to make his debut for Australia, might have to wait for some more time.

Agar was also a part of the Australia Test squad for India series, earlier this year, but was left out of the playing eleven. Left arm spinner O’Keefe showed great form with the ball, picking up 19 wickets in the series, which included 12 in the first Test in Pune. Recently, O Keefe paid the price for his inappropriate behaviour towards a female cricketer at an award ceremony in April and was dropped from the squad for the Bangladesh series.

“Steven was excellent over there but we’ve decided to go with Ashton. He’s got the all-round game and hopefully he’ll take it to the next level so if we wanted to play three quicks he could bat up the order, for example. He gives us a lot of flexibility in that way.”

He added: “Young Swepson is a good prospect as a leg-spinner … it’s really tight between all the spinners but Ashton himself has batted really well, he’s a gun fielder and he’s got his length right with the ball.”

Australia cancelled their two-day practice match on Monday due to contaminated water and recent flooding at the ground. The first Test begins on Sunday, followed by the second and final Test in Chittagong.

IIT-Kharagpur accepts whistleblower professor’s resignation,"IIT-Kharagpur is learnt to have accepted the resignation of Rajeev Kumar — a professor who had exposed flaws in the Joint Entrance Examination. Last month, before demitting office, President Pranab Mukherjee had quashed the compulsory retirement imposed on Kumar in 2014.

Kumar had filed a PIL in Supreme Court seeking transparency in the IIT JEE, which eventually played a crucial role in IITs introducing several changes, including permitting examinees to take back a carbon copy of their answer scripts. He was hailed as an “unsung hero” by the apex court.

The IIT-Kharagpur administration had suspended him in May 2011 after accusing him of “damaging the reputation of the institute” by levelling allegations on issues ranging from irregularities in the purchase of laptops to rampant copying by students during examinations.

The inquiry instituted against him found him guilty and in 2014 the institute decided to impose compulsory retirement on him. Kumar approached Delhi High Court against the decision and also appealed to the President alleging bias.

Kumar, who was on leave from IIT-Kharagpur for two years, joined Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Once his leave expired, IIT-Kharagpur asked him to report back to work but Kumar requested that his resignation be accepted so that he can join JNU permanently. The request was turned down on the ground that Kumar’s case is still being heard in court. Meanwhile, JNU relieved him of his job.

Kumar is learnt to have asked JNU to reinstate him as his resignation has been accepted by IIT-Kharagpur. The university has not acted on his request. JNU Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar did not respond to a call and SMS by The Indian Express on Sunday.

Finance Ministry modifies cash management system to include post-GST changes,"In line with the new dates for GST inflows, the finance ministry has asked other ministries/departments to ensure that big releases of Rs 200-2,000 crore are kept between 21st and 25th of a month to “take advantage of GST inflows”.

(Source: PTI Photo)

The finance ministry has modified the cash management system of the Central government to incorporate the change in date of tax receipts arising out of the new indirect tax regime of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In an office memorandum, the finance ministry has asked all financial advisers of all departments and ministries to send a monthly/quarterly expenditure plan to the Budget division of the ministry within two weeks of passage of their detailed demand for grants in Parliament.

In line with the new dates for GST inflows, the finance ministry has asked other ministries/departments to ensure that big releases of Rs 200-2,000 crore are kept between 21st and 25th of a month to “take advantage of GST inflows”. Earlier, the range of dates for such releases was kept between 8th and 21st of a month.

The finance ministry has also asked other departments/ministries to keep bulk expenditure items of over Rs 2,000 crore to be timed in the last month of each quarter to utilise the direct tax inflows in June, September, December and March. “The releases (more than Rs 2,000 crore) may be kept within 17th and 25th in these months,” the memorandum said. Prior permission from Budget division of finance ministry shall be a prerequisite for any single payment release in excess of Rs 5,000 crore, it said.

The finance ministry said that monthly/quarterly expenditure plan form the basis of cash forecast and preparation of indicative calendar for government borrowings. “Deviations from monthly/quarterly expenditure plan may result into distortions in the cash planning by Government of India with multiple negative implications including increased cost of borrowing and hence would be viewed seriously,” it said.

The monthly expenditure plan would form the basis of quarterly expenditure plan and departments/ministries will not be allowed to release payment beyond quarterly expenditure plan (equal to sum of monthly expenditure plans within that quarter) without prior consent of the Budget division. “Practice of expenditure beyond quarterly expenditure plan without prior approval of Secretary (Expenditure) would be viewed adversely,” it said.

Savings, if any, incurred during quarterly expenditure plan would not be available for automatic carry forward to the next quarter, without revalidation of such savings by the Budget division for the next quarter through modification in quarterly expenditure plan, it said.

Not more than 33 per cent and 15 per cent of expenditure of Budget estimates shall be permissible respectively in the last quarter and last month of the financial year. “The restriction shall be observed both scheme-wise as well as for Demand for Grants as whole,” it said.

Liking different brands can make partners unhappy: Study,"If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images) If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

It may not seem like a big deal whether your partner prefers Coke or Pepsi, but scientists suggest that liking different brands can affect our happiness in relationships more than shared interests or personality traits.

“People think compatibility in relationships comes from having similar backgrounds, religion or education,” said Gavan Fitzsimons, a professor at Duke University in the US.

“But we find those things don’t explain how happy you are in life nearly as much as this notion of brand compatibility,” said Fitzsimons.

The researchers found that partners who had low power in their relationships – those who do not feel they can shape their partner’s behaviour – tend to find themselves stuck with their partner’s preferred brands.

“If you are lower in relationship power and have different brand preferences than your partner, you’re probably going to find yourself stuck with your partner’s favourite brands, over and over again. This could lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts feeling,” said Danielle Brick, now at the University of New Hampshire.

“Most couples won’t break up over brand incompatibility, but it leads to the low power partner becoming less and less happy,” said Brick.

Studies in several settings produced the same result. The researchers used brand preferences in soda, coffee, chocolate, beer and automobiles to study individuals and couples, some of whom were tracked over two years.

These results were combined with findings on relationship power and happiness.

Brick said it is likely these brand compatibility effects have steadily gained strength as brands have evolved to play a bigger role in the daily lives of consumers.

However, they are not given the same weight as other relationship-influencing factors because they are not seen as significant.

“If you are a different religion than your romantic partner, you know that if this is an issue you can’t work through, then the relationship isn’t going to last,” Brick said.

“Conversely, if you like Coke and your partner likes Pepsi, you’re probably not going to break up over it – but 11 years into a relationship, when he or she keeps coming home with Pepsi, day in and day out, it might start to cause a little conflict,” she said.

“If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy,” she added.

The research was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

She is no slouch when it comes to her performances on-screen and definitely not one when it comes to staying fit. The Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor has worked really hard to get the toned body she has today with the help of celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. According to reports, she weighed around 67kg when she was 17 and lost around 16kg in just three months when she was shortlisted for her debut film Student of the Year.

Today, all of 24, the actress can often be seen sharing inspirational workout videos with her followers on Instagram, documenting her journey in a way. From working out on the Pilates machine Cadillac to the extremely difficult back-bend bridge, handstand, crunches and Jack Rabbit, she does it all. This beauty doesn’t like repeating workouts, so Karachiwala has her hitting different machines like the corealign, reformer, Wunda chair, step barrel and the Bodhi suspension system.

As far as her diet is concerned, she has a major sweet tooth and is a fan of Pooja Dhingra’s Le 15 Patisserie and Chef Kelvin Cheung’s delectable cakes, but she is also a stickler for discipline and probably that’s what helps her the most.

Bhatt also believes in eating everything in moderation. Recently, she teamed up with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar for a Facebook live session, in which she talked about her body secrets. Shattering the concept of following the online food trends, she said, “Everyone’s talking about gluten-free pizza, brown bread, and red rice, about reducing their carb intake, and I’m eating white bread and butter at 4am. Rujuta showed me how local food eaten in moderation can be healthy.”

In the past, she has even shared photos of her enjoying bread on Instagram, which is a no-no for fitness freaks. “Who knew a piece of malt bread with avocado, tomatoes and a poached egg would make me so happy?,” she wrote.

"PCB does U-turn, allows players to return to CPL, county cricket","Mohammad Amir plays for Essex. (Source: Express Archive) Mohammad Amir plays for Essex. (Source: Express Archive)

Pakistan Cricket Board sprung another surprise on Monday when it allowed the players recalled from the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and counties in England to return to the competitions. This comes after they had abruptly called its players back to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Lahore.

According to an ESPNcricinfo report, the main reason for the U-turn is though to be that postponement of the National T20 Cup which will now be played in November. But, the players still have to undergo fitness tests from August 22 to 24 before returning to their franchises in West Indies and England.

“The World XI series was not officially confirmed when we set the dates for our domestic tournament,” Sethi said in a press conference. “That series falls right in the middle of when our competition would have been played. Then there’s a by-election [on September 17 on the seat of now-disqualified prime minister Nawaz Sharif], and after that the team has to go to the UAE, so the competition was squeezed out. As a result, we have moved it to November. An added advantage of this arrangement is that our players who are taking part in the CPL and other county will be able to take full part in those tournaments. This will make the players happy too, as well as the CPL.”

Ten Pakistan players play in the CPL and will now have to play back after August 24. The PCB had even recalled three non-centrally contracted players. Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir and Mohammad Sami, the three players with no central contract, now fly back to West Indies.

The three players in the English counties were Mohammad Amir, playing for Essex until September, Sarfraz Ahmed, playing for Yorkshire in the Natwest T20 Blast, and Fakhar Zaman, set to join Somerset.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Fazel Atrachali playing with dislocated bone, says Gujarat Fortunegiants physiotherapist Olivia Witek","Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand. Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand.

Gujarat Fortunegiants may have been dealt a blow after a dream run at home in their debut season of Pro Kabaddi. Their star defender and vice-captain Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand.

“Fazel is going through a tough time as he has a dislocated bone in his right hand,” said Gujarat Fortunegiants chief physiotherapist Olivia Witek. “During the match, it hurts him a lot but we are giving him painkillers,” Olivia said.

When asked about who could be a potential replacement for Fazel if the condition deteriorates, Olivia said, “We can’t put Fazel out of the match. If Fazel is out then the entire team is out. He is one of our key players.”

In nine matches, Fazel has made 19 successful tackles. While the Iranian has been rock solid in the left corner, he has got support from compatriot Abozar Mighuani. The Fazel-Abozar pair has scored 43 tackle points.

Gujarat will next play U Mumba on August 29 at the NSCI SVP Stadium in Mumbai, giving the 25-year old a well earned seven-day break to recover. “We at least need one month to completely heal his injury. But with such a tight schedule, we are giving him painkillers and injections whenever there is discomfort,” she added.

Fazel is the only player in the history of Pro Kabaddi to lift the coveted trophy with two different teams – season 2 with U Mumba and season 4 with Patna Pirates.

Gujarat Fortunegiants are the only team in the fifth season, who were unbeaten at home. Their first match at Ahmedabad ended in a win over U Mumba. There after, they went on to register wins over Dabang Delhi, Jaipur Pink Panthers, Bengaluru Bulls and Telugu Titans.

Gujarat Fortunegiants concluded their home leg with a 26-26 draw against Bengal Warriors. They top the Zone A rankings after six wins from nine games.

"Watch: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Karisma Kapoor wish luck to Aadar Jain for his debut film Qaidi Band","Aadar Jain’s film Qaidi Band releases on August 25. Aadar Jain’s film Qaidi Band releases on August 25.

Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor’s cousin Aadar Jain’s debut film Qaidi Band is all set to hit the screens on August 25. While the debutant is receiving wishes from Bollywood insiders, even his cousins Kareena and Karisma are doing all that it takes to ensure people give him a chance at the box office. The Kapoor sisters shot a short video for Aadar and asked their fans to welcome the debutant. They said, “We are very excited our cousin Aadar Jain is being launched in Yash Raj’s new film Qaidi Band. We are super excited, super nervous but I know you are going to do us proud. You are going to be fantastic. Guys, show him and his entire crew a lot of love.”

Qaidi Band revolves around seven innocent under-trials, and their journey towards freedom. The film also marks his co-star Anya Singh’s debut. While Aadar has a Kapoor connect, Anya does not have any sort of backing in the industry.

A few years ago, Aadar’s brother Armaan Jain also tried his hands at acting but the film tanked at the box office. But it seems Aadar is prepared for any outcome.

“When Armaan’s film didn’t do as we had expected it to do, of course, it was a frustrating time in the family like how it would be if anybody’s film wouldn’t do well, but now he is back to talking to a lot of producers and he is going to be doing something very soon. Apart from Armaan, both my cousins Ranbir and Kareena had their first few films which didn’t work, but what I have learnt from them is that we need to pick ourselves up, you can’t let an unsuccessful start bog you down,” said the actor to indianexpress.com in an interview earlier.

The film, which is being produced by YRF, is directed by Habib Faisal.

Annabelle Creation movie review: This Conjuring spin-off disappoints,"Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie. Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie.

Annabelle Creation movie cast: Miranda Otto, Stephanie Sigman, Anthony LaPaglia, Lulu Wilson

Annabelle Creation movie director: David Sandberg

Annabelle Creation movie rating: 2 stars

PARENTS frightened of their own child have sustained many a horror film. A malevolent spirit in a child’s doll many others. We needn’t look further than even The Conjuring, of which Annabelle: Creation is the fourth spin-off, and the prequel to a prequel. Yeah, by now, they should have this pat down. Annabelle: Creation has all that, plus a desolate house, orphans, nun, a mysterious woman behind a curtain, a forbidden door, a scarecrow, a barn, a basement, a chair lift, a lift hidden behind a wall, a well, and lots and lots of dolls. Who needs a story, or even one character that does things besides opening strange doors?

Sometime in the early 1940s, a doll-maker and his wife, Samuel (LaPaglia) and Esther (Otto) Mullins, lose their young daughter to an accident. They sequester themselves in their old, rickety farmhouse, away from all civilization, along with their grief, the doll Annabelle (named after their daughter) and “something else”. Twelve years later, to this house arrives a nun (Sigman) with six girls, her wards at an orphanage that has shut down. One of the girls, Janice (Bateman), is polio-afflicted, and left on her own by the other girls, starts exploring the house with its many secrets and strange happenings.

Then the happenings never cease, with director Sandberg (Lights Out) deploying largely the same tricks. The questions we want answered are never asked. So, we know nothing of the nun, but for the titillating detail that she was once at a “Romania convent where the other sisters have no contact with the outside world”; nothing about the girls, of varying ages and desires, and some more interesting than the others, stuck together; and almost zero about the couple who have put them in harm’s way. The actors, with the exception of Bateman, and that largely because she is the star victim this time, are largely impassive.

One thing is clear though, we are not done with Annabelle yet. The photo the nun shows of her Romania convent has a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows. Up next in The Conjuring series is Nun.

Wrestling World Championships: India eye their 12th medal in Paris,"Bajrang won gold medal at Asian Championships. (Source: Express photo) Bajrang won gold medal at Asian Championships. (Source: Express photo)

Starting Monday, 24 Indian wrestlers will be in action in Paris at the Wrestling World Championships. The wrestlers will be competing in the three categories — Greco-Roman, Freestyle and Women’s Freestyle — with eight wrestlers in each category.

In the men’s freestyle, India’s biggest medal hope will be Bajrang Punia who recently won the Asian Championship gold medal at the 65kg. But, more than him, it will be Sakshi Malik who will be a strong contender to medal at the World Championships.

At the Senior Asian Championships in New Delhi, Sakshi lost her final bout to settle for silver at 60kg category. This was her first major competition since winning the historic bronze medal at the Rio Olympics in 58kg category. The move up a category doesn’t do all good to her.

She has to face Rio Olympic gold medallist at 63kg Risako Kawai in that category. Sakshi had lost her final at Asian Championships against her and the Worlds can be another challenge for her.

For Bajrang, the 65kg category brings a lot of hope to medal. The 2013 World bronze medallist has a chance to become India’s first ever multi-Worlds medallist by winning a medal in Paris. For that, he has to overcome challenges of Franklin Gomez of Puerto Rico, Zurabi Iakobishvili of Georgia, Magomedmurad Gadzhiev of Poland, Alan Gogaev of Russia and Zain Rutherford of USA.

This field is weaker that what he could have actually got. Rio gold medallist Sosalan Ramonov is absent due to injury, silver medallist Toghrul Asgarov is banned for one-year while the two bronze medallists — Frank Chamizo and Ikhtiyor Nuvruzov — have decided to compete in 70kg.

Back to the women’s freestyle, another medal hope will be Vinesh Phogat. She was injured in her quarter-final in Rio but can look forward to make amends in Paris. She is back in her preferred 48kg category. But, she has Yui Susaki of Japan as the main contender. The 17-year-old is a three-time cadet world champ and has won all three tournaments she has taken part at the senior level.

Now, Sandeep Tomar has an outside chance in the 57kg men’s freestyle category. There are some big names missing from the field in this category but Tomar still needs to be at the top of his game to win a medal here.

As far as Greco-Roman is concerned, India have only won a bronze medal in the history of the competition. Sandeep Yadav won the medal in Budapest four years back. This year, a medal looks highly improbable but a surprise won’t be bad for India’s wrestling fans.

Here are the 24 wrestlers who will take part in the Senior World Championships at Paris from August 21 to 26.

Men’s Freestyle: Sandeep Tomar (57kg), Harphool (61kg), Bajrang Punia (65kg), Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg), Deepak (86kg), Satywart Kadiyan (97kg), Sumit (125kg).

Women’s wrestling: Vinesh Phogat (48kg), Sheetal Tomar (53kg), Lalita Sehrawat (55kg), Pooja Dhanda (58kg), Sakshi Malik (60kg), Shilpi Sheoran (63kg), Navjot Kaur (69kg), Pooja (75kg).

Greco-Roman: Gyanender (59kg), Ravinder (66kg), Yogesh (71kg), Gurpreet Singh (75kg), Harpreet Singh (80kg), Ravinder Khatri (85kg), Hardeep (98kg), Naveen (130kg).

Mauritius face St Kitts and Nevis in second tri-nation game,"Led by skipper Kevin Bru, the Mauritian side would need to improve their defence. (Source: File) Led by skipper Kevin Bru, the Mauritian side would need to improve their defence. (Source: File)

After a 1-2 loss to hosts India, Mauritius face another higher-ranked side in St Kitts and Nevis in their second and final league match in the tri-nation tournament in Mumbai on Tuesday.

Mauritius coach Francisco Filho had said that he would like to see his team play an aggressive football like they had done against India in the first half of their match on Saturday, when they scored a goal in the 15th minute.

Ranked 160th in the FIFA chart, Mauritius also need to maintain the aggression and not provide an opportunity to their opponents to get into the game.

Led by skipper Kevin Bru, the Mauritian side would need to improve their defence, which was breached by the Indian side to net couple of goals.

The side mostly attacked the Indian goalpost from the left in their previous game and can adopt a similar approach in their second outing tomorrow.

South American side St Kitts and Nevis, who are 125th ranked in the FIFA chart, would like to start the tournament on a winning note before they play India on August 24.

Coached by Passy Jacques, they had registered a 2-1 win against Barbados in their last friendly in May.

Vans To Avert Terror Attacks: ‘Parakram’ call goes out to 41 women officers from Northeast,"400 people, including 134 women from Northeastern states, were inducted into the Delhi Police in 2016. (Express Archive) 400 people, including 134 women from Northeastern states, were inducted into the Delhi Police in 2016. (Express Archive)

Soon, women commandos from the Northeastern states will be deployed inside “Parakram” vans, launched for anti-terror and other operations warranting armed response. The commandos, who will be trained by officers from the National Security Guard (NSG), Special Cell and other security agencies, will be deployed in the vans launched in May to avert terror attacks, police sources said Tuesday.

Under a Special Recruitment Drive, which was facilitated after a government order to the police following a series of hate crimes in the city, 400 people from Northeastern states were inducted into the Delhi Police force in 2016. Of them, 134 were women. Among them, 41 women were imparted the commando course at the Police Training College in Jharoda Kalan. During the course, they were taught how to shoot with weapons such as AK 47, carbines, pistols, revolvers, LmG and SaF rifles and glock pistols. The women were deployed at Red Fort on Independence Day.

However, sources said selection for the Parakram vans will be based on the willingness of the candidates. Whoever completes two years at Parakram can choose what posting they want later, sources said. “Those who are selected for Parakram will get an advanced commando training, specially to counter terror attack-like situations. They have to be preemptive and soft. They have to understand the situation and react instantly. Therefore, we will also impart them knowledge about vulnerable areas and buildings,” said Special Commissioner of Police (operations) Dependra Pathak, adding that high-end equipment will be used to train them further.

In May this year, Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik had flagged off 10 Parakram vans, which are at present stationed at Vijay Chowk, Palika Bazar, IP Marg, Select Citywalk Mall in Saket, Vasant Kunj Mall, Pacific Mall in Subhash Nagar, Netaji Subhash Place market and mall complex, Akshardham Temple, Lotus Temple and Jhandewalan.

Before Independence Day, 15 more vans were launched by the Police Control Room (PCR) unit of Delhi Police. The vehicles are GPRS-enabled and are fitted with pan-Delhi wireless communication. Each van is manned by an NSG-trained driver, an in-charge and three commandos. The contingent of commandos also comprises nine women.

"Didn’t get promised villas as part of 2011 World Cup winners, says Harbhajan Singh after real estate firm’s insolvency","Harbhajan Singh defended claims by Twitter users that they received free real estate gifts. (Source: Express Photo) Harbhajan Singh defended claims by Twitter users that they received free real estate gifts. (Source: Express Photo)

Harbhajan Singh has hit back at home buyers who accused him and former India captain MS Dhoni of getting their due properties from real estate firms while many people have seen their funds and property liquified having invested in projects. The two cricketers were the faces of some of the real estate projects and like previous examples of PR crisis, the companies failed to deliver on their promises. It has thus brought into question the brand endorsers too – in this case Harbhajan and Dhoni. Dhoni had pulled out of promoting a real estate company last year after they failed to deliver on their promises.

Some of the people who had invested into the schemes took dig at Harbhajan and the bowler did not take too kindly to the allegations.

One user wrote, “amrapalifraud @msdhoni n @harbhajan_singh sir aap logon ka villa to mil gya free mein. Humhare to paise bhi doob rahe hai @avhflatbuyers (Sir you are getting villas for free while we are losing money),” on Twitter.

In response, Harbhajan said: “Bhai tujhe kisne bola hamme villas mil Gaye hai? thenga Mila hamme.Bawakoof banaya gaya. Hamare naam ko use karke public k paise mare Gaye hai (who told you we got villas? We got nothing. We were fooled and our names were used to make money from the public).”

Bhai tujhe kisne bola hamme villas mil Gaye hai?thenga Mila hamme.Bawakoof banaya gaya.Hamare naam ko use karke public k paise mare Gaye hai http://t.co/ro3VZ7i3ID — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) 22 August 2017

Meanwhile another user alleged Dhoni was a ‘good friend’ of the company boss, so Harbhajan should not lie. The India spinner replied, “He could be his friend but not mine.. so you better ask him not me.. use ur brain if u have thoda sa bi”.

He could be his friend but not mine.. so you better ask him not me.. use ur brain if u have thoda sa bi http://t.co/LMs3hfsAcH — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) 22 August 2017

The same firm had allegedly promised to gift villas to the 2011 World Cup winning team which also included Harbhajan. However the off spinner later claimed that no villas were ever given. And the spinner wasn’t done as he continued his replies the next day too. He reiterated that the players didn’t receive any villas – as was promised.

Money ?For what ?who gave me ?? I wasn’t a brand ambassador for Amrapali.They promised villas to World Cup winning team but diya kya👎😜😜 http://t.co/8AfqTik8h2 — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) 23 August 2017

"Down in jungleland: A cow and bull story, or how not to attain bovine glory if you’re a rebel animal","(Illustration: Mithun Chakraborty) (Illustration: Mithun Chakraborty)

Recently, my rustic, very organic cousin invited me over to his farm to spend the weekend. When I reached there, I heard his exasperated voice from the large cowshed. I walked up to it and, since the best stories are those that you overhear, began to eavesdrop. And this is what I overheard. My cousin was talking to his cow, Moti, while milking her.

“I don’t care what you think. It’s a done deal. Monday morning and I’m admitting you to the hostel. I’ve already made the down payment on rent and have examined the stalls. They are very comfortable: with air-conditioning, free wi-fi, HDTV, non-alcoholic mini-bar, etc. You will have 24-hour stall service, dung and pee collection (which will be donated to medical labs), and every morning, a member of the staff will come to milk you. We will visit you once a week on the weekends. You’ll be very happy.”

“I don’t want to go to a hostel!” Moti replied mutinously. “You have no idea what the wardens do to inmates in hostels. And everyone knows what hostel food is like!”

“Well, you should have thought about that earlier. You and your friends spend the whole day gallivanting about in the streets, eating rubbish and plastic bags and causing traffic jams.”

“No, we do not! We just lie down in the middle of a highway to do yoga, that’s all. And, for your information, the mere sight of us cows doing the cud-chewing asana, calms the traffic down. Drivers slow down as they try to navigate around us. Sometimes, we bring the traffic to a complete halt for two hours to induce them into a deep coma! We are a beatific influence.”

“That may be, but what about these complaints I’ve received about you being seen in the Glitizzy Mall in the company of a bafellow at night? Not only that, you went into a women’s lingerie store and…” Here my cousin sputtered to an outraged halt. “Have you no sense at all? What were you thinking? What will people say?” he went on.

“They can say and think what they like,” Moti replied, giggling. “You should have seen Bhaisa darling’s face when I came out of the trial room. The dude got so excited that he totaled the Food Court. It was pandemonium!”

“That’s another thing. To be seen going around with a bafellow in the first place.”

“Oh chill, this is the 21st century and we are bovisexuals. Bhaisa’s very sweet, even if a bit thick between the horns. Besides, I have the right to go out with whom I choose.”

“It’s a wonder you were not arrested by the anti-Romeo squads.”

“They wouldn’t dare. You know, we have our own SPG to protect us at all times,” Moti snorted. “You just want to take away our freedom as you have been trying to do with human girls. No going out, no mobiles, no boys within 20 km of the hostel. You can’t wear this, you can’t eat that, you can’t say this, you can’t write that, you can’t see this, you can’t hear that, you can’t have boyfriends, be back by this hour or else. Sorry, but we are not going to be your goongi gudiyas.”

“It’s for you own good!”

“Pah! Besides, we get so much more protection than human girls. If any girl had come out of that trial room looking like I had, even though she had every right to… We can wander the streets all day and night, and no one says or does anything to us, except, maybe, garland us. We can help ourselves to fruits, vegetables and snacks from roadside stalls without asking or paying, and no one dares protest.”

“I don’t want to hear anything more about that lingerie store incident,” my poor cousin said. “I don’t know how I’m going to live it down. Why can’t you be like your lovely step-sister Malti here? She has no problem going to a hostel.’

“Jee papaji,” Malti said in a sweet, low voice, making me wince. “I’m so looking forward to it, but I’ll miss you all so much. But, imagine, to be in a stall all day just ruminating. Can you think of anything more tranquil?”

“Hah! I know what you’ll be ruminating about: those fabulous Jallikattu bulls or some of those jet-black Spanish studs,” said Moti.

“Papaji, tell her. She’s being so mean!”

Then came the sound of a pail being kicked over and a shout from my cousin.

“Moti, you kicked the milk bucket over deliberately. You are impossible!”

“I just don’t think adult human beings should be drinking milk: It’s stolen baby food. No adult animal drinks milk. Really, you people are infantile! Grow up!”

“That’s it! It’s the hostel for you, like it or not!” my cousin snapped. “I hope they’ll teach you to be more respectful towards those who look after you.”

“Bah. Just let them try!” Moti snorted.

“She’s a real feisty one, isn’t she?” I commiserated with my cousin some time later. He nodded.

“Always been a rebel. I just hope she will simmer down in the hostel,” my cousin said.

Later, I checked to find out how the hostel admission process had gone off.

“Oh,” my cousin said lugubriously, “They didn’t admit her. They said her mother probably did some hanky-panky. Basically, that Moti’s cross-bred and has Jersey blood in her, and they’re only admitting wholesome, indigenously-bred khadi cows.” He cheered up. “But they took sweet Malti!”

Journalist murder: CBI files chargesheet against Mohammad Shahabuddin,"RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin

The CBI on Tuesday filed chargesheet against former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin and six others in journalist Rajdev Ranjan murder case. Ranjan, who was the Siwan bureau chief of Hindi daily Hindustan, was shot dead on May 13, 2016, while he was returning home after work. The chargesheet said Shahabuddin, who was in Siwan jail, conspired to eliminate Ranjan as he had been writing against him.

CBI’s investigating officer S K Rawat filed the chargesheet against the seven people in the special CBI court of Anupam Kumari under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and under provisions of Arms Act.

Technically, this is a supplementary chargesheet as state police has already filed a chargesheet against six people under the same sections — Shahabuddin is the latest inclusion in the case. Those chargesheeted besides Shahabuddin are Azharuddin Beg alias Laddan Mian, Vijay Kumar Gupta. Rohit Kumar Soni, Rajesh Kumar, Rishu Kumar Jaiswal and Sonu Kumar Gupta.

Shahabuddin’s counsel Sharad Sinha told The Indian Express: “CBI has filed chargesheet against seven people. But the CBI does not have a strong case as it has several missing links”.

Rajdev Ranjan’s wife Asha Ranjan, on the other hand, said, “It is good that Mohammad Shahabuddin is among those chargesheeted. We have full faith in the judicial system.” Shahabuddin is currently in Tihar jail after the Supreme Court cancelled his bail in a 2004 double murder case. The Patna High Court’s decision to grant him bail was challenged by the state government and Chandrakeshwar Prasad, father of the victims.

Two children pulled from rubble on quake-hit Italian island,"Firefighters and rescuers pull out a boy, Mattias, from the collapsed building in Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia, near Naples, Italy, a day after a 4.0-magnitude quake hit the Italian resort island, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Italian Carabinieri, HO/ANSA via AP) Firefighters and rescuers pull out a boy, Mattias, from the collapsed building in Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia, near Naples, Italy, a day after a 4.0-magnitude quake hit the Italian resort island, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Italian Carabinieri, HO/ANSA via AP)

Firefighters in Italy freed a 7-month-old baby and his older brother from rubble early Tuesday following a 4.0-magnitude quake on the resort island of Ischia off Naples, and rescuers were working on helping a third brother who remained trapped. At least two people were killed in the quake that struck just before 9 pm (1900 GMT) Monday, while another 39 were injured and some 2,600 were left homeless.

The victims were an elderly woman who was in a church that crumbled in the quake, and a second person who has been located in the rubble but not yet extracted.

Video released from the firefighting service showed rescuers passing the baby, who was wearing a white onesie and appearing alert, out of the collapsed structure in hardest-hit Casamicciola at around 4 am. The news agency ANSA said cries of joy went up in the crowd and the boys’ mother ran to take him.

One of the baby’s brothers was rescued some seven hours later, and quickly loaded onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.

A firefighter photo showed the boy, identified as Mattias, being pulled out of the rubble in just his underwear covered with cement dust. Firefighters said on Twitter that they had reached the other boy, named Ciro, and were working on extracting him.

The children’s father told RAI state television that boys were in a bedroom when the quake struck, while he and his wife were elsewhere in the house. The mother, who Italian media say is heavily pregnant, managed to escape through a window while rescuers helped the father.

Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari said they maintained voice contact with the two boys during the complex rescue operation to create an opening through the collapsed ceiling. The boys had been given bottles of water and a flashlight.

“We are in touch with both of the boys. We hear their voices and we are making ours heard to keep them calm,” Cari was quoted by ANSA as saying.

The quake hit during the height of the tourist season, and Italian television showed many visitors taking refuge in parks following the quake. Authorities began organizing ferries to bring tourists back to the mainland early Tuesday.

Together with the nearby island of Capri, Ischia is a favorite island getaway for the European jet set, famed in particular for its thermal waters. Casamicciola was the epicenter of an 1883 earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people.

Images from the quake zone show many buildings collapsed into rubble, while others showed signs of structural damage with deep cracks in exterior walls. Cars were overturned.

The extent of the damage for a relatively light quake raised questions about the quality of construction on the island in the seismically active area off Naples and the active volcano, and the prevalence of illegally built structures.

Fabrizio Pistolesi, the head of Italy’s national architecture advisory board, told SKY that many buildings on the island were built before seismic codes were adopted. He also cited the high incidence of illegal construction on Ischia and generally in the Campagna region that includes both the resort island and Naples.

“We know well that in Campagna, more than 200,000 homes were illegally constructed, we are talking about homes constructed in absolute scorn of seismic norms,” he told Sky TG24.

Former Naples prosecutor Aldo De Chiara told Corriere della Sera that most of the recently constructed buildings on Ischia were built without necessary permits, and many with poor quality cement. “We warned about the risk of collapses also in the case of not particularly serious temblors,” De Chiara said. “Unfortunately, what we had denounced, happened last night.”

The head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, told reporters that 2,000 people had been left homeless in Casamicciola and another 600 in Lacco Ameno. He said authorities were checking the stability of hotels to see if they could be used as temporary housing.

The quake came just two days shy of the one-year anniversary of a powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake that devastated several towns in central Italy. The quake on Aug. 24, 2016 killed more than 250 people in Amatrice and beyond and set off a months-long series of powerful aftershocks that emptied many towns and hamlets of their people.

Triple talaq verdict: ‘I hope no one will now go through what I did’,"Ishrat Jehan (Subham Dutta) Ishrat Jehan (Subham Dutta)

“I hope no one will now undergo what I went through,” said Ishrat Jehan of Howrah, one of the petitioners to the Supreme Court against triple talaq. “My husband called me from Dubai and said ‘Talaq, talaq, talaq’. It was so sudden.” Md Murtaza Ansari, who works in Dubai, had made that call in April 2015. Ishrat, a mother of four, now lives in Howrah with two of her children. After the divorce, all her children had been with her husband’s family; two came back to her recently.

“I was waiting for the news,” said Ishrat, 30. “Now Muslim women will be able to live with their heads high. After the verdict, I feel Muslim women will get their rights and their equality back. I went to court to get justice, now I think that I will get justice. I am a religious person but I believe one should not be allowed to get a divorce over phone or just by saying talaq thrice.”

Ishrat was 14 when she got married in 2001. She settled with her husband first in Bihar, then they moved to Howrah. Ishrat’s first three children were girls, which is what, she alleges, set her husband against her. After her fourth child, a son, her husband suddenly made the call to say talaq thrice and has never spoken with her again.

Her children were taken to Bihar, where her husband later remarried. “Since the electricity connection here was in their [in-laws’] name, they did not pay the bills and it got snapped some months ago,” she said. “Just 15 days ago, my eldest daughter Shayestha, 13, and son Zaid, 7, came to me,” she said. “They could not live in Bihar since their stepmother ill-treats them. My other two children, Kehekasha, 11, and Bushra, 9, are still there. I miss them and want them back.”

She is meeting her expenses with help from her sister. “I don’t know how my children will grow up. I have no money,” she said. She lodged a case for maintenance with a Howrah court before she went to the Supreme Court on triple talaq. “My case for maintenance in the lower court is still on. I have to find some job or a means to earn. There is a long fight ahead of me,” she said.

"Globally 8 in 1,000 kids born with foetal alcohol syndrome","It is very important for expecting mothers to be aware of the ill-effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Source: File Photo) It is very important for expecting mothers to be aware of the ill-effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Source: File Photo)

Nearly eight out of every 1,000 children worldwide are born with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), which increases their risk of developing physical, mental, behavioural and learning disabilities, according to researchers.

The study estimated that one out of 13 women, who consumed alcohol at any point or frequently during pregnancy, gave birth to a child with FASD.

“FASD prevalence estimates are essential to effectively prioritise and plan health care for children with FASD who are often misdiagnosed,” said Svetlana Popova, Senior Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Ontario.

“Most of these children will require lifelong care, so the earlier they have access to appropriate therapy and supports, the better their long-term health and social outcomes will be,” Popova added. For the study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, the team looked at the prevalence — or the frequency that FASD—occurs for children from birth to age 16 in 187 countries.

While the European region reported the highest levels worldwide at nearly 20 cases of FASD per 1,000 children, the Eastern Mediterranean Region has showed the lowest FASD prevalence. The US showed 15 cases of FASD per 1,000 children, while Canada reported eight cases per 1,000 children. In 76 countries, more than one out of 100 young people reported FASD.

The researchers also found that FASD occurred more frequently among children in care (such as foster care or orphanages), in the criminal justice system, in psychiatric care and aboriginal young people compared to the general population.

“There is a need for targeted screening and diagnosis for these high-risk populations as well as interventions to prevent alcohol use among mothers of children with FASD in relation to subsequent pregnancies,” Popova said.

Public health messages about the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy and routine screening by health care professionals to detect alcohol consumption before or at early stages pregnancy should be followed, the researchers said.

"At Arizona rally, Donald Trump defends response to Charlottesville violence","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

President Donald Trump, surrounded by thousands of supporters on Tuesday, defended his response to the violence at a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, and attacked the media for “giving a platform to hate groups.” Trump told the friendly crowd at the political rally in Arizona that his words in the aftermath of the Virginia event had been “perfect.” He revved up the crowd with criticism of journalists, who he said did not report what he had said. Many in the crowd turned and pointed at reporters in the room. Some chanted “CNN sucks.”

Trump also suggested he might pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Arpaio, 85, lost a re-election bid last year in the county.

“Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?” Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of “Pardon Joe!”

“Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?” Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One earlier on Tuesday: “There will be no discussion of that today at any point and no action will be taken on that front at any point today.”

BROAD CRITICISM

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed. Protesters outside Tuesday’s rally yelled: “Shame, shame, shame” and “No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA” as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: “Build the wall,” a reference to Trump’s pledge to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Many wore red hats with Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday’s event, scheduled for 7 pm MST (0200 GMT Wednesday), while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville.

Neither John McCain nor Jeff Flake, Arizona’s senators, was expected to attend the Phoenix event, said a source familiar with Flake’s re-election campaign and published reports, underscoring Trump’s fractious relationship with some in his own party.

Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the rally. Before flying to Phoenix, the state capital, Trump landed in Yuma, Arizona, near the Mexican border, for a tour of border security facilities. He is seeking congressional funding for the wall he wants built along the border to deter illegal immigration..

HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE

A heavy police presence deployed around the Phoenix venue. Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump’s Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by supporters. “The president is always welcome in Arizona,” Flake spokesman Will Allison said in an emailed statement. Flake “hopes the president will speak constructively about moving forward with tax reform, border security, and other important issues facing our country,” Allison said.

Earlier this summer, Flake published a book questioning the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era, making him one of the few party members willing to criticize the president. Last week, Trump sent a tweet voicing support for Flake’s challenger, Kelli Ward, in next year’s Arizona Senate Republican primary. In the tweet, Trump called Flake “toxic” and “weak.”

The president has also made caustic remarks about McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and war hero, who is battling cancer. A spokesman for McCain could not be reached immediately. The Phoenix event is Trump’s first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election.

China warns US ahead of Taiwan defence minister’s brief visit,"Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan attends a parliamentary session at Legislative Yuan in Taipei. (Source: Reuters) Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan attends a parliamentary session at Legislative Yuan in Taipei. (Source: Reuters)

China warned the United States on Tuesday against any military contacts with Taiwan ahead of brief visits by the self-ruled island’s defence minister to the United States on his way to and from Central American allies. The United States is Taiwan’s main source of weapons and Taiwan has been pressing for sales of more advanced equipment to deal with the rapidly modernising military of China, which claims Taiwan as its own.

Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan would make brief transit stops in New York and Los Angeles on his Aug 23-Sept. 8 trip, and had nothing else on his agenda in the United States, the ministry said.

Feng would visit Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic to “further deepen bilateral friendly relations”, the ministry said in a statement.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had noted the reports. “China consistently insists on using the ‘one China’ principle in handling the issue of the Taiwan region’s exchanges, and firmly opposes country’s with which China has established relations conducting any type of official contact or military exchanges with Taiwan,” Hua told reporters.

“Our position is clear and consistent. I believe the United States is extremely clear on this.”

Taiwan presidents and other senior officials frequently stop over in the United States while visiting Taiwan’s dwindling number of allies in Latin America and the Caribbean, always drawing China’s ire.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and has stepped up military drills around the island in recent months. Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China.

Taiwan now only has official diplomatic ties with 20 countries. Panama dropped its diplomatic ties with Taiwan to instead recognise China in June. China says Taiwan is merely a province with no right to diplomatic ties with other countries.

The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging that China takes the position that there is “one China” and Taiwan is part of it. But the United States is also duty-bound by legislation to help the island defend itself.

"Athletics has not grown as the focus was just on Usain Bolt, says Carl Lewis","Usain Bolt called time on his athletics career with a bronze medal at World Championship. (Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt called time on his athletics career with a bronze medal at World Championship. (Source: Reuters)

The last decade in world athletics belonged to Usain Bolt but the legendary Carl Lewis is not happy with the singular focus on the Jamaican showman. Considered the greatest athlete of all time, Jamaican Bolt drew curtains on his illustrious career after a disappointing performance at the World Championship in London, where he could only win a bronze in the 100m.

“The sport is not just about one person. Nobody is irreplaceable. Track and field survived many civilisations. Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and now Usain Bolt. Men will all come and go but the sport will always remain,” Lewis, who has won nine Olympic gold medals, told PTI in an exclusive interview.

With Bolt’s retirement, Lewis feels that it’s time to build on the sport now that people will get over their obsession with a singular man. “We need to do more to build on the sport. We don’t need to follow that trend that we have been in the last eight years, which was just about following one person (Bolt),” Lewis didn’t mince words as he spoke on the sidelines of the 29th Summer Universiade.

“Our job is to fill the void. In the last 10 years, the sport has not grown as the focus was just on one man. The point is we need to build competition. We now have a unique chance to rebuild and grow our sport. Now we have a chance to make a difference, grow our sport and not just grow yourself,” Lewis’ sarcasm on Bolt’s cult status was pretty much evident.

Lewis, who won Long Jump gold in four successive Olympic Games (1984, 88, 92 and 96), is not at all amused that ‘Brand Bolt’ became bigger than the sport. “We were just so caught up trying to make one person all about the whole sport and now we have a unique opportunity to spread it across the board and really allow it grow,” said Lewis.

Lewis termed World Championship 100m silver medallist Christian Coleman and Rio bronze medallist Canadian Andre de Grasse are the ones to watch out for in the coming years. “Christian Coleman was second (in World Championships) behind Justin Gatlin and he had the fastest time this year. Gatlin is 35 years old and that was probably his last Major championship. I think De Grasse and Coleman are both great athletes and I am really excited about them,” Lewis is confident that they can maintain the standard set by Bolt.

Lewis, is in Taiwan as the assistant coach of the US track and field University team and named young Cameron Burrell as the next big thing among American track and field. Young Cameron competes both in 100m and long jump like Lewis and is the son of Lewis’ former teammate Leroy Burrell (a 1991 World Championship 100m bronze medallist) and Olympic relay champion.

Lewis and Burrell Sr also competed together for the famous Santa Monica Track Club. “I was a long jumper who ran sprints. And now Cameron is trying to do that. I would love to see that. He is a great kid and he has the potential to become an Olympic champion,” Lewis opined.

Justin Gatlin won gold medal in the 100m sprint at the World Championship to beat Usain Bolt who finished third. (Source: AP) Justin Gatlin won gold medal in the 100m sprint at the World Championship to beat Usain Bolt who finished third. (Source: AP)

With Cameron’s reference, Lewis took another dig at Bolt. “That’s the great thing about our sport and I think Cameron is going to be an Olympics champion one day and Coleman is also going to be an Olympic champion. Everyone just wants to talk about the garden centre instead of lumber area or the clothing area. We have a great sport that we need to spread it across and talk about the unique relationships. Don’t let people get into the box where it is about just one person.”

Lewis however did not like termed the booing of Gatlin after winning the 100m dash at the recent World Championships ahead of Bolt as “childish”. “It was unfair. I am not saying what he has done is right. But it was childish,” he said.

J-K: Govt opposes Centralized Selection Mechanism for appointment of judges in subordinate judiciary,"Giving details, an official release here said that the Supreme Court of India had sent a concept note to all the states with a proposal for a CSM for appointment of judicial officers in subordinate courts in the states and had sought suggestions from them. Giving details, an official release here said that the Supreme Court of India had sent a concept note to all the states with a proposal for a CSM for appointment of judicial officers in subordinate courts in the states and had sought suggestions from them.

CITING special status enjoyed by it under the Constitution of India, the Jammu Kashmir government has opposed the Centralized Selection Mechanism (CSM) for the appointment of judges in subordinate judiciary in the state.

Giving details, an official release here said that the Supreme Court of India had sent a concept note to all the states with a proposal for a CSM for appointment of judicial officers in subordinate courts in the states and had sought suggestions from them. Since the case involved interpretation of the Constitution, the government hired the services of Rakesh Dwivedi, a senior advocate in addition to Shoebv Alam, advocate on record, who submitted before the Apex Court that centralizing the selection process for appointment of district judges would not be in consonance with constitutional position enjoyed by the state as in accordance with Section 109 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, power to appoint them vests with the State Governor in consultation with the State High Court.

Pointing out that this power cannot be taken away or abridged by the exercise of judicial powers by court, they argued that high court of the state exercised greater independence than high courts of other states as the entire state judiciary including high court and the subordinate courts are not constituted under Constitution of India, but under the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. As such the appointment of judges of the Jammu Kashmir High Court and the district judges take place under the Constitution of the State.

While the proposed CSM will require Jammu Kashmir State to recruit candidates from the centralized pool of successful candidates, it cannot appoint non-permanent resident candidates to the post. Moreover, the scope of Article 312 of the Constitution of India relating to the All India Services has been extended to the creation of an All India Judicial Service by 42nd amendment Act 1976 and the said amendment has not been extended to the state of J&K, they added. They stated that the state enjoys special relationship unlike other states in the union of India inter alia by virtue of Articles 370 of Constitution of India which is applicable to the state only to the extent it is applied to the state by the exercise of presidential power in terms of Article 370 of Constitution of India.

After hearing the response from the J&K state, Apex Court bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar, Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and A M Khanwilka said a revised concept note will be prepared so that it will be circulated to High Courts of objecting states so that they may be given the option to opt out of the CSM.

Pakistan just managed to host Zimbabwe in 2015 for a bilateral ODI series after most of the teams boycotted visiting the country after the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by gunmen in 2009 while touring Pakistan. Moreover, Sri Lanka and West Indies too have agreed to play T20 international in September and November respectively.

“Cricket West Indies and Pakistan Cricket Board are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies team play the T20 matches with Pakistan in Lahore in late November,” said a statement released by the PCB.

“My mission statement is to bring back international cricket to Pakistan and hopefully we will be able to announce the full World XI side in next two to three days,” PCB chairman Najam Sethi told a news conference.

“It was a very difficult task convincing the Sri Lankan board to send their team to Lahore once again but they have shown great courage in accepting our request and hopefully if security arrangements are confirmed they will come and play T20 matches in October,” he added.

"England vs West Indies: Never saw any aggression from the Windies throughout the three days, says Curtly Ambrose","Curtly Ambrose said that the West Indies side was embarrassing. Curtly Ambrose said that the West Indies side was embarrassing.

Curtly Ambrose labelled the current West Indies side “embarrassing” and “pathetic” after their humiliating innings defeat by England in the first Test. England went 1-0 up in the ongoing three-match series courtesy of a mammoth innings and 209-run win as the first day/night Test in Britain ended inside three days at Edgbaston on Saturday.

Amid a welter of depressing statistics for the West Indies, perhaps the worst was that they lost 19 wickets in under a day on Saturday after being made to follow-on.

“In the end it was totally embarrassing,” West Indies fast-bowling great Ambrose told Monday’s Daily Mail.

“I never saw any aggression from the West Indies players throughout the three days,” added Ambrose, who took 405 wickets at an outstanding low average of 20.99 in his 98-Test career.

“There was no belief that they could compete, let alone beat England. They seemed to be waiting for England to make mistakes and at this level that is not going to work. “Trust me, it was painful to watch.”

West Indies have now won just three out of 87 away Tests in the past 20 years excluding matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.

Ambrose said he had tried to stop the slide as a member of the backroom staff but in the end felt it was a “waste of time”.

“I was with the team for two years as bowling coach and we tried to educate them about our heritage,” he recalled. “I talked about the pride and passion in representing the region and our people.

“I could talk to them all day but once they stepped over that rope they were on their own and if they were not prepared to listen, it was simply a waste of time. It does hurt. “And it has reached a point where it is very embarrassing.”

Ambrose was now left hoping the West Indies could compete in the remaining two Tests of the England series at Headingley and Lord’s as “what we have seen so far has been pathetic”.

Meanwhile England great Geoffrey Boycott said the West Indies were the worst Test side he’d seen during his five decades of involvement in cricket, labelling their plight a “tragedy” for the sport.

“This West Indies lot are the worst Test match team I have seen in more than 50 years of watching, playing and commentating on cricket,” wrote Boycott in his Daily Telegraph column.

“They can’t bat and can’t bowl.”

The former England opener, whose career coincided with that of such West Indies stars as Garfield Sobers, Michael Holding and Vivian Richards, added: “I take no pleasure out of saying this as I played against some of the greatest players the world has ever seen wearing the maroon cap of the West Indies.

“It is a cricketing tragedy to see the West Indies like this and there is no gloating over them losing.

“It is just sad to see a once-proud cricket Test team lower than any I have ever seen before.”

The second Test starts on Friday.

Britain will not exclude possible EU oversight of UK borders after Brexit,"British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file) British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file)

Britain will not rule out the possibility that the European Union may retain oversight of customs controls at UK borders after it leaves the bloc, as the country seeks ways to keep unhindered access to EU markets following Brexit. Last week, the UK published a policy document proposing two possible models for British-EU customs arrangements after withdrawal from the EU in 2019.

The first model was a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” which involved the re-introduction of a customs border but which envisaged electronic tracking of shipments, rather than physical checks of goods and documents at the border. An alternative proposal was the “new customs partnership” which would remove the need for a UK-EU customs border altogether.

Under this model, the UK would operate as if it was still part of the bloc for customs purposes. British goods would be exported tariff-free and Britain would levy EU tariffs on goods coming into the UK for onward passage to the EU directly or as components in UK export goods. However, lawyers said there would be a need for a mechanism to oversee the “new customs partnership” to ensure that the UK was correctly monitoring goods coming into the UK and destined for Europe. The EU’s system of movement of goods across EU borders without checks works on the basis that all members closely monitor shipments coming into the bloc from outside, to ensure the correct tariffs are paid and that goods meet EU standards.

WEAKNESSES

The EU anti-fraud agency OLAF polices customs agencies across Europe to ensure they are correctly monitoring imports. OLAF has the powers to conduct on-the-spot inspections and seek information from customs bodies. If OLAF finds weaknesses in a country’s systems and that the member is not charging the appropriate duties on imports from outside the EU, it will recommend that the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, should recover money from the offending member.

For example, in March OLAF slammed lax UK border controls and recommended the European Commission reclaim 2 billion euros the agency said was lost because Britain had failed to apply the correct EU duties on imports of Chinese clothes and footwear in recent years.

A spokesman for the UK’s tax authority said it questioned OLAF’s estimate of lost revenue. Duties collected are paid to Brussels. Commission duty recovery claims can be appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), the EU’s highest court.

UK Prime Minster Theresa May has said the UK will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ after Britain’s exit from the bloc. However, the British finance ministry declined to say if the country would bar OLAF from policing the UK’s customs system under the “new customs partnership” model or whether it would allow the Commission to make demands for recovery of lost duties.

“The exact form of the arrangements will be agreed as part of the negotiations,” a ministry spokeswoman said.

MONEY AND EFFORT

Lode Van Den Hende, a partner with Herbert Smith Freehills in Brussels, said it was hard to see how the customs partnership model could work without OLAF or a similar body policing the UK’s monitoring of imports destined for the EU. “In practical terms they (Britain and the EU) would have to operate in the same way or the whole thing would fall apart,” he said.

Bernard Jenkin, a member of parliament for May’s Conservative party, who backed Brexit in last year’s referendum, said he opposed continued EU oversight of UK borders. “There is no need for an EU institution to police our customs, and we should not accept this,” he said in a statement.

“Any dispute about each other’s customs arrangements should be settled by an independent arbitrator, as with any other international agreement, not by an institution which belongs only to one party of the agreement,” he added. Van Den Hende said the ECJ may not accept the creation of an independent body to oversea EU customs. Customs are a matter of EU law and the court is supposed to be the highest authority on this.

Also, the breadth of areas in which the UK wishes to retain free trade with Europe means many such independent arbitrators would be required. They would be needed to monitor enforcement of health standards, standards in financial services and rules that apply to a host of other regulated markets. “In theory you can design that, but in practice neither the UK nor the EU would want that because you would be replicating institutions which already exist. It would be a huge amount of money and effort,” he said.

“This is in one of the fundamental problems about Brexit. The UK wants to retain deep integration but the UK doesn’t like the institutions that administer all this stuff,” Van Den Hende said.

Onus is on all players to find the spark and a little bit extra: Matthew Mott,"Ellyse Perry scored a crucial 71 run knock against New Zealand in the recently concluded Women’s World Cup. (Source: Reuters) Ellyse Perry scored a crucial 71 run knock against New Zealand in the recently concluded Women’s World Cup. (Source: Reuters)

Ahead of the crucial upcoming Ashes series the Australian women’s team suffered a big setback when skipper Meg Lanning was ruled due to a shoulder injury. However, this has led to Australian women’s team head coach Matthew Mott to point out that with Lanning ruled out for the Ashes, it provides an opportunity for other players to stand up and perform.

Speaking to cricket.com.au, Mott said, “As an Australian team for the last few years, we’ve been able to rely quite heavily on Meg. Not only does she score big runs, she scores them at a quick pace which puts pressure on opposition teams. So across the board I think that puts more onus on all players to find that spark and a little bit extra strike-rate that can make up for losing such a strong player We had Rachael Haynes on the sidelines for most of the World Cup, and in my opinion she’s a world-class player.

Commenting on the depth of the Aussie side, Mott said, “Certainly, the depth there in the batting can cover (Lanning), but when you take a great player out of any team it’s always hard to fill that void. Across the board, if everyone can find just a little bit extra – and the beauty is there’s onus on everyone to do it – the batting unit as a whole can grow from the experience of not having Meg there day in, and day out, to rely on.”

In the semi-finals of the Women’s World Cup Australia suffered a loss to India, which saw them out in the knockout stage. However, Mott doesn’t see that loss leading to many changes in the side.

“I’m catching up with the selectors in the next few days. But that’s what happens in knock-out tournaments, we got to a semi-final and we felt like we were going quite well and then we were suddenly out.”, Mott said and added, “It’s not like anyone had a chance to play themselves out of the team. I don’t think we’ll look too far outside (the World Cup squad of 15), but the Ashes is across three formats so there will be some flexibility among the squads. “There are a few players just outside pushing for selection, but there certainly won’t be massive changes.”

State of the Union,"Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran. Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran.

The flaws in India’s internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries’ judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed — so far, at least.

Balachandran’s book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was “certainly a lapse”. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. “What was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)”. It was a “leadership failure” of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn’t institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown “no interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security”. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for “immaturely” dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

US and South Korean troops start drills amid North Korea standoff,"A US Air Force U-2 spy plane takes off on the runway at the Osan US Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, Monday, August 21, 2017. (Source: AP) A US Air Force U-2 spy plane takes off on the runway at the Osan US Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, Monday, August 21, 2017. (Source: AP)

US and South Korean troops kicked off their annual drills on Monday that come after President Donald Trump and North Korea exchanged warlike rhetoric in the wake of the North’s two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills are largely computer-simulated war games held every summer and have drawn furious responses from North Korea, which views them as an invasion rehearsal.

Pyongyang’s state media yesterday called this year’s drills a “reckless” move that could trigger the “uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war.” Despite the threat, US and South Korean militaries launched this year’s 11-day training today morning as scheduled.

The exercise involves 17,500 American troops and 50,000 South Korean soldiers, according to the US military command in South Korea and Seoul’s Defense Ministry. No field training like live-fire exercises or tank maneuvering is involved in the Ulchi drills, in which alliance officers sit at computers to practice how they engage in battles and hone their decision-making capabilities. The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said Monday that North Korea must not use the drills as a pretext to launch fresh provocation, saying the training is held regularly because of repeated provocations by North Korea.

North Korea typically responds to South Korea-US military exercises with weapons tests and a string of belligerent rhetoric. During last year’s Ulchi drills, North Korea test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile that flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in the longest flight by that type of weapon. Days after the drills, the North carried out its fifth and biggest nuclear test to date.

Last month North Korea test-launched two ICBMs at highly lofted angles, and outside experts say those missiles can reach some US parts like Alaska, Los Angeles or Chicago if fired at normal, flattened trajectories. Analysts say it would be only a matter of time for the North to achieve its long-stated goal of acquiring a nuclear missile that can strike anywhere in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with “fire and fury.” North Korea, for its part, threatened to launch missiles toward the American territory of Guam before its leader Kim Jong Un backed off saying he would first watch how Washington acts before going ahead with the missile launch plans.

Lewis Hamilton needs to step up in his 200th race,"A fifth victory of 2017 for the Briton would put the pressure back on Ferrari’s Vettel and Hamilton can celebrate another milestone by bagging pole position on Saturday. (Source: AP) A fifth victory of 2017 for the Briton would put the pressure back on Ferrari’s Vettel and Hamilton can celebrate another milestone by bagging pole position on Saturday. (Source: AP)

Lewis Hamilton will start the 200th grand prix of his Formula One career in Belgium this weekend but the triple world champion has smaller but more significant numbers on his mind.

Refreshed from an August break in the Caribbean, including a trip to Cuba in his role as UNICEF ambassador, the Mercedes driver is 14 points behind championship leader Sebastian Vettel as he revs up for the second half of the season.

A fifth victory of 2017 for the Briton would put the pressure back on Ferrari’s Vettel and Hamilton can celebrate another milestone by bagging pole position on Saturday at the long and fast Spa-Francorchamps circuit.

That would see Hamilton, who sportingly relinquished third place to team mate Valtteri Bottas in Hungary before the summer shutdown, match the record of 68 poles set by Michael Schumacher with Ferrari in 2006.

Mercedes have won the last two Belgian Grands Prix, with now-retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg triumphant from pole last year after Hamilton won in 2015.

Nobody will be taking anything for granted, however, after Ferrari’s one-two win in Budapest at the end of July.

“On paper, people will assume that Spa should suit our car because it is a circuit where aerodynamic efficiency is extremely important,” Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said.

“But assumptions are dangerous — we have seen too many times already this season that the form book can be rewritten from one weekend to the next. So we will be making no assumptions.”

Hamilton has won twice before at Spa, as has Vettel, but the track — a classic blast from the past — has not been particularly kind to him.

In 2008, when he won his first title, the Briton was demoted from first to third after the race for cutting a chicane, with then Ferrari rival Felipe Massa savouring victory instead.

Spa can often be a lottery, with its capricious weather, and rain could be a boon for Red Bull’s Belgian-born Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, who can count on plenty of local support in what amounts to a home race.

“I just love the track and it’ll be nice seeing so many orange (Dutch) fans in the grandstands,” he said.

“Spa is my favourite track of the year. You have to get everything right but when you get a good lap it’s very rewarding.”

Belgium could also be good for Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen, who arrives with a new contract for 2018 in his pocket.

The fearless Finnish ‘Iceman’ has won four times at Spa but will need to be beyond the reach of Ferrari ‘team orders’ if he is to do it again.

“For sure there are some circuits that fit us better,” Raikkonen, whose last Belgian win in 2009 was also Ferrari’s most recent at Spa, said in Hungary.

“The Mercedes has better horsepower but it depends on so many things. “If you purely look now, you would say it’s not going to be as easy for us as here (Hungary) but obviously we try to improve and we are going to do our best.”

Sunday’s race, the 50th world championship Grand Prix held at Spa, will also see a Belgian competing — McLaren rookie Stoffel Vandoorne — for the first time since Jerome d’Ambrosio in 2012.

RJP-Nepal will participate in third phase of local polls: CEC,"The Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal, a coalition of six Madhes-based groups who had boycotted the first two phases of the local-level polls, will participate in the final phase next month, according to the chief election commissioner (CEC). Madhesi parties have long been demanding an amendment to the Constitution promulgated in 2015 to accommodate their main demands: more political representation for the inhabitants of the southern plains and redrawing the provincial boundaries. They had boycotted the first two phases of the polls -being held for the first time in about two decades – over the demands.

CEC Ayodhi Prasad Yadav told reporters in Janakpur, a centre for cultural tourism about 200 kilometres from Kathmandu, that RJP-Nepal will contest the polls scheduled on September 18 in Province No. 2 as per the deal reached with the government and the main opposition CPN-UML of former prime minister KP Sharma Oli. In April, six Madhesi parties announced to jointly form the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-Nepal).

RJP-Nepal leader Rajendra Mahato last week, however, indicated the party might contest the third phase, saying the ruling alliance of Nepali Congress and CPN-Maoist Centre have assured them they would endorse the Constitution amendment bill tabled in the parliament. Yadav also said that the Election Commission was preparing to hold federal and provincial elections in 31 mountainous and hilly districts on November 20 and discussions were underway with the central government on the matter.

Millions of Nepalese voted in the first two phases as the Himalayan nation takes a key step towards cementing democracy. Nepal witnessed political instability when Madhesis, who are mostly of Indian origin, had launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the Constitution.

AFC Cup: Bengaluru FC thrash North Korean side April 25 3-0,"Bengaluru FC Sunil Chettri and 4.25 SC North Korea players in action during the AFC cup Inter Zone Semifinal match. (Source: PTI) Bengaluru FC Sunil Chettri and 4.25 SC North Korea players in action during the AFC cup Inter Zone Semifinal match. (Source: PTI)

Star striker Sunil Chhetri was among the goal-getters as Bengaluru FC thrased North Korean side April 25 3-0 in first of the two-legged AFC Cup inter-zone semifinal match in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Chhetri led the charge with a 32nd minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match in front of the cheering home crowd at Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

Heavy rains lashed the stadium an hour into the game and both the teams played under reduced visibility.

Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty kick after Udanta was brought down by the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area.

Chhetri stepped up and sent his shot at the center, which beat Ri Kang, who dived to his right.

Bengaluru scored their second goal through Udanta as the winger sprinted from the vacant right flank into the box and sent a superb left footer into the North Korean net.

Lenny Rodrigues completed the route as he sent the ball past Kang who was blinded by the splash of water on his face. Chhetri broke away and ran almost 50 yards to cut in and deliver the cross from the left to Lenny who made no mistake.

Chhetri missed a chance to score his second goal in the 42nd minute after Kang, who was off the line, managed to get a finger of a the Indian striker’s shot for a corner.

April 25 also had their chance in 23rd minute as Ri Hyong Jin sent an accurate freekick but An Song Il’s header hit the crossbar and the ball rebounded back into play.

They also missed an opportunity coming their way to reduce the margin in the 71st minute as Kwon Ch sent a grounded cross but An Il Bom could not connect it properly.

We will never stop having special nights at the Fortress. I said it before and will always say it,this is BFC. Our fans? Priceless. — Sunil Chhetri (@chetrisunil11) 23 August 2017

What a night! Couldn’t have asked for a better debut than this for @bengalurufc , Thank you @WestBlockBlues for making this night special. — Gurpreet Singh (@GurpreetGK) 23 August 2017

Soon after the half-time break, April 25 got into their act, but the smartness of the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the situation. Kim Yu Song had beaten three Bengaluru men and was going for a shot from an angle into the goal in 49th minute but Sandhu denied him.

A couple of minutes back too, Gurpreet had done well to send the ball out of danger after Kim Jong Chol had flicked to An Il Bom, who sent a cross across the goal with all the defenders falling short of pace to get hold of it.

Bengaluru FC will now travel to Pyongyang on September 13 for the second leg match.

"One for the ages: At 60, Matthew Fogarty keeps coming back at World Championships","Matthew Fogarty with his mother in Glasgow. The American played alongside Nicholas Bonkowssky of Canada in what was his 8th qualification at the World Championships. Matthew Fogarty with his mother in Glasgow. The American played alongside Nicholas Bonkowssky of Canada in what was his 8th qualification at the World Championships.

Matthew Fogarty is 60 and has qualified for the World Championships — his 8th. The American from Boston had qualified in 2003 at Anaheim — based on his rankings (which is now 93), but the US Federation did not allow him to play because he was 47 then.

He continued to qualify for the Worlds thereafter, arriving this time again with a much younger Canadian Nicholas Bonkowssky (29) as partner after his age-sake Dean Shoppe had accompanied him for three Worlds. Fogarty, on warpath with his federation, is keen to expose the “corruption and unfairness” of his national body, and makes it a point to keep his ranking within qualification limits.

“I used to play as a kid because my grandparents and parents played near Boston. Then I had to stop because I went to med school. But I continued playing,” he recounts. “Then some years ago they told me I was too old.”

What no one could stop was him making the Worlds — with only two teams per country permitted. This time, they qualified after the withdrawal of several doubles teams, rubbing in the nose of the American Federation once again.

Travelling with his mum — she’s in her 80s now though she used to play as his partner till two decades ago — Fogarty would enjoy Glasgow, make it a point to annoy officials against whom he riles, before eventually losing 21-2, 21-4 against a Malaysian pair.

When asked if Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei can continue playing, Fogarty says, “I love the science of badminton and I can tell you the equipment is so light that anyone can continue playing as long as they want. I intend to play till I feel like it,” he asserted. And no one hearing the name Matthew Fogarty in badminton will ever ask, “Dr Who?”

The Hungry trailer: Naseeruddin Shah and Tisca Chopra’s film will leave you confused and intrigued,"Tisca Chopra shares screen space with Naseeruddin Shah in The Hungry. Tisca Chopra shares screen space with Naseeruddin Shah in The Hungry.

Tisca Chopra and Naseeruddin Shah are joining hands for The Hungry, an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus. The trailer shows Tisca seeking revenge for the murder of her first born but the identity of the murderer remains unknown. While the trailer leaves us intrigued, it really does not reveal anything about the plot.

According to the makers of the film, The Hungry, written and directed by Bornila Chatterjee, is about the violence that exists between power and love – a macabre fairy-tale set in the elite circles of north India.

Talking about The Hungry, Naseeruddin Shah, who plays a pivotal role in the film, said, “What really got through to me was that it’s a pretty accurate picture of the small town power elite in India where you have the sugar barons, the guys who make textile or landlords. There have been many instances of brothers gunning each other down, parents killing their children or vice versa. It was a sort of an attempt to understand people of that kind, and not pass judgment on them.”

Tisca Chopra added, “For any actor, Shakespeare is always on the wish list. You always sort of want to tick that box. There’s a sense of inherent power in my character Tulsi. She is not emasculated or in any way angular or aggressive or the standard caveats of being strong. I think there is a power source inherent in her. And I have heard people talk about parts like this but I haven’t really experienced it and I’m experiencing it now.”

The Hungry, a co-production of Cinestaan Film Company & Film London, will have its world premiere at the TIFF 2017.

No ‘deemed silence zones’ in Maharashtra: Govt tells Bombay HC,"The High Court asked why the Maharashtra government was so keen on people using loudspeakers in the state. The High Court asked why the Maharashtra government was so keen on people using loudspeakers in the state.

The state government Tuesday informed the Bombay HC that as of now, there were no “deemed silence zones” in the state, with the Centre recently amending the Noise Pollution Rules of 2000. The state will now carry out a fresh exercise to declare certain areas as silence zones.

Pointing out that the earlier rules and court orders regarding noise pollution were unworkable owing to a wide definition of what areas were covered in silence zones, Advocate General A Kumbhakoni said the amendment would help make the system more workable.

“If we go by the earlier definition of educational institutions or hospital area, every inch in a city like Mumbai will be a silence zone. If the judgment of the court is adhered to in a city like Mumbai, a space where an idol is placed will be a religious space and will therefore be a silence zone. We need to iron out the creases. There is no deemed silence zone as of now,” he added.

The High Court asked why the Maharashtra government was so keen on people using loudspeakers in the state. A division bench of Justices A S Oka and Riyaz Chagla were hearing a petition relating to noise pollution rules. The court was informed that pursuant to the amendment to the noise pollution rules of 2000, all areas declared as silence zones in the past stand de-notified.

The AG said lack of silence zones during the transitional phase did not mean the government would allow loudspeakers near hospitals etc. “When we give permissions for loudspeakers we will ensure decibel levels are maintained,” he said. The HC, in its 2016 order, had said an area of not less than 100 metres around hospitals, educational institutions and courts constitutes a silence zone.

“Why is the state government so agitated that someone is not permitted to use loudspeakers? Why is the government so keen to permit use of loudspeakers?” said Justice Oka. The court was also told that the 1500 silence zones earlier identified by the court appointed committee would no longer be binding. “But we will consider such zones while granting permission,” said Kumbhakoni.

The court will next hear the matter on Wednesday. Sanjeev Gorwadkar, appearing for one of the petitioners, Mahesh Bedekar, said that the amendment cannot be applied retrospectively and the existing rights cannot be taken away. A petition has, meanwhile, been filed by Bedekar challenging the amendment to he noise pollution rules. The centre has sought time to file it’s reply in the matter

"Kaifiyat Express derailment: More than 40 trains cancelled, few diverted; top developments today","Kaifiyat Express derailment: The derailment took place after the train reportedly collided with a loader. (Source: Uttar Pradesh Home Department) Kaifiyat Express derailment: The derailment took place after the train reportedly collided with a loader. (Source: Uttar Pradesh Home Department)

As many as 100 people were injured after Kaifiyat Express derailed near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh early morning on Wednesday. A dumper broke the railway fence and hit the engine of the Kaifiyat express causing the derailment. The collision hampered the train operations on Delhi- Howrah route. This is the second rail accident in the state in four days. On Saturday evening, 14 coaches of the Kalinga Utkal Express derailed at Khatauli on Saturday killing 22 people and injuring dozens. Railway ministry was shaken up as ministers and board members started to resign.

Here are the top development from today’s Kafiyat Express derailment:

1. New Railway Board chairman

Air India chief Ashwani Lohani was appointed as the chairman of the Railway Board after incumbent A K Mital resigned following two recent train accidents.

2. Suresh Prabhu offers to resign

Facing sharp criticism following a series of derailments, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu offered to quit from his post and in a series of emotional tweets he tweeted that he was “extremely pained” by the two derailments in Uttar Pradesh on August 19 and today. “In less than three years as Minister, I have devoted my blood and sweat for the betterment of the Railways. Under the leadership of PM, tried to overcome decades of neglect through systemic reforms in all areas leading to unprecedented investment and milestones,” he said.

Why has Suresh Prabhu offered to resign- Read

3. Arun Jaitley on Suresh Prabhu’s resignation

As his resignation is yet to be accepted, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said, “Accountability is good system in government. The PM will take a decision on whatever request the rail minister has made.”

4. Congress reaction

The main opposition Congress accused Prabhu of having “utterly failed” in his job and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack him and appoint a “responsible person” in the position. This “responsibility business” would not do, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said while stressing that Prabhu must resign. “Prabhu should resign immediately if he has iota of morality left in him after today’s incident which has left 74 more people injured. It is worst kind of tokenism asking rail board chairman or any other official to step aside,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told reporters.

5. Railway board chief resigns

Railway Board chairman AK Mital tendered his resignation on Wednesday. This comes after two express trains derailed in the last four days. In July, Mital became the first Railway Board chairman in history to be granted a two-year extension. His appointment was cleared by the Prime Minister’s Office.

6. Rescue operations sent to the spot

A team from NDRF was immediately sent for rescue operations at the spot of the derailment. All the injured were taken to the Saifai hospital in Etawah. Uttar Pradesh Police also tweeted the emergency phone numbers of senior officers in the district that can be contacted.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: This Dhanush-Kajol film suffers due to a hopelessly stilted plot,"VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie cast: Dhanush, Kajol, Amala Paul

VIP 2 Lalkar movie director: Soundarya Rajinikanth

VIP 2 Lalkar movie star rating: 1.5

The only reason to keep watching this film right till the bitter end comes right at the end. This is not a spoiler. It’s just a tip, which comes to you via gritted teeth, because you keep asking yourself in disbelief, just how bad can a Dhanush film get?

Going by VIP 2, let me tell you, it can get pretty terrible.

VIP 2 Lalkar is 99 percent tosh, created for the express purpose of getting Dhanush to sing and dance and ‘do comedy’ and fight, all the things a Hero is meant to do.

Given that the leading man is capable of terrific acting, and has done all kinds of interesting, edgy roles, this one should have been a snip. But he flubs it, essentially because of a hopelessly stilted plot and treatment that is all cliché.

Taking off from where the original VIP left off, we see Raghuvaran (Dhanush) crossing swords with the very toffee-nosed Vasundhara (Kajol), the former being the very proletarian, down-to-earth engineer and the savior of many working class young joes like himself, the latter being the very wealthy, arrogant owner of the biggest architect firm in the region.

‘Vellai’ (work) plus ‘illai’ (no) adds up to Jobless Raghuvaran, whose fight against Vasundhara is on the principles of fairness and justice and truth and saving the environment. That must have sounded good on paper, but is executed so ham-handedly, that you cringe.

And Kajol, who was so good in her big Tamil outing many years ago (Rajeev Menon’s Minsara Kanuvu aka Sapnay, ‘97) is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. She’s written with no variation, and you watch in despair: Kajol has much more in her; she certainly doesn’t need this. And we are expected to believe that Dhanush, the slender, lightweight Dhanush, can take on burly villains single-handedly, and send them flying, slo-mo.

All you can is to roll your eyes.

And one more thing. Given that there is a female director at the helm, it has surprisingly regressive lines, poking fun at wives and other women. These jokes have gone old, and more so in a film helmed by the next gen.

In the last few minutes, the film changes tack, loosens up, allowing the two leads to break out. Suddenly, we find the two talking to each other, measuring each other up for size, showing us two actors at work.

This could have been the film.

While Aditya looked dashing in a black, velvet one-button jacket with a contrast black embroidered lapels, Jacqueline looked gorgeous in a long-sleeved, embroidered, net floor- skimming creation, over micro shorts.

According to PTI, Jacqueline said “It is a pleasure to walk for Manish. He has been so humble and kind always. He is great person by heart and I love collaborating with him always.”

“It is the third time I am walking for Manish and it is always great. What is different this time is that for the first time I am wearing a suit, otherwise he has always dressed me in Indian wear. It feels great to be here,” Aditya said.

The bespoke suits had the attention-grabbing details and designing. Baggy pleated pants with rouched ankles, long velvet coats with peak lapels, embroidered lapel jackets, velvet smoking options, collarless jackets with embellished sleeves and double-breasted velvet numbers with fur emphasis on the shoulders were interesting additions.

It was a breathtaking array of glitter, dazzle and glamour with crystals, sequins and zari along with giant beaded tasselled accents making dramatic style statements. Corsets were a popular choice, teamed with feathered skirts, slit gowns, ornate lehengas or as minis with long shoulder capes.

Triple talaq not acceptable form of behaviour between man and woman: Salman Khurshid,"Congress leader Salman Khurshid. (Source: Express Photo by Prem Nath Pandey) Congress leader Salman Khurshid. (Source: Express Photo by Prem Nath Pandey)

Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Wednesday said triple talaq was not an acceptable form of behaviour between a man and a woman. Speaking at a national conference on ‘Post Colonialism: Indian Response And Transformation’ in Noida, he noted that five judges of the apex court with their varied viewpoints concluded that the practice of triple talaq was against the basic tenets of the Holy Quran and violated the Islamic law Shariat.

“All the five judges deciding the triple talaq case, more or less, accepted that the practice was not an acceptable form of behaviour between a man and a woman. The top judges came to different conclusions in the case. Some may say that minds of judges are programmed in post-colonial India…constrained by colonial education. Some may say this is the way human beings differ…every mind responds differently because of different experiences, education, DNA, family, cultural background. Somebody may say it is acceptable and somebody may say it is unacceptable,” he said.

Elaborating further, the former Union minister said it was rather self-destructive to say that “everything which is negative should be put at the door of colonialism in our country”. He also called upon the youths to become “citizens of the world with roots in India”.

Delhi AAP MLA Anil Bajpai said India was a free nation but we were still fighting for real freedom. “Partition has done a lot of damage to the country and it is the responsibility of the youths to mend the differences,” he said.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena sacks justice minister for criticising Hambantota port deal with China,"Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. (Source: PTI) Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. (Source: PTI)

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday sacked his outspoken justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for criticising the government’s USD 1.1 billion deal with China to develop the strategic Hambantota port. Sirisena removed Rajapakshe following a request from the United National Party (UNP) to dismiss the minister who had publicly denounced the government’s July 29 decision to sell a 70-per cent stake in the port to a state-run Chinese firm, a move that could raise security concerns in India.

UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said that Rajapakshe was given a deadline till Monday by the UNP leadership to rectify his critical statement.

However, Rajapakshe had failed to do so and as a result the party has now decided he must be removed from his cabinet post, Hashim was quoted as saying by the Colombo Gazette.

Hashim also said that Rajapakshe continued to make critical statements against the UNP and the government’s decisions.

Rajapakshe was quoted as saying that the port deal was a betrayal of the country’s sovereignty and he would make sure that the port is taken back from China.

Under the 99-year lease agreement, China’s state-run conglomerate China Merchant Port Holdings is to invest up to USD 1.1 billion in the port and marine-related activities.

The accumulated loss from the port was more than USD 300 million and the money realised from deal will set off the debts owed to China, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said.

Rajapakshe, who is also the minister in charge of the Buddhist order, was previously accused of aiding and abetting an extremist Buddhist monk who was promoting violence against the Muslim minority.

The UNP has also charged that Rajapakshe as the Minister of Justice had hampered the investigations against the family of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose nearly a decade-long rule was ended by Sirisena in 2015.

The UNP said that investigations against former strongman Rajapaksa and his followers on alleged misdeeds had taken over two and a half years, and Rajapakshe was responsible for deliberate slowing down of investigations.

Rajapakshe denied the accusation, saying it was not proper for the government to interfere in the judiciary.

Border Dispatch,"Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan.

Meena Menon was The Hindu’s correspondent in Islamabad for only nine months (August, 2013 to May, 2014) before she was kicked out. It is astonishing to learn from this memoir of how, in such a short time, her empathetic interest in anything and everything Pakistani enabled her to rise well above routine reporting (and routine harassment) to range across virtually the entire gamut of life as it is actually lived in that “distant neighbour” of ours.

Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. With a keen eye, a sharp ear, an open mind and a large heart, she kept in good cheer whatever the hurdles, made numerous friends, met everyone from top politicians to the proverbial taxi driver, wandered the by-lanes, shopped in different markets, explored the eating places, and did the sights, going to mosques and temples and churches around the capital.

Of course, she filed her regular reports, dutifully attended foreign office briefings, and informed her readers of political events and the proceedings in the National Assembly (Parliament). But she also immersed herself into Pakistan’s rich cultural life, interacted with artistes, painters, writers, social workers, political activists, fellow-journalists, and, of course, the aam admi. Instead of only obsessing over the India-Pakistan relationship, as many Indian reporters and most Indian diplomats do, it was Pakistan as a nation and a society, and Pakistanis as a people, who interested her. And, amusingly, she never allowed her minders, the two security guys who relentlessly trailed her (and whom she nick-named “Beard” and “Chubby”) to faze her or derail her from her purpose.

This is what makes this book so special: it takes in all the political and economic see-saw in Pakistan itself, and in our relationship with Pakistan, but rising above both the pride and the prejudice that often overwhelm our perceptions of that country, she unhesitatingly presents both the warts and the astonishing resilience of a people fighting fierce odds.

“I could walk around,” she writes, “and meet nice people”. “I had many friends and they were always helpful and kind”. She talks of “a senior politician who treated me like his daughter”. “Many parliamentarians were friendly,” she remarks, “even if they made anti-Indian statements.” A startling revelation is that “one place we felt quite welcome was the foreign office”! Elsewhere, she remarks, “this unconditional affection and warmth is overwhelming”. “Pakistani writers and journalists were always accessible” and “helped me understand their country”. She names a whole sheaf of them. She recounts her encounters with the wife of a Pakistani army general, Indu Mitha, who teaches “Bharatanatyam to enthusiastic Pakistanis” and Shenaz Minallah who, despite an attempt to burn down her headquarters, continues to run the Pakistan branch of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s “Art of Living”: “We do courses in mostly three cities and from twenty-odd people the number has swelled to over eighty per session”. There is a moving account of her friendship with the great Sufi singer, Abida Parveen, who says of her hopes for India and Pakistan: “Love is a force, it’s like the sea, it cannot break”. She interviews the Baloch Gandhi, Mama Qadeer, the proximate cause of her expulsion. And she admires Shoaib Sultan Khan, a development activist, “The Man from Pakistan”, who has done outstanding rural development work in Andhra Pradesh. She records, without further comment, Shoaib’s assessment of Rahul Gandhi who was much taken with his work: “this young man has his heart in the right place to do something for the poor”.

She contrasts “most of the media portrayal reinforcing the image of a backward and failed state” with “visitors (who) are pleasantly surprised when they see glimpses of a country that is different from what they think it is.” While surveying the many vicious disabilities to which the minorities are subjected (the Ahmedias are the worst treated, “the community lives on the razor’s edge”) she also finds space for “Pandit Chamanlal from Rawalpindi” asserting, somewhat startlingly, that “the Hindu community was not targeted in any way”.

Yet, she is no starry-eyed romantic. She sees the downside clearly: the “deep state” and its connections to terrorism; the persecution of Baloch dissidents and the atrocities inflicted on them; the blatant misuse of blasphemy laws; the sickening treatment of people with different sexual orientations; the awful collateral damage caused by drones; the soaring crime rate. There are graphic descriptions of suicide bomb blasts in the heart of Islamabad to which she was personal witness; and grim stories of mindless cruelty, murder and mayhem.

Her undiluted admiration is reserved for Pakistani journalists. “Journalists can be shot, kidnapped, threatened and abused…life hung on a thread”. Yet, “journalism in Pakistan has been bold and brave”. She concludes, “The government and the security empire have the upper hand. Yet, with all the powers at their command, they have not crushed the free spirit of the people who write and report at will”.

Meena Menon was unceremoniously thrown out of Pakistan in under a year. She harbours no bitterness. Balanced as ever, she remarks, of herself and the treatment meted out to Pak journalists in India: “there is no low both countries cannot stoop to.” Her final message is: “there is a call for peace and reason, however faint it may be, and it is coming from an invisible majority which is yet to come into its own”.

Triple Talaq verdict: Activists welcome Supreme Court decision,"Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict at Byculla on Tuesday. (Source: Express Photo/Prashant Nadkar) Women celebrate the Supreme Court verdict at Byculla on Tuesday. (Source: Express Photo/Prashant Nadkar)

The decision by a five-judge Supreme Court bench to bar instant triple talaq has been welcomed by most Muslim social activists. “It is a big day for Muslim women as constitutional safeguards will now be applicable for them. We hope that now on, there would be some steps taken to codify the personal law. However, we want to make it clear that we are not in favour of uniform civil code. We are seeking rights that have been promised in the Quran and Hadith itself,” said Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan convenor Noorjehan Safia Niaz.

“The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has been in existence for over 30 years. They took ages to come up with a model Nikahnama which was the need of the community. There is a need for internal reforms…,” said Aamir Edressy, president of the Association for Muslim Professionals. For women whose lives were derailed by triple talaq, verdict brings hope. Click here to read.

The AIMPLB has, meanwhile, stated that the SC verdict should not be misused by the government to try to interfere with personal laws through legislation. “We are aware that many Muslims believe Talaq-e-Bidat given in one sitting, has basis in religious beliefs. However, while we accept the judgment, we will examine the issues of its implementation and will work to resolve the same,” the AIMPLB said in a statement. Reacting to the judgment, women’s rights legal expert and activist Flavia Agnes said its implementation on the ground will be the key.

“There have been previous orders, including in the Shamim Ara case of 2002, which had invalidated arbitrary triple talaq. There is a need to have community awareness to ensure that this practice is stopped. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board had said in its affidavit before the Supreme Court that it will advise the Qazis performing marriages under the Islamic law to include a statement in the nikahnama itself to exclude the practice. This should be effectively done by those performing the marriages,” Agnes said.

Shahid Afridi blasts 42-ball century in Natwest T20,"Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 Blast match. Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 Blast match.

Former Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi scored 101 from 43 balls in the NatWest t20 Blast match while playing for Hampshire against Derbyshire that included ten boundaries and seven maximums. The right-hander scored his first T20 hundred in 256 matches that came in 42 deliveries. The Derbyshire skipper Gary Wilson after winning the toss elected to bowl first.

Afridi along with wicket-keeper batsman Calvin Dickinson scored 43 for the first wicket before Dickinson was out for 18 by Ben Cotton. The fall of wicket didn’t really effect Afridi’s scoring rate as he continued to hammer Derbyshire bowlers all around the park.

Afridi then stitched a partnership of 97 runs with captain James Vince for second wicket.

A maiden #T20 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ for @SAfridiOfficial, off just 42 balls! Epic. Incredible. Brutal. Sublime. Sizzling. Brilliant. BOOM BOOM! 💥 pic.twitter.com/auqII1cbsN — NatWest T20 Blast (@NatWestT20Blast) 22 August 2017

The former Pakistan cricketer’s innings was put to an end by New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry after he pulled a short delivery only to give a catch to Ben Cotton at deep fine leg area.

A standing ovation for Boom Boom. The legend departs for 101 off 43 balls 💪 Follow the action ➡️http://t.co/VNi5JbrMDapic.twitter.com/ZD6SOLleUW — NatWest T20 Blast (@NatWestT20Blast) 22 August 2017

Hampshire went on to compile a total of 249/8 in 20 overs which is the highest T20 score in Derbyshire. Skipper Vince too chipped in with a fifty during their innings.

Afridi has always been known as one of the most aggressive batsmen in world cricket and the right-hander displayed his abilities in the very first innings that he played in 1996 against Sri Lanka.

The right-hander scored the then fastest hundred in limited overs which came off just 37 balls. His long-standing record was later broken by Corey Anderson in 2014 who completed hundred runs in 36 balls.

An year later, the record was grabbed by South Africa’s AB de Villiers who smacked a ton in 31 balls against West Indies in 2015.

"Triple talaq verdict: ‘For us, religion comes first,’ say some","An October 2016 file photo of a protest in Mumbai against ‘interference’ with the practice of triple talaq. (Source: Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran) An October 2016 file photo of a protest in Mumbai against ‘interference’ with the practice of triple talaq. (Source: Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran)

Even as many Muslims hailed the Supreme Court’s decision to do away with triple talaq, there were some dissenting voices. Haji Mohammed Raz (55), who owns a garment shop, says, “Islam is the most free and modern religion, and all the rules contained within the Quran and the Hadith are good for men and women.”

“Women also get advantages as they do not have to worry about income and often direct the working of the household. Both women and men get advantages and both have to make sacrifices. An individual cannot have everything.” He adds, “For us, our religion comes first and if we do not follow the scriptures we cannot be Muslim.”

He feels his views are aligned with the Constitution. Raz adds, “The Constitution clearly states that every individual has a right to practice any religion the way they see fit.” Some believe that the Supreme Court’s intervention was an interference in the personal issues of the Muslim community and it would have been more prudent for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board to have dealt with the issue.

“Yes, the AIMPLB is the right body for this, because their decision will take into account the scriptures and ordinary Muslim sentiments, which have been hurt by this decision,” says Jaseem Toor (38), a tour consultant with National Holidays. He adds, “This nation is a secular nation, which means every individual should be able to practise his religion without interference.”

Some, however, supported the verdict as being in line with Islamic tenets. Sadam Sheikh (25), who works as an taxi driver said, “The SC verdict is sound because instant triple talaq is not Islamic. The Quran clearly lays out the procedure for divorce, which takes a period of three months when the couple try to work things out. If they still can’t resolve differences, then divorce should be granted.”

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee’s book on India’s coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it — from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore’s grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal’s foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi’s nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam’s last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‘Coal on Sale’, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation — the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‘coal on sale’ to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee’s next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‘Notes from an Auditor’. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai’s tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail — including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India’s energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‘un-put-down-able’ book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen’s Money and Power, any of David Halberstam’s works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie’s books or TN Ninan’s Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that’s the pity.

Jean-Michael Seri coy over Barcelona talk,"Jean-Michael Seri was staying coy on talk of a big-money move to Barcelona. Jean-Michael Seri was staying coy on talk of a big-money move to Barcelona.

Nice midfielder Jean-Michael Seri was staying coy on talk of a big-money move to Barcelona amid reports he has already reached agreement on the terms of a contract with the Spanish giants.

The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international played for Nice in their 2-0 defeat to Napoli on Tuesday that saw them miss out on a place in the Champions League group stage as they lost their play-off tie 4-0 on aggregate.

“No it was not my last match for Nice. I will be at Amiens on Saturday,” said Seri, who sports daily L’Equipe reported had agreed a four-year deal with Barcelona over the weekend.

A transfer for up to 40 million euros (USD 47 million, £36.7 million) has been mooted as the Catalans desperately look to strengthen their squad with the proceeds of Neymar’s world record 222 million-euro move to Paris Saint-Germain.

But Nice have reportedly been reluctant to negotiate so far and Seri added: “I don’t know much about it. I said to everyone to leave me to concentrate on the Champions League and that after we would see if I stayed or went.”

Seri joined Nice in 2015 from the Portuguese club Pacos de Ferreira and has been outstanding in the last two seasons as the French side have finished fourth and then third in Ligue 1

World Badminton Championship: A surfeit of superheroes in Glasgow,"Glaswegian Vincent Deighan, a.k.a. Frank Quitely, has sketched superheroes such as Batman and Superman. Glaswegian Vincent Deighan, a.k.a. Frank Quitely, has sketched superheroes such as Batman and Superman.

When Super Dan flew into Glasgow in pursuit of his half-dozenth World Championship title, the original Superman was zooming over the Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery. The civil reception for players and officials by the Glasgow City Council and BWF – hosted at the iconic red matte façade — coincided with The Art of Comics exhibition hosted by the gallery to honour local sketch artist Frank Quitely.

The 49-year-old Glaswegian — born Vincent Deighan, and taking off on ‘Frank Quietly’, his cheeky alter ego — has sketched Superman, Batman, X-Men and Jupiter’s Legacy in recent years, and the city devoted an entire six months to displaying his largest collection of artwork, while also doffing a hat to other comic legend writers like Mark Millar and Neal Adams.

Superman acquires the subtle Scottish square jaw when he hovers over Kelvingrove, penciled by Frank Quitely. The definitive strokes of a comic sketch more than made up for the gloom that had descended on the Kelvingrove when its piece de resistance, the Christ of Saint John of the Cross – a Salvador Dali classic which needs more rumination to breathe it in than mere seeing – was taken to London on one of its promised rotations. It’ll move to Florida next, and Glasgow needed Frank Quitely’s stick strokes to brighten things up a little.

While Glasgow’s favourite building boasts some Dutch Old Masters, French Impressionists and the best of Scottish art – including that of design icon Charles Rennis Mackintosh – it’s the contemporary art exhibitions that the Kelvingrove staff get excited putting together. AC/DC and the Glasgow Boys were mega hits, while ‘Costumes of Kylie Minogue’ drew a surprisingly large crowd few years back — with the common refrain about how petite she was.

Badminton may not be the biggest sport this corner of the planet, but gallery staff were keen to take a shot at compiling shuttle’s best artefacts.

Scotland’s best sketched boy who never grew up is Peter Pan. Over this next week, we’ll know if there’s an ageless Chinese reincarnate of JM Barrie’s best creation, and if he goes by the name Lin Dan.

"Not reviewing reservation system, says govt; nod to panel for sub-quotas among OBCs, creamy layer limit up by Rs 2 lakh","The Cabinet also raised the income limit defining ‘creamy layer’ for OBC reservation by Rs 2 lakh per annum. The Cabinet also raised the income limit defining ‘creamy layer’ for OBC reservation by Rs 2 lakh per annum.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday ruled out having a relook at the reservation system in the country even as it approved setting up setting up of a commission for sub-categorisation within the other backward classes

for even distribution of reservation benefit.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had in September, 2015 pitched for a review of the reservation policy, contending it has been used for political ends and suggested setting up of an apolitical committee to examine who needs the facility and for how long.

“Neither there is any proposal before the government, nor would there be a proposal (before it in the future),” Jaitley said when asked whether the government will review the reservation system as proposed by Bhagwat.

Jaitley, however, said that the government has approved setting up of a commission to examine the sub categorisation of backward communities in the central list to ensure that the benefits extended to OBCs reach all the communities.

Talking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, Jaitley said as many as 11 states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, West Bengal and the Jammu region in Jammu and Kashmir already have such categorisation in state government jobs.

There is no sub categorisation in the central list. The proposed commission will examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among caste and communities, including the broad categories of OBCs included in the central list. The commission will submit its report in 12 weeks from the day it is set up.

“There will be more equitable distribution amongst the OBCs themselves (of the benefits),” Jaitley explained. The proposed commission, to be set up under Article 340 of the Constitution, will submit its report within 12 weeks from the date its chairperson is appointed.

According to a press release issued by the government, the panel will examine the “extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes and communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list”.

It will also work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters — in a scientific approach — for sub-categorisation within such OBCs. The commission will also undertake an exercise of identifying the respective castes/communities/ sub-castes/synonyms in the central list of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.

The Cabinet also raised the income limit defining ‘creamy layer’ for OBC reservation by Rs 2 lakh per annum. The ministry of social justice and empowerment had proposed that OBC families which earn more than Rs 8 lakh per year should be classified as ‘creamy layer’ -— the ceiling which bars members of the other backward classes from availing reservations in employment.

There had been three revisions of the creamy layer bar. It was fixed at Rs one lakh in 1993 and hiked to Rs 2.5 lakh in 2004 and Rs 4.5 lakh in 2008. The present ceiling of Rs six lakh came into being in 2013.

"Freed on bail, Purohit gets Army escort due to ‘threat to his life’","Purohit, who left the Taloja jail at around 11.15 am, was escorted by a team of Army personnel to the Colaba Military Station. (File photo) Purohit, who left the Taloja jail at around 11.15 am, was escorted by a team of Army personnel to the Colaba Military Station. (File photo)

Two days after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court, Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit was released from Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday, almost nine years after he was arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) in connection with the Malegaon 2008 blast.

Purohit, who left the Taloja jail at around 11.15 am, was escorted by a team of Army personnel to the Colaba Military Station. “Two vehicles were roped in to ferry Purohit as there are inputs of a perceived threat to his life,” said an Army officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Purohit’s family reached the military unit in South Mumbai before his arrival. Family sources said they would remain in Mumbai till the court exempts Purohit from personal appearance in the case.

At the time of his arrest in 2008, Purohit was working with the Southern Command Liaison Unit (SCLU) of Military Intelligence, and had enrolled for a course in Arabic language at the Army Education Corps Training College and Centre at Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh. Before joining the course, he was posted at Devlali in Nashik as part of his deputation with the SCLU.

While Purohit was suspended after his arrest, sources said that the Army would take a decision on his reinstatement after studying the bail order. Sources said according to the rules, Purohit must report to the unit and inform his office of his release on bail. “Purohit, who is placed under Discipline and Vigilance (DV) ban, will report at the SCLU headquarters in Pune shortly. While he won’t be entitled to any promotion or career advancement courses until he is acquitted by a competent court, he will be required to report to work everyday,” said an officer who did not want to be identified.

Meanwhile, the special NIA court is expected to hear the arguments on Purohit’s discharge plea, which had begun before his bail plea was heard. Special Public Prosecutor Avinash Rasal said Purohit has sought exemption from appearance for a day, stating that he is completing formalities with the military personnel. “He submitted that the administrative formalities are yet to be completed and hence sought exemption for a day. The court allowed the application,” said Rasal. Purohit is expected to appear before the court on Thursday.

While granting bail to Purohit on Monday, the Supreme Court observed that there were contradictions in the chargesheets filed by the Maharashtra ATS and the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The case dates back to September 29, 2008, when six people were killed in a bomb blast at Malegaon. Purohit was arrested in November 2008.

UFC gets aggressive with technology to enhance its fights,"WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than billion WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than billion

The UFC is turning to a high-tech platform that could enhance the way fans watch fights. The world’s leading mixed martial arts promotion has reached a partnership with Heed. The joint venture between WME-IMG and AGT International wants to change the way fans connect with sports at home or at a live event through sensor-measured data.

WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than $4 billion. “Our goal is to revolutionize our sport, our events and ultimately enhance the fan experience,” UFC CFO Andrew Schleimer said.

Heed also has struck deals with Professional Bull Riders and Euroleague basketball. The new format uses sensors that collect data on everything from fan and competitor emotion to real-time event tracking that could change how fights, bull rides or other events are scored.

“This gives us a solution that is better than the human alternative to judging the difficulty of a bull ride,” PBR CEO Sean Gleason said.

Gleason said PBR would roll out a side-by-side system in January and use the Heed technology as a full replacement to human judging in 2019.

“We’ll have bull meters or information on G-forces that were applied that are available in television, digital products and social apps,” he said. “It helps new fans understand the difficulty and nuances of bull riding.”

No bull, PBR believed science can almost reinvent the sport. Heed will outfit both bull and rider with technology that measures spin, direction changes, kicks and rider control.

“It’s not only an informational and educational tool for fans but will help new fans understand the difficulties and nuances of bull rides,” Gleason said. “None of us have been on a bull, so it’s hard to have a frame of reference to how difficult bull riding is and how athletic it is. This tool will help explain that in scientific data. That will be great for the sport. This is revolutionary, not evolutionary for our sport. We are incorporating technology into the core of our scoring and the competitive results.”

At the premier European basketball competition, the EuroLeague, sensors will be deployed in all 16 arenas. They will collect data from fans, players and coaches. Heed will transform this information into video content and performance reports for fans on site and at home through TV broadcasting, social media and other digital distribution channels.

Heed sampled its technology on an old UFC fight that kept a running tally of blocks, jabs, hooks, overhands and uppercuts on the side and bottom of the screen.

“Fight Pass could be a very unique place to have some of these specific content and stories that we’re creating with Heed,” Schleimer said.

Heed says its technology can track fan or fighter emotions ranging from sadness and surprise to disgust and fear. The UFC said those tools, along with the fight tracking, could help the company stay more informed on a fighter’s health.

“We believe there’s a tremendous opportunity for us as UFC and for the fighters to benefit from a health and safety perspective,” Schleimer said. “Just by virtue of the types of things that we’re capturing, we’re going to be very much focused on how we can leverage that to enhance our brand, our promotion and our athletes, which we’re always looking to do, anything related to health and safety.”

Would you like to be matched at work?,"Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

“I want to do fraandship with you…” is something every woman has heard, being randomly accosted on the road, and yes, that has now translated online, to not just Facebook and other social networking sites, but also the professional LinkedIn. While I’m usually careful about avoiding “friendship requests” from people I don’t know on Facebook, I’m not that reticent on LinkedIn, since it’s a site where professionals pursue career goals. But, I’ve had to un-connect after receiving “friendship requests” in my mailbox marked to “My dear…”.

So, when a new matrimonial app decides to pitch itself as the perfect playing ground for dating with a purpose, using the professional networking site as its database, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it would weed out the Romeos. Promatch, playing cupid to ambitious careerists, claims to be a notch above the typical dating apps, which are used for “flirting” and “casual relationships”, among other things. Promatch, on the other hand, since it has LinkedIn verified profiles, effectively points you towards mates who are (hopefully!) “focused towards a serious relationship” and get this—you can search in same industry, match your incomes and city.

First off, hookups happen everywhere, whether it’s at work or elsewhere. It’s the same people, after all, whether you meet at a bar, through common friends or at work, with or without an app. Potential partners can’t grow a sincerity gene, just because you happen to be a ‘pro’ match. But, what’s commendable is the clear-headed approach it takes to matrimony, something Indians are famous for. While it’s fine to kiss all the frogs you like, make your “mistakes” before you find your Prince Charming or the woman of your dreams, when it comes to marriage, there’s a very decided checklist, which puts the earning capacity of a spouse right on top. And, conventionally, parents have looked for a doctor for their doctor son or daughter and other similar matches. And, while such an app may sound like fun, it’s not really, since it’s similar to the “bio-data” that gets sent around to relatives and all those who reach out, listing educational qualifications, even parents’ and relatives’ career progression, if someone is well-placed in a government job, etc. It’s all laid out, bare bones, without any pretensions. In this generation, where we act all this doesn’t matter and we’re one better than our parents, such an app calls out our innate…well, “Indian-ness”. Will the guy understand my hours? Can he support me if I take a break after a baby? Will the woman be able to equally pitch in for my dream home EMIs? Well, let’s face it, we’re like that only. Or a lot of us still are.

Matching incomes is not a bad thing, ideally. I remember, when a friend’s marriage was breaking up, one of the things was that rankled was their approach to money. While she was middle-class in her thinking, putting off the lights and fans whenever she left a room or haggled with auto-wallahs, the guy was beyond such cares. On a daily basis, such things can blow up into something huge. So yes, coming from a similar income bracket isn’t such a bad idea. Same industry? What about all the gossip that follows if you break up? And, what about all your dark secrets that can be laid bare through common contacts? In other words, just like when you apply for a job, it’s easy to do a background check! So, it’s time to hold back on the drinks at office parties…you don’t want that making it to your profile!

But, while a friend I checked with, said she didn’t mind giving it a try, some others question the concept of getting matched with a “pro”. “I would much rather go with the flow,” one guy said, adding “What my partner does is not really the question. It’s the person that’s important.” Another, in his early twenties, who loves video games was thrilled with the idea of maybe finding someone from the gaming industry, so they could literally play together. However, he added sagely, “I think it’s for people who care about the ‘status’ of their spouse…who feel the need to show off, perhaps.”

Well, how about doing it the old-fashioned way? Whether you swipe right or left on Tinder if you find someone hot (or not), or check out their incomes, don’t lose focus on the real thing—finding a partner who understands you, not just your cranky boss and working hours, though that can be a good start. So, go ahead, log on! Finding the right someone never sounded as easy….or tough! Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it.

Taliban reacts to Donald Trump’s Afghan policy: Trump’s Afghan strategy is ‘nothing new’,"“For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. (Photo: AP “For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. (Photo: AP

The Taliban dismissed Donald Trump’s strategy for Afghanistan as vague and “nothing new” today after the US president cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country. “For now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,” in Afghanistan, told AFP.

He added that the militants were preparing a formal statement which would be released later. Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America’s longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief late Monday, though he did not offer specifics.

He said he had concluded “the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable”, leaving a vacuum that terrorists “would instantly fill.” A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the “arrogant behaviour” of previous presidents such as George Bush.

“He is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. “For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are resh and we will continue this war until our last breath,” he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location.

He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government “is a US puppet”. The insurgents also signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack late Monday.

The rocket landed in a field in the city’s diplomatic quarter, with no casualties reported. While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan.

He also lambasted ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to “agents of chaos.” A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan’s shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump “has proved it’s a Crusade”.

“His statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),” he said. Prior to Trump’s announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

"Alleging slave-like treatment, 50 foreign inmates go on hunger strike","Before the strike, they had written several letters to the President, the Prime Minister and the Ministry of External Affairs. All of the letters, however, have gone unanswered, they claimed. (Representational Image) Before the strike, they had written several letters to the President, the Prime Minister and the Ministry of External Affairs. All of the letters, however, have gone unanswered, they claimed. (Representational Image)

AT LEAST 50 inmates, from countries ranging from Sudan to Pakistan, at the detention facility in Lampur, Monday went on an “indefinite hunger strike” protesting the “slave-like” treatment meted out to them. Alleging that they are extorted at the facility, they said that they have to suffer poor living conditions, and are given bad quality food and expired medicines.

Before the strike, they had written several letters to the President, the Prime Minister and the Ministry of External Affairs. All of the letters, however, have gone unanswered, they claimed. A letter dated August 17 states that the reason for the “indefinite hunger strike” is the “indefinite incarceration of three-thirteen months by the Indian Foreigner Regional Registration Offices (FRRO) without any court judgment”. The letter also alleges that extortion takes place in the name of “real deportation” for which the charge varies between Rs 70,000 and Rs 1,20,000. It adds, “We are not slaves nor goods for sale by the Indian FRRO”.

The letter also alleges the “black Africans” are arrested by the “FRRO Police” as “street black dogs for their skin color and concentrated in the camp”. It repeatedly urges the authorities to “respect African culture”, provide “African food” and “not… rice and unpeeled potatoes every day”. Chinyere Nnamdi, from Nigeria, who formerly worked as a soccer coach in a Delhi league and is a barber as well, said he was arrested on November 23 last year. He said, “The conditions here are not conducive to live, the food quality is really bad… two slices of bread in the morning… unpeeled potatoes with some water sauce. They also give us expired medicines.”

Mohammad Qamar, identified as a “Pakistan national” who was arrested on February 7, 2015, claimed he had been wrongfully detained and that he hails from Meerut. “I have been in custody for five years and I have been detained here for more than two years. I am not a Pakistani national. I was born in Meerut. My wife and five children live in Meerut,” he claimed.

Onukawa Ugochukwu Bright, a Nigerian national, claimed that his passport and visa were valid when he was arrested. “The FRRO conducted a raid and arrested five Nigerian nationals last August. I was one of them. I told them that I was a student and I gave them my passport but they arrested me and brought me to this deportation camp. I have been here for a year,” he said.

Mohammad Hussain, a Pakistani national, said that he decided to go on “hunger strike” because his case was being delayed. “I was detained on October 12, 2012, and was acquitted by the sessions court soon after. Then I was acquitted by the High Court in May 2015. Then the special cell appealed to the Supreme Court in March 2017,” he said.

On being asked about the allegations, Additional CP (FRRO), Prabhakar, said that the questions should be addressed to “Secretary Social Welfare, GNCT Of Delhi”. Despite repeated attempts, Secretary, Social Welfare, A K Jain, did not respond. A Delhi government spokesperson said, “If at all there are any lapses related to living conditions, then there will be zero tolerance.”

"Delhi court to frame charges against Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia on September 14","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal (Source: PTI /File Photo) Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal (Source: PTI /File Photo)

A Delhi court today fixed September 14 for framing of charges against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia in a criminal defamation complaint. Metropolitan Magistrate Vijay Kumar Jha allowed the plea of Kejriwal and Sisodia, who were directed to appear today, seeking exemption for personal appearance for the day. Advocate Umesh Gupta, appearing for Kejriwal and Sisodia, sought exemption for the leaders on the ground that they were busy in bypolls in Bawana in north west Delhi today. Besides the two AAP leaders, the court would also frame charges against Yogendra Yadav in the case.

The court had on August 2 passed order on framing of notice (charge) on a criminal defamation complaint filed against the two AAP leaders, who sought quashing of the plea, and Yadav by advocate Surender Kumar Sharma who was denied a ticket by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to contest assembly polls. The court had said in the order that the contentions on behalf of accused persons do no sustain and proceeded to frame notice under the CrPC against them. Yadav was a member of the National Executive of the AAP until 2015 when he was expelled for alleged anti-party activities. Later, he floated his own party Swaraj India.

Sharma, in his complaint, had alleged that in 2013 he was approached by volunteers of AAP who had asked him to contest the Delhi Assembly elections on a party ticket, saying Kejriwal was pleased with his social service. He filled up the application form to contest the polls after being told by Sisodia and Yadav that AAP’s Political Affairs Committee had decided to give him the ticket. But it was denied to him later.

On October 14, 2013, the complainant claimed that articles in newspapers carried “defamatory, unlawful and derogatory words used by the accused persons” which he said had lowered his reputation in the Bar and the society. Opposing the complaint, the AAP leaders had submitted that cancellation or allotment of an election ticket was the prerogative of the party and the complainant had not divulged correct information regarding the cases pending against him.

On the basis of the complaint, the trial court had earlier sought their presence before it in the matter. It had granted bail to Kejriwal, Sisodia and Yadav after they had appeared before it in pursuance to summonses. The summonses were issued on the complaint under sections 499, 500 (defamation) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC, with the trial court saying there was prima facie material to summon the accused. The Delhi High Court had earlier refused to stay the trial court proceedings in the case.

Grace Mugabe returns to Zimbabwe after South Africa assault allegation,"In this Feb. 21, 2017 file photo, Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe addresses party supporters at an event to mark her husband, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s upcoming 93rd birthday in Harare, Zimbabwe.

(AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi, File)

Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe returned from South Africa early on Sunday, state media reported, after a 20-year-old model accused her of assault in an upmarket Johannesburg hotel room. South African police had placed border posts on “red alert” to prevent her leaving the country, but a security source told Reuters on Friday that the wife of 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe had been granted diplomatic immunity.

Zimbabwean state media reported that the president and first lady arrived in Harare aboard an Air Zimbabwe plane in the early hours of Sunday. A source confirmed this to Reuters. A bruised Gabriella Engels has accused Grace Mugabe of whipping her with an electric extension cable a week ago as she waited with two friends in a luxury hotel suite to meet one of Mugabe’s adult sons.

President Mugabe attended a South African Development Community summit in Pretoria on Saturday, but his 52-year-old wife was not there or part of his delegation. Harare has made no official comment on the saga and requests for comment from Zimbabwean government officials have gone unanswered. The South African government has limited all official comment to the police ministry and international relations department spokespeople did not answer calls for comment.

South Africa’s main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), blamed the ministers of police, international relations and defence for the failure to detain Mugabe and said it wants the matter investigated. “The DA will be demanding an immediate parliamentary inquiry into (the) government’s complicity in allowing Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe to flee the country in the dead of night to avoid criminal prosecution,” DA whip John Steenhuisen said in a statement.

Compounding the awkward diplomatic situation, commercial flights between Zimbabwe and South Africa were grounded on Friday and Saturday, affecting both national carriers, after unexpected checks for operating permits. South African Airways resumed flights to Zimbabwe, it said in a statement on Sunday, and an Air Zimbabwe flight also departed from Harare to South Africa on Sunday morning.

India A concede lead as batsmen struggle against South Africa A spinners,"Disappointing outing for Karun Nair as he scored just one run. (Source: File) Disappointing outing for Karun Nair as he scored just one run. (Source: File)

Another disappointing day for India A batsmen as they struggled against South Africa A spinners to concede a 46-run first innings lead to the hosts in Potchefstroom on Monday. The visitors started the day’s play at 181/3 but no resistance from the middle-order saw them get bundle out for 276 on the third day of second, and final, unofficial Test. In reply, South Africa A were 138/4 at stumps and have stretched their overall lead to 184.

Apart from the top three Ravikumar Samarth (77), Sudip Chatterjee (46) and Shreyas Iyer (65), no other India A batsman put up a fight against the opposition spinners.. It could have been worse for Karun Nair-led unit had Shahbaz Nadeem not chipped in with a 36 lower down the order.

India A, trailing the series 0-1, found going tough against off-spinner Dane Piedt (4/70) and leg-spinner Shaun von Berg (2/84). Both took lion’s share of the wicket as Dane Paterson was the only stand out seamer with figures of 3/48. In their second innings, South Africa A rode on Stephen Cook’s unbeaten 55 to end the day in commanding position. The bowlers started well for the visitors before Cook and Andile Phehlukwayo combined well for an unbeaten stand.

India now need a special effort with both bat and ball to level the series. Not only do they need to pick early wickets, but score quick runs when they come out to bat for the second innings. Skipper Nair would like to lead from the front if he gets an opportunity to bat in the second innings.

Donald Trump hints at pardon for former sheriff Joe Arpaio,"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

US President Donald Trump hinted on Tuesday that he would issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, a controversial former sheriff convicted last month of criminal contempt in a racial profiling case. Trump, who had already held out the possibility of a pardon for Arpaio, decided against announcing it at a major rally in Arizona on Tuesday night but hinted he would step in at some point.

“I’ll make a prediction. I think he’s going to be just fine, okay? But I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good.” Arpaio, an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, was the sheriff of Maricopa County in Phoenix before he lost a re-election bid last year. He was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

"Panama govt says to demand visas from Venezuelans, slams Nicolas Maduro","Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro (REUTERS/File Photo) Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro (REUTERS/File Photo)

Panama’s government said on Tuesday that from October Venezuelans wishing to enter the country would need a visa, accusing the administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of undermining democracy at home and security abroad. Speaking a few days after a visit to Panama by US Vice President Mike Pence, the country’s president Juan Carlos Varela said the visa requirement would take effect on Oct. 1 and remain in place until “democratic order” was restored in Venezuela.

“Given the break in the democratic order in Venezuela, a situation that puts at risk our security, our economy … and after a careful analysis, I’ve taken the decision to demand visas from Venezuelan citizens wanting to travel to Panama,” Varela said in a brief televised message to the nation. Varela said the situation in Venezuela had deteriorated since the government decided to press ahead with a 545-member constituent assembly in the face of strong criticism from around the Americas, including the United States and Mexico.

On Friday, the assembly granted itself lawmaking powers, dealing a new blow to the opposition-controlled congress, whose decisions have been nullified by the pro-government Supreme Court. Large numbers of Venezuelans have left their country due to economic and political turmoil. According to Varela, some 60,000 Venezuelans have moved to Panama in the last six years.

Boys don’t cry: Who are men really when they are alone?,"(Illustration: Subrata Dhar) (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

I’m 19, razor thin, restless of mind, but overwhelmingly quiet. It has been a year since my father left town on a transfer, leaving mom behind to the hapless task of raising a bitter, confrontational boy. My maternal grandfather has just died. Three days after his last rites have been performed, I arrive at his home, after appearing for an exam. Every face I encounter is sombre, there is soreness in each eye. The women look distinctly bedraggled, lifeless. The men, all of them, are absent, either physically or emotionally. I see mom through the curtains that separate men from the women, sitting in a corner, surrounded by her sisters, blank and weak. My stomach suddenly collapses on me. I feel this surge, a wet force behind my eyes. My mind is a confused tangle of emotions over what is expected of me. I turn around and place myself in the huddle of men, somehow managing not to break into tears.

For at least 25 years of my life, I did not shed a tear. Not that I was clinically recording the fact, but, as far as memory serves right, I simply refused to give in whenever a situation arose — be it a death in the family, breakups, academic failures or even the sheer, physical pain of injury. Often my ideological tussles with dad, which I eventually lost, left me broken. Emotionally overwhelmed, I resorted to anger, even to insults, but never to the slow eloquence of wet-eyed stutters. To me, they were a mark of weakness, a “feminine” side that, like most men, I was raised to disown.

Masculinity means many things to many men. In my late teens, I interpreted it as the necessity to disagree or to hold a contrarian view. If dad looked west, I looked east merely because I felt I had the choice to do so. Defeats, whether physical or mental, at that age, can be jarring. Judgement is what a boy, in a crowd of hyper-masculine men, fears the most. I decided I would rather be alone than be judged, tying up with it my earliest ideas of dignity and self-respect. I made sure that while I did not gain in height, I did not lose anything in the eyes of those watching me.

The men that I came across, inside or outside home, exhibited an equal aversion to appearing vulnerable. They wanted to be strong, they believed themselves to be strong and they dismissed anything else as a sign of weakness. Auraton ki tarah roya matt karo (Don’t cry like a woman) — is a refrain that was both an insult and an injury to the likes of us.

Years later, I realised, there was a vacuum behind each stubborn face. A vacuum, it was espoused, women were marked to fill. Six years from the day I hid from my mother in broad daylight in a room in Pune, I broke into tears over a minor disagreement with a woman. I was tired of the charade, embarrassed too. For 25 years, I had taught myself to believe that the other side of the wall was where all the “real” men gathered. If you found yourself on the wrong side, as I did myself now, I would be earmarked as a pushover, considered either weak or feminine, or both.

I promised myself it was a one-off, never to be repeated — a warning, so to speak. But it was difficult to live up to that promise. I found myself breaking down more often, a lot more than expected. I started weeping as I watched movies, I cried when I longed for home and I sobbed my heart out when I failed to understand what was happening to me. It was like a dam had burst within.

Most men that boys look up to as role models are strong, stubborn characters, who radiate a kind of stony emotional strength. But what does it serve? All my life, growing up, I looked at dad and my uncles, as these incredibly sturdy men, who never wavered at moments of distress. But were they really impervious to grief and sorrow? Who were they, really, when they were alone? Did I know them? I wonder if they hid in washrooms and sobbed quietly or shed a drop in the pall of television-lit rooms when no one was looking. I wouldn’t think any less of them now if they did.

Two years ago, when my maternal grandmother died, I returned home to find my mother sobbing. This time, I did not turn my back on her. I hugged her and we wept together.

Singapore rejects US academic Huang Jing’s appeal against expulsion,"Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Singapore has rejected a US citizen’s appeal to stay in the city-state following the cancellation of his permanent residence status after the government branded him as an agent of foreign influence. Earlier this month, Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) revoked the permanent residence of Huang Jing, then a professor at Singapore’s prominent Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and of his wife, Shirley Yang Xiuping, also a US citizen. Both had appealed the decision.

The minister for home affairs has rejected their appeals and they were informed of the rejection Aug. 23, the MHA said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the decision was final. “Huang Jing and his wife will have to leave Singapore within a stipulated grace period. They will be permanently banned from re-entering Singapore,” the statement said.

The ministry’s decision to revoke Huang’s permanent residency this month was based on his alleged interactions with a foreign country with the aim of bringing about a change in the direction of Singapore’s foreign policy. It also said Huang’s wife was aware of his activities. The ministry did not identify the foreign country with which Huang was said to be interacting. Huang did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

China to again launch world’s fastest bullet train from September 21,"China is relaunching the world’s fastest bullet trains in September 2017, running at 350 kilometers (217 miles) per hour.

After cutting back the speed of the Beijing to Shanghai bullet train following a deadly crash, China is set to again make it one of the world’s fastest. New generation trains will service the route starting next month, making the 1,250-kilometer (777-mile) journey from the capital to Shanghai in just 4 hours, 30 minutes. The latest trains were unveiled in June and have a top speed of 400 kilometers per hour (250 mph), according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

China first ran trains at 350 kilometers per hour in August 2008, but cut speeds back to 250-300 kilometers per hour in 2011 following a two-train collision near the city of Wenzhou that killed 40 people and injured 191.

China has laid more than 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) of high-speed rail, with a target of adding another 10,000 kilometers (6,214 miles) by 2020. China has spent an estimated $360 billion on high-speed rail, building by far the largest network in the world.

China backs Pakistan after Donald Trump’s warning on terror safe havens,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while dismissing to Trump’s scathing criticism of Pakistan’s support to terror groups, said, “I think the international community should truly affirm” Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while dismissing to Trump’s scathing criticism of Pakistan’s support to terror groups, said, “I think the international community should truly affirm” Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism.

China on Tuesday jumped to the defence of its all-weather ally Pakistan in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s stern warning to it over providing safe havens to terrorists, saying that Islamabad is at the frontline of combating terrorism. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to announce his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to “agents of chaos” that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has “much to lose” by harbouring terrorists.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while reacting to Trump’s comments on Pakistan, said, “Hope the relevant policy decision by US side will be conducive to promoting security, stability of the relevant region.”

“(On) President Trump’s remarks on Pakistan, I should say that Pakistan is at the frontline of fighting terrorism, has made sacrifices in fighting terrorism, making an important contribution to upholding peace and stability,” Hua said, strongly defending Beijing’s all-weather friend.

Trump, in his address, said a pillar of his new strategy was a change in America’s approach to Pakistan.

He slammed Pakistan for its support to terror groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

“We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” Trump said.

“Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,” he said, in a warning to Pakistan.

Hua, in response to Trump’s scathing criticism of Pakistan’s support to terror groups, said, “I think the international community should truly affirm” the efforts by Pakistan in combating terrorism.

“We are pleased to see US and Pakistan to conduct cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts on the basis of mutual respect and contribute to the global peace and stability,” she said.

In his speech, Trump slammed Islamabad for harbouring militants who target US service members.

“But that will have to change. That will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country’s harbouring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace,” Trump said

Decoded: Why expensive wines taste better,"It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images) It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Expensive wines appear to be tastier, say scientists who have found that a higher price tag on the bottle causes the reward centre in the brain to trick the taste processing regions.

The phenomenon that identical products are perceived differently due to differences in price is called the “marketing placebo effect.”

As with placebo medications, it has an effect solely due to ascribed properties: “Quality has its price!”

“However, it has so far been unclear how the price information ultimately causes more expensive wine to also be perceived as having a better taste in the brain,” said Bernd Weber, from the University of Bonn in Germany.

The researchers assessed how different prices are translated into corresponding taste experiences in the brain, even if the wine tasted does not differ.

Thirty participants took part in the study, of which 15 were women and 15 were men, with an average age of around 30 years.

The wine tasting took place lying down in an MRI scanner, allowing brain activity to be recorded “online” while participants were tasting the wines. Each time, the price of the wine was shown first.

Only then around a millilitre of the respective wine was given to the participants via a tube in their mouths. The participants were then asked to rate via a button on a nine-point scale how good the wine tasted to them.

Their mouths were then rinsed with a neutral liquid and the next identical wine sample was given for tasting.

Researchers conducted the tests using an average to good quality red wine with a retail bottle prize of 12 euros.

In the MRI scanner, the price of this wine was shown randomly as 3, 6 and 18 euros.

“As expected, the subjects stated that the wine with the higher price tasted better than an apparently cheaper one,” said Hilke Plassmann from the INSEAD Business School in France.

Identical wine leads to a better taste experience when a greater quality expectation is associated with the wine due to its price.

The measurements of brain activity in the MRI scanner confirmed this. The research team discovered that above all parts of the medial pre-frontal cortex and also the ventral striatum were activated more when prices were higher.

While the medial pre-frontal cortex particularly appears to be involved in integrating the price comparison and thus the expectation into the evaluation of the wine, the ventral striatum forms part of the brain’s reward and motivation system.

“The reward and motivation system is activated more significantly with higher prices and apparently increases the taste experience in this way,” said Weber.

“Ultimately, the reward and motivation system plays a trick on us,” said INSEAD post-doctoral fellow Liane Schmidt.

When prices are higher, it leads us to believe that a taste is present that is not only driven by the wine itself, because the products were objectively identical in all of the tastings.

Former boss of Dinamo Zagreb shot and wounded,"Zdravko Mamic is now an advisor at Dinamo Zagreb. (Source: Reuters File) Zdravko Mamic is now an advisor at Dinamo Zagreb. (Source: Reuters File)

Zdravko Mamic, the former boss of Croatian football club Dinamo Zagreb and one of country’s richest men, was shot and wounded in the leg by two attackers in western Bosnia on Tuesday, local media reported. Dinamo Zagreb, where Mamic is now an advisor, called the incident “attempted murder”.

Web portal 24sata said Mamic, 58, was visiting his father’s grave near the Bosnian town of Tomislavgrad when two masked gunmen fired shots at him. He was transferred to a nearby hospital where he was treated for injuries to his leg, local media quoted a police spokesman as saying. Reuters could not immediately reach the police or representatives of Mamic for comment.

Mamic, a powerful figure in Croatian football who is currently on trial for tax evasion, has been the target of other physical attacks in the past few years, which soccer officials blamed on rival teams’ fans, but this was the first time he has been shot and the motive was unclear.

Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia’s biggest football club, said in a statement after Tuesday’s attack that it was “horrified by the armed attack and the attempted murder of the club’s adviser”.

Mamic and two other former senior officials from Dinamo Zagreb are on trial after being charged with avoiding paying 12.2 million Croatian kuna ($1.94 million) in taxes and diverting 116 million kuna from the soccer club. All three deny the charges.

Virat Kohli enjoys day off in Sri Lankan nature; Anushka Sharma is not far off,"Virat Kohli spent time out in Sri Lanka after winning the first ODI. (Source: Virat Kohli’s Instagram) Virat Kohli spent time out in Sri Lanka after winning the first ODI. (Source: Virat Kohli’s Instagram)

Virat Kohli and team India had a day off after beating Sri Lanka convincingly by nine wickets in the first of five ODIs and a solitary T20 on Sunday. The Indian skipper too played a key role in teams’ comprehensive win in Dambulla by scoring 82 and remaining unbeaten. The win once again hurt Sri Lanka’s confidence level and put a dent on their chances of opening their account in the series. Additionally, Sri Lanka need two wins in the remaining four matches to automatically qualify for the 2019 World Cup. Should they fail, West Indies can take over their spot.

On Monday morning, Kohli chose to spend the day amid Sri Lankan nature with a backdrop of elephants taking a swim. Kohli tweeted, “Recent day out around these gentle giants! 😇😇 Such innocence and playfulness was blissful to see. 🐘🐘”.

Interestingly, and hilariously, his girlfriend Anushka Sharma was not too far away. She too had a near similar picture – elephants in the background and wearing the same kind of hat while in the same balcony. “A day spent with elephants … is a day spent well ! 🐘💜” is how Anushka captioned the photograph on Instagram.

The two have already been spotted previously in an eco-friendly date and planted a sapling. They were also together in New York with the Bollywood actress there for the IIFA Awards prior to the Sri Lankan tour.

In the first ODI, Kohli gave good support to opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan who scored 132* to keep his tremendous run in the island going. He was rewarded with the Man of the Match for his performance.

"Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy fit to face Sheffield United, says Craig Shakespeare","Leicester City travel to Manchester United in their next league match on Saturday. (Source: AP) Leicester City travel to Manchester United in their next league match on Saturday. (Source: AP)

Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy has recovered from a foot injury and is fit to travel with the team to Sheffield United for their second round League Cup match on Tuesday, manager Craig Shakespeare has said.

Vardy was substituted in the closing stages of last Saturday’s 2-0 win over Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League. Shakespeare said the 30-year-old trained on Monday and will feature against the Championship side.

“Jamie trained this morning okay,” Shakespeare told the club’s website on Monday (www.lcfc.com). “He was a bit sore yesterday, but he was okay to train today.

“He is okay and will be involved tomorrow. At what length, we will have to wait and see. I plan to make changes.” Shakespeare also said midfielder Nampalys Mendy, who sustained an ankle injury in March, could play at Bramall Lane.

Defenders Robert Huth (ankle) and Wes Morgan (back), midfielders Danny Drinkwater (thigh)and Vicente Iborra (groin) and forward Kelechi Iheanacho (toe) have been ruled out of Tuesday’s match as they recover from their respective injuries.

BBC journalist on trial for Thailand crime reporting,"Jonathan Head, the BBC’s Southeast Asia correspondent, faces up to five years in jail at the private prosecution on the popular tourist island of Phuket. (Representational Image) Jonathan Head, the BBC’s Southeast Asia correspondent, faces up to five years in jail at the private prosecution on the popular tourist island of Phuket. (Representational Image)

A British BBC journalist appeared in a Thai court on Wednesday for the start of a criminal defamation trial brought by a lawyer who featured in an investigation about foreigners being scammed of their retirement homes. Jonathan Head, the BBC’s Southeast Asia correspondent, faces up to five years in jail at the private prosecution on the popular tourist island of Phuket.

Rights groups have said the case exposes how Thailand’s broad defamation and computer crime laws scupper investigative journalism and make it difficult to uncover wrongdoing in an endemically corrupt country.

The prosecution was sparked by a 2015 report by Head detailing how two foreign retirees had Phuket properties stolen from them by a network of criminals and corrupt officials. One of the victims, British national Ian Rance, is a joint defendant in the prosecution. Both have pleaded not guilty.

The man bringing the prosecution is Pratuan Thanarak, a local lawyer who featured in the BBC’s report looking at how Rance lost USD 1.2 million worth of properties.

According to the report, Pratuan admitted on tape to certifying Rance’s signature without him being present, a move which helped the British retiree’s then wife transfer his properties out of his name.

She was later convicted and jailed for the scam.

A copy of Pratuan’s complaint seen by AFP alleges that the BBC’s report caused him to be “defamed, insulted or hated”. It does not detail whether he notarised the signature without Rance being present.

Pratuan declined to speak about the case on the way into court. He warned gathered photographers that he would file a lawsuit against anyone who published images of him.

Neither Head nor Rance spoke to reporters on their way into the Phuket court today.

In a previous statement the BBC has said it “stands by its journalism” and that they “intend to clear the name of our correspondent”.

Rance and Head face one charge of criminal defamation, which carries up to two years in jail.

Head faces an additional charge under Thailand’s Computer Crimes Act, a broadly-worded law which forbids uploading “false data” online and carries a five-year maximum jail penalty. Unlike most countries where defamation is a civil crime, in Thailand it is a criminal offence. Private citizens can also launch their own prosecutions and they are not forced to pay costs if they lose.

Similar cases have been brought in recent years. Local news site Phuketwan closed down in 2015 after running out of money in its successful bid to defeat a suit brought by Thailand’s navy. Andrew Drummond, a British crime reporter, left the country the same year because of multiple cases brought by those he exposed as did British labour rights activist Andy Hall in 2016.

South Korea’s first woman PM released from jail,"outh Korea’s first female prime minister, Han Myeong-Sook. (Source: Reuters) outh Korea’s first female prime minister, Han Myeong-Sook. (Source: Reuters)

South Korea’s first female prime minister was released from prison on Wednesday after completing a two-year sentence for accepting illicit political funds. Han Myeong-Sook, now 73, was prime minister for a year from April 2006 under the liberal government of then-president Roh Moo-Hyun.

She was the first woman to hold the post of prime minister in South Korea, and also the first former premier to be put behind bars. A few years later Park Geun-Hye — currently on trial for corruption after being ousted in a sprawling scandal — became South Korea’s first woman president.

Han was convicted in 2015 of receiving 880 million won (then USD 760,000) from a businessman in illegal campaign funding for her eventually unsuccessful 2007 bid to secure her party’s presidential nomination.

Han has denied any wrongdoing and accused the then-conservative government of using state prosecutors to tarnish her reputation.

She was greeted by politicians and hundreds of supporters as she emerged from a detention centre on the outskirts of Seoul early today.

“There has been insufferable pain during the past two years but I have finally met a new world and I am grateful,” she was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.

Several former presidents have been embroiled in corruption scandals in South Korea, where politics and big business have long been closely tied.

Former leaders Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo served jail terms in the 1990s for charges including bribery and treason, and ex-president Roh Moo-Hyun — the mentor of President Moon Jae-In — killed himself in 2009 after being questioned over graft.

Initial momentum crucial during home stretch: U Mumba coach E Bhaskaran,"U Mumba will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers in their first home game at the NSCI in suburban Worli on August 25. (Source: AP) U Mumba will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers in their first home game at the NSCI in suburban Worli on August 25. (Source: AP)

U Mumba coach E Bhaskaran on Wednesday said the initial momentum during their home stretch of the season five of the Pro Kabaddi League is crucial for the team.

U Mumba have so far played six matches, with equal number of wins and losses, and have grabbed 16 points. “Playing six matches at a go is not a pressure situation for us.

It is all about the first game, if we perform and do well, we will all gain confidence to move ahead. The initial momentum is very crucial during the home stretch,” Bhaskaran was quoted as saying in a media release issued in Mumbai.

Team skipper Anup Kumar also echoed similar feelings saying it is all about getting the first match right.

“It is all about getting that first match right. If you see Gujarat, their home stretch has been very good in terms of performance. This is largely because they started on the right note. Our first match is against Jaipur and if we do well there, I know that the team will capitalise on that first win and use that as a motivation for the rest,” Kumar said in the release.

U Mumba will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers in their first home game at the NSCI in suburban Worli on August 25.

Oil prices fall on concerns of oversupply as Libyan output recovers,"OPEC has so far fallen short off its pledge, in part due to Libya’s strong output. (File Photo) OPEC has so far fallen short off its pledge, in part due to Libya’s strong output. (File Photo)

Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed down by concerns of oversupply as Libyan output improves and as U.S. gasoline inventories rose despite the peak summer driving season. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $51.75 per barrel at 0415 GMT, down 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $47.72 a barrel, down 11 cents, or 0.2 percent.

Libya’s Sharara oil field, the country’s largest, was gradually restarting on Tuesday after a shutdown.

Sharara recently reached output of 280,000 barrels per day (bpd), but closed earlier this month due to a pipeline blockade. Its production is key to Libya’s oil output, which surged above 1 million bpd in late June, about four times its level last summer. Libya’s rising output is a headache for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which together with non-OPEC producers including Russia has pledged to hold back around 1.8 million bpd of supplies between January this year and March 2018 to tighten supplies. However, OPEC has so far fallen short off its pledge, in part due to Libya’s strong output. The OPEC-member has been exempt from cuts. “Sentiment towards oil remains bearish amid oversupply fears and the possible threat of OPEC’s supply cut deal falling apart,” said Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM.

The next meeting of a ministerial committee of OPEC and non-OPEC states to discuss their production pact has been proposed for Sept. 22.

In the United States, crude inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 18 to 465.6 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday. However, gasoline stocks rose by 1.4 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a 643,000-barrel decline.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA said that the rising U.S. gasoline inventories were “not a good sign during the U.S. summer driving season” during which fuel demand tends to be high. Official inventory data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to be released late on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Bernstein Research warned that low prices and ample supplies were resulting in low oil industry investment levels. “We see (oil and gas)… order intake activity at almost the same low level as in 2016 … For now, we remind investors that contract levels appear to still be insufficient to drive recovery in earnings,” it said.

"Raksha Bandhan 2017: Know the Importance, History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan Festival in India","There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia) There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)

India as we know has a rich cultural heritage and while there are many festivals observed throughout the year, Raksha Bandhan holds a special place. It is the time when siblings celebrate the special bond of love between them. Sisters tie a thread/band around their brother’s wrist for his long life and happiness and in exchange he promises to protect his sibling from all evils. This year, Raksha Bandhan will be observed on August 7.

Origin of Raksha Bandhan

The exact origin of the festival that is celebrated joyously in India and Nepal is unknown, but there are are many interesting stories associated with it. The most popular one is from the Mahabharata and it acknowledges the relationship between Lord Krishna and Draupadi. According to the epic, one morning, when Lord Krishna was flying a kite, he cut his finger on the abrasive string. Draupadi, who was nearby, saw him bleeding profusely and ran to him. She then tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his finger. Lord Krishna was so touched that in return he promised to protect her from all evil, forever. And he did protect her all along, especially during her ‘cheerharan’ by the Kauravas.

There’s another interesting story involving Emperor Humayun and Rani Karnavati of Mewar. When Mewar was attacked twice by Bahadur Shah Zafar in the mid 16th century, she sent a letter with a rakhi to Humayun as a last resort, to help her. The emperor was so touched by the gesture that he immediately left the military campaign he was then involved in to protect her.

Interesting rituals

There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. In some parts of India, families draw figures and symbols on the walls of their homes and worship them with offerings of vermilion and kheer. Palm imprints are also used to decorate the entrance of a household where rakhis are stuck.

Trump administration wants to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan: Mike Pence,"US Vice President Mike Pence. (Reuters photo) US Vice President Mike Pence. (Reuters photo)

The Trump administration wants to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions in the region, US Vice President Mike Pence said. His comments came hours after President Donald Trump hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to “agents of chaos” that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has “much to lose” by harbouring terrorists.

“We want to strengthen the partnership between Afghanistan and India. We want to hold Pakistan more accountable for their actions in the region,” Pence said. “What President Trump announced yesterday was a whole new strategy for South Asia that said, look, we’re going to provide the resources and the military personnel and the air assets necessary to support the Afghan army’s efforts to defeat the Taliban,” the Vice-President told Fox News.

He said the US would destroy terrorist networks that use Afghanistan and portions of Pakistan as safe havens and asked Islamabad to step up and be a more effective partner in confronting the terrorist organizations, some 20 of which harbor in Afghanistan and regions in Pakistan.

“We’re going to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan,” Pence said. India has been supporting an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, broad-based and inclusive process of peace and reconciliation, and advocating the need for a sustained and long-term commitment to Afghanistan by the international community. “We’ll let the Afghan people build their own nation. Our objective there is to advance the security of the United States of America and to support the Afghan national army as they stay in the lead, in the fight,” said the Vice President.

In an op-ed in USA Today, Pence alleged that Pakistan too often turns a blind eye to the cancer of terrorism and in many cases it has contributed to the growth of terrorist groups. “Pakistan, like Afghanistan, is a haven for terrorist activity. Between the two countries, no fewer than 20 US- designated foreign terrorist organizations have haven and conduct operations — the highest concentration of any region in the world. Pakistan, which has borne the weight of terrorist attacks in the past, shares with us,” he wrote.

He said America will not write a blank check for countries that fail to root out the same forces who try every day to kill its people. Pence said that Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with American effort in Afghanistan. It has much more to lose by supporting terrorists, he warned.

“The president has put them on notice,” he said. Pence said President’s strategy for South Asia involves a stronger strategic partnership with India — the world’s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner. “India has made important contributions towards Afghanistan’s stability and security, and India has also pledged critical support to Afghanistan’s development needs. Because they directly affect America’s interests, America will continue to work closely with New Delhi on these issues,” Pence wrote.

France’s Macron says ‘posted worker’ rules betray EU spirit,"FILE PHOTO French President Emmanuel Macron waits for a guest at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, June 28, 2017. Picture taken June 28, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo FILE PHOTO French President Emmanuel Macron waits for a guest at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, June 28, 2017.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday decried European rules allowing firms in low-wage countries to post workers elsewhere as a “betrayal” of the European spirit, seeking to overcome eastern European resistance to curbing the practice. Macron has pledged to overhaul a system under which “posted” workers can be sent to other European Union states on contracts that must guarantee the host country’s minimum wage, but under which taxes and social charges are paid in the home nation.

He says the system creates unfair competition in wealthier nations. Macron is pushing for the duration of these contracts to be limited to one year rather than two under a new European Commission proposal, and to reinforce measures to ensure the rules are obeyed.

“The single European market and the free movement of workers is not meant to create a race to the bottom in terms of social regulations,” Macron told reporters after meeting Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, who he said was in full agreement. Macron is on a three-day tour of central and eastern Europe, hoping to make progress on an issue over which Western nations and poorer eastern European states have been at odds for years.

He and Kern were due to meet the prime ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia – two low-wage eastern countries – later on Wednesday. “The posted workers’ directive as it currently functions is a betrayal of the European spirit in its essence,” Macron said.

He also said France and Austria shared the same views on the need to harmonise fiscal rules, build up a common European investment capacity and a euro zone budget that would be voted through by a euro zone parliament. “All of this encourages us to move forward with a new initiative to relaunch Europe before the end of the year,” he said, an ambitious project given impetus in part by Britain’s shock vote last year to leave the EU.

Expelled Congress MLA to join BJP today: ‘Congress not acting against those involved in anti-party activities’,"Jadeja was expelled from Congress for cross voting in RS polls. Jadeja was expelled from Congress for cross voting in RS polls.

A day before joining the BJP, expelled Congress MLA Dharmendrasinh Jadeja on Tuesday alleged that the Congress was not acting against anti-party activities and there were people within the party who were working for the BJP in his constituency Jamnagar (North). Jadeja, who was one of eight Congress MLAs expelled for cross voting in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, said that the office bearers of the Congress didn’t listen to his complaints.

“The Congress leaders did not pay heed to my pleas to act on those working against the party. There were people within Congress who were actually working for the BJP in my constituency,” the 44-year-old first time MLA told The Indian Express.

Jadeja will join the BJP in presence of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani at an event in Jamnagar city, which he has organised. Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja will also be present at the event.

Asked what kind of political future he sees with the BJP, Jadeja said a ticket to contest the upcoming Assembly election was not a precondition of him joining the party. “If the party fields me, I shall contest, if it doesn’t, I think I shall be able to serve the people even then.”

A native of Khambhaliya taluka in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, Jadeja had joined the Congress around 20 years ago and risen through the party ranks to earn a ticket in the 2012 election. In his maiden Assembly election, he defeated BJP heavyweight Mulu Bera by around 10,000 votes.

When asked if the people of his constituency will accept his change of party allegiance, Jadeja said he was confident that they were still with him. “An election is (like a) wrestling match… The public is supreme. I am a politician who believes in drawing his line longer than truncating others’. Therefore, I never attacked the BJP but focused on serving the people. Before choosing the BJP, I spent a month meeting the people and they were positive. I have organised Wednesday’s event in my personal capacity. The turnout at the event will make the picture clearer,” said Jadeja who also owns Raviraj Infraproject Pvt Limited along with his wife Prafulaba. In his affidavit filed during the 2012 Assembly elections, Jadeja had declared assets worth around Rs12 crore.

Sources claimed that a few Congress corporators of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation were also likely to join the BJP along with Jadeja on Wednesday.

Local BJP leaders welcomed the development. “BJP would have defeated Jadeja had he contested the next Assembly elections as a Congress candidate. Now that he is joining the BJP, party leaders will decide who shall contest from this seat,” said Hasmukh Hindocha, president of Jamnagar city unit of the BJP.

President of Jamnagar city unit of Congress P C Khetiya said electors of this constituency have been loyal to the party. “Jadeja’s 2012 win was a victory of the Congress and not an individual,” he said.

"US Judge shot, wounded near Ohio courthouse; gunman killed","A judge walking from his car into the county courthouse was shot by a gunman but managed to fire back before a probation officer stepped in and ultimately killed the suspect, authorities said. Jefferson County Judge Joseph Bruzzese Jr. was shot today at around 8 am near the courthouse in Steubenville, just across the Ohio River from West Virginia’s northern panhandle, roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Pittsburgh. Courthouse video shows both the judge and the gunman firing about five times each, said Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla.

“Whoever thought this could happen here?” Abdalla said, adding that investigators are familiar with the suspect and are checking to see if he had any connection with the judge. Steubenville City Manager James Mavromatis tells WTOV-TV that Bruzzese was talking after being wounded. He was flown to a Pittsburgh-area hospital.

Investigators didn’t immediately release further information about the judge’s condition or on the suspect. Republican Gov. John Kasich said he was told the judge would survive.

The attack had to be intentional because people know about the reserved spots where judges park, said one of Bruzzese’s judicial colleagues.

Judge Joseph Corabi said he and the county’s two other judges park in reserved spots next to the courthouse in eastern Ohio. Judges then walk a few feet down what’s known as “Courthouse Alley” to a side entrance to the building, said Corabi, the Jefferson County juvenile and probate court judge.

“Everybody knows who parks there. That’s why it’s not an accident what happened. He was clearly an intended target,” Corabi said.

Corabi said Bruzzese is known as an avid hunter. He called him fair, hard-working, well-liked and “a tough son of a gun.”

“He is very intelligent and he can cut to the chase,” Corabi said. “He spots issues and he resolves the issues.” Bruzzese, 65, hears general and domestic relations cases as one of two judges serving in Jefferson County Common Pleas Court.

Bruzzese has served on that court since 1997, according to Ohio Supreme Court records. He was most recently re-elected in 2014 for another six-year term.

Bruzzese had likely arrived early to review his usual Monday morning batch of legal motions, Corabi said.

Local media reported that the suspect’s body could be seen lying next to a car at the drive-thru of a neighboring bank. Police said a man who was in the car with him was taken into custody.

The courthouse was closed for the day as local and state authorities helped secure the scene. Jefferson County Commissioner Thomas Graham told WTOV that some courthouse workers witnessed the “tragic situation” and that people would need time to process what had happened.

The state crime lab will help investigate the shooting, said Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine.

The chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court called the attack a “cowardly ambush” and urged court personnel â€” especially judges â€” to take extra precautions.

The attack “reminds us all of the very real potential for violence against judges,” Maureen O’Connor said. “Violence against judges represents an attack on the Rule of Law, the foundation of our country.”

Bernard Tomic to return for US Open: Reports,"Bernard Tomic is likely to play at the US Open after lengthy absence from court. Bernard Tomic is likely to play at the US Open after lengthy absence from court.

Australia’s Bernard Tomic is speculated to return to tennis at the US Open having ended his absence from the tour after a controversy ridden period following his first round exit at Wimbledon. His absence from the tour has seen his ranking drop to 146.

Tomic, once considered a potential top-10 player has not played since Wimbledon where he lost to Mischa Zverev and claimed he was “bored” in the post match interaction. His comments weren’t taken kindly and was subsequently slammed by former players and fined $15,000.

Later while speaking to an Australian TV channel in an interview, he created further furore by saying he was in the sport only for the money and consider this a “job”. The Aussie added he had won plenty of money even without trying hard.

“He is playing the U.S. Open,” Tomic’s manager Matthew Fawcett told Melbourne’s Herald Sun. “Following that he is planning to play Chengdu, Tokyo, Shanghai, Antwerp or Stockholm or Moscow, Vienna and Paris.”

Tomic has withdrawn from his last four tournaments which has seriously affected his ranking to push it down which would need him to battle it out on lower-tier tours or seek wildcards from tournament organisers next year.

His top 30 ranking at the end of 2016 guarantees him slots at ATP 500 tournaments in Tokyo and Vienna but he will need to climb up the charts if he is to qualify for the ATP 1000 Masters series events in Shanghai and Paris in October.

Tennis Australia’s high performance chief Wally Masur said last month he was worried the long-time Davis Cup player was “burnt out.”

Living in Miami, Tomic’s party lifestyle has frequently done the rounds of Australian newspapers and former Aussie great Todd Woodbridge feels the reality check is not too far away. “Bernard is getting to that point where reality is really going to hit him,” Woodbridge told The Australian last week. “He will find out pretty quickly whether he enjoys playing, whether he wants to play and whether tennis can give him a lifestyle he enjoys. Otherwise, it won’t be long before he discovers that what he has been doing is a wonderful opportunity that has gone begging.”

The US Open begins on August 28 with many pundits suggesting Tomic does not have the physical fitness required to compete in a five setter.

"Ahead of JNU student union polls, another Muzaffarnagar film-this time by ABVP","In August 2015, another documentary, Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai, was denied permission to be screened at JNU. In August 2015, another documentary, Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai, was denied permission to be screened at JNU.

With their eyes on the upcoming students’ union elections at JNU, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) Monday night screened on campus a ‘documentary’ on the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, which they claim portrays the true picture of what transpired in the state. Directed by journalist Vivek Sinha, the 36-minute-long documentary titled ‘Muzaffarnagar, Aakhir Kyon?’ tries to understand “why the riots took place, and concludes that it started with a case of sexual harassment which was deliberately communalised”.

Introducing the film to 100-odd students, Sinha said,“This is what happened on August 27, 2013, when Shahnawaz threatened Gaurav and Sachin’s sister that he would kidnap her. Ab Shahnawaz Musalman hai toh hum kuchh nahi kar sakte iss baat mein. Agar Gaurav aur Sachin Hindu the toh isme kisi patrakar ki galti nahi hai. Haan, par patrakar me itni himmat honi chahiye ki sach ko dikhaye ki ek Hindu ladki ko ek Musalman ladke ne utha le jaane ki dhamki di.”

“Agar aapke ghar me ma hai, behen hai, beti hai, bhabhi hai… kya aap bardasht karenge ki woh bahar nikle toh koi unpe chheentakashi kare, chhed-chaad kare, gangrape bhi karle ya utha le jaane ki dhamki de. Agar koi aisa kehta hai, toh aap kya karenge uss dauran? Koi aadmi kaise react karega,” he said. Sinha said a confrontation between both parties led to escalation of matters and the subsequent riots. The suppression of such incidents, including one at Jolly canal on September 7, 2013, where an alleged “systematic attack” took place on a Hindu mahapanchayat, was the reason he made the documentary, he said.

In August 2015, another documentary, Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai, was denied permission to be screened at JNU citing lack of permission by the organisers, the Democratic Students’ Federation. On Tuesday, Saurabh Sharma from the ABVP said the truth had to be projected to JNU students. “Till now, only a one-sided picture of the riots has been painted. This film shows how a Hindu woman was harassed and later a riot-like situation was started by Muslims. By screening this film, we wanted to question why such incidents of Hindu women being harassed were being suppressed and love jihad was being perpetuated,” he said.

Other student organisations questioned the accuracy of the film as well as the permission granted to ABVP to screen it. Calling Sinha’s interaction “hate speech”, JNUSU president Mohit Pandey wrote on Facebook, “Hear new gyaan from ABVP. Harassment of girls leads to riots. Communalising gender issues so shamefully! Jab Varnika Kundu ki harassment Vikas Barala karta hai, tab kaunsi community ke khilaf danga kare?”

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday launched the Host City Logo for Kolkata, the venue of the final of FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017 and announced that the FIFA president Gianni Infantino will be their ‘state guest’ during the visit.

The iconic Vivekanand Yuva Bharati Krirangan will host ten matches in October including the final. Mamata said after the launch of the logo, “The FIFA president will be our state guest. This was decided in the meeting today,” Mamata said. “We are really grateful to host this major tournament here. We are proud and deeply honoured to host such a tournament.”

Tournament director Javier Ceppi, who was also present at the launch, said about the Salt Lake Stadium, “The facilities have been hugely renovated and if you haven’t visited the stadium in one and a half years and go now, you will not recognise the stadium.”

“It is a world class facility at this point of time. We are now waiting for the hand over of the venue, likely on September 10,” the Chilean said. “We are extremely pleased to announce Kolkata as the first city to launch the host city logo today. It’s a momentous occasion. It is for the first time that a city has been connected to a FIFA tournament through it’s distinguished image. We are extremely happy that this is happening in Kolkata which will

also be hosting the FIFA headquarters, referees’ headquarters, the international broadcasting centre and it is the city from which the most tickets have been sold.

“So we hope that Salt Lake stadium will be full. We appreciate the support of the state government to project Kolkata as a sporting capital of India, as a sporting capital of Asia and hopefully as a sporting capital of the world,” added Ceppi.

Rocket strikes downtown Kabul: Report,"A rocket struck the heart of Kabul’s government and diplomatic area on Monday night, setting off alarms and sirens at foreign embassies, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Police said the rocket landed on a secure road just outside the presidential palace and near an area housing other Afghan government offices, foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of the international military coalition.

The blast was preceded by “incoming” announcements on loudspeakers, often used by the American embassy to warn of an imminent rocket attack.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Taliban and Islamic State militants have stepped up attacks on the Afghan capital, making it the country’s deadliest city for civilians this year.

Monday’s rocket strike came just hours before U.S. President Donald Trump was to give a prime-time speech outlining the future of the American presence in Afghanistan.

US military commanders have asked for several thousand more troops to help train and assist Afghan security forces struggling to contain the growing Islamist insurgency.

Britain welcomes Trump’s renewed commitment to Afghanistan,"US President Donald Trump. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque US President Donald Trump. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

Britain on Tuesday welcomed a commitment by U.S. President Donald Trump to step up the military campaign against Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. President Trump committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan on Monday night, reversing course from his campaign pledges. Britain along with other European allies pledged more troops to support Afghanistan’s military in June, with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis saying at the time that troop numbers in the country had been reduced too rapidly. “The U.S. commitment is very welcome,” British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement.

“In my call with Secretary Mattis yesterday we agreed that despite the challenges, we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy and reduce the terrorist threat to the West. “It’s in all our interests that Afghanistan becomes more prosperous and safer: that’s why we ?announced our own troop increase back in June.”

Soul Strings: U Rajesh on the legacy of playing an Italian lute in the Carnatic classical system,"In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound.

Growing up in Palakal, Andhra Pradesh, U Rajesh never saw his older brother engage in sibling rivalry. “Or revelry,” says Rajesh, “He was nine years older, would hardly talk or play and was always bent on a small fretboard, trying to figure something rest of us didn’t know. But I was a restive child, always wanting to go out to play, but he would never bother.”

In a telephone conversation from Chennai, Rajesh is referring to U Srinivas, better known to the world as Mandolin Srinivas, the famed musician who convinced the purists of the Carnatic classical world that an Italian lute, associated with court recitals in Europe, baroque concerti by Vivaldi and film music in India, could present the complexities of Carnatic music. Srinivas modified the instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings and, in the process, the mandolin created gamakas, delivered nuances and gave pleasure to the rasikas as any other Indian classical instrument. Violin took decades to find that status in India. While the uninitiated enjoyed the novelty his music displayed, the connoisseurs loved the deft strokes, the technique, and the passion. So much so that when George Harrison stumbled upon Mandolin Ecstacy in the ’80s, a Srinivas album, he said in an interview, “Eddie van Halen, eat your heart out”. Halen is one of the most distinguished guitarists in the history of rock music. Srinivas wasn’t in his twenties yet. His Carnatic career with the mandolin had just begun.

But Srinivas passed away in 2014 after a liver transplant failure. He was only 45, with a Padma Shri, a Sangeet Natak Akademi award and praises from Harrison and John Mclaughlin under his belt.

But, during the time he was alive, he taught Rajesh his unique style on the advice of Paramacharya of Kanchipuram. “I learnt some krithis. I always wanted to be a pilot. My brother said he’d help in that but, if I chose music, there would be no endorsements. ‘My job will be to only teach you. No more,’ he said. I was to take my pick,” recalls Rajesh, who did choose music, thinking he could go to his brother if there was a challenging situation. The two also played many duets. “And then, in a matter of just a month, he was gone. While performing, I still look to my right sometimes to get approval,” says 38-year-old Rajesh, who will be in Delhi on August 23 for a performance with sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee as a part of the 19th Amar Jyoti Concert presented by Pt Chaturlal Memorial Society. The organisation was formed in the memory of Pt Chaturlal, a fixture in Pt Ravi Shankar’s concerts abroad in the ’50s and one of the first Indian tabla players to introduce Indian percussion system to the West. Chaturlal died in 1965, at the age of 40. Ut Allah Rakha took over after that. The performance will be followed by a flute recital by Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia.

In the last three years, Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. His collaboration with Chatterjee is also an endeavour in that direction. Apart from releasing Timeless, the last live recording of the kutcheri in Mylapore where he played with his brother, and performances at Chennai’s December season, he is actively collaborating “to see how classical mandolin interacts with other Western instruments”. He’s already worked with Mclaughlin on Floating Point, which was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.

He will soon head to the US for his work with LA Philharmonic Orchestra. “This exchange of notes widens my perspective of my own music. I’m trying to be my own musician, entangle myself with challenges, find answers myself,” says Rajesh.

Harika Dronavalli bounces back after three draws at Abu Dhabi Chess Festival,"After three consecutive draws, Indian Grandmaster Harika Dronavalli bounced back with a win over CM Suleymanli Aydin of Azerbaijan in the seventh round of the Master’s tournament of the Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival, in Abu Dhabi.

The World No. 9 Indian, playing with white pieces, started the game on an attacking note and gained an advantage in the initial stages of the game. However, the 12-year-old lad from Azerbaijan put up a staunch fight to contain the attacking Indian, but couldn’t do so as Harika took the game away from him after 40 moves.

“I got off to a great start and gained an advantage in the initial phases of the game but a few miscalculated moves from my end got me in a complicated position,” Harika said.

“Although when we were both were under the pressure of the clock and both kings were under attack, I outplayed him with a few strategies of my own,” she added.

After seven rounds in the nine-round Swiss tournament, Harika has amassed a total of four and a half points, courtesy three wins, three draws and just one loss. She has broken into the top-10 of the standings.

The ninth-placed Indian will take on GM Ivan Rozum from Russia in the eighth round of the tournament.

Taliban warns Afghanistan will become ‘graveyard’ for US,"“As long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,” a Taliban spokesman said. (File Photo/Representational) “As long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,” a Taliban spokesman said. (File Photo/Representational)

The Taliban warned that Afghanistan would become “a graveyard” for the United States today after President Donald Trump cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country.

“If America doesn’t withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, soon Afghanistan will become another graveyard for this superpower in the 21st century,” Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, said in a statement. He added that America should think of an exit strategy “instead of continuing the war”. “As long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,” Mujahid said.

Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America’s longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief late Monday, though he did not offer specifics. He said he had concluded “the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable”, leaving a vacuum that terrorists “would instantly fill”.

While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan. Earlier Mujahid had dismissed the strategy as vague and “nothing new”. “For now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,” he told AFP.

A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the “arrogant behaviour” of previous presidents such as George W Bush. “He is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,” he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government “is a US puppet”.

The insurgents signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack late Monday. The rocket landed in a field in the city’s diplomatic quarter, with no casualties reported.

Trump also lambasted US ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to “agents of chaos”. A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan’s shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump “has proved it’s a Crusade”. “His statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),” he said.

Prior to Trump’s announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

Arjun Kapoor time and again has been caught reminiscing about his childhood. His pictures not only make fans do a double take but it inspires them as the actor has had a major transformation from fat to fit. While we drool over his Gunday body, we also feel he was super cute during his growing up years. On Wednesday, Arjun shared a picture of him with his cousins, which is going to leave you speechless. In the picture, we see Sonam Kapoor, who does not look much different from how she looks now, obviously sans all that glamour. However, it is Arjun who can’t be identified in one go.

So, let us help you. The bespectacled boy in black standing right behind Anshula Kapoor (Arjun’s sister) is the Mubarakan actor. And we are assuming the boy in front of Sonam is Harshvardhan Kapoor, who recently made his debut with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Mirzya. But who is the kid? Well, only Arjun has the answer to this question.

Arjun shared the picture on Instagram. He captioned the photo as, “Dude, like who are these people ???”

Earlier, during the promotions of his recent release Mubarakan, when Anil Kapoor asked Arjun about his favourite cousin between Sonam, Rhea and Harsh, Arjun said, “Sonam is my favorite cousin. We both are of similar age. We both have gone to same school and from the beginning I am very protective about her and will always be in my life.”

On the work front, the 32-year-old will next be seen in Namastey Canada, opposite Parineeti Chopra. The film will be directed by Vipul Shah, who helmed Akshay Kumar starrer Namastey London.

There are also reports that Arjun has a signed film opposite Kriti Sanon titled Farzi.

Retired Colonel gets 5 years in jail in DA case,"According to the CBI, between January 1987 and August 1990, Goraya had acquired properties worth Rs 82.58 lakh. According to the CBI, between January 1987 and August 1990, Goraya had acquired properties worth Rs 82.58 lakh.

A CBI special court on Tuesday sentenced Colonel (retd) B S Goraya to five years in jail in a disproportionate assets case. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the convict. The retired Army officer was sentenced by Additional District and Sessions Judge Gagan Geet Kaur under Sections 13(2) and 13(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988. The court also directed UT administration to confiscate an amount of Rs 66.94 lakh from Goraya.

According to the CBI, between January 1987 and August 1990, Goraya had acquired properties worth Rs 82.58 lakh. The properties were disproportionate to his known sources of income. During the trial, the CBI court had also attached the Sector 9 house of the former Army officer. CBI sleuths had learnt that he had several properties in his name as well as in the name of his family members in Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana.

Following investigation, Goraya’s property was attached during the investigation of a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act by the CBI court. The court had also ordered that he was not entitled to sell his land.

However, Goraya sold one of his properties in Punjab, defying court orders, for which he was awarded two-year rigorous imprisonment under Section 206 (fraudulent removal or concealment of property to prevent its seizure as forfeited or in execution) of the IPC by the Chief Judicial Magistrate court. A fine of Rs 20,000 was also imposed on him for defying the CBI court orders.

Advocate S P S Bhullar, Defense Counsel of Col (retd) Goraya said, “The lower court has sentenced him after finding guilty in the case, but we will appeal in High Court.”

"Delhi High Court wants Facebook, Google to take down Blue Whale links","The plea said the court should restrain websites from posting or allowing uploads of any material/ information/link pertaining to the game. The plea said the court should restrain websites from posting or allowing uploads of any material/ information/link pertaining to the game.

The Delhi High Court has issued notices to Facebook India, Google India and Yahoo India — all represented by their managing directors in Gurgaon — along with the state, represented by the Commissioner of Police, over a plea seeking directions to remove all online links of the ‘Blue Whale challenge’. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar directed the websites and the state to file a status report detailing the steps taken, to stop the game, on the next date of hearing —September 19.

On Tuesday, the Counsel for the CP said while the Union government had taken a stand in the matter, there were “no concrete established causes in Delhi and investigation was on”. He also said the CBSE had issued guidelines regarding the online game. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain requested the court to implead the Centre as a party in the case, to which the bench agreed. He told the bench that the Centre had already issued a circular on August 15 asking social media sites to remove all links to the game.

On August 15, the Ministry of Electronics and IT had directed Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Microsoft and Yahoo to remove all links to the game. The petitioner, advocate Gurmeet Singh, said while the relevant section of the IT Act recognised Yahoo, Google and Facebook as mere intermediaries, the Act also said their immunity as an intermediary stopped once the Centre issued them a notice/directive. They could be prosecuted if they did not follow the directive, he said.

Earlier, in his petition, Singh underlined that four children below the age of 18 had died in Delhi, West Bengal, and Mumbai allegedly while taking part in the challenge. The petition also said there were cases where some minors were stopped right before they could allegedly commit suicide.

The plea said the court should restrain websites from posting or allowing uploads of any material/ information/link pertaining to the game. It said the websites could be directed to immediately block, take down or ban any content/post /web link/material regarding the game. The CP could be directed to appoint a special team comprising at least five members, not below the rank of inspector, to ensure that the websites followed the directives, said the plea.

Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field — who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US — is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

“Knowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,” Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

“The problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,” he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in “The Best American Short Stories” and “O. Henry Prize Collections”. Sharma’s first book, “An Obedient Father”, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, “Family Life” won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. “I began writing ‘We Didn’t Like Him’ the day after I handed in my novel ‘Family Life’. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

“I then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn’t satisfy me and so I wrote another,” the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story — from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

“We Didn’t Like Him”, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled “A Life of Adventure and Delight” (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. “They are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,” he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. “They cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,” he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

Burnley sign Kiwi striker Chris Wood in club record deal,"Chris Wood has been signed by Burnley. (Source: Twitter) Chris Wood has been signed by Burnley. (Source: Twitter)

Burnley have signed striker Chris Wood from Leeds United on a four-year contract for a club record fee, the Premier League team announced on Monday. The New Zealand international striker, who scored 27 goals in the second tier Championship last season, is reported to have cost Burnley more than 15 million pounds ($19.3 million) plus additional payments. The club did not disclose the fee.

Burnley this month sold forward Andre Gray to Watford for a fee reported to be around 18 million pounds and Wood will likely compete with Wales international Sam Vokes for the central striker role in Sean Dyche’s team.

The 25-year-old target man joined Leeds from Leicester City in 2015, having also previously been at West Bromwich Albion. He scored 44 goals in 88 games for Leeds.

Although Wood was briefly part of Premier League squads at West Brom and Leicester, having helped both win promotion from the Championship, he says he is hungry for the chance to play more in the top tier.

“My ambition has been to play in the Premier League for years,” Wood told Burnley’s official website (www.burnleyfootballclub.com).

“I’ve had tastes of being in there but I’ve never had the chance to give it a proper bash.

“Coming here I feel I’ve got a proper opportunity to do that. I’ve never started a Premier League game and this what I want to do.

Burnley were promoted back into the top flight in 2016 and finished 16th. They beat Chelsea away on the opening day of this campaign but lost 1-0 at home to West Brom on Saturday.

Wood, who played for New Zealand in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as an 18-year-old, has scored 20 goals in 52 appearances for the All Whites.

The deal is the fourth time that Burnley have broken their club record fee in the past year following the arrivals of Belgian Steven Defour and Irish pair Jeff Hendrick and Robbie Brady.

"Players, BCCI unhappy with kit sponsor Nike","Nike has been associated with Indian cricket team since 2006 when it became the official kit sponsor (File) Nike has been associated with Indian cricket team since 2006 when it became the official kit sponsor (File)

The Indian cricket board is unhappy with Nike, the kit sponsor for Indian team, for providing sub-standard clothing to the players over the past few months. It’s learnt that the Indian players complained about the clothing and subsequently, the two top BCCI employees — Chief Executive Officer Rahul Johri and General Manager game development Ratnakar Shetty — raised the issue with the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA). BCCI CEO Johri confirmed to The Indian Express that issue was raised in a meeting with COA whose chairman Vinod Rai expressed his concerns.

“It (Nike’s clothing) has come up for discussion in last COA meeting and chairman CoA (Vinod Rai) took it very strongly. The team cannot have sub-standard kits and we will be engaging with Nike and he has asked to put our case strongly. We have to engage with them, we will have a meeting with them (Nike) next week and try to resolve it at earliest,” Johri said. Nike India communications head Keerthana Ramakrishnan did not respond to emails or text messages.

Nike has been associated with Indian cricket team since 2006 when it became the official kit sponsor. In 2016 it paid approximately Rs 370 crores to be Indian team kit sponsor till 2020. Their contract runs from 1 Jan 2016 to 30 September 2020 — and they pay Rs 87,34,000 per match.

"I don’t want others to learn patience the way I have, says Sanjay Dutt","Sanjay Dutt opens up about his life, his movies and his relationship with directors before the release of his comeback film Bhoomi. Sanjay Dutt opens up about his life, his movies and his relationship with directors before the release of his comeback film Bhoomi.

The vastness of a star-lit sky finally reassured Sanjay Dutt that he was “free”. On the night of February 25, 2016, having been released from Pune’s Yerwada Central Jail after serving a six-year sentence, the actor went up to the terrace of Imperial Heights, his 14-storied family home in Mumbai’s Pali Hill. “I lay down on the terrace and looked at the sky above. That made me realise that there were no bars around me anymore,” says the actor. Dutt was embroiled in a long legal battle since his arrest on April 19, 1993 under TADA and the Arms Act for his alleged role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts. He was convicted in 2013 for illegal possession of weapons.

With the 23-year tryst with law behind him, Dutt is making a “comeback” with Bhoomi, a film directed by Omung Kumar, which releases on September 22. The years spent in dealing with his drug habit, courtrooms, and prison life, he says, has brought about a big change. “I am a much more patient man. It takes a long time for me to lose my temper. I tell myself, jaane do (let it go). I was very short-tempered. Very rash. But I don’t want others to learn patience the way I have,” he says, when we meet in a glass-enclosed room in Imperial Heights.

The 58-year-old actor is wearing a pair of jeans, a black T-shirt and printed leather shoes. His well-toned body sports multiple tattoos, while his hair and beard are carefully clipped and dyed. Dutt chose Bhoomi, a film about a father’s search for justice for his raped daughter, because of its “strong message”. “Bhoomi is a story of a father and daughter from a lower middle-class background living in a small town. When the daughter is raped, it shows how the family deals with it,” says the actor, who is also father to six-year-old twins Iqra and Shahraan, and Trishala, from an earlier marriage. He claims to be “as protective as any father” can get. “According to me, a girl is a blessing not a burden. I’m all for beti bachao and women’s empowerment,” he says.

As an interviewee, Dutt is known to give short answers. He lives up to that reputation, even though he does not dodge any question or shy away from talking about his past. “I don’t want anyone to go through the same ordeal. One has to be balanced and focussed to be able to do that. However, the best part is to learn from it and forget about it.” Has forgetting been easy? “No. But you have to move on in life. I want to work. I want to spend time with my kids and family,” he says.

Actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is playing the character of Dutt in a biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani, had called his story “inspiring”. “Sanjay Dutt is so controversial and yet loved. The biopic is an honest take on an ordinary man, his mistakes as well as his relationship with his father and friends,” he had said in an earlier interview. Dutt has gone through the script of the film and visited its sets a couple of times. “The film does not glorify me. It depicts the truth,” he says.

Dutt has an impressive line-up of releases in the next two years — Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed Padmavati, Abhishek Varman’s Shiddat with Alia Bhatt and Sridevi as co-actors; and Hasmukh Pighal Gaya, directed by Sejal Shah. He is also supposed to feature in Malang, produced by his old associate Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Dutt is also likely to feature in the future projects of Tigmanshu Dhulia, Mahesh Manjrekar and Anubhav Sinha. “I believe in commercial cinema. I am here to entertain people,” says the actor. While choosing a film, he goes by the character, screenplay and script. “My choice also depends on who is directing the film,” he adds.

One of the key factors that has sustained Dutt in the industry for 36 years is the affection and goodwill he enjoys, and the strong bonds he has with directors. Hirani and Chopra swear by him while Kumar wants to do another film with him. “I enjoy working with them and they enjoy working with me. Till the time I have a good bonding with the directors, I can’t work. That is very important. My relationship with them goes beyond the sets,” he says. Kumar vouches for his affability. “Before the making of Bhoomi, I did not know him well. Today, I feel I have known him for years,” he says.

Both Kumar and Karan Malhotra, who directed Agneepath (2012), are impressed by Dutt’s trust in his directors; he never checks the rushes after giving a shot. According to Malhotra, he is like a “lamb” on the sets and does what the director wants. While shooting for Agneepath in the 40-degree summer temperatures of Diu, Malhotra was struggling to maintain Dutt’s bald look, created through prosthetics. Dutt solved the problem by shaving off his hair. “It is this accommodating nature that has sustained his popularity,” says Malhotra.

It has also helped that Dutt is his father’s son. Sunil Dutt was an immensely loved and respected actor and Congress politician, with friends across the political spectrum. “My father used to tell me, ‘Ultimately, you have to be a nice human being, whether you are up or down in life’,” he says. Dutt was 22 when his mother, the actor Nargis, died of cancer. His father became his biggest source of strength. Sunil stood by his side all through, whether it was when he had to check into rehab for his addiction or during the TADA trials.

Despite a rough ride, Dutt considers himself “lucky”. “People believed in my work and the directors believed that the role in Khal Nayak (1993) or Vaastav (1996) was perfect for me,” he says. The actor, who made his debut in Rocky (1981), directed by his father, also counts Naam (1986), Sadak (1991), Munnabhai MBBS (2003), Shabd (2005) and Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) as some of his best films.

There is another side of Dutt, which is rarely spoken about. He grew up in a multi-faith household; Nargis was a Muslim and his father Hindu. In jail, he says, he read texts of many religions. “I respect all religions. My parents never told me to choose any particular religion. However, I believe in Hinduism and my god is Lord Shiva. I love him. I follow Bholenath’s path,” says Dutt. His reading, he says, has led him to conclude that “all religions talk of peace”.

After being an actor and producer for over three decades, Dutt eventually wants to direct movies. “But not now. My dad directed some fantastic movies like Yaadein and Reshma Aur Shera.

But I would like to make commercial movies. I wish to entertain the audience,” he says.

Tamil Nadu NEET merit list 2017 declared at tnhealth.org and tnmedicalselection.org,"The merit list will be prepared on the basis of NEET 2017 results. The merit list will be prepared on the basis of NEET 2017 results.

The Central government on August 22 told the Supreme Court that it was not in favour of the recent ordinance passed by Tamil Nadu to exempt it from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) this year, the Directorate of Medical Education is therefore expected to release the merit list and counselling dates on Thursday at tnhealth.org and tnmedicalselection.org.

The apex court has told the state government to start the counselling process for admissions for MBBS and BDS seats in the state based on the NEET merit list. The government has been given time till September 4 to complete the process.

The Supreme Court had on August 17 put on hold the counselling for the medical seats in the state. The court asked the MCI and the state government to find a balanced solution to deal with the interests of state board students and those who cleared NEET.

A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra was hearing a plea filed by six students seeking a direction to the state government to conduct counselling for the medical seats solely on the basis of the merit list prepared on the basis of NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) marks.

The Directorate of Medical Education had received 50,558 applications from the aspirants of which 31,323 were seeking admissions to 2,594 seats.

Chinese Grand Prix set to extend stay,"Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004. Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004.

A new deal to keep the Chinese Grand Prix in the Formula One calendar has been agreed in principle and will likely be sealed within weeks, a senior F1 official said on Tuesday.

The sport, under ambitious new US-based owners, released its 2018 race schedule in June and Shanghai was only listed as provisional, along with Singapore. That prompted speculation that both races might be axed from the roster.

But Sean Bratches, F1 managing director of commercial operations, told AFP in Shanghai: “We’ve been working hard with Juss Event, the promoter, and we’ve got an agreement in principle. My suspicion is that it will be executed by the end of next month, fully executed.”

Bratches said that F1 chiefs released next year’s race schedule earlier than previously as part of efforts to make Formula One more fan- and sponsor-friendly.

“Next year the schedule will be released and there will be nothing provisional about Shanghai because we will have a long-term deal,” he added, following talks in the city that pushed the agreement along.

The current deal for the Chinese Grand Prix is due to finish at the end of this year. The Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‘Two Centuries of Indian Print’ (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

“So far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,” Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

“We are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,” explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. “So over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,” he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

“We want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL’s collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,” Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

“The British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‘Advice for Railway Travellers’ which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can’t seea they are in libraries across the world.” added Gupta.

All’s well that ends well,"The learned CJI had to pen 272 pages to conclude that the abominable custom of triple talaq is an “essential religious practice” of Muslims and enjoys protection of religious-liberty clauses of the Constitution (C.R. Sasikumar) The learned CJI had to pen 272 pages to conclude that the abominable custom of triple talaq is an “essential religious practice” of Muslims and enjoys protection of religious-liberty clauses of the Constitution (C.R. Sasikumar)

Confusion worse confounded. This is how I can best describe the way the Supreme Court chose to make public its views on triple talaq. The learned Chief Justice of India (CJI) preferred to read first the operative part of his judgment. Within minutes TV channels began telling the nation that the apex court had refused to interfere in this matter of national importance on the plea of people’s religious freedom and ruled that the practice of triple talaq is not repugnant to the Constitution of India. Only when concluding paras of the two other separate judgments were read out it became clear that what had been pronounced first was in fact the minority judgment.

The marathon hearing of the triple talaq case by what has been aptly described as an “inter-faith” bench was concluded on May 18. I have been wondering why the court needed more than three-and-a-half months to decide an issue concerning a customary practice which amounts to a blanket violation of the international human rights law and clearly flies in the face of the Constitution. The cat is now out of the bag. The learned CJI had to pen 272 pages to conclude that the abominable custom of triple talaq is an “essential religious practice” of Muslims and enjoys protection of religious-liberty clauses of the Constitution. While the Muslim judge on the bench simply approved the learned CJI’s views, Kurian Joseph wrote a separate 27-page judgment and Rohinton Nariman another running into 96 pages which U.U. Lalit endorsed. Constituting the majority judgment of the court, these had to prevail and the order of the court at the end of the 395-page split verdict had to be, “In view of the different opinions recorded by a majority of 3:2 the practice of triple talaq is set aside”.

It may be a case of the proverbial all’s well that ends well, but it leaves some curious questions to be answered. “There can be no doubt, and that is our definitive conclusion, that the position can be salvaged only by legislation,” says the minority judgment, adding that “unfortunately the Union seeks at our hands what clearly falls in its own”. It then proceeds to “direct” the Union of India to consider appropriate legislation. It is, to say the least, paradoxical to declare a religious practice to be constitutionally protected and then “direct” the state to legislate against it. Does the learned CJI mean that an essential religious practice, even though protected by the Constitution, can also be done away with by legislation?

Toward the end of his judgment the learned CJI said “till such time as legislation is considered we are satisfied in injuncting Muslim husbands from pronouncing talaq-e-bidat for severing their matrimonial relationship”, adding that the injunction will initially remain operative for six months, would stand vacated if legislative process for “redefining” triple talaq commences earlier, but if the said process contemplates abolishing the practice, will remain in force till this is finally done.

First, how could the court impose an injunction on the exercise of an essential religious practice protected by the Constitution? And, then, what will this injunction mean, and how will it be enforced? What will be the legal status of a triple talaq pronounced in violation of the injunction? Will it effect a single revocable talaq — this is how triple talaq has been “redefined” in Muslim countries which the minority judgment cites — or will it effect an instant divorce as usual but the violator would be liable to be punished for contempt of court? I feel, with due deference to the learned authors of the minority judgment, it smacks of a confused thinking and reflects an aspiration for reform without bearing the brunt for it.

The reasoning and conclusions of the other two judgments sound immensely rational and convincing. Kurian Joseph’s assertion that the apex court’s ruling in Shamim Ara (2002), reiterated in several later cases saying that a talaq by a Muslim husband can have legal effect only if pronounced in full compliance with the true Islamic procedure for it (by implication of which triple talaq has no legs to stand on), “is the law applicable in India” qualifies to be seen as the most sensible and hence highly appreciable observation found in the 395 pages of all the judgments read together.

The judgment of R.F. Nariman and U.U. Lalit declares that the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1937 “insofar as it seeks to recognise and enforce triple talaq” is ultra vires Article 13 of the Constitution (pronouncing all old laws in force that violate the fundamental rights to be void). I must point out that the Shariat Act does not specifically mention triple talaq among the subjects in which Muslim law shall be the rule of decision for the courts; it uses only the word “talaq” and clarifies that it includes khula (talaq at wife’s instance) and mubarat (divorce by mutual consent), etc, but does not enlist triple talaq as a form of divorce. Yet it is good that this separate judgment of the two learned judges does not leave any room even for arguing that “talaq” implies triple talaq.

Coming to the final order of the court based on the majority view, one may ask what will be the effect of “setting aside” the practice of triple talaq? Will it be a nullity and effect no divorce at all, or will it effect a single talaq with a cooling off period of about three months during which the man can revoke it and, failing that, the parties can directly remarry (without the so-called halala)? A clue is found in Kurian Joseph’s judgment which asserts that the decisive law in India is as set out in Shamim Ara to the effect that a talaq to be legally recognised must have been pronounced in a step-by-step compliance with the true Islamic procedure. As per that procedure, talaq coupled with the word “three” or repeated thrice would count only as a single revocable divorce. How I wish the bench had just reiterated Shamim Ara, unanimously, approving this implication of the very sensible ruling given 15 years ago.

"Despite great start, Manchester United theories still need testing","Jose Mourinho has used the word “confidence” a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. (Source: Reuters) Jose Mourinho has used the word “confidence” a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. (Source: Reuters)

Eight goals scored, none conceded and six points in the bag – it has been the perfect start to the season for Manchester United and they have rightly earned plenty of praise.

But before they are anointed champions-elect in August, it is surely worth asking whether or not the big question marks about Jose Mourinho’s squad have truly been answered in 4-0 wins over West Ham and Swansea?

No-one ever doubted that United, once they had signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, would be more potent in attack and indeed his three goals in two games has confirmed that.

With Marcus Rashford’s pace a threat down the left and Anthony Martial scoring in both his substitute appearances, Mourinho’s men certainly are proving to be a goal threat.

If the reports are accurate that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is making rapid progress in his return from a knee injury and is set to sign a new contract with club, United will have plenty of options in the forward areas.

Likewise the signing of Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic has given extra bite, solidity and balance to the United midfield and some extra protection to the back-line.

Last season United drew ten games at home – many of them matches they would have been expected to win – and this start suggests a repeat of those frustrations is less likely this time around.

But, looking at the fixture list, which has been kind to United in early season encounters, perhaps judgment should be delayed a little.

In October, United will finally face teams who finished above them in the league last season with a trip to Liverpool and a visit from Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the month. A week later, they are away to champions Chelsea on Nov. 5.

TOUGHER TESTS

One of the big question marks about United has been their defence where Mourinho has yet to find a fixed partner for Eric Bailly.

Swedish defender Victor Lindelof was supposed to be that man but he has made a slow start to life at Old Trafford and Mourinho is currently preferring Phil Jones.

Is the United defence, with Antonio Valencia and Daley Blind at full-backs, tight enough to win a championship? We can’t really judge that from wins over West Ham and Swansea.

Furthermore, no-one ever doubted that Lukaku could stick goals past those sort of opponents but will he be able to deliver in those crunch matches?

His record last season certainly raises the question – of his 25 goals for Everton, 21 came against the bottom 13 teams in the league.

Indeed, in his career, Lukaku has scored just one goal in 14 combined games against Chelsea and Tottenham.

Statistics can be misleading and in this case may reflect Everton’s inability to create chances for him against the top teams – but nonetheless the Belgian’s ability against the best remains a doubt to be assuaged.

The belief is also that Matic will enable Paul Pogba to thrive in a liberated, attacking role but while there are signs this might be happening, that theory also needs testing against the highest calibre of opponent.

REACTION

Then there is the issue of United’s mental strength.

Mourinho has used the word “confidence” a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. But as the manager himself noted, it is easy to be positive when you are winning.

“The team is confident, the team starts the game confident, the team starts the second half confident. But I want to see the way we emotionally react to losing it because it’s also another stage – be losing and try to change a result because in this moment everything is going in our favour.

“You know, it’s not always motorway. You always find difficult roads and we have to be ready,” he said.

He also knows that his team have the extra burden of a Champions League campaign starting next month.

While United had continental duties last year, when they won the Europa League, the demands of the Champions League, even in the group stage, are significantly more testing.

Mourinho has not yet had to rest players and rotate his squad – in other words the depth of his options, again good on paper, has not yet truly been challenged.

While the pundits may be making instant evaluations, the former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager has been around too long to fall for the trap of believing the hype.

As he put it after the win at Swansea:

“This time last season we had six points from our first two games and we finished sixth. This start means nothing.”

"Spinning track alone won’t win Australia Test, says Tamim Iqbal","Tamim Iqbal will open batting for Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Tamim Iqbal will open batting for Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Bangladesh is set to take on Australia in a two-match Test series that is scheduled to start from Sunday. The opening batsman of the home side Tamim Iqbal has said that it’s not only that would help their side win the game.”It is not that we will win just by making spin tracks,” Tamim told.

Adding more to it, the left-handed batsman suggested that the efforts from hosts’ bowling line up will play a key role in their success.

“Even if there is support for the spinners in the wicket, still our spinners will have to bowl really well,” he added.

Moreover, Tamim insisted that it needs team effort to create fruitful results.”Our batsmen also have to bat well as well as our pacers, who need to bowl well in these surfaces. If you want to see success then all these things have to work together,” he said.

The Bangladesh team selection recently had a lot of confusion when batsman Mominul Haque was dropped from the squad but was re-called.

“Mominul is added into the squad of the first test, replacing Mosaddek Hossain,” BCB president Nazmul Hassan. “(Hossain) is not cleared from his eye infection. So we can’t risk him,” he said.

“As a coach, you have a responsibility,” Hathurusinghe said. “But the player also knows what he has to do. They are working very hard on it. “Somebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing. Those players not in the squad, they are still practicing. Confidence comes when we communicate with the player. There is no rule but fairness is applied for everybody,” he added.

Squad: Mushfiqur Rahim (capt & wk), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Liton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Mustafizur Rahman, Taijul Islam, Mehedi Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Nasir Hossain, Shafiul Islam

Boko Haram use of kids as ‘human bombs’ soars in 2017: UN,"The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009. The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009.

UNICEF is reporting a fourfold increase in the use of children as “human bombs” by the radical Boko Haram group in northeastern Nigeria already this year compared to all of 2016. UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado says she has no explanation for the increase in 83 such “human bomb” children, two-thirds of them girls, compared to 19 total children last year.

She said Boko Haram does not always claim responsibility for such attacks typically against civilian targets, but no other groups are known to use the tactic. A side-effect is that “many children who have managed to get away from captivity face rejection when they try to reintegrate into their communities.”

The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009.

Supreme Court rejects Sasikala’s plea to review her conviction in disproportionate assets case,"V K Sasikala (File photo) V K Sasikala (File photo)

The Supreme Court of India on Wednesday dismissed a review petition filed by jailed AIADMK leader V K Sasikala in the disproportionate assets case in which she was convicted in February this year. Sasikala, along with two of her relatives, V N Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi, was awarded four-year jail term and has been in prison since the conviction.

Earlier, on May 4 she had moved the Supreme Court seeking review of the February 14 judgement of the court upholding her conviction in the disproportionate assets case in which she was accused along with former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister late J Jayalalithaa.

A trial court had convicted Sasikala in the case and sentenced her to four years in prison. This was upheld by the Supreme Court on February 14 this year.

Defending herself, Sasikala had cited an earlier judgement of the Supreme Court which had said that when the appeal against an accused stands abated on account of his/her death, the appeals against the co-accused would also stand abated. Two other accused — V N Sudhakaran, Jayalalithaa’s foster son, and Elavarasi, widow of Sasikala’s elder brother– had also appealed to the apex court.

The Bengaluru trial court had convicted Sasikala, Jayalalithaa, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi in the case. While the CBI had alleged that the unaccounted wealth was close to Rs 66.65 crore, the special trial court found disproportionate assets worth Rs 53.60 crore, which Jayalalithaa and the three others could not account for.

Sasikala had been in the jail in 1996 when the case had been registered.

Strong adolescence friendship bond may boost mental health,"Maintaining goof relationships with friends help children cope better with difficulties they face on a daily basis. (Source: File Photo) Maintaining goof relationships with friends help children cope better with difficulties they face on a daily basis. (Source: File Photo)

Worried over your son or daughter being too friendly with his or her mates? Take heart, having strong and intimate friendships during adolescence may help improve several aspects of mental health such as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression, researchers say.

“Our research found that the quality of friendships during adolescence may directly predict aspects of long-term mental and emotional health,” said lead author Rachel K. Narr, PhD candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Virginia.

“High school students with higher-quality best friendships tended to improve in several aspects of mental health over time, while teens who were popular among their peers during high school may be more prone to social anxiety later in life,” Narr added.

The study, published in the journal Child Development, looked at a community sample of 169 adolescents over 10 years, from the time they were age 15 to when they were 25.

The youth were racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse, with 58 per cent Caucasian, 29 per cent African American and eight per cent of mixed race or ethnicity and with median family income $40,000 to $59,999.

Adolescents were assessed annually, answering questions about who their closest friends were, reporting on their friendships and participating in interviews and assessments exploring such feelings as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression.

Researchers found that teens who prioritised close friendships at age 15 had lower social anxiety, an increased sense of self-worth and fewer symptoms of depression by the time they reached age 25 than their peers.

Neither having a strong friendship nor being more popular predicted short-term changes in mental health, the researchers noted. The researchers suggested that this may be because positive experiences with friends help bolster positive feelings about oneself during a stage of life when personal identity is being developed.

Also, close friendships may set adolescents on a trajectory to expect and therefore encourage supportive experiences in the future.

‘Creamy layer’ income cap for OBCs raised to Rs 8 lakh per annum,"There had been three revisions of the creamy layer bar. It was fixed at Rs one lakh in 1993 and hiked to Rs 2.5 lakh in 2004 and Rs 4.5 lakh in 2008. There had been three revisions of the creamy layer bar. It was fixed at Rs one lakh in 1993 and hiked to Rs 2.5 lakh in 2004 and Rs 4.5 lakh in 2008.

The income limit defining ‘creamy layer’ for OBC reservation has been raised by Rs 2 lakh per annum even as the Union cabinet today approved setting up of a panel for sub-categorisation within the other backward classes for even distribution of reservation benefits.

The government also ruled out having a relook at the present reservation system. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters here that the Union Cabinet was today formally apprised of the decision to hike the limit for central government jobs. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hinted in Assam recently that the bar defining creamy layer would be raised and the procedure of formally informing the cabinet about the decision was completed today.

The ministry of social justice and empowerment had proposed that OBC families which earn more than Rs 8 lakh per year should be classified as ‘creamy layer’ -— the ceiling which bars members of the other backward classes from availing reservations in employment.

Responding to a question, Jaitley said a proposal to extend the decision to public sector undertakings was under “active consideration” of the government.

There had been three revisions of the creamy layer bar. It was fixed at Rs one lakh in 1993 and hiked to Rs 2.5 lakh in 2004 and Rs 4.5 lakh in 2008. The present ceiling of Rs six lakh came into being in 2013. Jaitley also announced the decision of the cabinet to set up a commission to work out sub-categorisation within other backward classes for a “more equitable distribution of reservation benefits amongst the OBCs”.

He said 11 states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Jammu region only of Jammu and Kashmir have already carried out sub-categorisation of OBCs.

“There will be more equitable distribution amongst the OBCs themselves (of the benefits),” Jaitley explained.

The proposed commission, to be set up under Article 340 of the Constitution, will submit its report within 12 weeks from the date its chairperson is appointed. According to a press release issued by the government, the panel will examine the “extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes and communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list”.

It will also work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters — in a scientific approach — for sub-categorisation within such OBCs. The commission will also undertake an exercise of identifying the respective castes/communities/ sub-castes/synonyms in the central list of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.

Responding to a question, the Finance Minister ruled out having a relook at the reservation system in the country. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had in September, 2015 pitched for a review of the reservation policy, contending it has been used for political ends and suggested setting up of an apolitical committee to examine who needs the facility and for how long.

“Neither there is any proposal before the government, nor would there be a proposal (before it in the future),” Jaitley told a press conference on cabinet decisions.

He was asked whether the government will review the reservation system as suggested by Bhagwat.

Viceroy’s House movie review: This Huma Qureshi starrer is like a stilted play,"Viceroy’s House movie review: Gurinder Chadha isn’t just content with a political drama. Her film deploys all. Viceroy’s House movie review: Gurinder Chadha isn’t just content with a political drama. Her film deploys all.

Viceroy’s House movie cast: Hugh Bonneville, Gillian Anderson, Manjit Dayal, Huma Qureshi, Om Puri, Michael Gambon, Simon Callow

Viceroy’s House movie director: Gurinder Chadha

Viceroy’s House movie rating: 2 Stars

The summer of 1947 was especially hot, “hottest in 75 years”. One man who had never set foot in India before was brought in his double-breasted suit to work with a team and, in five weeks, draw a line dividing the country into two. He sweated and protested his way through it, as the likely bloodshed his actions would wrought played out on the streets.

If only Sir Cyril Radcliffe (Callow) was the story.

As the countdown to the Partition began, among the things to be apportioned, in the ratio of 80:20 between India and Pakistan, were the cutlery, musical instruments, and books at Viceroy’s House.

If only the division was the story.

As the well-meaning Mountbattens, “who everyone liked”, realised the impossibility of the task they had been handed, they hastened the British exit in the deluded hope that it would end the violence.

If only the Mountbattens’ delusion was the story.

Rather, the Viceroy’s House, on one of the world’s greatest tragedies, one that holds personal pain for Gurinder Chadha — one of her aunts starved to death in the mass migration — is like a stilted play, that at its best stirs itself up to an insipid British TV costume-drama. If drama can be used for it.

Given the scale of the Partition, it perhaps wasn’t a bad idea to tell it through the viceregal mansion (now Rashtrapati Bhavan), which lay at the start of that line. However, Chadha isn’t just content with a political drama. Her film deploys all: an Upstairs Downstairs (the TV show) kind of look at the outgoing British rulers, and their still obedient Indian servants, now divided along religious lines; instant history lessons through one-liners thrown in at intervals (“divide and rule” etc); and, most incongruously, a passionless love story between a Hindu man (Manish Dayal) and a Muslim woman (Huma Qureshi) employed in the service of the Mountbattens. As if the tragedy of what was playing out outside wasn’t enough to drive the story. There is even a third angle to that affair: the woman’s betrothed, who happens to be Mohammed Ali Jinnah’s driver.

Even if Chadha had been able to piece together all the things she is juggling here, along with an impressive Gandhi, a flailing Nehru and a casual Jinnah, who drop by at times, Viceroy’s House could have had a chance. However, the three strands, along with the strained staff of the Viceroy’s House, never gel. Once in a while, the director also turns her attention to the Mountbattens, who make for a more compelling story, if only because Anderson, despite that forced gait and walk, portrays Edwina as the only one aware of how their name is going down in history.

But is history really on Chadha’s mind? A document pulled out of a drawer, showing a Partition plan as far back as 1945, blamed on Winston Churchill, as a British grand design to contain the Soviets, is passed off as “real fact”. It waters down even that diluted effort at Nehru/Jinnah/Gandhi clash, making Partition inevitable, that Viceroy’s House makes earlier.

The film wisely declares ‘history is written by the victors’. The above Churchill ‘factoid’ is taken from a little-known book by a former Indian diplomat, Narendra Singh Sarila, who was once a junior member of Mountbatten’s staff. Well, Churchill did lose the 1945 elections.

Valencia sign Geoffrey Kondogbia on loan from Inter Milan,"Geoffrey Kondogbia will now play for Valencia. (Source: AP File) Geoffrey Kondogbia will now play for Valencia. (Source: AP File)

Valencia announced the signing of French holding midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia on loan from Inter Milan on Monday, their third signing in four days as new coach Marcelino sets about reinforcing his team’s defensive capabilities.

Kondogbia, 24, returns to La Liga four years after leaving Sevilla for AS Monaco, later joining Inter in 2015, and follows the signing of centre backs Jeison Murillo and Gabriel Paulista, who joined last Friday from Inter and Arsenal respectively.

Local media reports suggest that Valencia’s Joao Cancelo will go on loan to the Serie A club as part of the deal. The Portuguese defender appeared to bid an emotional farewell to Valencia fans after Friday’s 1-0 win at home to Las Palmas, as the team’s new campaign under former Villarreal coach Marcelino got off to a positive start.

According to reports in the Spanish media, Valencia will need to pay 25 million euros ($29.5 million) to buy Kondogbia at the end of his one-year loan period.

Marcelino, who turned Villarreal into one of the most solid and consistent sides in the league after winning promotion in 2013 and took them to the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, has pledged to bring defensive stability to a chaotic Valencia side which conceded a club record 65 goals last season.

White House says some members of infrastructure advisory council resign,"Some members of a White House infrastructure advisory council have resigned, the White House said on Tuesday, days after President Donald Trump’s response to violence at a rally by white nationalists in Virginia prompted business leaders and cultural figures to quit other panels in protest. Trump last week disbanded two business advisory councils after several chief executives resigned in protest over his remarks blaming the violence on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists.

In a statement on Tuesday, the White House did not give a reason for the resignations from the National Infrastructure Advisory Council and said the panel met on Tuesday with the majority of its members. It did not specify how many members quit.

“We can confirm that a number of members of the NIAC who had been appointed under the previous administration have submitted their resignation,” the statement said.

Trump, commenting on the Aug. 12 rally organized by neo-Nazis and other white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a woman was killed when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters, said last week that there were “very fine people” on both sides.

Trump dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum on Aug. 16. Sixteen members of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities also resigned on Friday in protest.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI Preview: India look to continue winning streak against hapless Sri Lanka","India will hope to continue its domination over the Lankan side. (Source: PTI) India will hope to continue its domination over the Lankan side. (Source: PTI)

After registering a thumping 9-wicket win in the first one-day international, team India will once again lock its horns against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele. While India will be buoyed by their string of spectacular performances, Sri Lanka needs to pull up their socks as they still have a lot to play for.

As far as the Indian team is concerned the form of Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli augurs well for the team. However, opener Rohit Sharma will be looking to add a few runs to his belt. The series will also be important for MS Dhoni as he has to justify his selection. While any major changes are not expected in the side, young Kuldeep Yadav might get a look in if Axar Patel is rested. But as of now, it seems like skipper Kohli will look to continue with Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel as his spin options.

Meanwhile, the hosts are plagued with a variety of concerns. Their disappointing performance in the first ODI led to sloganeering by fans. The selection of the team also raised quite a few eyebrows. The Lankan side also needs the veterans to rise to the occasion and deliver a match winning performance. The likes of Lasith Malinga, Thisara Perera, Angelo Mathews and Upul Tharanga were mediocre in the first ODI and hence the onus will be on them to perform.

As the first ODI turned out to be a pretty much one-sided affair, fans will be hoping that this one will see the hosts put up a fight. But as of now, India seems like firm favorites and hence India will look to continue with their winning momentum.

Teams:

India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli(c), Lokesh Rahul, MS Dhoni(w), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav

Sri Lanka: Niroshan Dickwella(w), Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga(c), Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Wanidu Hasaranga, Thisara Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Lasith Malinga, Vishwa Fernando, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Dushmantha Chameera

"Not considering ban on Rs 2,000 notes: FM Arun Jaitley","Finance minister Arun Jaitley. (Source-PTI Photo) Finance minister Arun Jaitley. (Source-PTI Photo)

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the government is not considering banning Rs 2,000 notes, and the Reserve Bank will decide on the timing of issuing the new Rs 200 bill. The government has given the go-ahead to the RBI to issue Rs 200 notes, a move that is aimed at easing the pressure on lower-denomination currency.

“The whole process regarding by when the notes will be printed, RBI will take care of that issue. Thus, it would be appropriate for the RBI to announce about dates and related matters to the note printing,” Jaitley told reporters in Delhi. When asked whether the government is considering to phase out Rs 2,000 notes, he said: “No, there was no such discussion”.

Following the demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 9 last year, the RBI had introduced Rs 2,000 notes and new Rs 500 notes with additional security features.

The 25-year-old opened his campaign at the Worlds with a testing win over Hong Kong’s Wei Nan.

"US, North Korea clash at UN forum over nuclear weapons","U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (R), together with Japan’s Foreign Minister Taro Kono (L), holds a news conference after their U.S.-Japan Security talks at the State Department in Washington, U.S., August 17, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

North Korea and the United States clashed at a UN forum on Tuesday over their military intentions towards one another, with Pyongyang’s envoy declaring it would “never” put its nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table. Japan, well within reach of North Korea’s missiles, said the world must maintain pressure on the reclusive country to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes and now was not the time for a resumption of multi-party talks.

North Korea has pursued its weapons programmes in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions and ignored all calls, including from major ally China, to stop, prompting a bellicose exchange of rhetoric between the North and the United States. North Korea justifies its weapons programmes, including its recent threat to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, by pointing to perceived US hostility, such as military exercises with South Korea this week.

US disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told a UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva US President Donald Trump’s top priority was to protect the United States and its allies against the “growing threat” from North Korea and America was ready to use “the full range of capabilities” at its disposal. The “path to dialogue still remained an option” for Pyongyang and it had the choice between poverty and belligerence on the one hand and prosperity and acceptance.

North Korea’s envoy told the same forum the North’s nuclear deterrent would never be up for negotiation, echoing Pyongyang’s regular denunciation of US “aggression”. “The measures taken by the DPRK to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter-continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defence in the face of such apparent and real threats,” diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the forum, referring to “constant nuclear threats” by the United States.

DPRK stands for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Regarding joint US-South Korean military exercises that began on Monday, he warned: “The ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.”

Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said pressure must be maintained until the North demonstrated it would give up its nuclear programme. “It’s not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,” Kono said, referring to stalled negotiations involving both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China and Japan. “It’s time to exert pressure,” he told reporters.

‘CRAZY’ TO SHARE TIMELINE

The head of the US military’s Pacific Command said diplomacy was key. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by “war maniacs”. “So we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,” Harris told reporters at a US air base in Osan, about an hour from Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader.

He said diplomacy was “the most important starting point” in response to the North’s threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive US strike against it. “As far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,” he said.

The United States and South Korea began the long-planned exercises on Monday, called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said are purely defensive. The drills involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea.

The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Delegations from about 20 countries spoke at the four-hour UN session, including Britain, France, Australia and South Korea, all of which criticised North Korea.

“I would like to repeat the appeal to the DPRK to listen to the fact that there is no alternative to stopping the different provocations and to return to dialogue,” South Korean ambassador Kim Inchul said. “We have never threatened the DPRK with any attacks and we have never promoted the use of force.”

Muslim women cheer on SC’s triple talaq verdict: Come a long way from Shah Bano to Shayara Bano,"From women fighting cases against husbands to recent victims left in the lurch, they clutched at hope, cheered “a historic day for Muslim women” and questioned the uncertainty the judgment had left in its wake. From women fighting cases against husbands to recent victims left in the lurch, they clutched at hope, cheered “a historic day for Muslim women” and questioned the uncertainty the judgment had left in its wake.

THE FIRST question that Shazia Fatima, 26, asked the inspector at the Women’s Police Station at Central Crime Station in Hyderabad as she walked in at 11.30 am Tuesday was about the Supreme Court verdict on triple talaq. Inspector Madhavi Latha tried to explain but, unable to comprehend fully, Fatima asked her what happens to her complaint now.

The police station in Basheerbaug receives the highest number of complaints regarding triple talaq in the city, at least 10 a week. Most of the women say they were given talaq over the phone, in text messages or WhatsApp, by husbands in the Gulf.

In Delhi, a 28-year-old Muslim woman who has been fighting a legal battle for over three years against her husband who claimed to have given her triple talaq, said she would now move court again to get maintenance. Her husband has denied her money on the ground that since he gave her triple talaq, he wasn’t obliged to pay anything more, apart from mehar. Hours after the Supreme Court verdict striking down instant triple talaq, the reactions that poured in from across the country summed up the mood.

From women fighting cases against husbands to recent victims left in the lurch, they clutched at hope, cheered “a historic day for Muslim women” and questioned the uncertainty the judgment had left in its wake. From the daughter of the late Shah Bano, whose landmark Supreme Court victory in 1985 over maintenance was overturned by legislation, to Shayara Bano, the main petitioner in this case.

“I am for the Supreme Court judgment in the sense that it will help illiterate women who are constantly under pressure and live in the fear of being given talaq,’’ said Siddiqua Ahmed, the daughter of Shah Bano in Indore. “I hugged my family when the verdict was delivered, they congratulated me, told me it is a historic day for Muslim women in India. We have been vindicated. Not just me, for all those like me, even those that were not present, this is for all of them,” said Shayara Bano in New Delhi.

In Hyderabad, though, Fatima wasn’t convinced. “Do you think the decision today changes anything for me? If I cannot save the marriage, I want to ensure that my husband returns all the money and gifts my parents gave, and takes care of our daughter by giving some monthly allowance. I hear he is preparing to marry again,” she told Inspector Latha. Fatima was married to Javed, a cloth salesman. One day, three years into the marriage, he stopped coming home, she said. A week later, he called and said talaq thrice. She came to the Women’s Police Station a fortnight ago.

“Many talaq victims came asking today about the Supreme Court verdict. All are disappointed because it says nothing about women who became victims recently,” a counselor, A Lakshmi, said. Commenting on the high number of cases of triple talaq they receive, especially concerning husbands in the Gulf, Inspector Latha said, “They come here for two-three months, get married, spend some time with the newly wed wife and after going back, say triple talaq. In such cases, we cannot do much. In cases where the husband is in Hyderabad, we call him and try to counsel him.”

In Delhi, the 28-year-old, who has been fighting her case in Mahila Court, said the Supreme Court order has given her hope for justice, and she would now seek maintenance challenging the validity of her triple talaq. Her husband claimed to have divorced her four years ago, and appeared before the court for the first time only recently to answer charges of domestic violence and of marrying another woman without divorcing the first. Her advocate Shubra Mendiratta said, “The matter is to be heard on October 6. The man has used a single argument that he has given triple talaq and that his responsibility is over. But now we will challenge the triple talaq as it has now been held unconstitutional.”

The woman said her husband never officially gave her divorce. “He married someone else and left”, she said, soon after their newborn girl died in 2008. “Only when I sought maintenance in court (in July 2014), I came to know he had given triple talaq. No one in the family was aware of this. I welcome the Supreme Court judgment. This will now help me get justice,” she said.

The woman also told the Mahila Court she had been “physically tortured and abused” and sought legal action under the Domestic Violence Act. The man, who works as a scrap dealer in Old Delhi and earns Rs 2 lakh per month, told the court that he had given her talaq on September 29, 2013. He also claimed that he settled “the mehar amount of Rs 25,000 on the first night of the marriage”.

“As per the Muslim law, I am sending a sum of Rs 6,000 by way of separate money order for maintenance of three months of the iddat period,” the document filed by the man states. Mehar is a mandatory payment promised by the groom and his family to the bride at the time of marriage, that legally becomes her property. Iddat is the period a woman must practise abstinence after divorce, during which she may not marry another man.

Said advocate Mendirata, “His argument is that he has settled the mehar amount, and that he has given her triple talaq. However, now, since the instant triple talaq is unconstitutional, this argument does not hold. In this case, the woman should get maintenance. The Supreme Court has given justice to hundreds of women. I hope the lower court interprets this judgment the same way.”

Mendiratta, who is handling several cases of triple talaq, urged that the National Legal Services Authority play a role in securing compensation. “We welcome today’s judgement. But what happens to women whose husbands have got married to some one else? The execution of the maintenance takes years. The government should step in and ask the Legal Services Authority to give compensation to such women, only then will justice be served.”

Dalit minor in Madhya Pradesh forced to remove excreta with her hands,"The girl’s father, accompanied by members of the Dalit community, has lodged a police complaint against Pappu Singh (Google Maps) The girl’s father, accompanied by members of the Dalit community, has lodged a police complaint against Pappu Singh (Google Maps)

An upper caste man allegedly forced a six-year-old Dalit girl to remove her excreta with hands on Monday from near her school in Gudhora village in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh. The state-run primary school does not have a toilet and the Class I student was relieving herself when Pappu Singh, an upper caste farmer, saw her. Singh scolded her for defecating in the open and forced her to remove her excreta with her hands. The girl returned home crying and told her parents about the incident.

Spain mourns attack victims as probe zeroes in on imam,"People stand next to candles and flower tributes placed on the ground after a terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

Grief-stricken Barcelona paid homage on Sunday to victims of two terror assaults at a mass in the city’s Sagrada Familia church, as investigators turned their focus to a missing Moroccan imam believed to have radicalised the young attackers. King Felipe, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont led the ceremony mourning the 14 people killed by jihadists who used vehicles to mow down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday and in the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils early Friday.

“These have been days of tears, many tears,” said auxiliary bishop Sebastia Taltavull. Outside the church, snipers were posted on rooftops surrounding the landmark building by Gaudi, while heavily armed police stood guard as hundreds of people gathered under grey skies. Catalonia resident Teresa Rodriguez said she had turned up to pray for the victims.

“What happened in Las Ramblas is really hard for us, we go for walks there often, it could have happened to me, my children or anyone. And here we are. It’s huge, huge,” she said as she fought back tears. Later on Sunday, nearly 100,000 people were expected at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium for their team’s first game of the season, to be marked by a minute of silence for the victims. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said on Saturday the cell behind the carnage that also injured 120 had been “dismantled,” although local authorities took a more cautious tone.

Police were still hunting 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who media reports say was the driver of a van that smashed into crowds on the popular Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday, killing 13 people. Hours later, there was a similar assault in the seaside town of Cambrils that left one woman dead. Police shot and killed the five attackers, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts.

An extensive security operation including roadblocks was mounted overnight across Catalonia. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attacks, believed to be its first in Spain. The terror cell in Spain reportedly comprised at least 12 young men, some of them teenagers. Investigators are seeking to unravel the role of an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, who is believed to have radicalised many of the youths from a small town called Ripoll, at the foot of the Pyrenees.

Several of the suspects – including Abouyaaqoub – grew up or lived in the town of about 10,000 inhabitants. On Saturday, police raided the imam’s apartment in Ripoll, his flatmate, who would only identify himself as Nourddem, told AFP. Spanish media quoting police sources, said the officers were looking for DNA traces in the apartment to compare with body parts found in an explosion in a home in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Barcelona, where the alleged jihadists were believed to have been building bombs.

Lin Dan wins to open bid for sixth Badminton World Championship,"Lin Dan recovered from being 11-1 down, to win the match 21-15, 21-10. (Source: Reuters) Lin Dan recovered from being 11-1 down, to win the match 21-15, 21-10. (Source: Reuters)

Lin Dan got his quest underway for a record sixth world badminton championship with a routine win over local British hope Kieran Merrilees on Monday. Lin won 21-15, 21-10 after an 11-1 start.

“Normally the first match is not easy, because I need to get myself in a good mindset,” Lin said. “I did a lot of practice and preparation, so I need to make this mindset last until the end of the championships.”

Next for the seventh-seeded Lin is Emil Holst of Denmark, who beat the Chinese superstar in March at the German Open. The other names in the top half of the draw were also relatively untroubled; top-seeded Son Wan Ho, and Kidambi Srikanth of India.

Son could become the first South Korean male to win the world championship, but he has to pass the quarterfinals for the first time. He and Kidambi, who beat Son while winning consecutive Superseries titles in Indonesia and Australia in June, are seeded to meet in the quarters.

The bottom half of the men’s draw begins on Tuesday and features all three medallists from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics: Gold medallist and defending two-time worlds champion Chen Long, silver medallist Lee Chong Wei, and bronze medallist Viktor Axelsen.

Chen, the Asian championship winner, starts against Georges Julien Paul of Mauritius. Chen’s on course to meet Chong Wei in the quarterfinals. The winner then could play Axelsen.

Chong Wei, three times a worlds runner-up, begins against Brice Leverdez of France, against whom he has a 7-1 record. All 16 women’s seeds received byes into the second round, including Olympic and two-time defending champion Carolina Marin of Spain, and top-seeded Akane Yamaguchi. No. 1-ranked Tai Tzu-ying is skipping the worlds to play in the World University Games in her Taiwan homeland.

Joining hands with the Aarey Conservation Group, Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam has raised allegations of corruption against Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and claimed that there is a Rs 18,000 crore scam behind the plan to construct a Metro car shed in Aarey colony. Nirupam pointed out that the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) has asked for more land than required, with the intention of handing over a portion of it to real estate developers for commercial use.

Terming it as an expose of the state government’s intentions, Nirupam alleged that Fadnavis is deliberately killing the city’s green lungs. “While car depots in other cities like Kochi and Pune need around 12 hectares, the MMRC has asked for 30 hectares. They will only end up using 18 hectares for the car depot and will hand over the remaining 12 hectares to private builders,” said Nirupam.

He alleged that the 12 hectares will yield around 12.84 lakh square feet which will amount to a profit of Rs 18,000 crore for the builders. “The current market rate of that area is around Rs 35,000 per square feet and basic calculations indicate that with an FSI of 4, real estate developers will commercially exploit the land and earn at least Rs 18,000 crore. This is a scam and the chief minister who is trying to ensure that this project takes off is responsible for it,” he said.

Nirupam and other activists including Stalin D, Amrita Bhattacharya, Priya Mishra and Biju Augustine of the Aarey Conservation Group pointed out that the site for the car shed has been finalised without considering alternative options. “Even though MMRC claims that alternative options were considered, there are no documents to show the other sites were even visited only because the other sites lie in Coastal Regulatory Zone where infrastructure can be constructed but not real estate. The state government has done nothing but lie at every step,” said Nirupam.

He claimed that even though it is well-known that Aarey colony falls under the jurisdiction of the forest department and is an eco-sensitive zone, the state government is trying to prove that Aarey colony belongs to the dairy development department and is not a part of forest land. The activists argued that the land belongs to the Revenue and Forest Department and Dairy Development Department is only the custodian of the land.

Nirupam said that while MMRC claims that no real estate development will be taken up near the depot, the design documents indicate that 30,000 square metres will be used for commercial purposes.

"I don’t like the word diet, says fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala","” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.” ” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.”

Celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala, who has trained the likes of Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif, says she doesn’t like the word “diet”.

“I don’t like the word diet. I think we all are smart and making smart food choices is a lifestyle change. I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them,” Karachiwala told IANS over e-mail. The celebrated fitness trainer, who has been roped in as the official fitness expert for sports and lifestyle brand Skechers, added: “I don’t recommend any diet”. Along with being a popular name in the fitness sector, Karachiwala, who owns a gym — Body Image in the suburbs of Mumbai, is also the first BASI certified Pilates instructor in India and established the first Pilates studio.

Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility and posture, and enhance mental awareness. Asked how Pilates is more beneficial than other forms of exercise, Karachiwala said: “Pilates helps strengthen the core and works the body from the inside out. It helps prevent injuries. I suggest doing it along with any other exercise and see how it makes you perform that exercise even better.”

Being in the fitness industry for over two decades, Karachiwala has helped Bollywood big-wigs like Deepika, Katrina, Alia, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora Khan, Zareen Khan and more to achieve the perfect frame.

What’s the biggest challenge she faces while training a Bollywood personality?

“I think to achieve different looks for a specific role is always a good challenge as if giving us an end goal. Challenges are good as it keeps you and your client motivated,” she said. Asked with whose transformation she was really proud of, Karachiwala replied: “All my clients work extremely hard. It’s not easy with their schedules but they are all dedicated to their workouts and I’m proud of them.”

It is often said that Bollywood personalities take supplements to modify their body according to their roles in films. What do you have to say to that? Karachiwala replied: “I don’t believe in supplements as such I think naturally. If we eat healthy, our body can get most of its nutrients. Of course, sometimes vegetarians have a problem with protein so then a plant based protein shake is what I would suggest.”

GST impact: Maharashtra govt to scrap ongoing tenders,"New Delhi: An illuminated Parliament ahead of midinight launch of ‘Goods and Services Tax (GST)’ in New Delhi on Friday. PTI Photo New Delhi: An illuminated Parliament ahead of midinight launch of ‘Goods and Services Tax (GST)’ in New Delhi on Friday. PTI Photo

The Maharashtra government has decided to scrap all ongoing tenders for awarding contracts for various development works to factor in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) impact. The state finance department has issued orders directing departments to cancel all such tenders where the GST factor was not accounted for and where work orders had not yet been issued.

“Departments have been asked to refloat such tenders after incorporating the decrease or increase in the contract cost owing to GST,” said a senior official. But an exception has been made for emergency work like broad repairs. While the departments have been permitted to go ahead with the existing tender and issue work orders in such cases, they have been asked to renegotiate the revised payables with the beneficiary contractors.

While the state’s fiscal managers are still reviewing the full impact of the decision, a senior official said the roads, the public works department and the irrigation department will be the most impacted. Meanwhile, the government is seeking legal opinion on how to rework contracts where work orders had been issued already. Legal advice has also been sought for contracts where some work had been carried out before the GST regime kicked in on July 1, while the remaining contract work and tied-up payments were to be made post July 1.

After missing ODI cricket for a long time due to an impasses with the board, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels are set to play in the fifty-over format for their country as they were picked in the Jason Holder-led squad for the ODI series in England. While Gayle last played an ODI in March, 2015, Samuels’ last appearance came back in October, 2016.

The duo’s return to the squad is after a relaxation in Cricket West Indies’ eligibility criteria for selection. Earlier, to play a format, players had to be available in domestic tournament corresponding the same. There was a change in policy in July this year and the players were offered an amnesty.

“With regards to the selection of the ODI squad, the panel welcomes back Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who will both add value to our batting and help with the nurturing of the young batsmen in the team,” chairman of selectors Courtney Browne was quoted by Cricinfo. “Both Sunil Narine and Darren Bravo have declined to be considered for ODIs in England. Narine has however confirmed his desire to play 50-over cricket again but has asked to play in our Regional Super50 before he is considered and Darren said he was not available for selection. Dwayne Bravo said he is still not 100% fit, but is looking at a possible return to international cricket next year.”

In the notable omissions, Kieran Powell, Jonathan Carter and Roston Chase are missing from the squad which featured in the ODIs against India in June and July. Jerome Taylor, who featured in the T20I against India, returns to the ODI format after a long absence.

Proffesor killed boyfriend as part of sexual fantasy: Prosecutors,"These booking photos provided by the Chicago Police Department show Wyndham Lathem, left, and Andrew Warren on Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (Chicago Police Department via AP) These booking photos provided by the Chicago Police Department show Wyndham Lathem, left, and Andrew Warren on Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (Chicago Police Department via AP)

The fatal stabbing of a hairstylist in Chicago was part of a sexual fantasy hatched in an online chatroom between a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee, whose plan included killing someone and then themselves, prosecutors told a Cook County judge Sunday at a bond hearing for the men. An Illinois prosecutor shared disturbing new details about the July 27 slaying, describing to the court how Trenton James Cornell-Duranleau, the 26-year-old boyfriend of since-fired microbiology professor Wyndham Lathem, was stabbed 70 times at Lathem’s Chicago condo and with such brutality that he was nearly decapitated. His throat was slit and pulmonary artery torn.

Lathem, 46, had communicated for months before with Andrew Warren, 56, about “carrying out their sexual fantasies of killing others and then themselves,” Natosha Toller, an assistant Cook County state’s Attorney, told the court. While the prosecutor used the plural in talking about the alleged fantasy to kill, she did not say there were other victims. Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. at one point shook his head in apparent disgust as he listened to the prosecutor offer a chilling narrative of the slaying. He later deemed both men potentially dangerous and flight risks, ordering them to remain in jail pending trial on first-degree murder charges.

“The heinous facts speak for themselves,” he said. Lathem and Warren — a British citizen employed as a financial official at the Oxford, England, university — were dressed in their own clothes Sunday at their first court appearance in Chicago. They stood calmly, their hands behind their backs, as the prosecutor and judge spoke. Lathem paid for Warren’s ticket to travel to the United States and he picked Warren up at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport a few days before the killing, the prosecutor said. On July 26, one day before the killing, Lathem booked a room for Warren near the condo, Toller said.

Cornell-Duranleau, a Michigan native, had been asleep in Lathem’s high-rise Chicago condo when Lathem let Warren into the 10th-floor unit around 4:30 a.m. on July 27 — treading carefully so as not to wake the victim. As Warren stood in a doorway, Lathem crept up to Cornell-Duranleau and began plunging a 6-inch drywall saw knife into his chest and neck, Toller said. Lathem had told Warren to take video of the killing using his cellphone, but Warren did not end up recording it, the prosecutor said.

When Cornell-Duranleau awoke, he began screaming and fought back; Lathem yelled at Warren, asking him to help subdue Cornell-Duranleau, the prosecutor said. Warren ran over to cover the victim’s mouth, then struck him in the head with a heavy lamp in an attempt to silence him, Toller said. As Lathem continued to stab the victim, Warren left the room and returned with two kitchen knives, she said.

Warren bent over Cornell-Duranleau and joined Lathem in stabbing him, the prosecutor said. At one point, the victim bit Warren’s hand as he struggled to fight off the attack. She said the victim’s last words were to Lathem: “Wyndham, what are you doing?”

While prosecutors said Lathem and Warren had concocted a plan to kill themselves after the stabbing, Toller did not say why they never followed through with it. After showering, Lathem and Warren left the apartment an hour after the stabbing began, the prosecutor said. They surrendered to California authorities on Aug. 4 after an eight-day manhunt and were recently returned to Illinois. The stab wounds to Cornell-Duranleau included 21 to the chest and abdomen, and 26 in the back, as well as multiple cuts on his hands. Cornell-Duranleau’s lungs were also both punctured, and there were wounds to his colon, spleen and liver.

After leaving the apartment and renting a car, Lathem on the same day left an anonymous $5,610 donation — in cash — at the Howard Brown Health Center in Chicago in the name ‘Cornell-Duranleau.’ They then drove to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and, 13 hours after the first payment, Lathem went to its public library and wrote a $1,000 check as a donation, also in the victim’s name, the prosecutor said. Toller said Lathem, while on the run, sent a video message to his parents and friends, admitting to the killing and telling them “he is not the person people thought he was.”

Lathem’s lawyer, Barry Sheppard, said in a brief statement to reporters after the hearing that people shouldn’t “engage in a rush to judgment.” He said his client had led “a life of unblemished … citizenship,” which included academic work on the bubonic-plague virus. Warren spoke briefly when the judge asked if he wanted a British diplomatic office to be in contact. “No,” Warren said. For the bond hearing, Warren relied on a public defender, who did not comment later.

The judge set a Tuesday hearing for the men, when another judge will be assigned to oversee the criminal case. Both would have a chance to enter pleas at a later arraignment.

Want to be supremely fit like Virat Kohli? This video could help,"Virat Kohli talks with Shankar Basu during his workout. Virat Kohli talks with Shankar Basu during his workout.

Virat Kohli’s fitness continues to set new standards in both the Indian cricket team and world. From starting out as a chubby cricketer from Delhi, Kohli’s transformation into supremely fit athlete has been commendable. In a recently released video, bcci.tv gives a sneak peak into what goes behind making the “captain’s well sculpt body”. In the video, Shankar Basu – India’s strength and fitness coach – can be seen scribbling Kohli’s day routine on the white board before the Indian skipper heads to the mat and starts his warm-up.

Basu returned for another term with the Indian team ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 and has played a key role in improving fitness levels of the Indian cricketers. Kohli credits Basu for his improved fitness levels and, according to a report, pushed for the coach’s return.

The video reveals Kohli’s workout details and how it starts with an intense cardio session before moving to weights. It’s basic stretching on the mat for starters before the skipper heads to knee-ups. Post this, he heads to the iron and engages in lifting – mainly clean and jerk. After a session with the iron bar, the skipper performs some dead-lifts and then forward lunges, with weights.

After a thumping win in the series opener, India now lock horns with Sri Lanka in the second ODI on August 24. After the second ODI, the two teams would meet in the third ODI on Sunday. Kohli has been in good touch in ODIs this year and continues to power his side home in run-chases. He is averaging 487, yes 487, in India’s successful ODI run-chases this year.

"US lawmakers welcome sanctions on Chinese, Russian companies","US lawmakers have welcomed the Trump administration’s decision slapping sanctions on Russian and Chinese entities and individuals for helping North Korea advance its missile and nuclear weapons programme. (Representational Image) US lawmakers have welcomed the Trump administration’s decision slapping sanctions on Russian and Chinese entities and individuals for helping North Korea advance its missile and nuclear weapons programme. (Representational Image)

Top US lawmakers have welcomed the Trump administration’s decision slapping sanctions on Russian and Chinese entities and individuals for helping North Korea advance its missile and nuclear weapons programme. The yesterday’s sanctions targeted 10 Russian and Chinese companies and six individuals involved in conducting business with the reclusive nation. “I support strong sanctions against those enabling North Korea to advance its missile program, and I am pleased by the US Treasury’s action today,” Senator Joe Donnelly, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance, said.

“As I’ve said, North Korea should be our top national security priority in the Pacific and we must focus the full economic and diplomatic force of our nation on this problem and get other countries in the region to do the same,” said Donnelly, who recently helped the Senate pass bipartisan legislation, which Trump signed into law, that would increase sanctions on North Korea.

As a Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, he has led efforts to increase funding for US missile defence programmes and supported provisions in this year’s national defence bill to significantly strengthen the US homeland missile defence system against the threat of an intercontinental ballistic missile attack. “For far too long, China has enabled North Korea to pursue nuclear development, cyber warfare, global provocation, and egregious human rights violations. Russia has also not been a good faith partner on these issues. The status quo is no longer acceptable,” said Congressman Robert Pittenger.

“Trump’s decisive action, coupled with my legislation to further punish businesses which support North Korean cyberattacks, sends a strong message. If you support the brutal North Korean regime, there will be a punitive response from the United States,” he said.

Congressman Dan Donovan said the Trump administration’s strategic sanctions against companies and individuals that do business with North Korea are exactly what’s needed right now. “We must continue to isolate the regime, cut off its economic activity and pressure nations, particularly China and Russia, whose companies and citizens help the North generate the resources used to further its aggressive nuclear programme,” said Congressman Dan Donovan who serves on the House Committee on Homeland Security and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Yesterday’s sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, deal in the North Korean energy trade, facilitate its exportation of workers, and enable sanctioned North Korean entities to access US and international financial systems.

Some of the prominent companies and individuals slapped with sanctions are China-based Dandong Rich Earth Trading Co; Mosco-based Gefest-M LLC and its director, Russian national Ruben Kirakosyan; and China- and Hong Kong-based Mingzheng International Trading Limited.

As a result, any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of US persons or within the United States must be blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The Treasury also designated three Chinese coal companies collectively responsible for importing nearly half a billion dollars’ worth of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2016.

"INX media case: Karti Chidambaram appears before CBI, to be examined again on Aug 28","Karti Chidambaram at the CBI office in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Source: Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey) Karti Chidambaram at the CBI office in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Source: Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey)

Karti Chidambaram appeared before the CBI on Wednesday for questioning in a case alleging irregularities in a clearance granted by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). Karti, son of former Union minister P Chidambaram, was directed to appear before the top probe agency by the Supreme Court.

Karti, who arrived at the agency headquarters on the directives of the Supreme Court around 10.20 AM, was questioned for over eight hours, CBI sources said. They said he will be examined again on August 28.

On Tuesday, the Madras High Court refrained from granting any relief to Karti, who sought quashing of the FIR filed by the CBI and its subsequent summoning in the INX Media case. Justice P Velmurugan directed the court registry to return all the papers in the case to the petitioner so as to enable him approach the Delhi High Court which has superintendence powers in the matter.

The judge had on August 16 reserved orders on maintainability of Karti’s petitions seeking to quash the FIR and summons related to the case pending in a CBI special court in Delhi.

The probe agency had earlier claimed that the FDI proposal of the media house INX Media was ‘fallacious’ but P Chidambaram had cleared it. On May 15, an FIR was registered by the CBI against Karti and INX Media along with eight others for alleged irregularities in the FIPB clearance given to the media house in order to receive FDI. Karti’s father P Chidambaram was the finance minister then. The agency had alleged that a firm “indirectly controlled” by Karti had received money from INX Media, run by Indrani and Peter Mukerjea in 2007.

Thousands protest in Hong Kong over jailing of democracy activists,"Student leaders Lester Shum, Nathan Law and Alex Chow hug as they arrive at the High Court to face verdict on charges relating to the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central protests, in Hong Kong, China August 17, 2017.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

Thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against the jailing of three young democracy activists, with many questioning the independence of the Chinese-ruled city’s judiciary. On Thursday, Joshua Wong, 20, Nathan Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, were jailed for six to eight months for unlawful assembly, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.

Thousands of people marched in sweltering temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) to the Court of Final Appeal, carrying placards and banners denouncing the jailing of the activists. Former student leader Lester Shum, who helped organize Sunday’s rally, said the number of protesters was the highest since pro-democracy protests in 2014 that paralysed parts of the financial hub for 79 days. “This shows that the Hong Kong government, the Chinese Communist regime and the Department of Justice’s conspiracy to deter Hong Kong people from continuing to participate in politics and to protest using harsh laws and punishments has completely failed,” Shum said.

Protesters brandished a large banner saying: “It’s not a crime to fight against totalitarianism.” They shouted: “Release all political prisoners. Civil disobedience. We have no fear. We have no regrets.” Ray Wong, 24, leader of pro-independence group Hong Kong Indigenous, said the issue is uniting government opponents.

“Since the Umbrella movement, the radical and milder forces walked their own path,” he said, referring to the 2014 democracy movement. “We’re now standing together. It is a good start.” In Sunday’s protests, some signs said “Shame on Rimsky”, referring to Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen, who Reuters reported last week had overruled other legal officials who initially advised against pursuing jail terms for the three activists.

Wong and his colleagues triggered the 2014 mass street protests, which attracted hundreds of thousands at their peak, when they climbed into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters. They were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but the Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

On Friday, Yuen denied any “political motive” in seeking jail for the trio. The former British colony returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement that ensured its freedoms, including a separate legal system. But Beijing has ultimate control and some Hong Kong people are concerned it is increasingly interfering to head off dissent.

5-YEAR DISQUALIFICATION

The jail terms for Wong, Law and Chow disqualify them from running for the legislature for the next five years. Lau Siu-lai, one of six legislators expelled from the city’s legislature this year over the manner in which she took her oath of office, said the sentences were unreasonably harsh. “It appears to be political suppression to strip away young people’s right to stand in elections,” she said.

“I hope people will pay attention … We need to protect Hong Kong’s’ rule of law.” Another protester carried a placard of Lady Justice with a red blindfold. “Hong Kong’s Lady Justice and the rule of law… are now being controlled by communists, and are now being twisted and she is now blind,” said 50-year-old artist Kacey Wong. While the decision to impose tougher sentences on the activists attracted widespread criticism in Hong Kong and overseas, the Hong Kong Bar Association and Law Society defended the court’s decision.

“Unfounded comments that judicial decisions were made or influenced by political considerations originating outside Hong Kong are unjustified and damaging to our legal system, and to Hong Kong as a whole,” they said in a joint statement on Friday.

We’re not getting carried away: Manchester United’s Nemanja Matic,"Matic, who joined United from champions Chelsea in July, played a key part in Jose Mourinho’s side picking up consecutive victories.

Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic is enjoying the positive dressing room atmosphere at his new club and believes that such team spirit will help the club cope with pressure over a long season.

United have won each of their first two Premier League games 4-0 and are top of the table on goal difference. Their dominance against West Ham United and Swansea City earned praise and fuelled fans’ hopes of a first league title since 2013.

Matic, who joined United from champions Chelsea in July, played a key part in Jose Mourinho’s side picking up consecutive victories and the Serbian credits the results to the players’ unity off the pitch rather than individual performances.

“It’s just the beginning of the season, but I am confident,” Matic said.

“It’s always special when you play for Manchester United and there is always pressure, but we are ready to cope with that.”

United will return to the Champions League next month after winning the Europa League in May.

“The group is great, we are all friends in the changing room and that’s very important. The season is long, so we have to have a good group, have good communication, and this team has that. I’m happy to be a part of this.”

Matic says the team are not becoming overconfident after notching two wins and are looking ahead to Saturday’s match against Leicester City, champions in 2015-16.

“We’re not getting carried away… we’re two games into the season and we’ve got another tough game against Leicester City next week, which won’t be easy. I’m just pleased to be playing,” Matic added.

Iran, accused of supporting Shiite Huthi rebels in Yemen, “is part of the problem, not the solution” when it comes to ending conflict in the war-torn nation, Yemen’s top diplomat has said.

“Iran is the cause of the problem, Iran continues to support the Huthis, Iranian arms are smuggled. Iran is part of the problem, not the solution,” Foreign Minister Abdulmalik al-Mekhlafi said when asked if Tehran could contribute to a political solution in Yemen. He was speaking at UN headquarters after a major luncheon hosted by Yemen and Saudi Arabia with the majority of diplomatic missions to the United Nations.

“Iran has no role to play in the region,” echoed the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi. Saudi humanitarian aid to Yemen is estimated to top 8.2 billion dollars.The Saudi-led military coalition largely controls the country’s airspace, although US drones also carry out strikes on suspected Al-Qaeda bases there. More than 8,300 people have been killed and 44,000 wounded since the Saudi-led coalition entered the Yemen war in 2015.

Close to 2,000 Yemenis have also died of cholera since April and another 600,000 are expected to contract the infection this year.

"After triple talaq verdict, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan says its draft can be used to codify personal law","Women distribute sweets in Nagpada Tuesday. (Source: Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar) Women distribute sweets in Nagpada Tuesday. (Source: Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar)

While the Supreme Court has asked Parliament to enact a law on how divorces can take place under Muslim Personal Law, activists have for long been demanding the codification of Muslim Personal Law. Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, one of the petitioners in the triple talaq case, has already worked on a Draft Muslim Family Law, which does away with verbal divorce and polygamy and has also stipulated the amount to be paid to a woman as Mehr during her wedding.

The draft law is being called the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act and BMMA has been working on it since 2007. This is the first time that Islamic laws pertaining to marriage, divorce and maintenance have been codified, the body says. The BMMA is hoping that the government uses this draft law to improve conditions of Muslim women in the country.

The draft law stipulates that the bride should not be younger than 18 years of age and the bridegroom 21 years of age, and neither party should have a living spouse. Islamic laws allow a Muslim man to legally have upto four wives. The draft law also stipulates how much the Mehr should be. Mehr is the amount paid by the groom to the bride during the wedding. The draft states that the minimum amount of Mehr shall not be less than one full annual income of the groom.

It further states that if the stipulated Mehr amount is not paid within six months of marriage, then the groom will have to pay double the amount. In present circumstances, some grooms give an amount as less as Rs 786 as Mehr. The draft law virtually abolishes the verbal divorce and triple talaq way of giving divorce. It states that only the Talaq-e-Ahsan method of divorce should be followed. In this method, divorce is pronounced once and then the couple waits for three months in what is seen as a period to sort out differences. This form of divorce keeps the option of a reunion open and the husband can reverse the process of divorce if both parties agree.

The draft also imposed heavy penalty on offenders, including cancelling of a Qazi’s licence, for repeat offences in failing to ensure fulfillment of conditions during marriage. It also calls for action under the Code of Criminal Procedure for all those who fail to pay maintenance.

Muslims in India are governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1936. This law makes the Shariat applicable on Muslims. However, this law is not codified and is open to interpretations. Women’s groups claim that these interpretations are prone to be used against women. Various women’s groups have been demanding that the Muslim Personal Law be codified so that its provisions are clear to everyone.

However, the conservative clergy has claimed that codification is tantamount to tampering with the Sharia and the Islamic way of life. The state also seems not very keen on taking up the issue for fear of antagonising the clergy, many feel.

“In the absence of a codified law, customary practices which are divergent from the values and principles of the Quran have emerged. New codes have been introduced globally with the hope that they will introduce the rule of law in family matters and end arbitrariness and variances in judicial decisions. In India, there is a need to have a comprehensive codified family law to ensure justice within the family,” the preamble to the draft law states.

"In economic crisis, Angola votes for first new leader in 38 years","Questions have been raised as to how much power Lourenco will have if he wins, given veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 74, will continue as head of the MPLA and have potentially a sweeping say over decision-making. Questions have been raised as to how much power Lourenco will have if he wins, given veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 74, will continue as head of the MPLA and have potentially a sweeping say over decision-making.

Angolans headed to the polls on Wednesday in a parliamentary election expected to usher in the ruling party’s defence minister as the first new leader of Africa’s second biggest oil producer for 38 years.

Joao Lourenco, who has pledged to boost growth and fight corruption, would inherit an economy mired in recession as gaping inequality, soaring inflation and high unemployment squeeze poor Angolans who have benefited little from a decades-long oil boom.

The People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) is expected to remain in power but with a reduced majority. Its support has waned due to widespread political cronyism, though many Angolans remain loyal to the party that ended 27 years of civil war in 2002.

Voters were seen waiting in orderly queues on a cloudy morning in the capital Luanda when polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) as police and military manned street corners.

Questions have been raised as to how much power Lourenco will have if he wins, given veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 74, will continue as head of the MPLA and have potentially a sweeping say over decision-making.

His daughter, Isabel, heads national oil producer Sonangol and his son José Filomeno is in charge of the state investment fund. Lourenco on Tuesday dismissed suggestions he would be a puppet president, saying he would focus on leading an “economic miracle”, possibly with the help of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and prosecute corrupt politicians.

Dos Santos, Africa’s longest-ruling president behind Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema, will step down after guiding the OPEC-member from Marxism to capitalism while embracing Chinese oil-for-infrastructure investment.

The MPLA’s main opponent will be its former civil war foe, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), while young voters have been lured by CASA-CE, which was formed in 2012 on a promise to disrupt 50 years of two-party politics.

There are concerns about how fair the vote will be after the government cracked down on recently planned public demonstrations. UNITA has said it will lead protests if it believes the MPLA has manipulated results.

An unofficial result is expected by Friday.

But there may be no formal announcement for two weeks as ballot boxes wend their way along pot-holed roads and dirt tracks in a country of 28 million spread across an area twice the size of France.

Indian cricketers Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan will train two youngsters from Jammu and Kashmir, Danish Qadeer (18 years) and Shahrukh Hussein in their cricket academy in Noida. The two all-rounders inaugurated ‘Cricket Academy of Pathans’ branch in Noida in May this year with an aim to train aspiring coaches on how to be effective in coaching. The coaches will then be prepared to train youngsters by giving them useful tips and techniques.

Cricket Academy of Pathans collaborated with the Indian Army. After conducting the trials for selection in Kupwara district, Indian army selected Qadeer and Hussein.

Speaking to IANS, Irfan said,”Kids were selected by the Indian army for which they had conducted trials at Kupwara district of J&K. Out of 100 cricket enthusiasts, two were selected by the Indian Army for training under CAP.”

On being asked about youngsters’ future, Irfan said: “These kids have just enrolled in the academy. They would be going through the preliminary module of CAP and after completing the preliminary module they would advance to the other levels of CAP modules.”

After the selection process, Irfan also appreciated Indian Army’s effort to take the initiative and said that they will always promote cricket. “We are always there to support and promote cricket. It is a very noble move by the Indian Army to support these kids,” he concluded.

"Infosys tussle: Contrary to allegations, no let-up in governance standards, says Venkatesan to Jaitley","Venkatesan is believed to have briefed Jaitley about the developments at Infosys and assured the minister of no let-up in corporate governance standards at the company, contrary to the allegations labelled by Murthy. (Source: Reuters/File photo) Venkatesan is believed to have briefed Jaitley about the developments at Infosys and assured the minister of no let-up in corporate governance standards at the company, contrary to the allegations labelled by Murthy. (Source: Reuters/File photo)

Amid a feud between the board of Infosys and co-founder NR Narayana Murthy, company’s co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan on Tuesday called on finance and corporate affairs minister Arun Jaitley. Venkatesan is believed to have briefed Jaitley about the developments at Infosys and assured the minister of no let-up in corporate governance standards at the company, contrary to the allegations labelled by Murthy.

Last week, Vishal Sikka resigned as the CEO and managing director of Infosys, saying the assault on him by Murthy had become increasingly malicious and personal. The company’s board came out in support of Sikka, hailing his performance in transforming the company and attributing his resignation to Murthy’s continuous assault on him.

Murthy had in recent months raised issues of “deteriorating standard of corporate governance” at the company. He had alleged that the company might have paid hush money to former CFO Rajiv Bansal and that the Panaya acquisition had not been above board. The allegations, however, have been strongly rejected by the company’s board.

Murthy’s concall with investors today

Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy will hold a conference call with investors on Wednesday. Murthy’s interaction with the investor community comes at a time when there is growing concern about the company’s future. The industry is expecting some strong words from Murthy during the investor call, especially considering the criticism by the Board.

According to sources, a section of Infosys investors had reached out to Murthy seeking an early resolution to the dispute. “The investors are worried about the way in which the company is now managed,” a person familiar with the development said. The promoter group holds 12.75 per cent stake in the firm.

Murthy’s call with analysts comes at a time when the board is making attempts to reach out to clients and institutional investors.

Carnival hits town as Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor ready to fight,"Floyd Mayweather goes into the bout undefeated and hoping to keep his 49-0 tally intact. (Source: Reuters) Floyd Mayweather goes into the bout undefeated and hoping to keep his 49-0 tally intact. (Source: Reuters)

The carnival finally hit town Tuesday, with Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr. putting on a bit of a fashion show before promising to knock each other out in their highly anticipated boxing match.

Mayweather wore a fedora and gold rimmed glasses while McGregor sported a three-piece suit and tie and aviator sunglasses as they made separate appearances before a crowd of several hundred people in front of the arena where they will fight Saturday night.

The two got into an unplanned verbal confrontation as they moved between the outdoor stage and the arena, though it was brief. Bodyguards kept them apart and both fighters are smart enough not to do anything to jeopardize their immense paydays from what could be the richest fight ever.

“It’s work,” Mayweather said when asked if he was having fun. “My job is to be a fighter.”

McGregor, meanwhile, reiterated his vow to knock Mayweather out within two rounds, and claimed the boxer was getting desperate in making comments about his weight and stamina.

“Let him keep praying about weight and fatigue. All he’s doing is praying,” McGregor said. “But he’s praying to the new god of boxing.”

The crowd for one of the final promotional events was small and not terribly vocal, especially after waiting an hour or two in 100-degree heat to see the fighters. There was no one in line at T-Mobile Arena’s three ticket windows, where plenty of expensive tickets remain for the bout.

The big money for the two fighters will come from pay-per-view sales, and early indications are that it could break all records. Some 50 million people may watch in the United States alone, with millions more tuning in worldwide.

Estimates vary wildly, but Mayweather could pocket $200 million, while McGregor might make $100 million.

The promotion has been more circus-like than anything, but both boxers said they were serious about putting on an explosive show on fight night.

“This fight is not going to go the distance,” Mayweather said.

“I believe I’ll knock him out early, one or two rounds,” McGregor said.

Both fighters seemed relaxed and confident, just days away from a fight that seemed improbable at times and impossible at other times. Yet they will meet under boxing rules in a scheduled 12-round fight that matches a UFC champion who has never boxed professionally against the master defensive fighter of his time.

McGregor said it was just another progression in his fighting career, and chided Mayweather for saying he hopes the referee does his job and doesn’t allow McGregor to try any mixed martial arts moves against him.

“I may make him beg me to follow the rules,” McGregor said.

Mayweather said he expected McGregor to come out wildly and use roughhouse tactics, something Marcos Maidana did effectively when he fought Mayweather in 2014. But he said the Irish fighter can’t keep that up for 12 rounds and doesn’t understand what it is to get hit by a real boxing champion.

“When he gets hit he’ll find out it’s totally different,” Mayweather said.

While looking as fit as ever and insisting he is taking the fight seriously, Mayweather said he will be doing meet-and-greet experiences every night living up to the fight at his new strip club just off the Las Vegas Strip.

“I’ll be at the Girl Collection every day this week,” he said. “Every day.”

Romanian player George Calintaru breaks finger in anger after failed ‘Panenka’,"George Calintaru taking the penalty. (Source: Screengrab) George Calintaru taking the penalty. (Source: Screengrab)

Juventus Bucharest midfielder George Calintaru broke his finger when he punched a table in the dressing room after seeing his stoppage-time ‘Panenka’ penalty easily saved, that could have earned his newly-promoted club a draw against FCSB in Romania’s Liga 1 on Saturday.

The 28-year-old missed the penalty in the sixth minute of added time after trying to chip the goalkeeper of FCSB, formerly known as Steaua Bucharest, angering his team mates.

TV footage showed Calintaru being pushed by vice-captain Valentin Barbulescu after the costly miss, which was the final kick of the game. The match ended in a 2-1 home defeat for Juventus, who had Iulian Carabela sent off after 72 minutes.

Local media reported Calintaru had been beaten by team mates after the final whistle but Juventus manager Daniel Oprita described the incident as “heated discussion”.

Oprita, who joined the club in 2015, said after the defeat that he did not want to continue as manager.

Juventus, still searching for their first win of the season, remain bottom of the table with two points from seven matches. Unbeaten FCSB are third on 15.

By Shivshankar Menon

This is a remarkable work of scholarship in a long-neglected area — state consolidation and frontier-making in the eastern Himalaya between 1910 and 1962. Unlike other books which have dealt with the high politics of the India-China relationship and boundary, it studies these issues from the ground up, from the point of view of the peoples and society. Coming when the Indian and Chinese states have accumulated hard power and are rubbing up against each other in their shared periphery, this history is a topical reminder of how we got to the present situation, and suggests alternate ways of looking at the processes of state formation and consolidation in the Indian and Chinese peripheries in the early 20th century.

The basic thesis is that existing analyses miss a fundamental element of Sino-Indian rivalry: the difficulty of coexisting in the Himalayas, a region whose distinct human landscape exposes India and China’s imperial nature. The 1962 war was preceded not just by military and diplomatic escalation, but by an older and increasingly tense shadowing contest to convince the eastern Himalayas’ inhabitants that one state, and not the other, was the better alternative. Guyot-Réchard sees India and China as post-imperial polities seeking to deepen their rule over the Himalayan region, where they encounter people starkly different from their “core” citizenry. She distinguishes between the behaviour of China and India. While China uses colonial policies on its geographic peripheries, independent India’s unity-in-diversity ideal coexisted with imperial strategies, and China and India see themselves as each other’s ‘shadow state’ in the Himalayas.

Based on research in the Arunachal Pradesh and Assam archives, original primary sources, and extensive interviews with those involved, the book naturally focuses much more closely on the Indian side, where sources are accessible. For the Chinese side, where sources are unavailable, limited or patchy, the author relies on deduction and inferred motives from revealed Chinese state behaviour. This could have opened her to the accusation that she is looking for keys lost somewhere else under a street lamp because that is where the light is. But the objectivity with which she handles the material avoids most pitfalls of this method — of picking over Indian flaws and hesitations while the official Chinese narrative gains undeserved credence by comparison and equation. It is hard to see what more she could have done. She has obeyed the historian’s cardinal rule and followed the evidence.

The result of her considerable scholarship is an important book that covers significant themes in an increasingly important area with a professional historian’s care and precision. For instance, the book deals with the complicated and non-linear transition in the eastern Himalaya from empire to nation-state in India and China, where the process was completed in the early 20th century (and, implicitly, in Tibet where the transition from a pre-modern polity to the nation state was not completed). It describes competitive state expansion in successive episodes, the first of which, by China in 1910-12, set off what Guyot-Réchard calls “shadow state” behaviour, where India and China reacted and mirrored what they thought the other was doing to consolidate power and sovereignty in this border region, and not only on their side of the Himalaya.

In describing this process, she is also alert to multiple side-shows which influenced the main flow of events in unpredictable ways. One was the triangular differences between London, Calcutta/Delhi and Assam. For London, imperial interests in keeping Russia out of Tibet dictated accommodation with China, recognition of Chinese “suzerainty” over Tibet, and ruled out an interest in expanding into the eastern Himalaya. New Delhi/Calcutta saw the exercise of British rule and recognition of boundaries as necessary both for security and commercial reasons but were unwilling to prioritise or invest. And, Assam saw Delhi’s regular relapse into a “policy of aloofness” as dangerous and sought a forward policy on the ground in terms of presence, civilian administration and development.

Another interesting theme was the impetus for the 1910 Treaty with Bhutan from Qing and Tibetan assertions of sovereignty in the eastern Himalaya, and Bhutan’s role in Calcutta and London’s Tibet and China policy. As for China, when she first tried to conquer Dzayul in May 1910 and entered the Lohit valley, the King of Bhutan was informed that his kingdom was China’s protectorate, and he was ordered to let Chinese currency circulate freely and to confine diplomatic relations to Beijing only — plus ça change…! This first burst of Qing China’s forward policy in the eastern Himalaya was soon ended by Tibetan resistance and the fall of the dynasty at home.

Shadow States: India, China and the Himalayas, 1910–1962

This is a book full of discovered delights, of repetitive patterns of behaviour by governments in India and China. One of them is the “recourse to force [which] had been a long-standing way of managing vulnerability on the part of China-based polities” that several instances in the book attest to. It is particularly good on the ebb and flow of administration in the eastern Himalayan borderland. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal the development dimension and the relationship between the people and the state in NEFA. The new Indian state differed from its predecessor, but carried on its legacy. With the 1950 Assam earthquake, independent India changed the coercive state vocabulary by adding development initiatives and relief. The story of state-building is told clinically and well.

The real value of this book is its emphasis on the role of the people of the eastern Himalaya and what it says of “ever-changing state-society relations on either side of the eastern Himalayas”. It describes local peoples’ preference for the looser arrangements of India over the monopolistic Chinese approach to their polities and societies. It was this preference that saw the relatively smooth return of the Indian administration into these areas after the 1962 war, despite Chinese attempts during their two to three month occupation of large parts of NEFA to demonstrate their goodwill to the people and to prove their superiority over the Indian state. Guyot-Réchard argues that “arguably, the PRC’s demonstration of invincibility, impeccable efficiency and self-sufficiency had been too convincing.”

The book also brings a fresh perspective to China’s military victory in 1962, which Guyot-Réchard says could well turn out to be Pyrrhic. She argues that viewed solely in military terms or of control of territory, the victory was undeniably China’s. But why then, as John W. Garver points out, is this China’s “forgotten war”? Is it because China’s leaders felt they miscalculated in launching it, and that it failed to resolve China’s coexistence with India or win over the populations of the eastern Himalaya? After the war, Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule continued, and NEFA’s people cooperated with returning Indian authorities. To that extent, the narrative of Chinese victory loses its shine, she points out. My own sense is that the war was at least as much an internal political coup by Mao, which succeeded, but which can hardly be acknowledged. It is probably a combination of several of these factors that explains the Chinese treatment of 1962 as the ‘forgotten war’.

As China seeks to extend her strategic frontiers in several directions including the eastern Himalaya, and India seeks to maintain the natural geographic boundaries that have served her through history, this is a timely and useful book. It is also a useful reminder of the relatively recent and fragile nature of state formation in the eastern Himalaya. Internal party-political games in the Northeast, toppling governments and stretching the law beyond its capacity, and failure to meet minimum standards of governance only lays in store trouble in a situation of weak and fragile state structures and fundamental social change in our Himalayan borderland. When China is increasingly active at our periphery, when she hosts insurgent leaders from the Northeast India like Paresh Baruah, and reactivates Indian insurgent groups, it is useful to remember that this has been an arena of India-China competition for over a century, where the two countries have shadowed each other, where new states and aggressive nationalisms are yet to find equipoise, and where development has proved its worth as an instrument in the past.

We need more work like this which takes us away from the monochromatic state and sovereignty-centred view of our borders to a fuller understanding of our own past that includes the agency of the people and that show us the complexity of what we have inherited. In that complexity itself lies opportunity for the pragmatic policymaker, for the historian and for those who are prisoners of our present constricted narrative on China, our borders and the history we share. Like a true work of history, it will have served a useful purpose if it brings us to question conventional wisdom, widens our vision, and provokes more scholarship on its themes, and on the domestic and internal political dynamics that drive India and China to do what they do. Do read this book. It is of value well beyond the limited circle of academic readers that the title might attract.

What they didn’t tell you: Coming out is a never-ending process,"What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

What do you want to be when you grow up?” a ninth grade English paper once asked me. It was a 20-mark essay, and I had 20 minutes to earn them. I rolled up my sleeves, and pulled out my cursive best.

The thing is, I wanted to be a great many things.I wanted to be a chef, an actor, a painter; I wanted to be an astronaut, and, for two weeks after I turned 11, I wanted to be a National Geographic correspondent — if only because my older sister said that she wanted to be one. From the age of six to 16, I raced through changes. My styles, my sexual leanings and my haircuts changed, and so did my dreams.Only, what did I never dream of being? Myself.

I was so used to pushing my problems under a hypothetical carpet, that I never realised the lies I was hoarding. It was an easy, lazy life. Through adolescence, I used this complacency as a security blanket, and wound it around myself whenever thoughts of the future terrified me. What would coming out (as a gay man) be like? Would I have to talk about my feelings? Would I have someone to talk about my feelings to (a fair question, because I grew up thinking that you were only allowed to talk about your feelings at expensive therapy sessions, sappy book clubs or when watching romantic tearjerkers)?

Growing up signified independence — no more staying at home, no more rules, no more restrictions, no more getting worried over your mother’s 18 missed calls (well, almost). But I didn’t know what I would do with all the freedom. Independence petrified me. What would I do being free? Would I finally have to be myself?

People are terrified to be themselves, especially when bravery is an option, and not an obligation. I’ve been called manipulative, selfish, a coward and a sore loser. Why would I want to be myself then? I’d rather be someone nicer and more admirable; I’d rather be someone else.

Some enjoy the peace that comes with accepting who they are, but most of us get stuck on the fence in the middle. Take sexuality, for instance. We can stir ourselves to walk free and fabulous, but we’d rather stay safe and sound in the cage of heteronormativity. I made myself feel at home in the cage till I was 21. The thing about independence, though, is that it doesn’t come gift-wrapped and express delivered to your front doorstep. It needs to be earned, or fought for.

Coming to terms with your sexuality and stepping out of the closet isn’t easy — especially in a country like India, where minds can be as narrow as Bandra’s bylanes, even if you are an upper-class, well-educated man (and sometimes, especially if you an upper-class, well-educated man). As countless films and American television shows have told us, you don’t just wake up one morning and walk out into the sunlit world. To reach the closet door, you need to push through your woollens, those “buy-one-get-one-free” shirts you bought on an impulse, and the odd tangle of smelly socks, greying underwear and smutty novels you don’t want your mother to find. It will be tough, especially if you’ve been hoarding — and holding back — all your life.

And even when you do, it’s a never-ending process. Those closet doors that everyone talks about? They are revolving. Week after week, you will find yourself coming out to friends, family, acquaintances, and (occasionally) drunken strangers at the bar. Perhaps, one day it will not be the big deal that it is today, and you won’t have to worry about whether your words are followed by a kiss to the cheek or a punch to the mouth. Every new acceptance is a fresh slice of independence, and you’ll wolf it all down.

Fortunately, my personal coming out story reeks of acceptance and Hallmark cards. I sat my parents down and told them everything in a diligently rehearsed 17-minute monologue. In 18 minutes, it was done. Questions were asked, hugs were exchanged, a tear was shed (that would be me). My mum went for a walk with her friends and my dad continued solving the crossword puzzle. They accepted it with a simple shrug (and lots of love and support over the next couple of years, but this is not that story). My sexuality was just another fact.

What about the war of words I had been expecting? The emotional bloodshed? The years of torment at the hands of society? They never came, even though history books said that they would. Times are changing, and somewhere over pop culture references and more inclusive media representations, my parents and peers had changed as well. The history books had it wrong.

What they did get right was this — freedom felt liberating. The freedom to stay single. To be a sexual deviant. The freedom to wear a skirt (if you are a man) or a jersey (if you are a woman). The freedom to wear both, or neither. The freedom to never find your way back home.

What do we do with the freedom then? Do we let it consume us? Terrify us into never seeking it out? We do neither. We simply unwind and enjoy it with a cup of tea. Preferably, chamomile.

"Junior cricketing structure in India is probably the best in the world, says WV Raman","WV Raman has praised the Indian u-19 side for its commendable performances. (Source: Express Photo) WV Raman has praised the Indian u-19 side for its commendable performances. (Source: Express Photo)

The Indian U-19 side has put in a string of good performances over the past year. In the recently concluded series against England, India dominated their opposition to register a clean sweep. Comparing the Indian side with its counterparts, WV Raman, who was the India coach in the youth series, stated that the team is way ahead.

While speaking to TOI, Raman said, “The junior cricketing structure in India is probably the best in the world. It also includes the Under-16 category. These boys get to play numerous matches and that too at very good venues. They are well supported by the system.Thus, these players are definitely at an advantage as compared to the boys in the same age group from other countries.”.

“Most of them start playing for the state Under-16 or zonal sides. Their skills are developed in the off-season camps.They not only gain experience playing a lot of matches but these camps help them repeat their skills more often and gain proficiency. That’s why these boys are far superior to those from the other countries,” he added.

Singling out Prithvi Shaw and applauding him for his efforts, Raman said, “Prithvi is fearless, dominating and confident. He has a special ability to get runs quickly. In another two years, he will find out a way on how to be aggressive consistently for long periods.”

“The heartening thing is it wasn’t just about a couple of individual performances. Our bowlers chipped in with the bat under pressure, guys who flew in for the ODIs hit the mark straight away under pressure moments. That was the highlight of the tour for me,” he concluded.
