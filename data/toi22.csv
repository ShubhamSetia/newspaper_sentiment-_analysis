GOD’S OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura’s alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.“Monkeys.They are chashma chor — spectacle stealing thieves,” he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:“You can’t blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.” We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna’s chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone — holy men, devotees and tourists — entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city’s Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister’s offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings — temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys — starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka’s resignation on August 18 — need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I’ve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India’s boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect — one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal’s remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn’t end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company’s board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company’s website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn’t, as you didn’t in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here’s my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys’ share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn’t end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka’s pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal’s task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don’t I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren’t needed.

Omkar

Sri Lanka coach Pothas distances himself from Chandimal non-selection,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

Sri Lanka coach Pothas distances himself from Chandimal non-selection

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 02:11 PM

Sri Lanka's interim coach Nic Pothas distanced himself from the controversial non-selection of middle-order batsman Dinesh Chandimal for the ongoing five-match ODI series against India after his team suffered a humiliating nine-wicket defeat with more than 21 overs to spare on Sunday.

Chandimal, Sri Lanka's best ODI batsman in the last two years and the Test captain, was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe as well. However, he was expected to return for the series against India at his customary number four position.

Instead Sri Lanka's selection panel, headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya, has given Chandimal's position to ODI captain Upul Tharanga while drafting in Chamara Kapugedera to number six, who will complete 100 ODIs in the second game against India at Pallekele, and has only eight half-centuries.

Pothas attended the post-match media briefing and ducked the question relating to Chandimal when he said it was a question that the selectors had to answer. The Chandimal question has been hotly debated in Colombo with several former captains, including Arjuna Ranatunga, Jayasuriya's mentor, questioning his snubbing.

Already whitewashed in the Test series, there was no change of fortunes for the Sri Lankans in coloured clothing as Shikhar Dhawan (132 not out) and captain Virat Kohli (82 not out) added an unfinished 197 runs for the second wicket to guide India to a comprehensive win.

Earlier Sri Lanka had collapsed dramatically after a good start having been asked to bat first. They were 150 for two half way through the innings and then lost eight wickets for 66 runs to be shot out for 216 runs.

Jayasuriya's selection panel has been criticised for lack of consistency and lack of patience. In the last two years, the selectors have used more than 50 players in ODIs, a move that was criticized by Pothas.

""If it was up to me and we had control over what we did, then we could probably give you a timeline (as to when the team will start winning). It's a question you probably need to ask a few other people as well. For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months.

""You'd see massive improvements. These are seriously gifted players. You give them a little bit of time - you give them a little bit of love, a little bit of care, and build up that confidence, you'll see results quick,"" Pothas added.

Sri Lanka were no match to the Indians, who are fielding a second-string attack having rested all their key bowlers. Sri Lanka were completely outplayed in all three departments.

""It swings between hurt and embarrassment. Emotionally you get angry. You get frustrated. Am I angry with the players? Absolutely not. The players work as hard as anyone can ask of them. They've been superb. Support staff have been out of this world. Brilliant.

""They work endless hours with planning and helping the boys. You can't fault anyone within that changing room. Yes, we didn't play our best cricket today. That's pretty obvious. You do get angry. To say ""too many cooks"" is probably accurate.""

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it’s a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there’s one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it’s Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India. Super-cool isn’t it? Watch the video to virtually experience this cool augmented reality battle with the chilly monsters!"
"Founders keepers? Infosys badly hit by internal turbulence, must find a way out in tough environment","The irony of Vishal Sikka’s departure from Infosys is hard to miss. Sikka bravely led the Indian IT industry charge against unpredictable global headwinds in the form of protectionism and disruptive technological changes. But internal turbulence within Infosys proved too difficult to negotiate. When NR Narayana Murthy and the other founder-promoters exited Infosys’s board in 2014, it was hailed as a talismanic moment for corporate governance. After all, it’s not often that Indian promoters turn over their companies to professional managers. Having decided to let go, Murthy should have resisted the temptation to interfere.

Ultimately, Infosys’s stock and Murthy’s reputation took a beating. Sikka was brought in after slowing revenue growth from outsourcing, high attrition rate, and top-level exits dimmed the aura that Murthy and co-promoters assiduously built up over two decades. If the Murthy era focussed on paring down costs to maximise labour arbitrage, Sikka loosened purse strings and utilised cash reserves to fund overseas acquisitions and offer very generous salary and severance packages. Murthy took offence to these changes in corporate culture forcing the Infosys board to play a delicate balancing act between shareholders and its chief executive.

But that restraint ended with the board’s statement accusing Murthy of a “misguided campaign”. After such acrimony Infosys may not attract a top-notch technology leader from outside. Sikka placed his bets on artificial intelligence, automation and cloud computation to improve productivity and sustain Infosys’s edge. This strategy demands a CEO focussed on technology and innovation. The Elon Musks come at a high premium but offer the hope of creating new business and employment opportunities to offset the job losses from AI and automation. Murthy must take a page out of Bill Gates’s playbook. He must allow Infosys to reinvent itself in a changing business and technology environment."
I've learnt so much out of failures: Dhawan,"INDIA TOUR OF SRI LANKA, 2017

I've learnt so much out of failures: Dhawan

• Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 12:08 AM Gokul Gopal in Dambulla

Dhawan slammed his 11th ODI to guide India past the finishing line. © AFP

That Shikhar Dhawan becomes a whole different force when it comes to ICC events is a fact that can hardly be contested. In the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, he amassed two centuries and a fifty. Come the 2015 World Cup, he repeated that feat and also came up with big contributions in the 2017 edition of the Champions Trophy that concluded in June. Between the said events, however, he has had a few slumps that has resulted in him being out of the reckoning on occasions.

But since his latest comeback, Dhawan has gone from strength to strength with each performance of his, and in doing so, reaffirming his footing as one of the key members in the core group. His latest contribution was an unbeaten 132 in the opening ODI against Sri Lanka, that resulted in India's biggest victory in the format in terms of deliveries remaining,

""I would like to keep performing well. That would be my goal because I don't perform there are such great batsmen in our side that anyone can take the place,"" said Dhawan, who also recollected how some of his past failures have made him stronger as a cricketer. ""I embrace that period also. When I was not doing well I was just focusing on my processes. And when I am doing well, I am still focusing on my processes. I feel failure teaches you a lot and I am lucky I have learnt so much out of that.""

A few days before the start of the ODI series between Sri Lanka and India, the visiting team's chief selector, MSK Prasad, had stressed that the emphasis, going forward in Indian cricket, would be on fitness in the lead up to the 2019 World Cup. Parameters and strict adherence were some of the terms he had used to make his point while he also advocated a rotation policy to identify and nurture a core unit that would feature predominantly in the mega event. Dhawan too spoke about fitness and the need to perform consistently in order to remain atop the pecking order when it comes to team selection.

""I would like to keep my fitness on a high level because all the young boys are there (in the Indian side). I like to keep myself fit (and be) at the pace of the game. I don't really have too many goals that I have to score these many runs. I just focus on my process and in my process everything comes in. My fitness, skills, fielding. These are my process and I keep doing it,"" he said.

Elaborating on the fitness, especially how it helps a team become stronger as a fielding unit, Dhawan said: ""It is very important that everyone should be at the same level of fitness. Fielding is a major part in all three formats. One loose fielding can change the momentum and in today's cricket you have to be fit. Now it is very high-paced cricket and you have to be fit. It's a very fair thing. If you are not fit then I think the team has to take that load and it's not fair on the team. Every cricket team like Australia, England, etc. they all have fitness parameters. So it's good that we are doing it and becoming more professional,"" Dhawan said.

Speaking about being professional, the Indians were just that as they clinically dismantled Sri Lanka for 216 before reaching the target with more than 20 overs to spare. Be it the batting, bowling or fielding, India appeared light-years ahead of the home team to extend their dominating run in the series. Such was the apathy of Sri Lanka's performance that slogans were being shouted against them and abuses were hurled as the fans held a mini protest outside the ground after the match. Dhawan, though, had some comforting words for the Sri Lankan team.

""This is a young side and they are in transition period where all the boys will mature. In international cricket you need to have that experience. The young boys are good but with time they will get better that's what I feel.

""I don't use those harsh words,"" he said when asked if this was the worst Sri Lankan attack he has faced in his career. ""They have a good fast-bowling attack. Even in the Champions Trophy, they beat us. It's just that we have got a mature side, very experienced side so that plays a huge role because how you handle pressure situations matters a lot with experience. So I feel that with time Sri Lankan team will do good,"" Dhawan concluded.

"Hope for the best, but expect less","I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine. -Bruce Lee

A friend’s status update on a social media site: ‘Who hurt you? My own expectations.’

Yes, we all have expectations in our lives: what we want out of life and who we want to become. I believe one of the keys to happiness lies within the management of your expectations of people and circumstances. If you do not have expectations, you can never be disappointed. Often we tend to believe that the way we treat others will be the way we are treated in return. But, unfortunately, this does not always happen.

The biggest disappointments in our lives are often the result of misplaced expectations. This is especially true when it comes to our relationships and interactions with others. You need to make sure you enter into relationship with someone who has as big of a heart as you do. If you do not, you may feel as if you are being taken advantage of. You need to find people who appreciate what you do for them and who will reciprocate those actions.

There are two ways to be happy: improve your reality or lower your expectations. Having realistic expectations will allow you to accept the flaws each person has. We need to learn how to take responsibility for our own lives and our own decisions before we can expect others to do the same.

One of the biggest challenges we face in life is learning to accept people for who they truly are. Once you realize that your expectations cannot change people, the better off you will be. Give without expectation, accept without reservation, and love with hesitation. Unrealistic expectations most often do lead to disappointment. Too many people are obsessed with finding the perfect career or the perfect spouse, and as a result become increasingly frustrated when this does not happen in reality.

Expectation is the root of all heartache. Try to remain confident while maintaining positive aspirations; just remember not to make the aspirations so high that they are impractical or unreachable.

Acceptance is an amazing trait that needs to be actively worked toward. When things do not work out the way we had planned, it is much more beneficial to realize that is how life works rather than becoming frustrated at the situation. Have hope rather than expectations and you will tend not to be as disappointed.

People rarely behave exactly the way you want them to. Hope for the best, but expect less. And remember, the magnitude of your happiness will be directly proportional to your thoughts and how you choose to think about things. Even if a situation or relationship doesn’t work out at all, it’s still worth it, if it made you feel something new, taught you something afresh."

Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release — to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour’s standards. Somehow ‘comfort zone’ has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life’s journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‘until a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.’ Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‘I’,the soil into which it is buried is God — the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected — into us.■

"Wayne Rooney Makes History, Scores His 200th Premier League Goal While Playing Against Manchester City","Wayne Rooney chalked up another career milestone on Monday when he scored his 200th Premier League goal to put Everton 1-0 up at Manchester City.

reuters

The 31-year-old forward, who returned to Everton from Manchester United in July, struck in the 35th minute at the Etihad Stadium, steering Dominic Calvert-Lewin's low cross between the legs of City goalkeeper Ederson.

reuters

He is only the second player to have reached the 200-goal milestone in the post-1992 Premier League era after Alan Shearer, who scored 260 goals for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.

Having scored the only goal of Everton's opening fixture against Stoke City, it was Rooney's second goal of the season.

Dry fruit-based desserts for your sweet fix,"Cranberry nut brittle

Ingredients

50 g dried cranberries

100 g mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds, pistachios)

150 g granulated sugar

30 g butter

1½ tbsp water

Method

Chop the nuts and mix with dried cranberries. Set aside.

Lightly grease a baking sheet (or thaali) and keep ready.

Place sugar, butter and water in a heavy bottom pan. Simmer over low heat until the sugar begins melting.

Stir continuously for about 10 minutes, then the sugar will begin to turn a light brown and will have melted completely. Once it turns medium brown, drop a tiny dot into a bowl of cold water.

Test to see that it turns crisp immediately.

Now quickly stir in a pinch of baking soda, and turn in all the dry fruit and cranberries.

Vigorously mix in to coat, and then immediately turn out onto greased tray, flattening rapidly with a flat metal spatula, spoon or butter knife. Be careful as the mixture will be very hot, but will begin to harden into shape rapidly.

Leave to cool, and then break into pieces.

Note: If you like even pieces then mark the brittle with a butter knife or pizza cutter while still warm.

Break up once cool."

House guests and fish: Both of them begin to stink up the home after about three days 😜,"It is truly said that house guests and fish have a common factor. After three days they begin to stink. You arrive at the host’s place full of warmth and sunshine and thoughtful gifts and they give you the hastily refurbished room with spanking new sheets, a fresh bar of soap, a fluffy towel smelling of naphthalene (saved in the suitcase for a special occasion) and a tube of toothpaste.

Come next morning and they have told you, relax, no rush to wake up, get over your jet lag, so you are lying there not making a noise in case they wake up and they are in the adjoining room lying there not making a noise in case you are disturbed and this absurd scenario in mutual accommodation can go half way onto lunch and then finally both have the same thought, they have to go and so the encounter occurs outside the bathroom door and now there is a flurry of no, no, you go first, no, you please, no hurry, all yours, it’s okay.

And then it is lunch and they have laid on a veritable feast and you haven’t the heart to tell them that you are on a sparse diet (so much for what the health) and this is going to wreck it and why have they bothered and the host is thinking, we never make this much on any other day, costs a fortune and they have pulled out the finest linen and crockery and that silver cutlery set that is used only to impress guests.

Then they have mapped out the tour for you to sightsee and you are not a sightseer and you have to pretend this is the most exciting idea and what you don’t know is that the host would rather watch Chelsea play Arsenal and instead he has to go with you because his wife hissed and said, it doesn’t look nice if you stay back, it’s only a soccer game.

Finally, it is day three and you have both run out of conversation and you are avoiding their obnoxious teenage children who resent you for having ‘stolen’ their room so they are having to share and the husband and wife are now asking oblique questions to ascertain when you are leaving like should we book theatre tickets for Sunday and your wife sends you a WhatsApp saying take them out for dinner and now you are in this fancy restaurant calculating the bill and it is a sobering thought that it is big enough for you to have stayed in a hotel and watched India play Sri Lanka."

Sunil Joshi appointed Bangladesh's spin consultant

Aayush Puthran • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:30 PM

While Australia have gone back to hiring the services of S Sriram, who helped their spinners during the India series earlier in the year, Bangladesh have added to their contingent, former India spinner Sunil Joshi, who has been roped in as the spin consultant for the immediate future.

The former slow left-armer confirmed the development to Cricbuzz but refused to divulge details of the duration of his service with Bangladesh's national side. ""Yes, I will be working as the spin consultant for the Australia series, and will be joining the (Bangladesh) side shortly,"" Joshi told Cricbuzz.

With Bangladesh having shown drastic improvements as a Test team in the last year,. the forthcoming two-match series marks a big opportunity for them to register their maiden Test win over Australia. It would be no surprise that they would bank on their strength, which also happens to be Australia's biggest weakness - spin.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board had gone all out in search of a spin consultant for the series, including the possibility of having Stuart MacGill in their coaching setup.

With the former Australian legspinner declining to take up the role due to illness, BCB turned towards Joshi, with whom they had earlier tried to initiate talks for the role of a bowling coach.

Joshi, who has played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs for India, was the Man of the Match in Bangladesh's first ever Test in 2000. He had scored 92 in his only innings and bagged eight wickets in the match, including a fifer.

"Sunny side up: As America undergoes eclipse, the Leone flares briefly over Kochi 😜","Americans by the millions will momentarily be averting their eyes from an orange face, as it gets occulted by a shadowy white orb that bears the tattoos of many astral nicks and cuts. Lest umbraphiles (eclipse chasers) take umbrage at this apparent alignment of politics with astronomy, let it be said that in the cosmic scheme of things, events on terra firma are but fleeting moments, evanescent and ephemeral. They often involve – to paraphrase the singer Bonnie Tyler in this case – a “total eclipse of the heart … faster than the speed of night.” Yes, night; not light.

Still, having hitched their wagon to a reality star, many voters are doubtless dismayed by the steady procession of those who are exiting hurriedly after their moment in the sun, scorched by the heat of office and expectation, and scalded by a lashing tongue. Even conservatives, who were over the moon not so long ago at the prospect of taking over the earth, are said to be wishing they lived on another planet, given the lunacy of the past few weeks. Again Bonnie Tyler – “once upon a time they were falling in love, now they are only falling apart.” What malefic alignment of celestial bodies has caused their best-laid plans to go awry, they are wondering, amid the meltdown in Washington DC.

They ought to take heart from a steamy event in distant Kochi, where the solar eclipse looming over America was preceded by a local thermonuclear flare, the likes of which India has never seen. We refer of course to the rapturous welcome according to the former porn star and rising Bollywood starlet Sunny Leone by starry-eyed Tony Testosteronies of the nation’s most literate state. By going kochi-coo over the diva of the divan in such vast numbers and demonstrating that they are willing to lie down with the Leone, they proved that India is not just up for sun worship, but also for Sunny supplication.

As for Leone (nee Karenjit Kaur Vohra), with an admirably sunny disposition, she is making sashay while the sun shines, unlike her fellow Americans (she is Canadian-born, but has US citizenship) who are currently more zigzaggy than syzygy, the term for alignment of the sun, moon, and earth that causes the eclipse. She ought to ask them to rise and shine, echoing the Bard’s words that “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.” Out of all things bad comes goodness. This American eclipse too will pass, and the sun will shine again."

Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of déjà vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government’s apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India’s total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government’s achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi’s intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015–16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016–17 as per reports.

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 – a promise prominently mentioned in BJP’s 2014 manifesto."
Facebook Is Working On AR Glasses That Will Beam Pictures And Videos Straight To Your Eyes!,"Last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off renders of augmented reality glasses the company was working on, though he didn’t reveal much else. Now, we know a few more details thanks to a patent filed by Oculus’ advanced research division.

The application, obtained by Business Insider, is for a “waveguide display with two-dimensional scanner that may augment views of a physical, real-world environment with computer-generated elements.”

Basically, a wave-guide system uses light to project images directly into a user’s eyes. It’s similar to Microsoft’s own AR headset, the HoloLens, as well as Magic Leap’s own secret mixed reality device. Indeed, Business Insider even points out that one of the patent application’s authors, Pasi Saarikko, originally worked on HoloLens before joining Oculus.

Aside from broadcasting images and videos on top of the real world view, the device can also play audio from connected headphones or speakers. The application also indicates Facebook wants the device to look more like regular glasses than other chunky headsets currently in development.

At the F8 developer conference last year, Zuckerberg said that one of the goals was to put Facebook right in people’s faces, should they choose it. Whether the company can develop components small enough to actually make a device of that size is another matter entirely."

"Bengaluru To Soon Have India's First Heli Taxi, Will Fly You To The Airport At The Cost Of A Cab","There's this one joke that always cracks me up about Bengaluru's traffic. A guy left for the airport to pick his girlfriend up, who was coming from Pune and they both left at the same time.

Faking News

As joke-worthy all these stories may seem, the traffic in India's hottest metropolitan city can be a real pain for those who live there. Imagine taking hours to cover a meagre distance or spending more than half your salary just on petrol.

Amid this crisis, the news of heli-taxi comes as an overdue respite. Folks in Bangalore will now have a cheaper and quicker alternative to fight the city's notorious traffic.

jagranjosh

India's first chopper taxi service was announced earlier this month and Bengaluru is the city to have these operations commence by December 2017. Authorities at the Bengaluru International Airport Ltd. (BIAL) have tied up a deal with the Thumby Aviation, a Kerala based helicopter service to facilitate the heli-taxi service.

The service will shuttle the passengers from city to the airport on demand and at a price equivalent to that of taxis. For instance, a ride from Electronic City, Bengaluru to Kempegowda International Airport will take 15 minutes on average, a fraction of the 90-150 minutes it can take by road.

Initially, the one six seaters Bell 407 chopper will operate on the routes, but it will soon be expanded to Whitefield and the HAL airport in the near future. That said, city's 90 helipads will now come alive to serve people who'd flown from different locations.

Mahal thus extended his title reign to 91 days.

Nakamura was the odds on favourite to win, and Mahal's win is somewhat of an upset considering the match was a quite a short on for a title match. It sure seemed a rushed ending as Nakamura, who was on the offensive early on, had to deal with the Singh Brother - Sunil and Samir - on the outside and that allowed Mahal to take advantage and hit his finisher, The Khallas, on Nakamura to retain the title.

Battle over quit India: Modi boisterously appropriates what Congress believes to be its family heirloom,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been thinking on his feet, as it were, on the issue of hitching his party to the bandwagon of freedom struggle. He is celebrating, with all the fervour that he can muster, the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement of 1942, the 70th anniversary of India’s independence, and he is planning grand celebrations for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 and the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022.

It has become clear by now that Modi believes hugely in atmospherics. The main opposition party, Congress, feels left out and more than a little peeved by the PM’s boisterous appropriation of the freedom struggle, which the grand old party of India believes to be its family heirloom.

Congress leaders have always been contemptuous of the Hindu right-wing and they have forever taunted their ideological adversaries for having never taken part in the freedom struggle. Of course, the charge is unfair in historical terms. There were many who did not believe in the politics of agitation popularised by Mahatma Gandhi from 1920 onwards which placed the Congress party in the lead position, but who had been looking at other ways of gaining independence from British suzerainty.

The Muslim League was never part of the agitational approach of Gandhi’s Congress, and neither were many other sections like the Zamindars, the Unionist Party in Punjab, the Justice Party in the Madras presidency and the Krishak Samaj Party in Bengal. One of the prominent leaders who did not accept Gandhi’s extra-constitutional approach was BR Ambedkar.

So, if the case is to be argued as to whether people who did not court prison and raise anti-British slogans did not fight for freedom from the British, then it would be an argument that would be difficult to sustain. There were different political groups and each dealt with the British keeping in mind what they believed to be their own interests. There is little doubt that Congress had a broader viewpoint than all the others put together. It claimed to speak for the whole country, for all the groups and all the regions. The others contested the Congress claim to be representing all.

This was specially so in the case of Muslim League. The Hindu right-wingers were indeed in a quandary because they could not say that Congress did not represent the Hindu majority. As a matter of fact, the League dubbed the Congress as the party of the Hindus. There was no room in the arena for other Hindu sectional interests. Hindu Mahasabha leaders like MR Jayakar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya continued to exert influence in Congress. In a way, communal Hindu elements found a voice within Congress. Nehru and others were aware of this and greatly resented their presence.

Modi has turned the argument over whether one participated in the freedom struggle on its head by asserting that present day India ruled by BJP derives inspiration from the 1942 Quit India Movement to transform India. In contrast, all that Congress president Sonia Gandhi could bring herself to say was that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had moved the Quit India resolution on August 9, 1942. Sonia was clutching a twig of history, while Modi took upon himself the burden of carrying the spirit of Quit India Movement, at least by way of rhetoric, to transform India of today.

Congress has now been reduced to a party which clings to memories of the past, invoking its heroism of long ago to seek solace in its bleak present and infuriated by the Modi strategy of appropriating the heritage of the freedom movement for BJP with much panache. It can be said that Modi’s words and gestures sound hollow because he does not really believe in the Gandhian morality of loving the adversary. And most importantly, he is not able to come to terms with Gandhi’s proclaimed political heir, Nehru.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no hesitation in looking up to the Nehruvian legacy because Vajpayee had greater self-confidence than Modi does. The prime minister’s belligerence in what he says and what he does not say betrays a brittle sense of his own self. But he is moving in the right direction by acknowledging loudly and clearly events like the Quit India Movement which was essentially a Congress ploy.

It can be seen in retrospect that the Quit India Movement was a historical blunder because the Muslim League and others became stronger between 1942 and 1945. Many Congress leaders, including Nehru, were not comfortable with Gandhi’s decision. Though it was a tactical blunder, Gandhi was right in going ahead with it because all the Congress leaders were imprisoned, and when they came out of prison at the end of the war, they were burnished heroes who had paid the price for refusing to go with the British war effort.

But no Congress leader of the day ever showed any resentment towards the bureaucracy, towards the Indian armed forces who participated in World War II, nor with the industrialists and many others from different walks of life who were not in the Quit India Movement. Congress in 1945 carried everyone else with it. Modi seems to be trying to appropriate the legacy of the freedom struggle with barely a nod towards Congress. Congress’s anger is palpable."

The Congress’s idea of India exposed,"Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.

In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen’s Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.

Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?

India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.

For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.

It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.

Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan’s ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.

For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.

Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?"
DU's Zero Cut-Off For Ph.D. Admissions For SC/ST Students Is Driving Everyone Up The Wall!,"So, for Ph.D. Mathematics, the qualifying marks is a big, round zero?!

Delhi University's recent cut-off list for SC/ST students for admissions in Ph.D. Mathematics lists zero as the ""minimum marks scored"". Well, it can get any minimum than this!

nyoooz

People are outraged. Rightly so. If this is what the fight, to have the reservation in India, has come to then anyone falling in the General category can simply take a hike.

How did the Department of Mathematics at DU even come up with this cut-off? Why does the OBC have to score an 84? Oh, let's not even heed the sound of the Unreserved's breaking hearts who have to score a 94 to qualify.

This is the interview schedule that is making everyone's blood boil.

Home-grown Nationalism,"

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. “She was an audacious woman who could hold her own,” she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda — who initiated her in brahmacharini vows — Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‘Nivedita,’ one who has dedicated her life to God.“She was a remarkable person.I don’t think we have focused enough on her,”says Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita’s life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master’s views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta’s Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta’s elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita’s 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.” Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.“Swami Vivekananda had said that it’s not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It’s a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,” says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. “Nivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,” elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.“ She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission — Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.” “Her nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India’s identity,” explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita’s sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. “Patriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it’s about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it’s not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.” In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms — from her extensive travels across the country — her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:“India must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion — the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.” Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.“Tradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it’s not about this and not that. It’s about inclusive Vedantic theory,” says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore’s Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.“One had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.”

MS Dhoni & Harbhajan Singh Face Flak On The Internet Over Controversy Surrounding A Real Estate Group,"A sports personality becoming the face of a company is nothing new. Most companies try to cash in on the market by making a popular name their brand ambassador. But then, at times, this practice backfires. Especially for cricketers.

Twitter

MS Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh now received extreme criticism from a Twitter user, who blamed the two cricketers for receiving villas as gift from the Amrapalli Group, which is currently embroiled in controversy because they have claimed to go bankrupt.

The user tweeted:

ईश्वर की पूजा के दौरान उत्पन्न ये 4 भावनाएं आपको असफल बना सकती हैं,
Return To Summit: Rafael Nadal claws his way back to No.1,"In what can only be described as a Herculean effort, Spanish tennis ace Rafael Nadal has returned to the World No.1 ranking beginning his fourth stint at the pinnacle of the men’s game. Rafa’s return to the top nine years after he first made it there is also unprecedented. This after he had to cut short his season last year due to a wrist injury. Plus, before he started his 2017 season, there were doubts about his return to top form. Some so-called experts speculated that Rafa’s battered and bruised body – thanks to his aggressive style of play – was finally giving up on him. They even opined that the game had gone beyond him with a new crop of exciting players such as Dominic Thiem, Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic finally making their mark.

How wrong were they! After incorporating Carlos Moya into his coaching team, Rafa roared into the 2017 season. Not only did he reach the final of the Australian Open – going down to his great rival Roger Federer in another riveting encounter – but he also tore up the clay court season – as Federer had predicted – completing an unprecedented decima (10 titles) each at the Roland Garros, Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open.

At 31, few will argue that Rafa hasn’t achieved enough. With 15 Grand Slam titles under his belt, Rafa has already etched his name into the annals of tennis history. True, he might no longer be the indomitable force he was in 2008 or 2010. But what Rafa has shown – and younger tennis players need to learn – in the last few years is his incredible ability to adapt his game to what his body can deliver. In this context, Rafa has made his game sharper, taking more risks and chasing down fewer balls on the defence. He has continuously worked on his serve, getting it to eke out that little extra.

Making such adjustments requires a player to constantly assess both his abilities as well as those of his opponents. And it is this desire to improve continuously that sets Rafa apart from the rest. In fact, Rafa today regains the No.1 spot not because he is head and shoulders above the other players on court. He is back at the summit because he is a tireless worker who is unfazed by the injuries and challenges that come his way. In that sense, this ascent of Rafa’s is typical of those matches where he slowly grinds his opponents to dust. Rafa is a warrior who never gives up. He finds a way to win even when the chips are down. And he can be No.1 even when he is not playing in God mode. That’s what is really scary for Rafa’s opponents. May Rafa continue to enthral us for years to come. Vamos Rafa!"
"Amid The Triple Talaq Debate In India, A Saudi Man Divorces Wife For 'Walking Ahead'","The Supreme Court has, in a majority decision, ruled that Triple Talaq is unconstitutional and asked the government to form a new law. However, this wisdom is yet to reach other parts of the world. Although Saudi Arabia does not allow instant talaq like India, a man has divorced his wife for walking ahead of him despite repeated warnings, a media report said.

BBC/Representational Image

The man, who was not identified, gave his wife repeated warnings to keep a step behind him, but she kept walking ahead of him after which, he divorced her, The Gulf News quoted the Saudi daily Al Watan as saying.

In another case, a Saudi man divorced his wife after she forgot to put the sheep head -- ""the most important part of the dinner"" -- on the main dish presented by her husband as he hosted his friends for dinner, the report said.

Representational Image

The woman said that after the guests left, her angry husband accused her of embarrassing him by forgetting to present the most important part of the dinner to his guests.

In another case, a husband divorced his wife during their honeymoon for wearing foot bangles.

Humood Al Shimmari, an official who conducts marriages, said that there has been a spurt in divorce cases in the last two years.

Arab News/Representational Image

He said that while there are many reasons including evolving views towards traditions and social norms, modern technology was the key culprit.

Lateefa Hamid, a social consultant in Saudi Arabia, said: ""Families should educate their young men and women and encourage them to engage in psychological, social and religious awareness and education programmes that will protect future spouses from family problems"".

"The two Trumps: Bannon’s exit a defeat for economic nationalism and ethnic populism, with lessons for India","The pronouncement of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, immediately after being fired by the Trump administration, is a curious one. He said that the Trump presidency is “over” and that it will now be “moderated” by the Republicans. Bannon had anchored one side of the divisive ideological debate within the Trump administration, that of economic nationalism and populist protectionism against the traditional Republican emphasis on free trade and global markets.

That uneasy coalition couldn’t last long, and matters were precipitated by the Charlottesville race riots where the Trump strategy misfired badly. It had the Bannon-esque ‘culture warrior’ stamp, as Trump hesitated in condemning the violence of ultra-right hate groups. This was widely seen as unbecoming of a US president. But differences with Bannon had been brewing on trade issues as well, where the anti-Bannon faction was anchored by Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner (who also happens to be Jewish). With Bannon out, the Trump administration is better placed to resolve its inner contradictions and pursue coherent and pro-trade policies that will boost the US economy, the ultimate parameter on which it will be judged.

What’s interesting about this ideological war is that it breaches the traditional Right-Left distinction (Bannon doesn’t hesitate to describe himself as a ‘Leninist’). Rather, the divide is between those who pursue a version of nationalist populism and economic protectionism against a more economically progressive and pro-globalist view, upholding liberal values in both an economic and political sense. But this divide doesn’t just exist in the Western world, it has its reflection in India as well.

A close parallel with Trump’s equivocation on Charlottesville violence, where he said there was “blame on both sides”, is the manner in which BJP leaders suggest that the blame for cow vigilante violence is not that of lynch mobs alone. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s denunciations of such violence tend to be delayed, lacking the strength and conviction of his other pronouncements. This is happening even as the economy runs into headwinds: the just tabled second part of the mid-year Economic Survey paints a grim picture even as CMIE estimates 1.5 million jobs were lost during January-April. It’s time to exorcise Hindutva (and left-wing populism) from government policy, recognise that India has benefited from economic reform and multiculturalism and needs upgraded versions of these, and focus on high growth and inclusive development."
The Tesla Model X SUV Just Crushed A Lamborhini Aventador In A Drag Race Like A Boss!,"It’s probably a bad idea to race an SUV against a racing-focused supercar. But there are some cases where you‘d be wrong.

Auto website DragTimes posted a video online last week, where they pitted a Tesla Model X P100D against a Lamborghini Aventador SV in a drag race.

And the Tesla won!

Sure, it was a narrow win, Tesla had a quicker start, and the Lamborghini was catching up near the end. But consider that one is a $165,000 electric SUV, while the other is a $530,000 premium supercar, and you’ll see the race in a whole new light.

The Tesla Model X came in at a 11.418 second time on the quarter mile (approximately 400 m) drag race, setting the world record for the fastest ever time to be achieved by an SUV on that stretch.

Not a bad day overall for Tesla and its fans.

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."
"Watchman's 15-YO Son Returns Lost Diamonds Worth Rs 40 Lakh, Gets Cash Reward Of Rs 41,000","A watchman's 15-year-old son, who found a packet containing 700-carat diamonds worth Rs 40 lakh while playing cricket at diamond street of Mahidhapura here on August 15, returned it to its rightful owner when he came searching for it.

TOI

Vishal Upadhyay, a Class XI student residing at Mahidhapura's Jadakhadi, was rewarded with a cash prize of Rs 30,000 by Mansukh Savaliya, owner of the diamonds, and Rs 11,000 by Surat Diamond Association (SDA) president Babu Gujarati for his honesty on Saturday.

""I am so indebted to the young boy for returning my diamond packet. It would have been a big loss, had I not found the packet. I would have to sell my house to repay my creditors. The boy saved me and my family,"" Mansukh said, adding that he narrowed down his area of search after going through CCTV footage.

Vishal found the packet containing diamonds while playing cricket at the diamond street with his friends.His friend hit the ball in the parking area on the roadside and Vishal chased it. When he was looking for the ball in the parking area, he laid his hands on the diamond packet tucked beneath a two-wheeler.

CNN/Representational Image

""I returned home and kept the packet safely without informing my parents. I thought I would find the rightful owner and return the packet to him. On the third day, the packet owner came looking for the packet. I heard the conversation and immediately followed him. I told him that the packet was with me,"" said Vishal, whose mother stitches clothes and elder brother works in an accountant's office. ""I remember losing a Rs 50 note in the street given by my mother. That day I could not eat. I kept on thinking about the pain and agony through which the person who lost the diamond packet may be going through,"" said Vishal, who lives with five family members in a tiny tin-shed room.

Asked what he will do with the Rs 41,000 reward, he said, ""I will use the money for my studies. I want to make it big one day. I want to give a quality life to my mother and father."" Vishal's father Phulchand Upadhyay is employed as a watchman on a monthly wage of Rs 8,000 in a building housing diamond offices in Mahidhpura.

"Android 8.0 Oreo Is Here, With Awesome Features Never Before Seen On Google's Mobile OS!","The latest version of Android is finally out in the wild, and it’s called Android Oreo, as most people guessed. Google, for some reason, made the decision to reveal the new OS’ name and launch details at an event in New York City, coinciding with the eclipse last night.

Google has traditionally named its major Android releases after sweet treats, starting with Android 1.5 ‘Cupcake’. Android 4.4 ‘KitKat’’ was the only one so far to receive a brand-associated name, with the others being more generic, but Oreo is such a recognizable name for a sweet snack starting with ‘O’ that Google likely didn’t have any other choice with Android 8.0.

Android Oreo brings a number of new features to the OS, both convenience tools and aesthetic tweaks. For instance, Android O brings a new picture-in-picture feature, so you can multitask with two apps at once using floating windows. There are also notification dots on apps, like those you put on your home screen, that light up to show you there’s something new. Just tap these to take a look and act immediately.

The new version also claims to be a safer app platform, with Google Play Protect built in. The OS has also been tweaked to reduce battery consumption from apps running in the background. And for those of you used to talking in anything other than words, the blob emoji is now dead. Android Oreo now has redesigned emoji taking their place, as well as 60 new versions available.

Of course, you won’t actually be able to experience Android Oreo just yet. The company has officially pushed the OS out of public beta testing and onto its Android Open Source Project, meaning Google devices like the Pixel, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C will receive over-the-air updates soon.

Those already enrolled in the beta program will receive the version today. For everyone else, Google says it’s working with partners like Essential, HMD (Nokia), Huawei, HTC, Kyocera, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp and Sony, and they’re all scheduled to launch or upgrade devices to Android 8.0 Oreo by the end of the year.

This 3200MP Camera In World's Most Hi-Tech Telescope Will Start Hunting For Dark Matter In 2019,"Ever since astronomers discovered in 1998 that our universe is expanding faster as time goes by the idea has captivated researchers across the world. The idea is that this acceleration in the rate it’s expanding because of “dark energy”, the mysterious gravitational force spread throughout our universe.

A concept render of what the LSST facility will eventually look like

Now, scientists from dozens of institutions across 23 countries have come together to work on a new telescope they believe can shed light on dark matter. Called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), it’s a gigantic digital camera to be mounted on Earth, which will capture images from galaxies millions of light years away.

“All the existing telescopes with cameras were built before the discovery of dark energy,” Paul O’Connor, a senior scientist from Brookhaven National Laboratory told Atlas Obscura. “We expect the LSST to map the entire sky and find out where all that dark matter has been hiding.” O’Connor has been working on the project for over ten years and he believes it could completely change how we understand the workings of the universe.

The LSST's 3.5 metre wide mirror cells, part of its camera assembly

The LSST would serve to capture images of galaxies much further away than our current technology allows. The camera’s field of view when pointed at the sky would be just ten square degrees, but it would still be able to spot around a million distant galaxies in that area. It'll also be outfitted with a 3,200 megapixel sensor being developed by O'Connor at Brookhaven, able to capture light from stars 100 million times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye.

About the size of a small SUV car, ""the LSST camera is the largest camera ever constructed for astronomy.""

It is a large-aperture, wide-field optical camera that is capable of viewing light from the near ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths. It's 3 metre long, 1.65 metre high, weighs 2800 kg, and has a pixel count of 3200 megapixel -- several times better, more precise than even the best smartphone cameras out there.

When the LSST begins operations in 2020, in the mountains of Chile, it will be tasked with scanning regions of the sky over and over for the next 10 years. It’s expected to capture each patch of sky a thousand times, over the course of 3,000 nights. “We’re really going to be making a movie of the universe,” O’Connor said.

The camera assembly of the LSST compared with a human

With that data, astronomers hope to better understand dark energy by looking at how it interacts with objects in the universe. Studying how these far-flung galaxies are shooting away from us could bring new discoveries in the field of astrophysics that we’ve never even thought"

Playing county helps to grow as a cricketer: Pujara

Prasad RS • Last updated on Tue, 22 Aug, 2017, 05:45 AM

""I had played in Sri Lanka during the 2015 series and that gave me a lot of confidence"" - Pujara © Getty

Cheteshwar Pujara was one of the standout performers at the recently-concluded Test series in Sri Lanka - scoring 309 runs in three games which included two centuries. In a chat with TOI, the 29-year-old spoke on what makes the Indian team an all-conquering unit, the importance of county cricket and more. Excerpts:

How would you sum up the recently-concluded Test series in Lanka?

Going into the Test series, I wanted to continue batting the way I have in the last one-and-half years. I was well-prepared for it, since I went to play county cricket (for Nottinghamshire) ahead of the series. Also, I had played in Sri Lanka during the 2015 series and that gave me a lot of confidence.

How did the county stint in Nottinghamshire shape your game?

Playing county cricket is about being in that environment and batting on those wickets which seam and have a bit of bounce. It's all about getting the experience and nothing related to your technique. Once you reach a certain point (in your career), your technique is very much decided and all you need to do is fine-tune it.

Ashwin too will play county cricket for Worcestershire. How much of help would that be when India tour England next year?

If you start playing county cricket, you start having an idea about how to perform in those conditions. I believe county cricket helps you grow as a cricketer. I feel if you want to play Test cricket and aim to do well in different venues, county cricket is the way to go. I will soon be heading back to play a few more games for my county .

With 2019 World Cup to be held in England, should the ODI specialists too try out county cricket next season?

Not just looking at the 2019 World Cup, but to develop as a cricketer, it is important to have county experience. Whether it is ODI or Tests, whenever there is an opportunity, cricketers should certainly play county matches.

What makes this Indian Test team such a winning unit?

I think each member of the side has contributed to its success. If you look at our batting, each one has stood up and made themselves counted. At times when the top-order succeeds, we end up getting a total of around 400 on board. However, when the lower-middle order scores runs, that's where we start to score in excess of 600. The difference between 400 and 600 is just huge. When you score 600, the opposition will always be under pressure even if they bat well to reach that total. Also, this Indian team's bench strength is quite strong. Whoever has come into the XI has gone on to make a contribution. Players such as Kuldeep Yadav, Jayant Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Karun Nair and even Abhinav Mukund have all performed when given opportunities. Even our fast bowers Umesh and Shami have been bowling well.

What does coach Shastri bring to the table?

Ravi bhai is someone who gives players enough freedom and at the same time knows what is needed for the players to be in the best possible shape ahead of any game. He makes players feel welcome and players understand their roles in the side.

Have you had a chat with the coach on areas you can improve in order to be playing in all formats of the game?

I haven't had any discussion yet, but I will definitely have a chat with him. Personally, I am very confident that I can play in all formats. I have been working hard on my game, and in times to come, the results will follow.

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

Soha Ali Khan Posted A Baby Bump Pic & As Expected Filthy Minds Started Trolling Her In No Time,"Embrace your baby bump. Don’t hide it. Embrace the life inside it. But apparently, the filthy minds don’t get it, and neither do they let people live in peace.

Time and again, people have been making constant attempts in telling people to love themselves, be comfortable in their own skin. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, after all. But still, there are some people who think that women should hide in shame for all the absurd reasons.

This #internationalyogaday 2017 don't pose for the photographers, pose for yourself 🙏🏼#yogaforlife A post shared by Soha (@sakpataudi) on Jun 21, 2017 at 1:15am PDT

That is one of the reasons why pregnant women lived their life miserably through years and would hide inside their homes for their baby bumps attracted a lot of eyeballs and made them feel uncomfortable.

But several celebrities took charge of the situation and flaunted their baby bumps like queens urging women to embrace and feel proud about the new phase of life, which is simply beautiful.

But some filthy minds couldn’t accept it. They went ahead to pass crass comments on these women.

And finally my favourite picture of the day 😍 A post shared by Soha (@sakpataudi) on Aug 19, 2017 at 12:22am PDT

Case in point—Soha Ali Khan. The actress, who has been, for long, flaunting her baby bump, feeling proud about it, recently uploaded a picture of her posing like a warrior while doing the yoga.

Here is the beautiful picture:

Fashion Diaries: Here’s Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one’s fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone’s going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it’s a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

OPPO F3

Well, selfies come handy not just to change display pictures, but when we need to check our pretty faces anywhere, anytime. And if on some days, if we look a bit too extra cute, why not click a selfie and save it too, right? And if you use a Selfie Expert phone, your picture is bound to look even prettier. If you want more, nowadays they even have a beauty mode btw!

And when friends are around, the selfie-game gets even better!

OPPO F3

Because when we are with our favourites, we are always in our happy and cheerful spirits which totally reflects on our pictures too. With a wide-angle group selfie, we can even get a full-length selfie to compare each other's style quotient!

One last word: Our phone's style quotient speaks a lot about our fashion diaries.

Pinterest

That’s why, nowadays people focus not just on the colour of the phone, but even on extra-accessories for it such as phone cases, bedazzlements or extra-customizations. Recently, even Bollywood style-icon Deepika Padukone had customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as the #F3DeepikaEdition.

OPPO F3

She had designed her own icon with OPPO, which has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded along, at the back of the phone and it pretty much signifies her personality, isn’t it? The special Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie, a 16 MP selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

So, dear style-divas if you are planning on buying a new phone, go for a Rose Gold OPPO F3, it’s pretty much going to be your new personal stylist!"
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
"A replacement for 66A is needed, but not in this form","The home ministry’s reported move to use provisions from the Indian Penal Code to plug the vacuum created by the quashing of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act may create a fresh set of problems. Recall that the Supreme Court had quashed 66A which criminalized the sending of offensive messages over a communication device noting that it had become a political instrument of coercion and intimidation. So the thumb rule for replacing 66A is to frame provisions that do not threaten free speech or individual liberty. But according to the news report cited above, the Centre is planning to use Section 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and Section 505 (Statements conducive to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code in place of 66A. This is a dose of strong, and hence attractive, but wrong, medicine for a pervasive ailment.

Even when viewed benignly, it is only a piecemeal fix. Section 66A had criminalized any communication which was grossly offensive, or has menacing character; or any information which is known to be false, but is communicated for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, or ill-will. The words used to frame this immensely useful provision vitiated its character. Proviso like “grossly offensive”, “annoyance” and “inconvenience” lend themselves to subjective actions which require an independent application of mind by police officers. However, this did not happen and the police and lower judiciary proved incapable of such autonomy and acted errantly or maliciously under political pressure.

But 66A, despite its problems, offered complainants a specific provision to complain about cyber harassment, bullying and stalking. In contrast, both 153A and 505 are offences related to maintenance of public order. Of course, the police and courts have the option of booking offenders under related provisions of the Indian Penal Code like Section 499 (criminal defamation), 506 (criminal intimidation), 292A (Printing, etc, of grossly indecent material), 507(criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and 509 (word,gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). But with the Internet becoming an integral part of our lives having provisions under a specialized law like the IT Act, instead of the more generic IPC which is often used to deal with crimes in the physical world may be better. The best argument for this is the digital nature of evidence collection and perpetration of the crime. Rather than amending the IPC which should remain a generic law, the IT Act could be a better placeholder to define the various crimes and the punishments that must be awarded.

Second and more important, the home ministry’s move to invoke 153A and 505 endangers free speech. Both are non-bailable provisions. It must be recalled that 66A was a bailable provision and yet the police made life hell for those it arrested by denying them bail and forcing them to go to courts. A lot of posts on social media are critical of religions, religious groups, caste, linguistic and ethnic groups, political and religious leaders, etc. These may not have any incitement to violence. Yet they can fall foul of 153A and 505. This is dangerous to free speech. In his reasoned judgment quashing 66A, Justice Rohington Nariman offered three axioms: discussion, advocacy, and incitement, to understand when free speech protected by Article 19(1)(a) is breached and the restrictions to free speech delineated under Article 19(2) kick in. “Mere discussion or even advocacy of a particular cause howsoever unpopular is at the heart of Article 19(1)(a). It is only when such discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement that Article 19(2) kicks in,” Justice Nariman wrote.

We do not need a replacement for Section 66A that is more draconian. A law is badly needed for individuals who are at the receiving end of offensive and hateful messages. Many journalists, especially women, have been facing vicious attacks from social media trolls. 66A FIRs were often lodged by complainants with only a remote connection to the offence. These buysbodies were not necessarily the targets, but were mere supporters of the intended target. It was not Mamata Banerjee who complained about the cartoonist or the Jadavpur University professor who created/circulated cartoons lampooning her. It was not the Thackerays who complained against Renu Srinivasan or Shaheen Dhadha for their post criticizing the shutdown of Mumbai after Bal Thackeray died. Perhaps, 66A should be revived with a smaller subset of offences which are then supplemented with iron-clad definitions in the Information Technology Act.

Here is my version of 66A: Any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device- (a) any information that is known to be false, but for the purpose of causing injury, criminal intimidation, and defamation, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine. This would restrict the scope for politicisation and deliberate misinterpretation and gives priority to personal crimes.

As the moon's shadow slowly took over areas that fall around Oregon and South Carolina, everyone began basking in the glorious eclipse, touted to be one of the harshest.

For over an hour and a half, everyone took a break from whatever they were doing and took it to the streets with their gears on. Millions got outside to watch this eclipse and even a million more witness it online, making it one of the most-watched in history.

The eclipse was partially visible across all 50 states, but it was the clearest from a 70-mile-wide sliver of 14 states. This eclipse was a totality, a rare event that hasn't happened since 1979 and a coast-to-coast eclipse for almost over a century.

"Brazilian Woman Acts Weird After Watching Annabelle: Creation, Screams While Punching Herself!","While for some people horror movies are unintentionally funny, for others they are no less than creepy nightmares. But still, people love to watch them.

Some people thrive for the adrenaline rush that they get after watching a scary scene. And for that very reason, many waited long enough for Annabelle: Creation, a movie which made several people shit bricks.

noroeste.com.mx

But what happened to this Brazilian woman has sent shockwaves across the world generating more curiosity than ever. This 20-year-old woman was watching the movie and was seemingly fine until the devil appeared on the screen. And when that happened, she stormed out of the theatre, fell flat on the ground, coughed, screamed, and punched herself in horror, while her friends tried to calm her down.

""When the film ended, we went to pay the car park and she started hitting herself with punches to her own head, and threw herself on the floor,"" revealed an eyewitness.

Twitter

“We haven’t managed to find out what happened to her and the reason behind her strange behavior,” a staff at the cinema center said.

These Smart Labels Will One Day Tell You When To Throw Away Old Food And Makeup,"It’s always sad when you think you have ingredients for a yummy snack in the fridge, only to take them out and realise they’ve gone bad. Now, scientists have developed a new type of sensor that can warn you when that’s about to happen so you can prepare.

Image courtesy: Silvana Andreescu

An American research team from Clarkson University presented their design at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) yesterday, for a low-cost, portable, paper-based sensor that can detect when food and cosmetics are spoiled or contaminated.

“I’ve always been interested in developing technologies that are accessible to both industry and the general population,” Silvana Andreescu, Ph.D., says. “My lab has built a versatile sensing platform that incorporates all the needed reagents for detection in a piece of paper. At the same time, it is adaptable to different targets, including food contaminants, antioxidants and free radicals that indicate spoilage.”

The key to her sensors, Andreescu says, are nanostructures within the sensors used to trap and bind the compounds they’re looking for. “Most people working on similar sensors use solutions that migrate on channels,” Andreescu says. “We use stable, inorganic particles that are redox active. When they interact with the substances we want to detect, they change color, and the intensity of the change tells us how concentrated the analyte is.”

Because of this, the sensors are extremely easy to use. All someone would have to do is add a bit of the sample they’re testing to the paper, and watch for a colour change. Once development is completed, Andreescu believes these sort of sensors can be incorporated into smart labels on food and cosmetic products, that customers could easily use to test when they need to throw something away, even if it’s not immediately apparent."
"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."
Supreme Court has done right to quash triple talaq,"The Supreme Court’s majority verdict declaring triple, or instant, talaq unconstitutional is an important, albeit limited, victory for Muslim women in India. It aligns India’s Muslim personal law, in this regard, with the law in most large Islamic nations that have already outlawed triple talaq, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. It opens the door for a serious engagement towards creating a civil legal code based on the principle of equality.

For women of Muslim faith in this country, the judgement marks a first important step. But there is still a long way to go. The judgement focused on a single issue, the triple instant talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, a frequent method of divorce among Sunni Muslims in India. It does not address issues like polygamy or nikah halala, or even the unilateral privileging of men in two other routes of divorce: talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan. Personal laws of other religious communities, Hindus and Christians, have gone through renditions to address some concerns relating to gender equality in matters of inheritance and polygamy. Despite the gains, gender equality does not permeate all aspects of civil law. The triple talaq judgement presents an opportunity to initiate a debate on putting in place a uniform civil code that brings equality — across faiths and gender. The government should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. In doing so, care must be taken to strengthen democracy, rather than weaken it.

If any attempt to modify personal laws is seen not through the prism of gender equality and inter-community parity, but from a perspective of imposing the majority’s will over minorities, that would vitiate democracy. This depends not just on the modifications proposed in personal law but on the overall developments in the polity. Political parties would do well to not stoke sectarian passions in the name of personal laws. Ridding laws and practices of patriarchal privilege is not easy, but essential to move towards a more wholesome democracy."
"Amma’s children: Two AIADMK factions have merged, with a little help from BJP","The political turmoil that Tamil Nadu witnessed since the death of chief minister J Jayalalithaa has subsided for now, with a merger of the two AIADMK factions. The AIADMK (Amma) faction of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and the AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) group led by his predecessor O Panneerselvam have buried their differences and arrived at a compromise formula, both having agreed to nullify Sasikala’s appointment as party general secretary and keep her clan out of party affairs. The Palaniswami faction had already passed a resolution cancelling the appointment of her nephew TTV Dhinakaran as the deputy general secretary. Also worked out were the positions offered to team OPS.

BJP spotted in the churning a wonderful opportunity to make inroads into a state where non-Dravidian parties had only a minimal presence, and made the most of it. It is an open secret that it was BJP which orchestrated the sequence of events that led to the merger. In the process, it now has a vice-like grip over the united AIADMK, which is well aware of the threat to the stability of its government from a bruised Dhinakaran who purportedly has about 20 MLAs with him. The success of the BJP mission has dealt a body blow to DMK that was hoping AIADMK would disintegrate, paving the way for it to fill the vacuum. With the general election not far away, a weakened Congress-led UPA will now have to rethink its strategy.

It’s advantage BJP at this point. Save Karnataka, the south has always been a tough nut for BJP to crack. Its perseverance appears to be yielding fruit. However, in a state where Dravidianism is the bedrock of politics, it will be no mean task for the party to consolidate its position. Tamil Nadu could well be heading for yet another phase of uncertainty."
Two leaves and a lotus bud,"After AIADMK merger, BJP can say cheers but not uncork the bottle

On Monday morning, festoons welcoming BJP leader Amit Shah flanked Chennai’s Grand Southern Trunk Road and Mount Road all the way from the airport to T Nagar, where the BJP’s state headquarters stand. On most of the posters, at Shah-ji’s feet was the lotus party’s state chief, a vivacious gynaecologist with a broad smile, flashing a ‘thumbs up’. On a few others was another ambitious woman leader doing a more courteous ‘vanakkam.’ In the few remaining vacant spots on the road medians, a certain Mr Naidu, with goggles and all, managed to install his modest hoardings joining the leaders in ushering in Shah: Come, come (varuga, varuga)! Amit Shah didn’t come.

Chennai, meanwhile, was hosting another drama— that of the merger of two AIADMK factions led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) and his predecessor O Panneerselvam (OPS). OPS now becomes the deputy chief minister with the finance portfolio, and the coordinator of the party steering committee. After J Jayalalithaa’s death in December last year, the party had split into two, then three, the third one led by Jayalalithaa aide V K Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran. In a way, the BJP festoons hadn’t gone waste—it was an inadvertent celebration of BJP having successfully orchestrated the reunion of the AIADMK groups.

Tamil Nadu governor C Vidyasagar Rao with O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami after the AIADMK factions merged on Monday

The logic was simple: The BJP wanted the AIADMK, which has 50 members in Parliament, to stay alive at least till the 2019 general elections. The saffron party needed the Tamil Nadu MPs’ support in getting crucial legislation passed and, when the elections came, a regional party to sail with. The withering party of two leaves fitted the bill perfectly. With a menacing stick (the threat of raids by central agencies on AIADMK leaders who refused to fall in line) and a tantalising carrot (a cabinet berth or two when Modi-ji returns to power in 2019, as even opposition leaders admit), Amit Shah tamed the meek AIADMK.

But the circus has just begun. TTV, who went from being an accidental leader to an anarchist in eight months, is plotting his revenge. Despite a much-retweeted sore throat that started around the same time the AIADMK merger happened, TTV ordered some 19 MLAs to the Raj Bhavan, demanding EPS be removed as chief minister. A more optimistic TTV count puts his support base at 27, including three ministers and three legislators who are unattached to the AIADMK, but won on the party symbol.

Time for some math. TTV’s 27 can’t rock the EPS-OPS boat on their own. But if their rebellion has the tacit support of the 89-member DMK, which has indicated its eagerness to introduce a no-confidence motion in the Assembly, the government is in troubled waters. The opposition, including Congress (8) and Indian Union Muslim League (1) has a combined strength of 98 in the 234-member House where Jayalalithaa’s seat remains vacant. If the 19 legislators who called on the governor on Tuesday support a no-confidence motion that the opposition would vote for, the numbers would cross the half mark of 117.

Suddenly, M K Stalin is the star. The DMK working president, who has waited too long for the AIADMK government to collapse under its own contradictions, is under pressure from within his party and outside to pull the rug. A Stalin advisor told me last month that the leader didn’t want to be seen as a destabilising factor, but now he is aware that “people are getting impatient to see this non-performing government go.”

Sooner the better, agree DMK strategists. For, giving more time for the AIADMK would also mean giving the BJP more time to handhold and handshake, and imparting a semblance of acceptance to the government. The BJP could then partake the glory to gain a few electoral points that the saffron brigade so badly needs to complete its footprint which has been sparse in the Dravidian land.

TTV is in a rage. And if Stalin proves to be strategically sound, it may not yet be time for Amit Shah and mitron to uncork the Patanjali brhami sharbat."
The real luxury in life is doing nothing,"It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that you’ll brush your teeth tomorrow morning. You don’t squander precious mental space evaluating whether or not brushing your teeth is worth the opportunity cost of let’s say, another five minutes of sleep. The same is true for showering, going to the bathroom, grooming your nails and facial hair. We clean our homes with a myriad of dust-sucking devices and chemical concoctions, or hire people to do so more thoroughly than we can. We even make sure to wash the car every so often.

As a people, we seem to be pretty vigilant about physical hygiene. We clean and cream our bodies, and take them out for a walk, much like we do for our dogs. We do so robotically, without wasting time in evaluating questions like, “Should I take out the trash today?” Even if we don’t do it today, you can bet it’ll be done before the week is out. Sadly, the same cannot be said for our mental hygiene. When was the last time you really cleaned the crevices of your mind?

And in this day and age, boy, do we have dirty minds. Between jobs, responsibilities at home, nights out, baby-talk and toddler tantrums, must-read blogs, email upkeep, spritely posts and timely tweets, we’ve stuffed our minds with more content than it can hold. Our minds run a marathon a minute. We swallow countless videos, movies and entire seasons of television shows with abandon, and these stimulating stories stick to our soft and once-supple consciousness. It’s a more-more-more world and our mind’s had enough. Simply put, we are mentally obese.

And then we wonder why we can’t still our minds and find some semblance of peace. We read self-help manuals, eat more organic greens and practise various forms of sweat-inducing yoga. We buy softer clothes, sniff scented candles, wear noise-canceling headphones and track our daily step count. We run away to exotic islands and true stillness evades us even under the palms.

The ubiquitous sentence we’ve all uttered, heard and repeated is — “I’m so tired”. We keep going like that poor Energizer bunny, but deep inside we feel kind of exhausted. Even the pursuit of higher echelons of fun becomes somewhat tiring by the time you’re thirty-five. And if not by then, by forty-five, for sure. “What’s the point?” we start to wonder.

And this is precisely where meditation saved me. Some people meditate with a mantra from a Master, some listen to meditation music, some watch their breath until they can override mental chatter, while others go for a nature walk. Even big-shot billionaires meditate with requisite meditation apps on TV these days.

The result is the same — in meditation, we do absolutely nothing for a few moments. We achieve nothing, we stop trying so damn hard. And unlike in sleep, we are restfully awake to witness the passage of time. We are completely present for ourselves — for doing absolutely nothing with ourselves — much like we make sure to be present to watch our children play soccer or perform in a school play.

In meditation, we become the witness. We become the one who watches patiently as time marches on, moving and twisting as it does. We don’t react or move an inch. We watch our thoughts go by like trains at a busy train station. We don’t hop on board. Like the statue of Buddha, we learn to embody peace and let go of past and future worries. We are the now. Like rock climbing, scuba diving, skiing, or even learning to read as children — learning to meditate takes some level of dedication and practice.

It’s a skill worth acquiring as soon as humanly possible. Even a momentary brush with wakeful nothingness — doing nothing, being nothing, wanting nothing, all while being there with the Self here and now — is a deep-clean steam shower for our mind. It refreshes us considerably and reminds us that there is more to life than chasing more."

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

"Age Of Empires IV Is Confirmed! It's Been 12 Years Since Last Game, Coming To A PC Very Soon!","Sorry StarCraft fans, but the mother of all real-time-strategy games is coming out of hibernation!

Microsoft announced at Gamescom 2017 yesterday that it’s resurrecting a classic strategy game. The company has revealed that a new Age of Empires game will be coming to PC, developed by Relic Entertainment, the makers of the Dawn of War series.

The Age of Empires IV trailer released alongside depicts battles across the world through different stages of history, from the Roman Empire at the peak of its power, to Spanish conquistadors, tribals, revolutionaries, and samurai.

This is the first sequel to the game in 12 years, ever since Age of Empires III was launched in 2005. The original developers, Ensembles Studios, released the first Age of Empires way back in 1997. They were then later acquired by Microsoft in 2001, where it operated internally until 2009.

Despite the studio eventually being shut down that year, the Age of Empires brand has lived on as both a nostalgia title in gamers’ memories, and a source for spinoff games.

Prior to the trailer unveiling, Microsoft confirmed that Age of Empires II and III would also be receiving Definitive Editions, along the lines of the upcoming remaster of the first game in the series.

Age of Empires IV still doesn’t have a release date. However, Microsoft has announced that the series will also be receiving Definitive Editions, which are likely to drop sooner than the latest sequel."
Triple talaq: Removing gender injustice would only strengthen minority rights in India,"Triple talaq has been quashed by the Supreme Court. A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‘pampered minorities’ in their place.

Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.

At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.

For Muslim Women

To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.

Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world’s earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.

The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.

The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.

The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.

The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel’s statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.

Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole

Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.

Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.

When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.

In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.

And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.

The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.

Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all."
"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."

Privacy as fundamental right: Minding our business,"By Smriti Parsheera

The Supreme Court’s upcoming verdict on whether we have a fundamental right to privacy will be one of the most momentous decisions of our times. It is, however, inopportune that this vital issue has arisen as an offshoot to the Aadhaar litigation.

Both sides are alive to the fact that the decision will take them a step closer or further from proving their stance in the main petition. This has undeniably coloured the arguments in court. The real implications of the nine-judge decision will, however, run much deeper than the immediate questions of Aadhaar.

The term ‘privacy’, while not expressly spelt out under the Constitution, forms the crux of what it means to live a dignified life in a liberal democracy. The concept of a secret ballot, for instance, finds its origin in the need for ‘political privacy’, our ability to vote anonymously, without the promise of reward or fear of persecution. Section 94 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, codifies this right by providing that a person cannot be mandated to disclose for whom she has voted, not even before a court of law.

Then there’s ‘physical privacy’ that guards a person’s body and physical space from unwelcome intrusions. ‘Behavioural privacy’ gives us the freedom to keep private our religious practices, sexual orientation and associations. ‘Informational privacy’ deals with the expectation of privacy in the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. ‘Cognitive privacy’ calls for new thinking about the use of technologies that can decipher thoughts and brain activities.

Some of these rights are already covered by existing constitutional provisions, some have been protected under laws, while others are still waiting to be born. A legal right can, however, not be a substitute for a fundamental right. Legal rights can be conferred and withdrawn at will and their validity rests on conformity with the Constitution.

The declaration of privacy as a fundamental right will not imply that it will become an unassailable, paramount right, which can never be undone. The contours of privacy, and the limitations on its scope, will have to evolve through jurisprudence developed by the courts. Even until recently, when we believed privacy to be an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, the Supreme Court had pointed on several occasions that privacy is not an absolute right.

For instance, in Mr X vs Hospital Z ((1998) 8 SCC 296), while dealing with the right to confidentiality of an HIV patient, the court held that in case of a conflict between right to privacy and right to health of another, the latter prevails. In another case, ordering a person to undergo a medical examination was not regarded as being violative of the person’s right to privacy where the test was necessary to determine unsoundness of mind, a recognised ground for divorce. The person could still refuse the medical examination, allowing the court to draw an adverse inference (Sharda vs Dharmpal, AIR 2003 SC 3450).

Conferring privacy with the status of afundamental right will achieve two key goals. One, it will offer a guaranteed constitutional framework to test against ingressions into the various dimensions of privacy. Two, it will provide courts with greater confidence when comparing the tradeoffs between privacy and other constitutional protections.

The separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary demands that courts cannot question the wisdom of legislative actions. So, any law, no matter how odious it may appear, cannot be struck down by a court unless covered by certain specific grounds. These grounds, as stated most recently in the Aadhaar-PAN case (WP Civil No. 247 of 2017), are that the legislature did not have the competence to make the law; or the law is void for being in violation of any of the fundamental rights or any other constitutional provisions.

If privacy is not to be a fundamental right, what protection would we have against future transgressions of this right by various laws? Always having to derive this right from other provisions in the Constitution would dilute its efficacy. Relying on political processes to solve the issue would be too little, too late.

The key challenge, therefore, is not just about the privacy implications of the Aadhaar Act, or any other legislation, but the unforeseen laws and practices of the days to come. A few years ago, the Bombay High Court directed the UIDAI to share the biometric information of Aadhaar holders in Goa to aid the CBI in a rape investigation. The UIDAI challenged this before the court on grounds of privacy, which was accepted by the court.

The passage of the Aadhaar Act has now closed the door on such speculative searches, at least so far as biometric data is concerned. If the law were to be subsequently amended to allow biometric data to be shared for investigation and surveillance purposes, one would like to believe that the supporters of the Aadhaar architecture will join the detractors in opposing such a move. What we will need then is a fundamental right to privacy against which the actions of the legislature can be tested.

Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."

Taskin keen to deliver 'match-winning spell' in his first home Test series

Bangladesh pace bowler Taskin Ahmed is eyeing to come up with a match-winning spell against Australia in the upcoming two-match Test series. Taskin, who has played only four Test matches so far, admits it would be an icing on the cake if he could pick Steven Smith, David Warner and Matt Renshaw, calling them his dream wickets.

Taskin was included in the 14-member squad for the first Test scheduled to start on August 27, along with two other pacers, Mustafizur Rahman and Shafiul Islam.

The 22-year-old seamer made his Test debut against New Zealand in Wellington earlier this year and has played four out of the five Tests Bangladesh have played since.

He was sidelined for Bangladesh's historic 100th Test where they defeated Sri Lanka, fielding two pacers Mustafizur and Subashish Roy in their playing eleven. ""If I get an opportunity, I will like to bowl a match-winning spell,"" Taskin told reporters in Dhaka on Tuesday (August 21).

""I don't say that match-winning spell means taking five to seven wickets. I will like to bowl some good overs instead of that. As like, our spinners may take seven wickets and in the middle, I may pick two wickets. I really want to do something for the team that will help the team,' the 22-year-old said.

Taskin added that they were not too worried with the performance of Mustafizur, and are confident of his ability. The recent form of Mustafizur has been a matter of concern for Bangladesh, where he has failed to live up to his reputation on his comeback after the shoulder surgery.

""We always expect much from Mustafiz. He fulfilled the expectations as well. It is true that he was not up to the mark in the last few matches. The greatest bowlers of the world also could not bowl well in two-three matches,"" Taskin said.

""We are not worried about that. I hope he will come back strong. We also have many responsibilities against Australia,"" he added. ""Australia is one of the best teams in the world. But we understand the surface very well than them as it is well known to us. I hope we will do well in the series,' Taskin said.

Referring to Test cricket as a game of patience and skills, Taskin admitted that he was eagerly waiting to play his first Test series at home. ""The pleasure I got bowling in New Zealand didn't feel in the same way in Sri Lanka. I haven't played a Test match yet in Bangladesh. I think Test cricket is a matter of great patience and skills. I hope good things are coming ahead,"" added Taskin.

""To be honest, I didn't play many Test matches. I find it really difficult after playing only four Test matches. I played only One-Day Internationals and Twenty20s before starting to play in Test matches.

""You have [to] play Test matches according to a plan. It is really important to implement change of pace. I hope that we can play according to the situation. I am looking forward to playing at home soil,"" Taskin concluded.

"Vegetarian Not Vegetarians Anymore? Turns Out, Plants Knew All Along They Were Being Eaten","Well, we all know that vegetarians take a lot of pride in the food they eat. They leave no stone unturned when it comes to giving a shit for eating meat as if it's a crime and as if the animals knows they are being eaten.

Well hey vegetarians, in your face because plants know it too.

Leaf&wood

A new research shows that plants know when they're being eaten and they don't like it when you do that. According to o Modern Farmer, a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri claims that all the plants possess some sort of intelligence and know it when you're approaching them to put them in your mouth.

They even send out defence mechanisms to try to stop you from doing that. The study was carried out on thale cress, which is closely related to broccoli, kale, mustard greens, and other members of the family. They are commonly used for experiments because they have genome sequenced, and scientists are intimately familiar with how it works.

Researchers took audio recordings to understand vibrations a plant does when it's being eaten. They studied these vibration patterns, that released another shake like wind noise.

Modern Farmer claims ""the thale cress produces mustard oils that are mildly toxic when eaten and sends them throughout its leaves to try to keep the predators away.""

""Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,"" said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU.

""However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found that feeding vibrations signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars,"" he added.

Shagun and Hingonia: Are these gaushalas or torture chambers?,"The horrifying scandals of government-aided gaushalas exposed in Chhattisgarh last week and in Rajasthan last year suggest that the elaborate sociopolitical architecture created around gau raksha since 2014 is essentially hypocritical. Unless beating up people for transporting cows is considered a proxy for improving the condition of cows, where is the evidence that India’s cows are better off today than three years ago? And if they haven’t benefited what’s worth asking is who has.

BJP leader Harish Verma is at the center of the Chhattisgarh scandal. He has been running the Shagun gaushala in the Durg district. Police have arrested Verma but he says (unconvincingly) that he is not to blame as the gaushala has been saddled with 600 cows when it is meant to hold only 220, plus for two years government hasn’t given him the Rs 10 lakh per year he is supposed to get to run the gaushala.

Verma is also associated with Mayuri and Phulchand gaushalas in the same district. As in the Shagun gaushala, here too reporters have found cows starving and carcasses rotting. The gory story has taken an even more ghoulish turn with allegations surfacing that Verma used to skin cow carcasses to feed fish in his pond and that he may be involved in cattle trafficking as well. Together around 200 cows are alleged to have died at these three gaushalas in around a week.

A year ago it was in Rajasthan – which not only boasts India’s first ever gaupalan ministry but also has very energetic gau rakhaks who among other misadventures have harassed Kashmiri students on suspicion of cooking beef (lab report said it wasn’t beef) and beaten up truckers transporting cattle and killed Pehlu Khan – that the death of hundreds of cows due to gross negligence amounting to torture was reported at the government-run Hingonia gaushala.

In all these case it is reported that not only were the gaushalas not being cleaned, locking cows to ordure and disease, but the cows weren’t even being watered and fed. In the Hingonia case some cows struggled to free themselves from the swamp of muck for days before succumbing to pain and exhaustion. One year on overcrowding and disease remain rife in Hingonia.

These scandals are shocking but perhaps predictable. Forcibly replacing a rational economic cycle of raising, selling and slaughtering cows with some arbitrary religious grid is bound to have various tumorous side-effects. The diversity of stakeholders has also been forcibly lessened even as a privileged new breed of stakeholders has been created – BJP leader Verma is very much representative of this breed. Its political power grows by sloganeering gau raksha vehemently – without a commensurate burden of actually providing gau raksha."

In one such study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, the researchers asked the participants questions about their infidelity with their partners; which was called extra-dyadic sexual involvement (ESI) by the researchers.

au.finance.yahoo.com

The study revealed some interesting results:

-People who cheated in their first relationship were three times as likely to cheat in their next relationship!

-Those who knew their partners had engaged in ESI in the previous relationships were twice as likely to report the same from their next partner.

-People who suspected their partners of ESI in their first-relationship were four times as likely to report suspecting their partner in the next relationship as well.

The results were indicative of the importance of prior infidelity in your current or next relationship.

One of the reasons the ESI’s find it easier to cheat and then lie about it could be explained by another study that reveals how the brain gets used to lying over time.

cotton-hairy-club.fr

A study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience states that telling lies builds the density of our brain against the negative emotions associated with it.

In other words, even if you feel guilty about cheating the first time you do, you’re unlikely to feel the same level of guilt the next time around, which in a way may encourage you to repeat the act in the future.

The studies no doubt provide some interesting insights into the minds of ESI offenders. Regardless of these insights, it’s up to people to view this with scepticism or take it at face value on an individual level. Besides, you have to give credit to the person for owning up to his/her past doings."

Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

Alastair Cook's match-winning 243 against Windies in the Pink Ball Test has helped him close the gap on fifth-ranked Virat Kohli in the latest ICC Test rankings for batsmen.

This is the fourth time in his career that the left-hander has amassed a 200 plus score, which helped him jump six spots to sixth place - the best ranking he has achieved since he reached number five in March 2013.

The England opener was instrumental in bailing his side out of trouble from 39 for 2 in the first innings. He also shared a 248-run stand for the third wicket with captain Joe Root, who himself gained 14 points after recording his 13th Test hundred to retain his second place behind Australia's Steven Smith.

Although there was no change in the top 20 among the bowlers, James Anderson and Stuart Broad picked up 15 and six points to narrow the gap on the first-ranked Ravindra Jadeja and sixth placed Kagiso Rabada respectively.

31-year-old Broad, who bagged five wickets in the game, surpassed Ian Botham's tally of 383 wickets to become England's second highest wicket-taker in Tests.

Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India’s current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country’s stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers’ productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a “development” prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."

More than 20 bidders in race for IPL media rights

K Shriniwas Rao • Last updated on Tue, 22 Aug, 2017, 12:04 PM

industry experts say the digital market is clearly a far more dynamic industry going further, which BCCI is unwilling to explore © AFP

A little more than 20 companies have bought the Invitation To Tender (ITT) for the high profile media rights of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the submissions for which have now been scheduled for September 1.

The submissions, earlier scheduled to take place on August 28, had to be postponed by four days because of matters related to taxation and impending bank holidays. In the first round of clarifications on the ITT sent out last Friday, the BCCI had informed potential bidders about the same.

The list of those who have picked up the ITT will be submitted to the Supreme Court on Tuesday when the petition submitted by MP Subramanian Swamy asking for an e-auction to ensure transparency will come up for hearing.

Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who is also hearing the matter concerning the BCCI in its longstanding legal tussle with the Cricket Association of Bihar, will hear Swamy's petition.

As the fraternity waits for the Supreme Court to show the way forward, TOI has learned that Star India Pvt Ltd, Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt Ltd, Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Digital lead a list of 20-odd companies that have picked up the ITT, with another internet giant Yahoo joining the race.

Others include Follow on Interactive Media, Times Internet Ltd, Gulf DTH, SuperSport International, GroupM Media India, Bein IP, Econet Media Group, Sky UK, ESPN Digital Media, BTG Legal Service, BT Sport, Twitter, Facebook, Discovery , Airtel and DAZN Perform Group.

While it certainly happens to be an attractive line-up, the fact that BCCI has kept all options open in terms of inviting the bids - a consolidated bid, breakdown of bids and both, it remains to be seen if it will be a level-playing field.

Those with an industry perspective say a consolidated bid will not allow market-specific bidders like Amazon and Yahoo looking to cut the cheque from a digital viewpoint to contest on equal footing because the option of a consolidated bid heavily tilts the game in favour of the television broadcaster.

While the cricket board's logic is that keeping all options open allows it to look at revenue maximization, industry experts say the digital market is clearly a far bigger and a more dynamic industry going further, which BCCI is unwilling to explore keeping broadcaster interests in mind.

""A separate bid for digital will force the rights-owner to do a deferred live of matches whereas if one party owns digital and broadcast both, then there's no restriction. Where's the logic in this?

Why not have a paywall instead? This is like suppressing a market that hasn't even woken up yet,"" says an industry executive.

Latest US Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy: Not much South Asian comfort,"By Pinaki Bhattacharya

It was touted as the latest US strategy towards South Asia. And, we were told by US Secretary of Defence James Mattis, that the Camp David meeting last weekend was a culmination of many months of review of US policies for the Afghanistan quagmire. So, expectations were high in the four capitals of Kabul, Islamabad, New Delhi and Beijing.

But US President Donald J Trump let South Asia down. He talked about an increased US commitment to Afghanistan — more boots on the ground. There were no numbers mentioned of fresh troop deployment, for that is a potential minefield in hyper-ventilating Washington.

US House of Representative SpeakerPaul Ryan, who was briefed earlier about what to expect from Trump’s current trumpeteering, almost called it prescient that the US President has called the latest strategy to be not time-based but “based on condition” —which means, as Trump explained, “condition on the ground”.

Lessons on conflict resolution state that one needs to divine an acceptable‘ end state’ before one sets the conflict-machine chugging. But it seems that Republican presidencies have not learnt the studied moves of the Nixon-Kissinger team. Instead, they seem as expansive as the Reagan administration that was too busy defeating the Soviet Union, thus making itself hostage to the Chinese economic miracle.

Which meant Ronald Reagan’s successor, George H W Bush, losing his presidency to ‘It’s the economy, stupid!’ rhetoric of Bill Clinton. The burgeoning US public debt that Beijing continued to feed — as reflected in the trade surpluses — shows in the lack of ‘strategic autonomy’ that Washington had enjoyed since World War 2.

George W Bush tried his hand in unilateralism, but ended up going down in American history books as a creator of not one, but two Vietnam wars in Af-Pak and Iraq.

Trump’s speech was devoid of any substance that could stir up the Indian subcontinent’s own ‘studio empire-builders’ to reach for their TV microphones.

And what did Trump tell Pakistan that could make the tinpot generals of Rawalpindi quake in their boots? “In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: we must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.”

Boilerplate words those. Thus, shorn of the finesse of a leader like Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s generals would rather have Beijing continuing its indulgence and play mediator for them.

Trump’s speech does very little for the confidence level of New Delhi, which is watching each muscle of the latest actor on the stage of Indo-US relations. There will be a holding operation that would be launched in New Delhi in the wake of this speech.

Not much extra commitment of India’s foreign exchange dollars will flow that Trump was hopeful of steering to Afghanistan. Of course India wouldbe doing its ‘best’. But that ‘best’ would fall short of Trump’s expectations.

So, this speech was really about the domestic audience: not Trump’s own white- and blue-collar electoral base, but the Establishment, whose leading lights are now firmly in the Indiancamp.

This was evident in the penultimate days of the Barack Obama administration when former Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter got the ‘blank cheque’ of the Defence Authorisation Act passed by the US Congress. That may have evoked some fraught memories. But Pentagon can play around with it, military-industrial complex or no military-industrial complex."
"Compassion is the key to Hinduism, does it still exist?","The Times has reported that the Holy Banyan tree is dying, the same tree under which Krshna ‘delivered his message of the Bhagwad Gita to Arjun’. With cemented paths, large bells, lights fixated all over, the problem has escalated with two claimants battling for the care of the tree while the tree is withering. The last remaining relic of the Mahabharata is dying; we have lost sight of what is important.

We pray to nature, to animals, to every living being. We pray to images that replicate holy deities in the form of shivling, in the form of a footprint. Yet we have turned the heart of our nation, Delhi, into the most polluted city of the world. Our metropolitans are growing fast, but to what end? Children have asthma, pm 1.0, 2.5 and 10 are polluting every pore of our natural being, blackening our lungs, shortening our life expectancy. During winters young and old alike leave the city and head for the mountains or the beaches, shutting down businesses, taking long vacations from their jobs, while breadwinners of the family send their spouse and children outside of the city to make sure they are safe.

As a religion that equates every living being to God, we have failed in respecting nature and our religion. In turn we are poisoning our family, our friends, and our neighbors. The cruelest act to mankind is pollution, we are living in a slow poison genocide. Each one of us is responsible for this act, and each one of us can make a difference.

India has a rich history when it comes to forest conservation. In 1730 AD Khejarli Village of Rajasthan, the King had ordered for the felling of Khejri trees, sacred to the Bishnois. Bishnois are an offshoot of Hinduism following 29 principles. Amrita Devi couldn’t bear to witness the destruction of her faith and the village’s sacred trees, so she hugged the trees and said “A chopped head is cheaper than a felled tree.” People from different villages joined her. The soldiers chopped slaughtered 363 Bishnois. As soon as the King received news of this he ordered the soldiers to stop the operation and designated the Bishnoi state as a protected area. This legislation still exists today. In memory of the deceased, a number of khejri trees are planted around the area.

This was the beginning of the Chipko movement, now nationally prevalent and widely acclaimed as an effective method of forest preservation.

The United Nations made June 5th World Environment Day in 1947, in 1950 Dr. K M Munshi created Van Mahotsav festival for forest conservation and planting trees. It is now a week-long festival, usually from the 1st of July to 7th July. We celebrate World Environment Day where for an hour we turn off the lights of our homes, but have forlorn Van Mahotsav festival which is more in-line with our ‘dharma’.

On World Environment Day 2017 ‘Mann ki Baat’, Prime Minister Modi talked about how traditional Hindu scriptures such as Gita, Shukracharya Niti, and Anushasan Parv of the Mahabharta highlight the values of forests. He planted a Kadam tree which has much religious value in Hindu scriptures, and also placed a traditional earthen-pot with it, a traditional method of conserving water, and ensuring it has regular water supply.

On Twitter Narendra Modi encouraged farmers to plant 5 trees in celebration of the birth of their daughter, as the farmer can reap monetary benefits from the plantation and use that for her marriage. A two pronged approach which saves the life of a girl child and doesn’t make her seem like a burden, and also helps the farmers family economically.

‘Each one plant one tree,’ a popular yet simple motto if followed can make a huge impact due to our 1.3 Billion population, the second largest population in the world. As at 2016 the tree cover of India was 23.81%. The Government of India has set a target of 33% cover by 2020. If united we can bring a change in the pollution levels, not only nationally but also globally thereby leaving a world safe for our future. If each one plants one tree, if each one ensures that each sapling lives its complete life, we can save the world. With Delhi’s population of 18.98 million people, if each person decides to plant at least one tree we can come closer to meeting the minimum requirement of 33% forest coverage in a metropolitan area.

The question arises, why only ‘each one plant ONE tree’, why not two? For each Hindu’s Antim-Sanskar we need at least 2 trees, we can return the favor to Mother Earth. If we could make the effort, find the motivation, respect our heritage and living beings of all nature then we can collectively make a difference in India which can impact the globe positively."

Vijender Singh Is Optimistic – Predicts More Than One Medal For India At The World Championship,"Eight years ago, he scripted history by opening the country's account in amateur boxing's marquee event and Vijender Singh feels India might just go one better on that during the 19th World Championship, starting August 25 in Hamburg.

afp

The 31-year-old had fetched a bronze medal at the 15th World Championship in Milan, just over a year after becoming India's first Olympic medallist in boxing - a bronze-winner at the 2008 Beijing Games.

The nation has a bronze each to show for in the 2009, 2011 and 2015 World Championships -- the other two bronze- medallists, apart from Vijender, being Vikas Krishan (2011) and Shiva Thapa (2015).

afp

""It is a mature bunch of boxers. I have been in teams that had Shiva (Thapa), Vikas (Krishan) and Manoj (Kumar). So, I know some of them well. They have the ability to ensure that India ends up with more than one medal. If they compete to their full potential, I think there is a real chance of more than one medal,"" Vijender told PTI in an interview.

""They have competed at the highest level in the past and know what they should do. I cannot give any suggestions to them but I can just say, they need to be very focussed,"" he added.

afp

Both Vikas (75kg) and Shiva (60kg) are part of the eight-member team, which has already reached Hamburg after qualifying for the event through the Asian Championships earlier this year.

The others in the team are Amit Phangal (49kg), Kavinder Bisht (52kg), Gaurav Bidhuri (56kg), Manoj Kumar (69kg), Sumit Sangwan (91kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg).

A fair share of amateur history to his credit, Vijender turned professional in 2015 and has two titles to flaunt in an unbeaten run so far.

""That bronze medal I won in Milan was part of a beautiful phase in my career because it managed to silence some harsh critics, who felt that my medal in Beijing was a fluke. There were people who said that I was not training enough, within months of my medal in Beijing,"" Vijender said.

Vijender recalled how he sought solitude during both the Olympics and the World Championship.

""To me, focus has always meant shutting myself off before heading to a big tournament. I would just insulate myself from anything and everything that was going on outside the little space, which I would create for myself,"" he explained.

ap

""There will always be expectations and I am sure the guys who are competing this time, are well aware of that. But to me, the key lies in not allowing that to play on the mind. There has to be a single-minded focus on the ring, forget everything else, that's what I do,"" he said.

A former world No.1 in middleweight amateur rankings, Vijender refused to pick favourites but did single out Thapa for praise.

""He has progressed tremendously and seems to be a very sorted boxer. I have been impressed by his growth,"" said the Haryana star about the 24-year-old, who is the first Indian to claim three back-to-back Asian Championship medals.

Infosys’s driverless golf cart versus Google’s autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google’s autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, which “rather than simply copy Glaxo’s migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).” The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural — software and hardware — support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."
5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease.

"Researchers Have Developed The World's Smallest Surgical Robot Arm, Thanks To Smartphones!","A team of British scientists have developed the world’s smallest surgical robot, one that could change the face of medicine forever.

Image courtesy: Cambridge Medical Robotics

Developed by a team of 100 scientists and engineers in Cambridgeshire, the robotic arm has been specially designed to conduct keyhole surgeries, using technology borrowed from mobile phones and the space industry.

Called Versius, the device mimics the movements of a human arm and can be used for a wide range of keyhole surgeries. This kind of operation involves making a series of tiny incisions in order to avoid the risks of traditional open surgery, as well as improve the patient’s recovery time.

In this case, Versius can supplement a traditional surgeon in order to improve the accuracy and reduce the chances of a slip up. The surgeon controls the arm via a 3D screen within the operating theatre. While surgical bots already exist, this one takes up a third of the space required by existing models, as well as being easier to use, according to the Cambridge Medical Robotics team.

“Having robots in the operating theatre is not a new idea,” the company’s chief executive, Martin Frost, said. “The problem at the moment is that they are phenomenally expensive – not only do they cost £2m each (approximately Rs 16.52 crore) to buy, but every procedure costs an extra £3,000 using the robot ( Rs 2.5 lakh) – and they are very large. Many hospitals have to use the operating theatre around the robot. Their size can also make them difficult for the surgical team to use.”

One major benefit to the Versius over a human surgeon is its utmost precision. Not only can it mimic a human arm’s movement, but inbuilt technology can also detect just how much force needs to be applied when the instruments are inside the patient.

The new bot will launch next year, and CMR expects surgeons to be trained and practiced enough to begin using the devices by the end of 2018.

108-kg Actress Refuses To Gain More Weight For TV Show,"Actress Anjali Anand, who currently weighs 108 kg, has refused to put on more weight for her role of an oversized girl in the upcoming TV show ""Dhhai Kilo Prem"".

Anjali, who is making her acting debut with the show, was asked by makers to put on more weight. However, she refused to do so.

""I have lived a very active life all this while. Being someone who loves to trek and cycle to maintain a steady weight, gaining too much weight is a big no-no. I am at 108 kg for the role and any more change might get difficult to reverse,"" Anjali said in a statement.

""Dhhai Kilo Prem"", which will be aired on Star Plus starting from April 3, is an unusual story of two imperfect individuals -- Deepika and Piyush (Meherzan Mazda).

The Hacker Of GoT Season 7 Episode 4 Leaked It Because He Wanted To Please His Girlfriend!,"It happens only in India?!

The first time it happened with the fourth episode of Game of Thrones, the most hyped and loved American series that the entire episode was leaked online before its official release, and it happened in India.

The leaked episode had Star India’s watermark on it, which means that Hotstar who is HBO’s partner in India for airing the episode was responsible for the leak. Later it turned out that Prime Focus Technologies—the agency which manages Star India Private Limited’s data, is the root of the entire problem. Four people were arrested in the same regard and now one of them has revealed how it got revealed.

What was supposed to be a grave severe affair turned out to be rather funnier and realistic, to say the least.

So, now it has been revealed that one of the IT professionals named Alok Sharma who was under arrest in the same regard had sent the episode to his girlfriend in order to please her, and that is from where it was leaked and later uploaded online.

Twitter

“Initially, there were suspicions that one of the accused had accessed the episode as his girlfriend wanted to see it. The girlfriend had then passed it onto others, one of whom uploaded it online,” revealed an official to Indian Express who was part of the probe earlier.

“The investigation is still in progress. However, so far, it appears that they had leaked it for self-consumption. We are now trying to find out who uploaded it online,” another senior officer added.

According to the report, first Alok had accessed the episode and it is he who shared it with the other four who are also under arrest. Police is trying to find out who uploaded it online.

Meanwhile, hackers responsible for the leak of the sixth episode have warned HBO that the finale episode will also be leaked before the actual air date.

"Woman Cricketer From Haryana Alleges Rape, Says No Action Taken By Police","A woman cricketer has alleged inaction in the arrest of a self-styled priest from Bhilwara in Rajasthan who raped her on the pretext of marrying her. The survivor claimed to be a part of the Haryana cricket team.

The Hisar Sadar police had booked four persons, including the alleged key accused, his friend and a woman friend of the survivor in March this year.

Twitter

According to sources, the woman appeared before Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, who was in Hisar to review the security arrangements in the wake of verdict in the rape case against, on Sunday. She not only accused the police of inaction but also alleged that an inspector had used abusive language with her, said sources.

In her complaint, the woman cricketer alleged that she had come in contact with one Vidyanand, the main accused, through a male acquaintance of her friend, said sources, adding that Vidyanand had allegedly called her to Haridwar and abused her on pretext of marrying her.

Hisar SP Manisha Chaudhary said one of the accused had been arrested. ""The main accused is on the run and we are conducting raids to arrest him. We will arrest him as soon as possible,"" said."
Can Yogi do more for electricity than gau raksha?,"Uttar Pradesh has long been one of the worst administered states. Children’s deaths in Gorakhpur recently hogged the headlines, but are hardly new. Ex-bureaucrat V Ramani has unearthed an RTI response showing that between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2011, 31,791 children were admitted to the Gorakhpur hospital, and no less than 3,745 died, 1,311 of encephalitis. Half the qualified medical posts and 40% of nursing posts were vacant. Similar problems afflict every sector in UP.

Like many predecessors, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to overhaul governance. During a recent visit to Lucknow, two senior bureaucrats told me the Yogi was more serious than any chief minister for decades, and was not simply a Hindutva fanatic. Yet UP’s history has long been one of broken promises and dismal outcomes. Poor governance is deeply embedded, and will resist overhaul.

There are some green shoots. One of the most difficult areas to reform in any state is electricity. Huge subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers have plunged most state electricity boards deep into the red. Chief ministers need to bite the bullet and push through major tariff hikes and reductions in theft.

The Yogi has bitten the bullet. The state has proposed tariff hikes of up to 360% for different categories of rural and urban domestic consumers, the average hike being 22.6%. Industry rates have not been raised at all — the state wants to attract industry, and its rates are already high. This is the very opposite of the populism typical of a new chief minister.

Can UP follow the Gujarat model? There, companies in generation, transmission and distribution all show profits. As Chief Minister, Modi cracked down on power theft, raised tariffs, metered and supplied power to almost all villages, and bifurcated electric feeders to villages. This enabled him to supply 24×7 power for domestic use and six hours per day for agricultural pumps.

Profitable industrial and commercial consumers account for 52% of consumption in Gujarat, against only 30% in UP, which cannot therefore depend on cross-subsidies from industry for farmers. It currently loses Rs 2.07 on every unit of power supplied. Apart from subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers, power theft and corruption are rampant. The state’s Aggregate Commercial and Technical (ACT) losses average 31% across its distribution companies. The Yogi seeks to slash this to 23% in a year, a huge challenge.

Technical losses in transmission should not exceed 8-9% of supply. Anything more represents theft and corruption. ACT loss is a whopping 60% in Meerut, where politically powerful vote banks and industries have long siphoned off power in collusion with corrupt electricity officials.

Checking theft requires strong police support. But police stations in UP are under-staffed and fully occupied with major crimes and public order. They have no time or staff to check electricity theft: unfilled vacancies for constables exceed one lakh.

Yogi’s radical reform proposal is to create one new police station in every district dedicated to checking electricity theft. That can be a game changer. A senior official says, “This is the first government in my time to say we should go after all thieves without exceptions or mercy.” Brave words, but implementation has never been the state’s strong point.

Following court orders, exams are being held to hire one lakh constables. These will be based largely on objective questions in a written exam, not school marks, since cheating is so rampant that school marks mean nothing.

The state’s ‘Electricity For All’ scheme aims to electrify every household by October 2018. That means doubling the current number of connections: an additional 1.12 crore rural and 15 lakh urban consumers are to be covered. Up to 10 lakh diesel gensets of farmers will also be converted to electricity. The Yogi claims rural power supply is up from 12 to 18 hours per day. Grassroots reports suggest substantial improvement though not to the extent claimed. Critics, including buffalo traders and meat processors, say the Yogi is keener on cow protection than electricity.

Officials claim that in four months, the BJP government has metered 3.25 lakh unmetered connections, and provided 12.5 lakh new connections. They say in the April-June quarter, electricity supply rose 18% while revenue jumped 30%, reflecting better collection.

Will this be sustained? Will the BJP resist the temptation to waive rural electricity dues when the next election approaches? Is the Yogi serious enough, and bureaucracy honest and efficient enough, to stop power theft and collect bills? Let’s see. The Yogi’s power reforms have started well, but have miles to go."
Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad,"BREAKING RECORDS

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad

• Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:47 AM Rob Johnston in Birmingham

Broad admitted it was extra special to have moved passed Botham - one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. © Getty

Stuart Broad admitted that it was a special feeling to become England's second-highest Test wicket-taker on the final day of the first Test against Windies at Edgbaston. When Broad bowled Shane Dowrich in the evening session of the final day with a ball that nipped back sharply, he moved to 384 Test wickets, overtaking Sir Ian Botham in the list of England's highest Test wicket-takers. James Anderson, Broad's great friend and opening partner, leads the list with 492 Test wickets.

""It's a really special day,"" Broad said on Saturday (August 19). ""I felt really good in that little spell of bowling [on the final evening]. It was probably the best 40 minutes of bowling I've had this summer."" After a frustrating start to Windies' innings - he had two catches dropped on the second evening - Broad's rewards came quickly as he took the five wickets he needed to overtake Botham across two of the visitors' innings on the third day.

It was, Broad admitted, extra special to have moved passed Botham, one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. ""He's someone who has been a big influence on me, playing with my Dad, watching some of his performances against Australia,"" he said. ""He is a huge legend of English cricket but someone who has given back to this team. I was fortunate to get my first cap off him in 2007.

""In the past couple of years, he's spent more and more time in the changing room and guys really listen to him. He's someone who's passionate about English cricket and wants us to do well. I could tell he was genuinely proud and delighted that I've managed to go past him. That's testament to him,"" he added.

Broad has bowled well this summer without the rewards to show for it. He took just 11 wickets against South Africa but looked in good rhythm throughout that series and had not been unduly worried about his form. ""I feel like I've been threatening and creating chances,"" Broad said. ""If I save all my wickets for Australia I don't mind,"" he said.

On the third day in Birmingham, he picked up two wickets in the Windies' first innings and three in the second, bowling a full length at good pace. He took 3-17 in a seven-over spell in the final session which was somewhat reminiscent of some of the magical spells Broad has delivered during his Test career to date.

After dismissing Roston Chase and captain Jason Holder in successive balls, leaving him in joint second place with Botham, Broad could have gone passed the former all-rounder in style. The Edgbaston crowd willed him on but Broad's hat-trick ball was resolutely blocked by Kemar Roach although Dowrich was dismissed soon after.

Broad, who has played 107 Tests, is probably not given the credit he deserves for his exploits. His 384 wickets have come at the impressive average of 28.47 and he has taken 15 five-wicket hauls and two ten-fors. He will go down as one of England's finest-ever fast bowlers and it is perhaps his misfortune that his career has coincided with that of Anderson. Had it not, he may have got even more plaudits.

At 31, Broad will have plenty of opportunity to add to his haul. His injury record has been generally good and provided he stays fit and is managed well, achieving 500 Test wickets is by no means out of the question. ""I still feel like I've got quite a lot of cricket left in me,"" he said. ""I'm really enjoying being a part of this team at the moment. I'd certainly hope that my performances will keep improving so I'd be part of that 2019 Ashes. I'm not someone who looks too far ahead because I think it slows you down as a performer. You don't know if you'll have the luck with injuries.

""I play cricket for the competitive side of it. I love that feeling of being in a battle, that feeling with the new ball, getting an opening batsman out and they're desperate to

survive. That's the reason I play. I'll play as long as that drive is there. It's still within me now. As soon as that goes, I'll know that I'm gone.""

Broad is best known for the magic spells that have defined his career; his 8-15 against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2015, 6-17 against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2016, 5-37 against Australia at the Oval in 2009. Perhaps because of those standout performances, his consistency is often overlooked. Not since 2012 has he averaged more than 30 runs per wicket in a calendar year.

""My career has always been a little bit like that,"" Broad said. ""Pick up a two-fer, a two-fer and then get a six-fer out of nowhere."" Can he sense when he is on the cusp of one of those spells? ""I sort of can. I do feel light in my run-up. I make the batsmen play every ball. When I don't get it quite right, I get pushed in to fifth stump and get left. I really don't like being left, it feels like a waste of a run-up. I love batsmen playing forward defensives at me because if I get any sort of nibble, it brings both sides in.""

Broad will be a key player for England in this winter's Ashes, a series he thinks is going to be ""a belter"". Although, if England's management are considering resting him from one of the next two Tests against Windies to save him for Australia, they might have to think again. ""I will be politely suggesting that I will have sufficient rest in September and October to be available for the next two Tests against West Indies,"" he said.

Going to Gorakhpur’s root: Here are some simple steps that would turn around and restore vibrancy to government hospitals,"The Gorakhpur tragedy has exposed the weakness of the public health system. Instead of finding a scapegoat, let us look at how India’s broken public health system can be mended. There are three main problems with Indian public health, and none of them have to do with lack of money. The problems are (i) acute shortage of medical specialists; (ii) lack of career progression for nurses; and (iii) accountability.

Shortage of medical specialists is evident even in a state like Karnataka which has the largest number of medical colleges. Yet there are over 1,200 vacancies for specialists in government hospitals. Unlike in the past, an MBBS doctor with adequate training but without a post graduate degree is legally barred today from performing a caesarean section, an anaesthetic procedure, an ultrasound or interpreting a chest X-ray.

The top 10 causes of death in India cannot be treated by an MBBS doctor. In simple terms, even a brilliant MBBS doctor cannot do anything more legally than what a housewife is permitted to do. These rigid regulations were created by the Medical Council and upheld by the Supreme Court for patient safety.

Unfortunately, we also have an acute shortage of post graduate seats needed to convert existing two lakh MBBS doctors into specialists. Because of the shortage of specialists, Indian maternal and infant mortality rates are worse than some sub-Saharan African countries.

The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery recommends preparedness for “bellwether procedures”, ie emergency caesarean section, laparotomy and surgery for open fractures at community health centres – of which there are 5,500 in India – as an indicator of an efficient public health system. Today, 60% of deaths are due to non-infectious diseases. According to the commission, while only 3.83 million people die globally due to malaria, HIV and TB, 16.9 million people die due to lack of access to safe surgery every year.

India needs 65 million surgeries annually, but only 26 million are performed and the rest suffer and die. Legally, only specialists can perform surgeries and treat non-communicable diseases. This is the reason a hospital without adequate number of specialists is of no use for the patient and the community.

Ten years ago, maternal mortality rate (MMR) of Maharashtra was as bad as in the rest of the prosperous south Indian states. In 2009, Maharashtra’s health ministry recognised diplomas from the then 96-year-old College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) to convert MBBS doctors into specialists. Today, nearly a thousand specialist medical officers working for Maharashtra health service are not MD or MS but diploma holders from CPS. By 2013, these diploma holders had produced a Maharashtra miracle: they dramatically reduced its MMR from 144 to 68, half of Karnataka’s MMR. Very soon, Maharashtra will be challenging Kerala for the number one spot.

Fortunately, the Union health ministry is considering recognising CPS diplomas across India. National Board of Examinations is also converting large government hospitals as teaching institutes to train medical specialists. With trained and certified gynaecologists, paediatricians, anaesthetists and radiologists, community health centres and taluka and district hospitals will become the most vibrant hospitals.

Second, the nursing profession is in crisis in India. In the US, 67% of anaesthesia procedures are administered by nurse anaesthetists. In India, a nurse who worked in an ICU for 20 years is legally not allowed to prescribe even a painkiller. The younger generation will never take up a profession where there is no career progression. Recently, the health ministry and Indian Nursing Council launched the nurse practitioner course, which will be a turning point in Indian nursing profession. Nurse practitioners can reduce doctors’ workload in government and private hospitals, improving clinical outcomes.

Third, the accountability question. People need hospitals only for the procedures. Health ministry should monitor hospitals on just four parameters for every government hospital – outpatient numbers, number of diagnostic tests, number and outcomes of surgeries and number and outcomes in critical care service. This data should be uploaded real time to a cloud-based app. Based on this data the ministry can grade every government hospital, plan budgetary allocation, increments and promotions of staff. Real time data in public domain will hold the mirror for policy makers to reflect on. We believe in god, but the rest is data.

When i was growing up, government hospitals were the most vibrant institutions and government doctors were our heroes. My brother, a doctor himself, insisted on my getting a tonsillectomy in a government hospital. If there were 20 full-time paediatricians working at Gorakhpur’s BRD hospital, tragedy would have been averted.

Medical specialists are always at the highest level of the government pecking order. Young and qualified medical specialists will insist on improvement of infrastructure to practice their newly acquired skill and build their reputation. As always happens in India, one of the 20 paediatricians would be taking care of a senior minister’s or politician’s grandchild, thus having access to the state’s power centre.

Maharashtra’s experience has convinced us to believe that recognition of CPS diploma courses across the country will be a turning point in the history of vibrancy of government hospitals, along with empowering nurses and digital accountability tools. I am convinced, after spending my entire professional life in managing hospitals, that private enterprise cannot replace government hospitals for rural healthcare. If you think government is not capable of managing hospitals look at Jayadeva Institute of Cardiac Sciences Bangalore, UN Mehta Heart Institute Ahmedabad and ILBS Delhi which make India proud."
"Girls In Shimla To Get Mandatory Self-Defense Classes, As Education Dept Responds To Rape Case","In the wake of the Kotkhai minor gangrape and murder, the state education department has issued a new set of guidelines under which students, especially girls, will be trained in self-defence and educated in requisite life skills to deal with such challenges.

Tiger Shroff Saves Rumoured Girlfriend Disha Patani From An Embarrassing Moment On The Ramp!,"It has, for long, been rumoured that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been dating but the couple has kept what's between them under wraps. Often they have been spotted together and the rumours thereafter spread like wildfire.

Recently, the alleged couple attended the Lakme Fashion Week together, and what happened there was rather cute that fans have been fawning over.

Just like Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani was also supposed to walk the runway but she didn't. Why, you ask? Because Tiger saved her from what could have been a major embarrassing moment.

So, before the diva walked the ramp, Tiger figured out that the stage was made up of a reflective glass, and her alleged girlfriend was wearing a short dress. Being a keen observer of thing or just being a caring boyfriend, Tiger was seen muttering something into her ears and thereafter she decided not to walk the ramp.

Isn't that cute?

Earlier as well, the alleged couples of the B-town have saved their girlfriends from such awkward moments. Remember, how once, Salman told Katrina to cover up her neck while at a press conference through Alia Bhatt.

Also, how once Singh Rajput saved Kriti Sanon from a probable wardrobe malfunction?

That's indeed cute, isn't it?

Law panel to study triple talaq order before writing report on civil code The law panel will also ascertain whether the verdict striking down the practice of triple talaq can shed light on what personal law is according to the constitution bench."
Daughters of India have a new hero and role model: Shayara Bano,"Today the Supreme Court of India found the practice of triple talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, violative of the fundamental right contained in Article 14 of the Constitution, which provides all persons equality before the law – prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, sex etc. It’s a momentous judgment in the life of our nation. We can be sure that its implications will unfold in many ways in the years and decades to come – likely empowering not just Muslim women, in fact not just women but also other subjects of discrimination, in their struggle for equality.

While there has long been mainstream consensus that triple talaq brutalizes women, it survived so far in the name of religion. In this it is only one of many practices like nikah halala, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, unequal guardianship rights, and unequal access to places of worship – where women continue to be subjected to discrimination in the name of religion and tradition. In this sense today’s victory is not the end of the fight but just the beginning.

For a brutalized woman the fight can seem daunting, the rewards uncertain, the journey uphill and sometimes backbreaking. The question she asks herself is, what difference can I make? But what a difference Shayara Bano has made. She was the first petitioner in the case that made history today. Fifteen years of marriage came to an abrupt end for her when in 2015 she was served a talaqnama via Speed Post. To underline, her husband ended the marriage unilaterally and instantaneously, with a letter in which talaq was written thrice. Unlike the millions of other women who have suffered similar injustice in silence, she went to court.

Petitioners Aafreen Rehman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri joined her. Lawyers like Indira Jaising and collectives like Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board stood like rock next to her. From all over India support poured in from Muslim and Hindu women alike. A solidarity grew where a woman had been abandoned, alone and browbeaten.

Shayara Bano calls pushing triple talaq into history’s dustbin “a milestone on the road to reforms”. It’s a pretty distinguished milestone. It guarantees her a place in tomorrow’s textbooks. She has emerged as a hero of modern India. Her story should now be told to all the daughters of India, to make them stronger and aware of their rights and ready to stand up for them.

As the Attorney General submitted to Supreme Court, “Gender justice [is] a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same half of the country’s citizenry would not be able to enjoy to the fullest – their rights, status and opportunities.”

Politicians are trying to hijack today’s victory. But it belongs to the women of India and to everyone who values the fundamental right to equality."

PCB chairman confirms World XI tour in September

While World XI is set to play a three-match T20 series in September, West Indies will play three T20Is in late November. © Getty

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, put to rest all speculations regarding the World XI tour to Pakistan, confirming on Monday (August 21), a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in Lahore, starting September 10. A 15-member squad led by former Zimbabwe great Andy Flower will take part in a seven-day long camp in Dubai before heading to Lahore for the series. However, the bigger news is Windies is set to tour the cricket-starved nation for a three-match T20I series in Lahore in late November.

Sethi also stated that the three games against World XI will be played across four days, but refused to divulge the dates citing security reasons.

""CWI and PCB are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies play three T20I matches in Lahore in late November,"" read the statement. ""In September, October and November, we'll have the World XI, we'll have Sri Lankan team and then the West Indies (come play in Pakistan).

""We just hope that the security we've promised, we'll keep it up. Sri Lanka have said they'll come after the World XI, provided the security is fine. It will be fine, Punjab government has indicated that the preparation are in full swing. At the end of this month, ICC's security team is also arriving. So far all signals are good,"" Sethi added. He also stated that talks with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were still on over the number of games to be played.

While the Punjab Government approved 'Presidential level security' for the week-long World XI series in Lahore, Sethi expressed his desire to host a few games in the other cities too, notably Karachi. ""I have the desire to take some games out of Lahore and host them in Karachi, but everyone I speak to reject that idea. They tell me that we've succeeded in hosting something well in Lahore (PSL 2 final) so keep that going. First host the PSL in Karachi, then we will come there.""

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

""This is my objective. I had given myself a mission statement - to organise PSL, to bring it to Pakistan, to bring international cricket to Pakistan. Game development needs to be done, fund raising needs to be done - and all that we're going to do slowly. And I also want to try to professionalise PCB,"" Sethi said.

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

"SC Upholds Gender Equality, Suspends Triple Talaq For Six Months. Asks Govt To Form New Law","In a landmark judgement, the Indian Supreme Court has held that the practice of triple talaq among a section of Indian Muslims is unconstitutional.

BCCL/ Representational Image

Triple talaq, or verbal (triple) divorce, is practiced by some in the Muslim community to instantly divorce their wives by saying talaq three times.

A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khare has asked the parliament to pass a new law in this regard. If the law doesn't come into force in six months, then the injunction on Triple Talaq will continue.

AFP/ Representational Image

The apex court also expresses hope the Centre's legislation will take into account concerns of Muslim bodies and Sharia law. The verdict came in a host of cases filed by various rights groups and individuals challenging the controversial practice.

The petitioners claimed that the practice was against women's rights and regressive. Many Muslim women who were given triple talaq on trivial issues had also approached the court seeking a ban on the practice, something that is outlawed even in Islamic countries.

AFP

Islamic organization like the All India Muslim Personal Law Board had vehemently opposed any move to abolish the practice, citing constitutionality. Narendra Modi and his BJP had extensively campaigned against the practice, especially during the UP elections.

Learn from Khatauli – the habits of ‘jugaad’ and ‘chalta hai’ are incompatible with rail safety,"Prima facie it appears that the train derailment at Khatauli on Saturday, mangling up the Utkal Express, could have been avoided, if the prescribed mandatory operating procedure had been observed.

Preliminary enquiries suggest that after detecting a crack in a ‘glued joint’ the engineering staff asked for a 20 minute ‘block’ for repairs, yet the repair work was taken up without authority – in gross violation of the safety protocol.

Indian Railways’ general and subsidiary rules lay down that, in case of emergency, repairs to the track may be carried out after taking mandatory precautions such as exhibiting ‘Stop’ signals. Further, a senior engineering official must first bring the train to a stop and advise the train driver through a written memo about the need to stop the train, and simultaneously arrange to send a message to the station master and obtain his written confirmation. This essential drill was not followed and elementary safety norms were violated.

Pending a detailed probe by the commissioner of railway safety, in a rather unprecedented move, a central government secretary level technocrat – member of the railway board in charge of the engineering department – has been summarily sent on leave, along with the two top jurisdictional officers – the general manager of the northern railway zone and the divisional railway manager of the Delhi division. In addition, the zonal chief track engineer has been moved out on transfer, while the senior divisional engineer, among other junior engineering officials, has been suspended.

Much as the swift and stern action by government underlines its stated ‘zero tolerance for unsafe rail operations’, the fact remains that most political dispensations have followed warped priorities with respect to the nation’s lifeline, leaving it battered and bruised.

Elsewhere in the world, today technology enables fatality-free rail travel. Japan’s Shinkansen ‘bullet’ trains have been operating without fatality for over 50 years. These technologies demand a modern mindset, appropriate management structure, and skilled workforce. With more than 85% of its train accidents ascribed to ‘human failure’, IR has also been constantly investing in newer technologies, mechanisation of maintenance, upgradation of track structure, including higher capacity long welded rails, their ultrasonic testing, on-track and digital machines, and electronic monitoring of track geometry.

With highly expensive and sophisticated equipment steadily ploughed into IR, along with myriad technological aids increasingly made available for maintenance, the extent of assets failures that still occur is unacceptable. IR’s assets failures, jeopardising safety, show a disturbing trend: rail track fractures and weld failures increased from 3,237 in 2015-16 to 3,546 in 2016-17; diesel and electric locomotives failures remained at about the level of 4,500 in the year, and detachment of passenger coaches from trains run in excess of 810; failures of overhead electric wires increased from 378 in 2015-16 to 447 in 2016-17; signalling equipment failures were of the order of 1,30,200 in 2016-17.

While the enquiry commissioned by IR will establish the cause of Saturday’s accident, safety is itself symptomatic of operational efficiency and discipline, to be viewed as integral to all operations. The glaring fault lines of the Khatauli accident expose IR’s silo-based set-up, where departmental compartmentalisation loses sight of the overall organisational goals including safety.

The Anil Kakodkar led rail safety committee report echoed the prevalent public perception of IR’s creeping infirmities: “Centralised, top heavy and hierarchical along departmental lines.” It also emphasised the status quo ante to be restored for senior general management posts, to be manned only by those well versed in train operation, much like the senior command posts in the defence establishment are filled mostly by the fighting arms.

Still the non-implementation bug bites, not IR alone; and selective amnesia has been government’s forte. It is definitely time for change, for a new way of thinking in the rail industry, to enable IR to regain primacy in the country’s transport domain, to become the economy’s engine of growth. There should be no place for an attitude of just ‘jugaad’, or, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed, of ‘chalta hai’."
Why Sasikala may still hold the key to survival of Tamil Nadu government,"TV news headlines have been dominated by the AIADMK merger where a reunion took place between Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami (EPS) and his predecessor O Panneerselvam (OPS) in Chennai on Monday. Both sides have been locked in a bitter tussle after former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide VK Sasikala was convicted in a disproportionate assets case in February. Though the merger comes as a boost to EPS-OPS camp who is trying to oust Sasikala from the party, yet the key to state government’s survival could still lie with Sasikala’s nephew – TTV Dhinakaran.

Even as the merger was being played out live on TV, reports suggest that there were as many as 16 AIADMK MLAs present at Dhinakaran’s residence watching the proceedings. As many as 23 MLAs and four MPs were seen on a public platform with party leaders at a rally organised by AIADMK deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaran in Madurai last week. The latest development has put Dhinakaran in a position where he enjoys no power over the state government. But this may not be enough for EPS-OPS to stop Dhinakaran from bringing down the government.

AIADMK factions finally unite, Panneerselvam is deputy CM https://t.co/4sys6uUTk3 pic.twitter.com/wV8pXLGcqk — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 21, 2017

The current strength of the Tamil Nadu assembly is 232 after the death of two MLAs including Jayalalithaa. This would put the required number at 117 to defeat a no-confidence-motion brought by the opposition led by DMK. During the February confidence vote, EPS had the support of 122 MLAs while OPS is said to have the backing of another 10 MLAs. The figure of 132 could be misleading as this includes the 16 MLAs who were present at Dhinakaran’s house on Monday. The government would be one short of a majority if Dhinakaran and the opposition can hold on to their MLAs.

Steps will be taken to remove Sasikala from party: AIADMK MP https://t.co/kYzkDJAkc5 pic.twitter.com/YXW9rUUeMp — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 21, 2017

Such a scenario could result in another assembly election where DMK may have the advantage due to a disunited AIADMK. The current assembly still has almost four of its five year tenure left. The only hope for political stability for EPS-OPS combine is that their merger could help convince MLAs from Dhinakaran camp to jump ship and stave off an early election."

Gayle, Samuels return to Windies squad for England ODIs

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 07:10 PM

Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels have been included in the 15-member Windies squad for the five-match One-Day International series in England, Cricket West Indies announced on Monday (August 21). Jerome Taylor too returns to ODI fold after more than a year.

Sunil Ambris, the uncapped right-handed opener from Guyana, was also included in the side while other notable omissions from the squad were Dwayne Bravo, Darren Bravo and Carlos Brathwaite.

Courtney Browne, the chairman of selection panel, though confirmed Dwayne was considered for selection but isn't fully fit yet. ""With regards to the selection of the ODI squad, the panel welcomes back Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who will both add value to our batting and help with the nurturing of the young batsmen in the team,"" he said.

""Both Sunil Narine and Darren Bravo have declined to be considered for ODIs in England. Narine has however confirmed his desire to play 50-over cricket again but has asked to play in our Regional Super50 before he is considered and Darren said he was not available for selection. Dwayne Bravo said he is still not 100% fit, but is looking at a possible return to international cricket next year.""

Ambris was part of the Windies squad that took on India at home for the last three ODIs but he didn't get a game. He has played 35 first-class games and has 1622 runs at an average of 28.96. His List A record though is much better as he averages 51.71 after 20 games and has scored 724 runs.

Gayle last played an ODI in the World Cup 2015 quarterfinal clash against New Zealand while Samuels's last outing for the national side came in October last year against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi.

Brathwaite continues to be left out of the side despite being the Twenty20 International captain. Kieran Powell, Jonathan Carter and Roston Chase too have been axed from the side. Dwayne Bravo has been playing for the Trinbago Knight Riders, having returned from a long hamstring injury lay-off that he picked up during the last edition of Big Bash League.

Darren Bravo, who ruled himself out of contention, is however eligible for selection after offering an apology to the board after his outrage on Twitter.

After the three-Test series, Windies play a one-off T20I before travelling to Manchester for the first ODI on September 19. The remaining four ODIs will be played in Nottingham, Bristol, London and Southampton on September 21, 24 27 and 29 respectively.

They will also take on Ireland in Stormont on September 13 in a one-off ODI before the limited-overs series in England.

Windies are looking to boost their chances of earning a direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup after having slipped to the ninth position in the ODI rankings. However, they will be forced to play the qualification tournament if Sri Lanka win at least two matches in their five-match series at home against India. Sri Lanka have 88 points while Windies have 78. Two wins for Sri Lanka will take them to 90 points, putting it beyond Windies's reach no matter how the ODI series in England pans out.

Squad: Sunil Ambris, Devendra Bishoo, Miguel Cummins, Chris Gayle, Jason Holder (captain), Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Evin Lewis, Jason Mohammed (Vice Captain), Ashley Nurse, Rovman Powell, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor and Kesrick Williams.

Swearing is a sign of rhetorical ability

People often think that swearing indicates a weakness in your vocabulary. The logical assumption being that if you swear a lot you probably don’t know how to construct your thoughts using a whole lot more words. But a study published in Science Direct that those who use the maximum number of swear words within a minute scored higher on an IQ test. The test was indicative of the fact that a rich vocabulary of swear words equated strong rhetoric ability and not a compensation for a lack of vocabulary.

If you have a messy setting, chances are you are more creative

botasot.info

So you’ve been accused of leaving a messy desk/room behind all your life? Well, the chance that you're more creative and a genius in comparison to your prim and proper counterparts is much higher. A study conducted by the University of Minnesota concluded that if you’re not spending too much time cleaning and organising your settings your mind is obviously preoccupied with thoughts that are more important. The researchers claimed that it led to better creative output.

Being a night owl has long been linked with intelligence

Merger drama and fragile Tamil dreams,"Two factions of Tamil Nadu’s AIADMK party have come together, attempting to fill a J Jayalalithaa-size hole after her death earlier this year. E K Palaniswami of AIADMK (Amma), the standby incumbent, will continue as chief minister. His rival O Panneerselvam will be accommodated as deputy chief minister. It is common knowledge that the reconciliation was brokered by the BJP, in power at the Centre. The BJP believes that its role as dealmaker between the two factions of AIADMK and support to keep it in power in Chennai, will allow it to get a toehold in the southern state.

Elections for the assembly are due only in 2021. But Lok Sabha polls are due in two years, and Tamil Nadu’s 40 seats, 39 of them now held by the AIADMK, are crucial for the BJP. Its managers like Amit Shah know that an alliance with the AIADMK might enable the party to make inroads into India’s vast southern peninsula. Yet, there are two reasons why the gamble might fail to yield results. One, a third, disgruntled AIADMK faction, led by TTV Dhinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaa’s aide Sasikala, claims the support of 20 elected lawmakers. Sasikala is behind bars on a case related to disproportionate assets. If Dhinakaran withdraws his lawmakers and sides with the main opposition party DMK, the incumbent government could fall.

Two, even if this does not happen, the BJP is firmly identified as a north-Indian outfit by Tamil voters. For decades now, the latter have consistently voted for Dravidian parties, relegating even the once-powerful Congress to the margins of electoral politics. The BJP cannot be faulted for its attempts to break new ground. But the tremendous uncertainty that has gripped Tamil and AIADMK politics casts a long shadow over administrative stability and governance."

"In his first big foreign policy speech, President Trump slams Pakistan","In the most direct speech ever from a world leader, President Trump rebuked Pakistan for housing terror groups. On the 21st of August, 2017, speaking to the armed forces in Fort Myers, Virginia, President Trump spoke about his Afghanistan -South Asia strategy. He was candid, direct about how he had asked his cabinet to come up with a strategy on Afghanistan and then had made his decision.

“No nation building anymore,” he said, “we are killing terrorists.” And assured the forces that there would not be micromanagement from Washington and strategic decisions would be made on the ground. This time America would fight to win.

President Trump regretted that the war in Afghanistan was in its 17 years and the blood and treasure had been enormous but he said he owed it to the soldiers who had fought and died to finish what they had gone for—killing terrorists in their safe havens and not letting a vacuum develop as in Iraq and in Afghanistan by hastily withdrawing troops.

On the issue of Islamic terrorism, Trump, has not wavered once. He spoke about it candidly in Saudi Arabia; wanted to extreme vet immigrants coming from countries that were considered to be harbouring terrorists; and has nailed Afghanistan and Pakistan as countries that have 20 US designated foreign terrorist organizations. This has made the security threat from this region immense. Therefore, America would have to after the terrorists.

“For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens for agents of chaos, violence and terror,” he said and he was committed to stripping terrorists of their territory and cutting of their funding. Calling them thugs, criminals, predators and losers he declared that we will defeat them handily.

This could imply that US troops would no longer be constrained to chase the Haqqani network into safe havens in Pakistan and that even terror groups in Pakistan would come under the radar to be destroyed.

President Trump said that a pillar of the new strategy is how to change the approach to deal with Pakistan. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations; the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.”

It had much to lose by harbouring criminals, terrorists. He said that though Pakistan had been a partner in the past it had sheltered the same organizations “that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time, they are housing the terrorists that we are fighting!”.

“But that will have to change and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a county’s harbouring of militants and terrorists that target US servicemen. Time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace.”

President Trump said that another critical part of the strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India- “the world’s largest democracy and the key security and economic partner of the US.”

This will definitely send a strong signal to both Pakistan and China that the US is firmly behind India. No longer is Pakistan going to be able to hold a gun to America’s head and say, “we will implode if you don’t pay us,” or “ we are a victim of terror.”

China too, indirectly, has been put on notice. Perhaps, they will realize that they can’t side with Pakistan indefinitely on terror. Their huge stakes in CPEC could also be at stake.

President Trump also said that the NATO allies have contributed and will continue to contribute towards fighting terror.

He was firm that there would be no blank checks and Afghanistan would have to commit to share the burden, to reform and play its part in the effort to stabilize itself.

Since President Trump came to office, I have written about the times his administration has chided Pakistan and foretold that he would be good for India. He has not disappointed me yet."
Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

Fashionistas and DP fans, want to watch the lovely Deepika talking about her #F3DeepikaEdition? Watch this video right here and book one already!"
Hit the tourism jackpot: Here are some concrete steps to translate ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ into reality,"‘Atithi Devo Bhava’, which means that a guest is akin to god, is one of India’s most ancient maxims. If we had more successfully translated this into economic dividends, India should have been among the top 10 countries in the world for tourism. However, even today, we are ranked 40th globally by the Travel and Tourism index of the World Economic Forum (WEF).

This is a pity, because even at a relatively paltry figure of some eight million tourists annually, which includes NRIs, the World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that tourism generated $220 billion in 2016, which was 9.6% of our GDP. Tourism also supported close to 41 million jobs or 9.3% of total employment in the country.

To be fair, we have made some progress. In 2015 our position was 52nd on the tourism global index, so we have moved up 12 places. WEF, in its annual report, identified India as ‘a bright spot in the global tourism scenario’. But if we see our performance on a comparative scale, there is reason to ask why India, which has everything from the Himalayas to the best beaches and wildlife sanctuaries, and an unparalleled cultural and spiritual heritage, not to speak of new sectors like medical tourism, is still lagging behind.

It should make us think why China receives 57 million tourists a year, seven times more than us, and has become the fourth biggest destination for international travellers. It is true that with our resources we cannot compete with Spain, France, Germany, US, UK and Italy. But surely we can ask why Turkey gets 40 million tourists, or Mexico over 32 million. In Asia, Malaysia gets 27 million, Thailand 30 million, and Indonesia over 10 million. Vietnam gets almost the same number as us. In fact Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea have doubled their number of tourists in the last decade. Other developing countries like South Africa and Morocco also get higher tourist arrivals.

Considering the contribution tourism makes to our GDP and employment figures, especially since it is educationally a low-threshold employer and jobs are scarce – the impact of a scenario where we can double the number of foreign tourists in the next five years – to say 16 million, which is still less than one-third of what China has achieved – is staggering. Can we take the necessary steps to reach this goal, and if so, what needs to be done?

Firstly, the government must realise the immense potential of this sector. Currently, tourism gets only some 0.1% of the central budget outlay. Perhaps this is because tourism is a state subject. But why can’t it be put in the concurrent list of the Constitution? I understand 18 states are agreeable to this move. A carefully crafted National Tourism Policy, to avoid ad hoc measures and promote holistic planning and standardisation, is also long overdue.

The introduction of e-visas is a good step, but some procedural hassles still need to be ironed out. Thought should be given to waive visa fees in the lean tourist season, from April to September. Special projects, like coastal and river tourism, need to be developed. Our luxury tourist trains – like the original Palace on Wheels – are a great product, but excessive haulage charges have made prices prohibitive and occupancy rate low.

The tax structure on hotels could be reviewed for India to retain its competitive edge as a tourist destination. Aviation capacities at metro airports, which are saturated with non-availability of new flying slots and parking bays, require urgent expansion.

Further, the disinvestment of Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) hotels must be expedited. The government has rightly said that running and managing hotels on professional lines is not the work of the government or its entities. The vast ‘sarkari’ Ashok Hotel in New Delhi sits on by far the most expensive real estate of any five-star hotel, but its services are far from five-star.

Far more attention needs to be given to facilities at world heritage sites and prominent historical monuments. I was horrified to find, on a recent visit to Hampi which is a world heritage site, that there is no decent public toilet or even a serviceable café. I had mentioned this to our tourism minister some time ago, and perhaps this has been rectified. But facilities at other such sites do need to be upgraded.

It is time too for the next big idea to promote tourism globally, after ‘Incredible India’ which dates back to 2002. Government offices abroad do very little promotion, and should be closed. The best professional agencies, in India and abroad, need to be harnessed for a new campaign, and they should not hesitate to tackle some uncomfortable truths like foreigners being duped by touts, women receiving unwanted male attention, and lack of hygiene and cleanliness.

‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ is not merely a concept. It needs to translate into reality and become one of our most important engines of economic growth. A time-bound plan to double tourist arrivals by the year 2022 needs to be drawn up. In this doable task, a full time tourism minister would be of great help."
Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev’s kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, “You (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.” Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki’s eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki’s eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, “You have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them”. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.“So you take this son back,”he told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‘any of these sons can be the cause of great trouble’. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama’s job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God’s representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies — lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion — but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki’s womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna’s appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose — of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon’s founder, insisted — as all the great acharyas also insisted — that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified.

‘In India-China standoff all sides know that going beyond point of no return will cost everyone and destroy all our dreams’,"As China becomes more aggressive in its external posture, the India-China standoff in Doklam is being watched closely across the Asean region. Thailand’s ambassador to India Chutintorn Gongsakdi spoke to Jiby J Kattakayam about how the border confrontation in Bhutan is being perceived in the wider region, India’s Act East policy and why, despite ancient civilisational linkages, it has taken 70 years of Indo-Thai diplomatic ties for trade and cultural exchanges to enter a higher trajectory:

Does the Indo-China standoff in Doklam on the eastern front worry Asean?

It is a standoff where all sides know that going beyond a point of no return is going to cost everyone and is going to destroy all our respective dreams. I believe that people have the good sense to not go beyond a standoff. Coming from an economics background, it does not make any sense to me for any of these flashpoints to explode.

How do you see the atoll-building activities of China in the South China Sea?

We always like to see countries resolving issues on the negotiating table. It is difficult to have black and white outcomes in border issues, but it has been shown in the past that we can live and work amicably and in the spirit of good neighbourliness. It is not in anyone’s interest in the region or outside for potential flashpoints to explode. People have tested each other, but have not come to blows.

Where is the India-Myanmar-Thailand tri-lateral highway at?

While maritime and air connectivity are important, the highway has great symbolism. The political leadership is visualising our people driving and visiting each other by road. Some road stretches still need improvement. Customs and immigration quarantine facilities still need upgrading. I have been to the border. Trucks queue on the road, taking up valuable space and time. As things stand, the borders cannot support the trade we are visualising.

The highway can also connect India to Laos and Cambodia as well. Border posts and truck stops in Europe and in some parts of Asean are like mini cities. Once the highway is ready we cannot have all these trucks parked along the road creating huge roadblocks.

How are Thailand’s relations with China evolving?

We are a small country. We maintain good relations with all the players in the region. We have a longstanding and strategic relationship with the US. We have a long and close friendship with China. India is a more recent player. The relationship with India has more potential to develop. The relationship with China has developed over the years. As nations grow and find their own place in the global stage, the relationship will also reflect that. Our position is to maintain friendly relations with all and to see them play an appropriate and balancing role in the region.

In the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business index, why is Thailand at 46 and India at 130?

One factor is Centre-state relationships. With GST, India will improve its rank massively next year because it unifies markets. We are unifying the Asean market as well. India is a good example of a government responding to people’s needs through reforms and not protectionism. The other problem which everyone has is corruption. Some Thai businesses ended their investments because of corruption and local people of influence.

We recently had a particularly bad experience with one Indian state. We haven’t given up on that state. The evolving nature of India is such that we do not give up on the country, or a state, but we will return when the state is more ready. We also advise Thai investors to have a local partner. It makes it easier to adapt to local business culture. While there is competition between Indian states, it is important to choose the right state where the chief minister has the attitude and willingness to help business.

How is Indo-Thai trade progressing?

Indo-Thai trade is doing well. It stands at around $7-8 billion per year which appears satisfactory. However, it can improve to $20 billion considering India’s and Asean’s massive markets. Thailand should be seen by India in the context of the Asean market of 600 plus million people. In this context, any country in Asean is a staging point for the whole Asean market.

I find our economies neatly complimenting each other. Manufacturing is our strength and is of interest to India. At the same time, Thailand needs services and information technology where India is ahead. I keep pointing out to Thai stakeholders that India is an emerging power. So my time in India is spent 40% on marketing Asean, 50% on marketing India and 10% on marketing Thailand, because when I am marketing Asean and India, I am serving my country’s interests."

Here’s A Bacteria That Could Potentially Boost Athletic Performance!,"Been trying to boost your athletic performance but don't know how? Scientists have recently identified a bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of runners and rowers that may aid in improving your athletic performance. The bacteria is set to be used to develop probiotic applications that aid in performance and recovery.

The results showed that the bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of the athletes may help develop probiotic supplements that could help them, and even amateur fitness enthusiasts, recover from a tough workout or more efficiently convert nutrients to energy.

""We are more bacteria than we are human. The bugs in our gut affect our energy metabolism, making it easier to breakdown carbohydrates, protein and fibre,"" said Jonathan Scheiman, a post-doctoral student at Harvard Medical School.

""They are also involved in inflammation and neurological functions. So perhaps the microbiome could be relevant for applications in endurance, recovery and maybe even mental toughness,"" Scheiman added.

For the study, presented at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, the team collected fecal samples on a daily basis from 20 athletes training for the 2015 Boston Marathon, to capture how the microbiome changes between performance and recovery.

When they compared the pre-race and post-race samples, the researchers found a sudden spike in the population of one particular type of bacteria after the marathon.

""This bug's natural function is to breakdown lactic acid,"" Scheiman said.

During intense exercise, the body produces more lactic acid than usual, which can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. This bacteria could potentially help with that.

The researchers are now feeding the bacteria to mice to measure its effects on lactic acid levels and fatigue.

In another experiment, the researchers compared the bacteria from ultra-marathoners to those found in rowers training for the Olympics.

They found a type of bacteria in ultra-marathoners that can help breakdown carbohydrates and fibre—which is key during a 100-mile run—that was not present in the rowers, suggesting that different sports may foster niche microbiomes.

England's maiden day-night Test a 'huge success'

The experiment of England's first ever day-night Test match at Edgbaston has been described as a success by Warwickshire's Chief Executive Neil Snowball.

Just under 70,000 spectators turned up over three days and Friday's attendance of 23,922 was a record crowd for a non-Ashes Test since 2001. According to reports, over 50,000 pints of beer were sold on the first day and there was also a healthy boost to Birmingham's economy in the region of 15 million GBP. To top it, an England victory rounded off a successful week.

""We are really pleased,"" Snowball told Cricbuzz. ""For the club and city, it was a huge success. It was a shame it didn't go into the fourth day but we did very well on the three days. As a first effort at a day-night Test in England, it couldn't have gone much better.""

Warwickshire had put a lot of work into preparing for the match, including having lights installed in the net areas and putting shuttle buses on for spectators. The feedback they have received from both teams as well as spectators and officials has been overwhelmingly positive. ""The feedback we have had from the fans and our members is that they had a fantastic time and it was great fun. Operationally we were very happy with how it went.""

Perhaps the only negative was the thinning out of the crowd in the final hour of the first day. ""That's surprised us,"" Snowball admitted. ""All day, the bit that everyone was excited about was the final hour with the new ball under the lights. Whether it's because it was a Thursday, people had work the next day. Pretty much as soon as it reached 9 PM, people started to drift away.

""Having said that, it does get a bit cold in the evening but Saturday night when you had Broad's record-breaking wicket and Roland-Jones finishing it off in front of a full crowd under the lights, I think we'll remember that for a long time.""

As to whether there is a need for day-night Test cricket in England given the strong attendances at most games, ""the jury is still out"" according to Snowball. ""The traditional Test grounds are very good at selling Test cricket. We are bucking a trend internationally. There's the question of if we need to do it. But if England are going to be playing more and more day-night Test cricket around the world, they probably should have an opportunity to play it here.

""I would say it's been successful enough to do it in the future. As to when that would be we don't know. That'll be determined by the schedules."" It is unlikely to happen for the next two years. India visit England next summer and a day-night Test would not fit the Indian TV schedules while the following year is an Ashes series for which the games will be sold out anyway.

It remains to be seen when the ECB next schedule a day-night Test and where it will be held. One venue which may not be bidding for any future day-night game is Headingley. ""We are a progressive bunch at Yorkshire and happy to consider most things but I think the case for day-night Tests here is far from proven,"" Steve Denison, Yorkshire's Chairman, told Cricbuzz. ""Our preference is for a summer Test which starts on a Thursday or a Friday like the one later this week.""

Criminal negligence: Utkal Express derailment highlights deep rot in railways’ processes,"The derailment of Utkal Express in Khatauli, UP, that has claimed 23 lives, highlights yet again the abysmal state of railway safety. That the mishap occurred due to unofficial repair work on the track, without a proper time block for maintenance, exposes the culture of negligence that has seeped into the mass mover. No speed restriction warning was put at the maintenance spot just so delays wouldn’t reflect poorly on the performance report of the division and zone. This is far more dangerous than any infrastructure issue, as it represents a breakdown of basic systems and processes.

Suspensions and transfers may not be enough to send a strong message on accountability for the disaster; those found responsible should be tried for criminal negligence. A quick look at the statistics reveals a shocking state of affairs. The 2016-17 period saw more people die in derailments than in any of the last 17 years. And of the 586 rail accidents in the last five years, around 53% were due to derailments. Plus, the arrears of track renewal are constantly mounting leading to disproportionately high maintenance effort. It appears that maintenance simply can’t keep up with requirement, forcing short cuts that inevitably compromise safety.

Add to this the administrative structure of the railways that prevents proper safety oversight. The railway board is rule maker, operator and regulator at the same time. This prevents accountability from being fixed. The need of the hour is an independent and empowered regulator, outside the ambit of the railway ministry, to audit rail safety. In addition to existing safety issues, the railways also needs to be aware of non-conventional threats such as terrorism. The Kanpur train accident last November that led to the deaths of more than 140 people has been blamed on sabotage. Probes and committee reports on such cases need to be put out in the public domain and preventive measures taken.

The current NDA dispensation may be good at painting and selling big visions like that of bullet trains, but what the railways desperately needs is better implementation of routine procedures on the ground. Railway minister Suresh Prabhu did well to begin his innings by not giving into the populist tendency to announce new trains. However, his track record in turning the mass mover into an efficient and safe outfit has been below expectations so far."
